Scott talks with Kimberly Bryant about

7
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.790
improving diversity in technology. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

8
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.980
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And today we've got

9
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.700
Kimberly Bryant from black girls code.
Thank you, Kimberly, for taking

10
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.180
the time to chat with
me today. Thank you, Scott,

11
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.850
for having me on the
show. I appreciate it. No

12
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.290
worries. So I usually talk
about, you know, technology and

13
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.370
programming languages, and haven't really
talked too much about social

14
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.650
issues around technology. I did
have a couple of shows

15
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.610
over the last 300, like
I did women in technology

16
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.920
in the Muslim world. And
that was very interesting because

17
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.660
we learned that what we
thought was true. Wasn't true.

18
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.540
And what I wanted to
do is talk to you

19
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.650
and understand why someone who
is a programmer who's maybe

20
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.210
listening to this show should
care whether or not more

21
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.990
black girls code. I think
that's a, that's a fair

22
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.670
question. I think the reason
that someone in technology, who's

23
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.920
not a woman or not
a person of color should

24
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.410
care because the field of
customers that we serve in

25
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.250
terms of who actually are
the consumers of these products

26
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.610
that we're developing from the
it side is a very

27
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.960
diverse one. It's very female
oriented, and it's also very

28
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.730
demographically oriented to folks of
color and is very diverse.

29
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.250
So I think the more
unique and different perspectives that

30
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.580
come to the table on
the design side, the more

31
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.480
effective and the more efficient
the products that we deliver

32
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.550
will be in terms of
meeting the needs of the

33
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.150
folks that we're building for.
So I think even with

34
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.540
empirical studies have been shown
that teams that are more

35
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.840
diverse are actually more efficient
as well. So, you know,

36
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.110
for all of those reasons,
I think that we should

37
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.430
care to make the environment
and the working environment, the

38
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.520
creative environment on the it
side is the versus possible.

39
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.170
That's interesting that should the,
should the environment in the

40
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.980
work environment reflect the environment
of the public. I mean,

41
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.580
right now in America, black
folks are about 14% of

42
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.210
the population. So where we,
we're not looking to have

43
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.680
teams be, You know, half
black, half white or, you

44
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.820
know, some arbitrary amount of
diversity. What, what is a

45
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.820
reasonable amount of diversity and
is that amount, the amount

46
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.080
that is available in the
general public? I think that

47
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.560
from my perspective, now, this
is just my own personal

48
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.120
perspective. I think that it
absolutely should be reflective of

49
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.880
the population in general, but
I think we need to

50
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.390
look beyond the population saying
that we need to look

51
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.180
beyond the population within the
continental us, because while folks

52
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.900
of color, only 14% in
the United States, that's not the

53
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.560
case. If you look on
a worldwide basis, the, the

54
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.830
world is much more diverse
than that. And even here

55
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.990
in the U S you
know, the, it has been

56
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.950
shown from the data that's
been collected lately that within

57
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.900
the next decade and a
half, that those numbers will

58
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.140
be much different than what
they are now. So there,

59
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.340
there will actually be much
more of a diverse population

60
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.820
than what we're seeing at
the numbers currently today. That

61
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.320
will be a lot, you
know, that will be a

62
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.120
lot of Hispanics that will
make up that demographic. And

63
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.090
I think when you look
at Hispanics and I see

64
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.620
the numbers skew even worse
than African Americans, so that

65
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.170
is an issue. So one
of the things we address

66
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.920
in our program is not
just girls of African American

67
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.910
descent, but also girls that
are Latino, native American as

68
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.050
well, because those are also
groups that are currently underrepresented

69
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.110
in it. Do you, do
you think that this, the

70
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.180
problem of homogeny within technology
started 20, 30, 40 years

71
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.760
ago, and this is an
issue of, of education and

72
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.800
availability of technology? I do.
I absolutely do. And even

73
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.970
if you look from a
CML perspective, I just recently

74
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.820
did a presentation that show
back many, many years ago,

75
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.650
during the thirties and forties,
there were many women that

76
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.810
were working on some of
the very first installations and

77
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.910
installments and working on a
lot of the supercomputers, but

78
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.500
that number started to change
drastically from the sixties and

79
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.840
seventies. And in the eighties,
we had a bit of

80
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.300
a peak that was during
my time when I was

81
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.810
in college, as far as
women still, not so much

82
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.750
as far as African Americans
or minorities. So we had

83
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.510
a bit of a peak
and CS enrollment in college

84
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.720
at around the 80 mid
eighties, and then a drastic

85
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.010
drop. So it has been
sort of a roller coaster

86
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.310
ride, but the, I think
in terms of when we

87
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.640
went into the web to
low era, and even before

88
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.540
that the numbers and the,
in the domination of males

89
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.200
in the industry really started
to push a lot of

90
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.220
the females out of the
field and African Americans and

91
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.280
folks of color never really
got a foothold into the

92
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.600
field. So it's a double
entendre when you're a person

93
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.840
of color and also a
woman in this field, there

94
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.040
are just not many folks
trailblazers before us, or even

95
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.470
those that are there now
for us to pattern ourselves

96
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.510
after. Yeah, there definitely were
some very significant women in

97
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.520
computers in the sixties and
seventies. And that kind of

98
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.950
did take a little bit
of a dive there. I

99
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.610
mean, initially you had like
Grace Hopper who developed COBOL, you

100
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.180
know, that, that is interesting,
that things that happen during

101
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.150
the late sixties and seventies
kind of changed the environment,

102
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.680
changed the structure of where
people went to school, changed

103
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.690
things that were available to
them to, to speak specifically

104
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.930
about the programs that are
available. Like, for example, in

105
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.860
Atlanta, there's three historically black
colleges in Atlanta, but only

106
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.630
one has a computer science
department for something like that.

107
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.210
Aren't they to blame, aren't
the historically black colleges to

108
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.240
blame for that. They should
have a computer science department,

109
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.650
they should be making sure
that those programs are available

110
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.470
to people. I would agree,
but I don't think that,

111
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.160
you know, coming from an
engineer, a traditional engineering background

112
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.210
myself, I just think that
as a person of color,

113
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.360
I think you have to
look a little deeper. So

114
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.940
African Americans in this country
have always been positioned for,

115
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.130
to be successful in society.
You either go one of

116
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.350
three routes. You either become
a doctor, you become a

117
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.030
lawyer, or really that's really
the path for most folks

118
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.490
coming out of the era,
the civil rights movement, et

119
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.880
cetera. We were at doctors,
lawyers, or teachers, educators, and

120
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.660
that was the path to
success. So there really, wasn't

121
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.760
a clear indication for us
to go on a tech

122
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.640
now, knowledge, you feel there
were some but not a

123
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.270
lot. So that's always been
the thing. And for far

124
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.960
as African Americans in our
culture, the symbol of success

125
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.950
is becoming the one person
that becomes the lawyer or

126
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.240
the doctor, or even the
educator beforehand. And now so

127
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.570
much now so much has
changed in our society that

128
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.030
kids actually look at more
of the folks on the

129
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.060
entertainment and sports side. There's
those people that had no

130
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.230
sales after. So our colleges
are African it's. Historically black

131
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.730
colleges actually were kind of
raised and born in that

132
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.220
era. And that is what
they cater to the liberal

133
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.740
arts education. You know, the
doctors, the lawyers and the

134
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.020
educators that's who they train.
So yes, they can probably

135
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.830
do more to address the
STEM careers that are, that

136
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.770
really we need to focus
on now, but you kind

137
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.770
of need to look a
little big, deeper into historical

138
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.160
context of why it is
what it is now, and

139
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.850
many of our HBCU. And
there are some that have

140
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.310
programs in CS, but they're
not alive, but I don't

141
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:55.150
think that's any different. When
you look overall at the,

142
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.140
the college and the colleges
in the U S as

143
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.430
a whole, there's a huge
skew towards liberal arts education,

144
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.730
which does need to change
for us to move, you

145
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.740
know, the country in the
direction we need to go.

146
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.450
So a couple of acronyms,
just for the listeners who

147
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.850
may not be familiar with
them, STEM is a word

148
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.290
that you keep saying, science,
technology, engineering, and math, and

149
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.150
then HBCU, historically black colleges
and universities. So when we

150
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.540
talk about, about STEM and
the push towards STEM, we're

151
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.840
talking about making sure that
everyone has the opportunity to

152
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:35.090
have a science, technology, engineering
and math, math classes, available

153
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.380
programs available to them. Why
are those programs not available

154
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.830
in as much in places
where black folks go to

155
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.590
school at the edge at
the elementary and the high

156
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.430
school level? I think it's
the demand. So there's not

157
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.210
been a huge demand. On
one hand from students at

158
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.510
some of the HBC use
to go into these fields

159
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.600
of study, there was needs
to change. So when I

160
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.150
was going to college, I
think colleges, myself, I did

161
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.480
look at SPC use and
the, I guess the most

162
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.810
prominent one would have been
Howard university, which did have

163
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.890
a robust engineering program, but
not a lot of the

164
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.610
HBCU did. So I ended
up going to a college

165
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.330
that was not an HBCU
because I really wanted to

166
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.170
get a strong foundation in
engineering, but I was a

167
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.560
handful of black students that
entered the freshmen classes and

168
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.700
engineer. So the demand is
not, and has not really

169
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.910
been there on a heavy
emphasis and focus for STEM

170
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.990
careers for students of color.
And that starts even before

171
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.110
they they're getting ready to
look into high school, which

172
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.320
is why, you know, in
my program, I really start

173
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.430
working with girls much earlier
than high school. Even we

174
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.760
started in elementary and middle
school because that's when your

175
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.840
focus really starts to frame
itself around what you are

176
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.420
interested in and what things
you may choose once you

177
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.750
go to college. So we
have to get students of

178
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:11.150
color interested in STEM careers
and see us way before

179
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.730
they are ready to select
the college. And I think

180
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.880
once that demand is there,
we will see more colleges

181
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.020
that are really catering to
that student demographics. So I

182
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.160
think that that gets getting,
getting back to the, the

183
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.250
children. I think moving away
from the discussion about colleges,

184
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.810
university, you're saying that the
man's not there, the demand

185
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.940
is likely not there because
the young people who have

186
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.280
grown up to be in
their twenties don't have the,

187
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.070
the context or the interest.
And they look at these

188
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.320
careers and they say, yeah,
that's for nerds. That's, you

189
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.350
know, it's a bunch of
white men that are, you

190
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.330
know, doing their computer science
thing, but that's just not

191
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.960
for me. And like you
said, that the HBC use

192
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.670
that are kind of born
out of the civil rights

193
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.280
era are set up for
liberal arts for making doctors

194
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.930
and lawyers for social people,
interested in social change, making

195
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.220
educators. But the idea that
I could be an engineer

196
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.850
and build something and make
change that way, isn't indoctrinated

197
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.520
into the kids that are
really really early age. At

198
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.850
what age do you think
young, black girls, or just

199
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:15.040
young people of color decide
that programming's for nerds and

200
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.600
they just give up their,
their, their, they switch it

201
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.000
off in their mind. I
believe absolutely starts for girls

202
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.020
at least in middle school.
And I would, I don't

203
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.380
know if I would necessarily
change that for children of

204
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.730
color, but for girls in
general, it definitely is middle

205
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.060
school. That's key. So that's
why one of the focuses

206
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.390
of our program is to
really have lots of programs

207
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.560
that really attach girls during
that phase and middle school

208
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.810
where they're in a transition.
And if you look at

209
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.010
even the statistics and math
and science girls track had

210
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.920
to have with boys until
about middle school, and that's

211
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.650
when they start to you
start to see differences in

212
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.440
the achievement levels. And I
think that's for a number

213
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.340
of reasons, but I know
myself as a young person

214
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.610
that, you know, went through
the same transition. That's about

215
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.460
the time where you're not
really sure there's a lot

216
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.820
of social issues that you're
going through through that development

217
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.470
stage. And if girls then
are not given that encouragement

218
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.970
and support that they can
actually do some of this

219
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.480
more technical work, and it's
not something that's not cool,

220
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.620
then they want the opt
out. So once that drops

221
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.690
starts to happen in middle
school, it is very rare

222
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.680
to see girls to continue
and then pick back up

223
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.370
into the science and math
and technical fields into high

224
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.520
school. You have to address
it in middle school because

225
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.850
that's when they start to
build those connections in terms

226
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.580
of what makes sense for
them and where they fit

227
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.120
in. Right? And they, they
need to have a healthy

228
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.870
sense of self esteem just
about themselves. Not necessarily about

229
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.120
themselves as women or about
themselves, people of color, but

230
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.120
they just simply, as a
person wandering around in America,

231
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.430
they need to know that
they're okay and what they

232
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.860
choose to do and look
like and feel like, and

233
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.760
work on is okay. And
that brings up an interesting

234
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.760
question. We had a comment
on, on Google plus and

235
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.290
a couple of comments on
Twitter and someone made the

236
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.320
comment that it isn't just
people of color there are.

237
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.580
And this was the gentleman's
term redneck schools where computer

238
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.740
science isn't cool either. I
mean, a poor white school

239
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.010
is not necessarily going to
promote engineering as a, a

240
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.570
way out as well. So
this idea that the social

241
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:35.310
fabric within which the students
operate may not be set

242
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.800
up to allow them to
go and have these pursuits

243
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.280
without being teased and constantly
berated. And at the age

244
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.010
of nine, 10, 11, it's
really difficult to tell your

245
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:49.200
friends, I'm interested in robots
putting together computer programs. And

246
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.850
at some point you're just
going to eventually give up

247
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.780
no matter what color you
are True. That's true. But

248
00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.400
I think the difference is
that there, you need to

249
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.370
see yourself. So you need
to see a reflection of

250
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.210
yourself to really build that
self confidence in terms of,

251
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.060
you know, what your life
path will be and what

252
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.430
type of road that you
want to take. That that's

253
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.370
just what it is. You
need to see a reflection

254
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:19.660
on yourself. And I think
oftentimes children of color, you

255
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.660
know, boys and girls, they
don't see that when it

256
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:27.250
comes to technology. They're this,
there's not that bill Gates.

257
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.370
There's not the Mark Zuckerberg
that looks like me. He

258
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.220
came from a similar background
as me and gives me

259
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.800
that extra bit of self
confidence that I need to

260
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.840
know that even though my
friends are going to the

261
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.480
basketball court and I want
to sit here and build

262
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.890
this website, that is okay,
I could do that. And

263
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.610
I think that, that makes
a huge difference. So yeah,

264
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.140
I would agree that in
general, overall, the geek culture

265
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.500
is not that I guess,
appealing to a middle school

266
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.070
kid, even if it was
from a redneck environment, but

267
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.490
at least that kid can
possibly go and find a

268
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.860
reflection of themselves to give
them that motivation, to continue

269
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.550
on the path and actually
do more, to connect with

270
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.250
someone that could actually be
a mentor to them. And

271
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.650
our kids don't have that.
And that, I think that's

272
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.720
the biggest issue that makes
it much more relevant and

273
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.700
an impact to them in
terms of where they go

274
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.030
into technology. I think that
that's really, really that's really

275
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.660
well said. I think that
growing up and raising my,

276
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.560
my sons who are mixed
that well, a, the average

277
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.080
white person might not say,
Oh yeah, you know, we

278
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.260
have a, a mixed president
now that's great, you know,

279
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.880
progress. It cannot be overstated
that just the simple existence

280
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.330
of a person in power
that happens to look like

281
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.810
a young person, how that
changes a young person's perspective.

282
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.720
I mean, I've got, I've
got three year old and

283
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.810
five-year-old that are growing up
in a world where, you

284
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.030
know, there are a couple
of world leaders that happen

285
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.890
to look like them, and
that's going to be a

286
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.700
given and well, you know,
again, someone might say, Oh,

287
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.030
you know, whatever, why are
you putting so much? Why

288
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.970
are you putting so much,
I'm honest on that. Why

289
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.340
is that such a big
deal? But the idea that

290
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.510
Obama and other world leaders
of color are in the

291
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.350
public consciousness will mean that
a nine year old version

292
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.450
of my son will go,
yeah, I could, I could

293
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.970
be president. I could totally
do that right there. You

294
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.250
know, that just is a
given. So I like the

295
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.880
idea of really exposing kids
to people who look like

296
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.910
them early, early on. I
assume that, you know, if

297
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.000
I show up at a
young school full of young

298
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.770
black girls and try to
teach them that might be

299
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.230
a value, but it's not
nearly as of much value,

300
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.060
if someone shows up that
happens to look like them

301
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.370
and came from their neighborhood
and, and came up the

302
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:53.130
way that they came. Absolutely.
I think for, for our

303
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.190
program, one of the things
that's been a huge benefit

304
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:01.110
is that we had a
tremendous outpouring of folks that

305
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.010
stepped in to be volunteers.
Most of them, I would

306
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.960
say 99.9% of them were
software engineers, or either designers

307
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.170
in the Valley, in the
Bay area. And I would

308
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.890
say over 90% of them
were women. Not that we

309
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.140
set, we put out anything
that, Oh, we only want

310
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.480
women volunteers, but women volunteers
overwhelmingly, came and volunteered their

311
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.450
time in our program. And
that was huge because that

312
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.260
allowed, you know, our girls
to work side by side,

313
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.230
you know, six weeks at
a time with a female

314
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.860
engineer, which is something and
most of their neighborhoods, they

315
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.950
won't see every day. So,
you know, even that little

316
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.280
bit beyond the tool that
we were teaching, that that's

317
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.090
huge because that plants a
seed that although I may

318
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.090
want to be an actress,
or I may want to

319
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.910
be a police officer may
want to be a lawyer.

320
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.000
I actually could have this
career over here as a

321
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.780
software engineer as an option
because I met this person

322
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.990
during this class and this
person was cool. And I

323
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.470
liked that. So we just
want to plant those seeds.

324
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.350
So there are options. So
the girls see options for

325
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.610
themselves where they may not
have seen them before. Exactly.

326
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.730
Exactly. I had an interesting
question on Twitter from a

327
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.970
white gentleman in the UK
who said, well, I don't

328
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.550
understand why you're trying to
artificially change kind of the

329
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.160
way that things have naturally
turned out. Why do we

330
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.530
want to kind of stack
the deck in one direction?

331
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.140
But then an interesting comment
on Google plus came in

332
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.620
from Michelle Hatley, from uplift
to DC. And she's an

333
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.380
African American computer scientist and
engineer who works in a

334
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.800
similar program that makes sure
that kids are exposed and

335
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.710
she points out. And I
like this, that the word

336
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.280
exposure is so fundamental. You're
not necessarily trying to stack

337
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.490
the deck or give anyone
an opportunity that anyone else

338
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.340
didn't get. You are simply
trying to expose kids because

339
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.690
with exposure, students get interest.
If they don't get exposed,

340
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.630
they don't even know the
topic exists. Absolutely. And that,

341
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.140
that, that is the key
word right there. The exposure

342
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.230
and that that's spot on
because when we started our

343
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.520
pilot program in 2011, we
had actually went to community

344
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.030
centers and the baby's honors
one in San Francisco. We

345
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.580
talked to some of the
guidance counselors and principals at

346
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.340
the middle school. And we
had girls and their parents

347
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.300
come in and have a
introduction to the program. Most

348
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.140
of the girls did not
know what computer science was.

349
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.050
They did not know what
computer programming was. They had

350
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.440
no clue, maybe one or
two girls out of the

351
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.820
whole program had done anything
similar before. So a lot

352
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.500
of the girls, I had
to kind of convince, well,

353
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.870
you know, you, you should
come to the class, try

354
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.810
it out. It'll be fun.
They didn't know. They didn't

355
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:46.970
have a clue. But at
the end of the six

356
00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.320
session, we had all of
these girls interested and had

357
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.440
already created things of their
own and there's program called

358
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.460
scratch. And that just plants
the seed. So I may

359
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.580
or may not be able
to burst a Mark circle

360
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.970
bird out of this class,
but maybe I will. But

361
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.310
the point is not even
that, that's not the goal.

362
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.170
The goal is just like
I said, and just what

363
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.920
Michelle said. We want to
expose kids to opportunities where

364
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.560
they may not necessarily see
them. I think we take

365
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.110
it for granted living in
the Bay area. We're surrounded

366
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.470
by technology. We're surrounded by
innovation, but most of the

367
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.840
kids from the inner city
do not have a clue

368
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.200
that it exists when it's
right in their backyard. So

369
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.660
that's the point of the
program that really give kids

370
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.560
an opportunity to be exposed
to a field of study,

371
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.690
that they may not even
know that they have an

372
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.410
interest in until we show
it to them. So you

373
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.510
bring up an interesting point,
the idea that technology is

374
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.640
all around us and what
we take for granted, but

375
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.330
it's interesting. And I think
useful to point out that

376
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.730
black people, at least in
America use social media more,

377
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:56.850
more often, arguably more effectively
than white folks, black people

378
00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.480
dominate Twitter. Lot of people
are using smartphones much more

379
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.270
than white people. These districts
statistics are all kind of

380
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.510
not in dispute. An interesting
question from a young lady

381
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.380
on Twitter says has the
proliferation of smartphones and the

382
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.160
exist, the idea that almost
everyone has a computer in

383
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.290
their pocket, they just don't
know it's a computer. Is

384
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.530
that proliferation of smartphones resulted
in more girls being interested.

385
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.380
The idea that I can
make something and put it

386
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.060
on this device that I
carry around with me all

387
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.070
day long. Unfortunately I would
have to say no, because

388
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.510
even though we as African
Americans and even as some

389
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.600
of the girls and students
are heavy users of technology

390
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:41.550
or heavy consumers of it,
they don't understand yet, which

391
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.860
is the purpose of the
program. Again, that there's something

392
00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.030
beneath just the youth. So
there's something beneath that that

393
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:52.050
actually makes it easy. But
there's something beneath my Android

394
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.350
phone that actually I can
actually create an application and

395
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.680
not just download one from
the store, the app store,

396
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.690
they don't understand the piece
beyond that. So that even

397
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.890
though they're using technology heavily,
they don't understand that the

398
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.740
other side of it about
the creation and how they

399
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.860
can be a builder using
this technology shields. That's the

400
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.830
point to actually show them
that gets them to kind

401
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.050
of pull back the top
layer and look on these.

402
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.210
That's a really, it sounds
I, as an adult hearing

403
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.770
that you kind of say,
how could they not know

404
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.550
that? But my, my six
year old, we said, you

405
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.880
know, eat your chicken. And
he says, chicken, what? Chicken?

406
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.510
This is meat. And then
suddenly just, he clicks. And

407
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.450
then you can almost see
his entire world explode and

408
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.830
suddenly the entire kind of
like inventory chain from chicken

409
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.910
to on your plate, just
poofed in his head. And

410
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.760
he said, wait a second,
chickens turn into food. And

411
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.200
then, you know, Oh my
goodness. So we took him

412
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.780
to a farm and explained
the whole process. But from

413
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.660
his point of view, Hey,
meet magically shows up on

414
00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.020
my plate. And then his
eyes were opened. What seems

415
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.810
like an obvious thing? Where
did these things come from?

416
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.290
This same thing applies to
smartphones. You know, I downloaded

417
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.870
it from the app store.
That's just, it's just me.

418
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.430
Right? A second. Where did
it come from? I have

419
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.920
no idea. You mean a
person built a business around

420
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.800
this and it is exposure.
Isn't it? You've got to

421
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.260
let them know where these
things come from, take them

422
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.410
to factories, take them to
software companies, bring your girls

423
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:27.800
to Workday and stuff like
that. Interesting. Interesting. And are

424
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.940
you doing like mentorship, your
program? How, how does this

425
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.500
is structured right now? Is
there a mentorship component? You,

426
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.800
you find kids that you
look like this one's going

427
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.990
to really be somebody and
you pull them aside and

428
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.100
assign them a mentor from
the community directly, or what's

429
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.480
the program structured. We actually
don't do that. We really

430
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.970
want the program to be
as open and accessible as

431
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.300
possible. So we do have
an application process when we

432
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.030
have our programs, when we
have our sessions and we

433
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:59.290
advertise that we actually do
community outreach to community organizations

434
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.930
and really, really try to
tap into drill. They might

435
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.690
even just have a little
bit of interest in technology

436
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.510
and take it from there.
But we do have a

437
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:13.150
mentorship from the standpoint of
having very engaged TAs and

438
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.060
mentors that come in during
the sessions to work with

439
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.520
the girls on the programs
and lesson plans that they're

440
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.300
working on. And we also
try to make sure that

441
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.990
the program is built to
be sustainable, not just for

442
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.750
the organization, but also for
the girls. So we want

443
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.620
to take girls from having
no knowledge of computer program

444
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.250
at all, and really see
them continue to grow in

445
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.920
the programs that continue to
come and take additional classes.

446
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.440
So it's not a one
shot deal where they come

447
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.960
to one class and we
don't see them again. We

448
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.990
really try to build relationships
with the girls and keep

449
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.740
them involved and engaged in
terms of other activities. So

450
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.770
we're going, some of the
girls are going to hack

451
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:57.750
the future hackathon for kids
here in the Bay area.

452
00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.210
The San Jose tech museum,
this Saturday is not sponsored

453
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.570
by black girls code, but
we are organizing a trip

454
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.430
for some of the drills
to go to that because

455
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.850
we want to keep them
engaged with technology, even when

456
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.570
they're not in our program
saying that is the goal

457
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.380
of our collaboration with brackets
21 to really have a

458
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.460
portal for our girls to
engage with other professionals in

459
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.260
the tech field or in
other fields that they may

460
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.210
be interested in so that
we continually, we continually feel.

461
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:31.570
Then they kind of see
them with information on technology,

462
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.140
information, on careers that can
help them grow. How, how

463
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.260
much has open source and
the proliferation of free software

464
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.080
and the ability to make,
make things for free. Like

465
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.590
you mentioned, squeak, and there's
all sorts of, you know,

466
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.410
every, every vendor from, you
know, Google, Microsoft, Apple all

467
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.690
has free things that you
can download. And there's lots

468
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.510
of open source projects where
someone could download what they

469
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.780
need to make a piece
of software. And the fact

470
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.870
that that is like now
more than ever free, does,

471
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.630
has that helped at all?
Do you expose them these

472
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.340
free tools and send them
home? Yes, yes, yes. And

473
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.270
yes, that is huge. You
know, most of our kids.

474
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.610
So I think one of
the challenges that we have

475
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.360
with our program is that
we actually do really target

476
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:19.100
kids that are from the
demographic areas and underrepresented areas

477
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.650
in the urban areas where
they may not necessarily have

478
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.760
access to these tools at
home. They may not have

479
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.090
access to broadband. They may
not actually have access to

480
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.080
computer equipment to do these
things, but if they do,

481
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.110
and it definitely, when they
come to the class, being

482
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.470
able to, you know, use
free to open source tools

483
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.760
like scratch to like Alice,
there's just so much available.

484
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.200
Now that's key to us
being able to really get

485
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.100
them to continually tweak and
play around with technology. That's

486
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:56.060
key because if we didn't
have that open source ability,

487
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.700
we would not be able
to reach the kids that

488
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:03.590
we need to. Now, whenever
anyone talks about race, there's

489
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.970
always the dancing around about
stereotypes. So certainly any generalizations

490
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.330
that I may say or
not say are just that

491
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.800
generalizations, but amongst other people
of color like Asians, South,

492
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.370
South Asians, Indians, there's a
lot of support from the

493
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:23.360
parents. No one, no one
is surprised to see another

494
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:29.030
Indian software engineer or another
Asian software engineer. And one

495
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.560
could argue that culturally engineering
is really promoted within those

496
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.080
cultures, but also that the
parents are deeply involved and

497
00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.750
being an engineer is almost
as exciting as being a

498
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.600
doctor. How do you get
the parents involved to the

499
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.120
point where they realize that,
Hey, you know, a web

500
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.630
startup could be a reasonable
career for my, my young

501
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.500
daughter or son. One of
the things that we noticed

502
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.620
during our program and during
our pilot last year was

503
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.670
that our parents were very
concerned as well as very

504
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.340
interested in what their daughters
were doing. And now during

505
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.980
that two and a half
hours on the Saturday, so

506
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:08.540
we actually had opportunities for
during the class session for

507
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.130
parents to come in and
the girls to present those

508
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.480
that actually an opportunity for
the girls to learn and

509
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.540
develop their self confidence in
public speaking, and being able

510
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.990
to present their work and
also opportunity for parents to

511
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.240
see what their girls were
doing in class and what

512
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.910
they were learning. And they
were very open to that.

513
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.480
We also had a career
day during the middle of

514
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.280
our work last workshop, where
we invited professionals to come

515
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.950
in and speak to the
girls about their careers and

516
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:41.000
technology and give a career
presentation. And we also invited

517
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.230
the parents to that. So
we want the parents to

518
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.810
see that this is a
path. So as much as

519
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.100
for us, it's about educating
our parents because they normally

520
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.070
are not in the technology
field, have any insight to

521
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.460
it as well, as much
as educating the kids. So

522
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:01.480
that has been part of,
I think, helping us to

523
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.120
have really good attendance in
terms of our classes. So

524
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.330
the parents see the value
of having their girls come

525
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.970
to this class on Saturdays
and learn a key skill

526
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.520
that could help them in
the future. So our parents

527
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.120
have been very engaged and
that's helpful. So I think

528
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.960
it's, it's, again goes back
to the issue of exposure.

529
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.040
It has not traditionally been
technology or even engineering for

530
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.760
that matter. Been a career
path that most African American

531
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.970
that's supposed to color from
the U S so if

532
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:35.010
you're talking about trans continental,
totally different story, but the

533
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.620
us, most people have asked
him to sit that has

534
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.440
not engineering has not traditionally
been a path that we've

535
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.920
grown to know the push
our kids into. So exposing

536
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.920
the parents to those opportunities
and see what it can

537
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.980
do for their kids is
as much as important to

538
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.070
exposing the kids for us.
And once we do that,

539
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.400
I have not had one
single issue with having our

540
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.360
parents continue to support, bring
their girls out to classes,

541
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.490
bring their girls out to
events like this on Saturday

542
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.290
at all. Very cool. So
people can learn more about

543
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.170
black girls code, black girls
code.com. You can donate, there's

544
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.500
a donate button right there.
You can get involved. And

545
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.330
I assume that you'd probably
encourage people to get involved

546
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.720
with whatever their community is.
Not necessarily black girls, but

547
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.290
maybe, you know, Latino guys
or whatever group the, the

548
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:25.380
audiences involved in go to
schools get involved there. I

549
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.690
assume that there are programs
like this in virtually every

550
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.350
city for every kind of
person that is underrepresented within

551
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:34.110
science of technology, You would
be surprised there actually not

552
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.480
as many as there should
be not at all. So

553
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.730
that was one of the
driving reasons for me to

554
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.060
create black girls code. There,
there definitely is not another

555
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:46.200
program that specifically targets girls
of color in this way,

556
00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.560
but there are some other
programs that are more targeted

557
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.320
to girls. There are some
more that are targeted, just

558
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.230
kids of color, some Latino
kids, but they're not enough.

559
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.920
So I would encourage folks
to get involved in whatever

560
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.820
programs that they can and
even creating things in their

561
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.960
own neighborhoods and in their
own communities around, around their

562
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.570
expertise to really expose kids
to this field and to

563
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.590
the, the options that they
have in the field of

564
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.170
technology. Well, I think that
you said it, you said

565
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.580
it correctly and you said
it very well. And you

566
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.740
said there aren't enough of
these programs. Certainly not as

567
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.040
many as, as folks deserve.
So I encourage people who

568
00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.840
are listening to get involved.
You can check out black

569
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.410
girls code. We also mentioned
uplift DC. There's other programs

570
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:32.310
like robotics in DC and
youth app lab. And we'll

571
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.720
try to put as many
links to those in the

572
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.430
show notes as we can.
And thank you so much,

573
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.830
Kimberly, for chatting with me
today. Thank you, Scott. I

574
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.580
appreciate it. And just last
thing, we have a new

575
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.090
class that's coming up in
collaboration with a company here

576
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.970
in the Bay area called
ThoughtWorks, which starts the second

577
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.660
week of February. And we'll
be doing a national video

578
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.200
STEM game challenge. So definitely
if folks are interested, please

579
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.830
take a look at that.
Alright, then you'll send me

580
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.600
all that and I'll put
that in the show notes.

581
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.960
So we'll be sure to
have links to everything. Definitely.

582
00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.770
Thank you. This has been
another episode of Hansel minutes.

583
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.150
We'll see you again next
week.
