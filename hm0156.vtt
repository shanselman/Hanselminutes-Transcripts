com. In this episode, Scott
talks with Ozlem con about

9
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.720
diversity and interaction from agile
development teams. Hi, this is

10
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.150
Scott Hanselman, and this is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

11
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.580
We're doing an international show
today and we're on the

12
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.670
phone right now with Ozlem
Khan. He's in South Africa and

13
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.040
he's a software architect and
a coach he's got more

14
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.220
than 18 years of experience
in software. The reason that

15
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.410
I wanted to, as I'm
on the show is that

16
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.300
he's got a real passion
for creating real simple solutions

17
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.940
with complex problems. And he's
a like me as a

18
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.050
pragmatist. And he believes that
the only truthful implementation of

19
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.810
an architecture is the code
that gets executed. I always

20
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.120
like talking to pragmatists and
since Oslo is a guy

21
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.760
who spends a lot of
time in powering teams, I

22
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.770
wanted to have him on
the show and we're going

23
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.470
to talk about diversity in
small teams, and you'll be

24
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.170
able to read about more
about Ozlem on his blog

25
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.740
at Ozlem Khan. K H
a n.net. Thank you sir,

26
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.660
for taking the time. I
guess you're up pretty late

27
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.700
tonight. Yes. It's this funny
11:00 PM. And just flown back

28
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.730
to Cape town from Johannesburg
and it says visit to

29
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.100
be on your show. Well,
thanks. I'm glad that I

30
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.340
got you just walking off
the plane here. So we

31
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.620
want to talk about diversity
in small teams. Do you

32
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.810
do a lot of coaching
of teams? And since you're

33
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.990
a South African, I assume
those teams are fairly diverse.

34
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.380
Yes. I ended up coaching
team accidentally. Voter's been sitting

35
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.220
inviting foster with teams and
in South Africa we get pretty

36
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.440
diverse with 11 official languages
of which I only speak

37
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.020
to and can't name the
other nine. All of them,

38
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.980
it gets quite a complex.
And, and so the teams

39
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.390
that we have that are
emerging and I'm from very

40
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:53.150
various backgrounds. The originally I
think that before, before the

41
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.210
dismantlement of a pocket, we
had to be very homogenous

42
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.160
teams. We didn't have a
larger working black population and

43
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.330
the culture that's come with
the black population has changed

44
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.640
the dynamic for power teams.
And you're living in an

45
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.180
environment where it was not
long ago when things were

46
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.540
dramatically different than the States.
We can say that it's

47
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.470
been at least 40 years,
maybe 50, depending on when

48
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.710
you think things started to
turn around the, since things

49
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.880
were, were very bad, things
were significantly bad in your

50
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.120
lifetime. And even in the
lifetime of your, of your

51
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.270
teenage kids, I understand It
has been very, very recent.

52
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.850
And sometimes I think we
forget how recent it has

53
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.460
actually been. And so much
has happened since 1994, but

54
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.850
leading up to 1994, I
mean, I was in university

55
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.150
until 1991. So now someone
downloads released from prison in

56
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.280
1992. So my university years
and high school years was,

57
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.000
was really, really intense leave
focused at dismantling of Pontius.

58
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.810
It happened in 1992 and
it is such a, it's

59
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.720
such a distinct difference in
attitude. And in the way

60
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.200
we relive life for Africa
pre 1994 and post 1994,

61
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.780
the feeling of liberation in
1994 was, was probably the

62
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.650
most amazing experience I've ever
had in my life. And

63
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.040
I think to date, it
is the single moment in

64
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.100
my life where I actually
felt that there's a possibility

65
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.210
that us as a human
and actually shaped differences in

66
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.020
business, one is spent nine
hours standing in a queue

67
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.750
and in a not so
great part of Johannesburg in

68
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.130
1994. And it was a
single day of complete peace,

69
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.460
complete harmony amongst every single
person that was standing there.

70
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.610
It was amazing. And now
I think we facing different

71
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.730
challenges and different ways of,
of dealing with, with some

72
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.580
of the issues that we
have. And this is completely

73
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.700
different from what it was
before 1994 changed everyone's life.

74
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.290
Well now people when, when,
when, when people, and I

75
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.250
guess since I'm a white
man living in America, and

76
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.810
I tend to think when
I say people, I guess

77
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.800
I'm speaking of white folks
think of diversity. Sometimes they

78
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.080
think of nonwhite or they
think of mixed groups of

79
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.200
people typically focused around skin
color after 2001 in the

80
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.270
States, diversity became a little
bit more of a, of

81
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.130
an expansive term to mean
also people of various religions.

82
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.620
And I think that, you
know, certainly when people sit

83
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.740
down and think about what
diversity is, it's, it's everything

84
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.280
from, it could be hair,
color, and style. It could

85
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.820
be religion, it could be
disability. It could be anything.

86
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.020
Are people in South Africa still
focused on color? Or is

87
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.960
it more about culture or
is it more about, you

88
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.360
know, finances? It doesn't matter
what color you are. It

89
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.210
matters how much money you
have. It's changing Scott, I

90
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.770
think in South Africa, because we
have a previous dispensation where

91
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.920
it was low. It was,
it was, it is decreed

92
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.340
that people will live separately.
It was imposed upon you.

93
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.220
You can't shed that in
15 years and not think

94
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.820
about people in non racial
lines. I think it's an

95
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.840
easy stereotype that you converge
on when you describe people

96
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.580
and you categorize people, take
it on, on, on color

97
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.320
boundaries. But I think when
you scratch beneath the surface,

98
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.290
it is not so much
color. It is so much,

99
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.540
it is a lot more
about culture. And in South Africa

100
00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.250
in the last five years,
we have a much greater

101
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.820
increase in an emerging black
middle class, which is really,

102
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.730
really important to Africa. And
so financial position and economic

103
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:17.500
status that introduces more diversity,
extremely conscious about gender equality.

104
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.270
So there's diversity in that
traditional cultures in South Africa, very

105
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.020
patriarchal in many parts of
the world. So gender politics

106
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:39.520
is really important. Political affiliation
is a really important characteristic

107
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.990
that distinguishes people from each
other, which political party you

108
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.510
associated with. You can't avoid
it in a country like

109
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.820
Sometimes from the point of
view of the ethnocentric West

110
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.710
as the, the white majority,
we here in America tend

111
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.860
to look at other countries
and say, it's just an

112
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.490
issue between two groups. We,
we would generalize and say,

113
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.500
well, the issue in South Africa
is between whites and blacks.

114
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.280
You know, the issues in
the Asian subcontinent or between

115
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.770
Indians and Pakistanis. And it
ignores the, the diversity of

116
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.950
the, of the group. Just
as you said, there's 11

117
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.180
official languages in South Africa. We
still think of it as

118
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.140
being a white and black
issue, but user are a

119
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.250
South African and your family
has been South African for

120
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.220
hundreds of years. And while
you are Brown, you're not

121
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.730
black. Does that change the
equation as you go about

122
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.280
your business as a, as
a developer in South Africa, That's

123
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:44.620
a, that's an interesting, that's
an interesting question. I have

124
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.430
to bring this back to
come back into context during

125
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.440
a Patek, you are black,
you are not white. That

126
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.450
was the distinction. You're not
white. You fought the same

127
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.160
struggle. You had one so-called
enemy and inverted common, you

128
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:09.450
know, so we fought against
the same oppressor, African African,

129
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:15.060
African Indian, South African African.
So I must make a

130
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.240
distinction, call it in South Africa.
It's not necessarily how you

131
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.200
look, Right? So when you
say when, when South Africans

132
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.870
say colored, they don't mean
any disrespect as it was

133
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.880
used in the States. They
mean mixed what we call

134
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.270
mixed people. So my son,
my sons are mixed. We

135
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.640
would call them in the
States or interracial or biracial.

136
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.470
They would be called colored
in South Africa without any meanness

137
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.500
meant in the statement. No,
none at all. I it's,

138
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.000
it's an, it's sort of
not an interracial marriage. So,

139
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.970
so that is what we
mean by colored. So, so

140
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.190
people that were not white,
we fought, we fought the

141
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.370
same struggle. We had the
same challenges. And when you

142
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:57.530
work in that type of
environment, you, you, you almost

143
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.330
invariably reported to, to a
white superior. And that was,

144
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.970
that was the context in
which you work. When you

145
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.410
come to post the pockets
of Africa, you're struggling to

146
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.610
find your own individual identity.
You could suddenly, there is

147
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:19.280
no single person that a
single category of people that,

148
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.630
that is pressing the Stripe,
you actually finding to find

149
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.350
your own identity. So even
amongst the African of Africans,

150
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:34.160
we have different cultures is,
is Plaza is Zulu, is

151
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:43.520
Shangaan Jonah. So it's each,
each one of those ethnic

152
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.000
grouping. That's starting to find
their own identity. There's a

153
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.910
South African Indian. You struggled
to find your own identity

154
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:56.360
as well, because my identity
is not India. It is

155
00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.410
not that at all. I've
never been there. My great

156
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.280
grandfather or grandfather was from
there and, and completely different

157
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.700
for me. I have my
regions in South Africa. And so

158
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.240
working in South Africa as an
Indian, you look for your

159
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.210
own identity and you fighting
a different battle completely, Right?

160
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.100
You're no more attached to
India than I am to

161
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:25.280
Scotland of the 17 hundreds.
Exactly. I have, I have

162
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.610
no passion, but I'd love
to visit the place my

163
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.780
mother has, has, has knows
exactly the village we, her

164
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.660
father came from. She's been
there. I have no passion

165
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.760
to go there. I would
like to go there. It's

166
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.160
just interesting. The difference of
course, is that I can

167
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.520
look at you and make
an assumption, make a judgment

168
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.910
of where you're from. And
since I don't have a

169
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.640
kilt and red hair and
freckles people can't look at

170
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.590
me and your people are
from Scotland. So there are

171
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.080
all of these initial assumptions.
When showing shows up on

172
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.660
a team here in the
States, we work on very,

173
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.680
very diverse teams. And if
I join up with a

174
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.880
group of different software developers,
I may see two individuals

175
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.430
and not be able to
tell that one is Indian.

176
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.020
One is Pakistani, and maybe
they wouldn't be friends because

177
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.810
of some particular reason that
I can't understand as an

178
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.680
American, but I need to
think about that as a,

179
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.960
as a team manager. But
at the same time, I

180
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.790
don't want to focus on
it because it's not what

181
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.390
we're here for. We're here
to write software. When you

182
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.100
have all of those complexities,
how do you get coherence

183
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.600
in a, in a, in
a team when there's so

184
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.090
much underlying history? I was
touching that now, but I

185
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:44.280
think that not knowing I
can look at people of

186
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.500
Indian origin and I can
tell you that this business

187
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.950
was probably a Hindu and
this person was probably Campbell.

188
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.940
And that one is most
probably Pakistan, because I'm familiar

189
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:59.130
with the subtleties and differences,
the subtle differences between those

190
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.300
people. So it might just
be an exposure issue. I

191
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.270
might just not be familiar
with it. You know, There,

192
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.920
there are some groups that
you can't do that with,

193
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.080
but I hear what you're
saying. I mean, someone might

194
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.740
say all, you know, all
Asians look alike, but if

195
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.050
they spend time with them,
they may find it very

196
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.760
easy to tell what country
comes in. Someone comes from,

197
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.670
but in all of these
things, one makes an assumption

198
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.110
and one cannot be 100%.
Right. You know what I'm

199
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.570
saying? There was an interesting
experiment in the States here.

200
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.100
Recently when someone put out
resumes with traditionally white names

201
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.850
and then the identical resume
with traditionally African American names

202
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.550
names, that would be, you
know, like John Smith on one

203
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.990
side and, you know, Lavante
Jackson on the other side

204
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.320
and see if they would
make a difference just based

205
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.530
entirely on assumption around naming.
And this is a very

206
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.800
common thing in what's happening
in Iraq. Right now, people

207
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.020
can tell whether you're Sunni
or Shia based on your

208
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.220
last name. So this is
a worldwide thing. There's, there's,

209
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.810
there's being able to look
at you and tell by

210
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.230
your facial structure or assumed
by your facial structure by

211
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.410
your last name, by the
way, your accent is all

212
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.100
of these things causes initial
assumptions to be made, which

213
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.200
color no pun intended our
interactions with individuals. I hundred

214
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.530
percent agree with you is
that those early stereotypes that

215
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.600
we make coming back to
how we deal with this

216
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.620
in a, in a team
environment. So I I've been

217
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:30.780
through last year and the
year before that 2008, 2007,

218
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.980
I went through quite a
challenging experience working on a

219
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.030
project that was two years
long. And in that project,

220
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:46.080
I had most extreme conflict
between people that I've ever

221
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.980
had in my entire life
to, to the point where

222
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.420
I had people calling each
other, you know, leveraging really

223
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.030
strong statements, to the extent
of things like calling someone,

224
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.340
a white supremacy, okay. In
a work environment and an

225
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.110
open in an open meeting,
you know, really, really strong

226
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:09.700
statements that kept really, really
close to the mall. So,

227
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.090
mm right. And we had
a huge turnaround of staff.

228
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.750
And you can just imagine
people just breaking down the

229
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.320
spirit of people that we've
just been crushed. And, and

230
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.190
for the first time in
South Africa, working with South African,

231
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.010
there was not a single
person outside of South Africa in

232
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.420
there. First time I felt
as if I knew nobody,

233
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.040
I never understood involved, but
about the culture and about

234
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.810
what, what made them tick
in the project. And they

235
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.980
bothered me or not, you
know, and it was only

236
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.290
towards the end of that
project was the end of

237
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:54.130
my stay in that project
that I have a thinking

238
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:59.230
about what caused all of
this. And that's the thing

239
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:06.160
that came through my mind.
He just did not take

240
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.170
the time out to understand
each other. We just created

241
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:17.050
this tiny little universe. No,
it was isolated from the

242
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.080
rest of the world. We
came into this project and

243
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.090
we felt that, are we
going to do this whole

244
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.970
thing with the agile way
of doing it, that creates

245
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.660
a team value system and
everyone will adopt it. I

246
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.690
sat back and thought about
it later on. And it

247
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.780
is not so easy to
create a team values. Well,

248
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.350
how do you create a
value system? No, that's it

249
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.950
thinking about how, how we
bootstrap the team? And we

250
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.590
did the typical thing when
we're recruiting for this team.

251
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:49.150
We did it, we described
what we wanted out of

252
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.210
an individual. So, you know,
the typical stuff that Uber

253
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.960
geek, you know, must know
this language and must be

254
00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.340
enthusiastic. You know, self-starter good
leader. And right at the

255
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.530
end, we always put down
something that says, you know,

256
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.380
must be a team, okay.
This individual and the asking

257
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.540
him to be part of
it, we should have had

258
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.500
to describe the team identity.
And if you're looking for

259
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:24.490
someone that'll fit this, he
says, when people believe, when

260
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:30.960
people enter into a new
in you, they have <inaudible>

261
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:37.920
personal identity to be ready.
They fit into that when

262
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.630
it's only, after a period
of time, if you start

263
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:48.550
living your personal characteristics, identity,
and self permeates, and we

264
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.420
never let happen, we just
did not let that happen.

265
00:17:52.650 --> 00:18:00.240
So we had people with
strong political baggage, I'm using

266
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.030
the word banks really poorly,
but you know what I

267
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.970
mean is that they have
right. They had baggage of

268
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.280
some kind and they brought
it with them onto the

269
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.160
team on day one. Yeah.
And they have a lot

270
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.950
of history of tests with
them and it defined the

271
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.250
way they look forward in
life. And we didn't understand

272
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.610
that. I didn't understand it.
So we had the result

273
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.440
of the fact that I
just did not make the

274
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.430
time to understand each person
individually. And what made them

275
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.970
tick meant that we had
all of these power struggles

276
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.390
that they're going, these tiny
little posts going on. Each

277
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.300
person is just trying to
find a position in this

278
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:41.270
environment that was just exploded.
It just got magnified over

279
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.210
time. And the power struggles
became larger and larger and

280
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:50.300
larger, and you get sucked
into it. And, and I

281
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:56.000
started questioning, you know, what
does it mean to be

282
00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.830
in an agile team? And
does it, does it make

283
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.000
any difference what, what we're
doing as a team, if

284
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.630
we just don't understand each
other, as people first and

285
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:15.140
foremost, writing software is an
extremely cerebral thing. At the

286
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.270
same time, it is a
purely social exercise, very, very

287
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.170
social in its structure. And
we just didn't take the

288
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:28.910
time off and a few
minutes, extra each morning just

289
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.040
to know each other. So
let me, let me dig

290
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.950
into that more, because recently
in the States, there's a,

291
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.530
there's a radio show called
talk of the nation. It's

292
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.200
kind of the American version
of world. Have your say.

293
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:44.300
And one of the discussions
was about a study that

294
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.960
came out recently that talked
about what they're calling colorblind

295
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:55.700
teams and culturally diverse or
culturally sensitive teams, basically, you

296
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.150
know, for many years in
the States, people have advocated

297
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.420
to being color blind. You
know, I see you as

298
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.970
an individual judge you on
the content of your character.

299
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.890
And we basically pretend that
we're all the same and

300
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.180
we really try to downplay
not necessarily ignore, but downplay

301
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.610
as much as we can
issues of, of color of

302
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.840
religious difference. Well, the other
perspective would sounds more like

303
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.080
what you're describing is to,
to recognize, to celebrate, to

304
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.020
discuss, to be open about
cultural differences. One of the

305
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.120
things I didn't like about
this particular show was that

306
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.030
they kept saying that and
referring to it in, in

307
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.710
vagueries. But what I want
to understand is if I'm

308
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.410
running an agile team, that's
very diverse and diverse doesn't

309
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.110
necessarily mean color. It just
means that we are all

310
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:48.130
different people. What can we
do? What concrete can I

311
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.720
bring to that, that team?
What techniques can I use

312
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.410
to change to, to frame
the discussion? Hmm. So I

313
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.390
think there's a few things
that we can try out.

314
00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:04.360
I mean, one of the
things that I, I, I

315
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.500
like to try out is,
is to make some full

316
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.910
conversations, more meaningful, and I
go back to the way

317
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.830
teachings and then in different
coaches. So I come from,

318
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.710
I come from a Muslim
background and the way you

319
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:30.480
greet someone of Muslim background,
you say, <inaudible>, that's all

320
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.350
it is, you know, but
it's, it's, it's quite a

321
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.080
powerful statement. That's fundamental. I
mean, it's a throw away

322
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.410
statement like how you're doing,
but it is, it is

323
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:46.260
meaningful if you dig into
it. Yeah. And a Zulu

324
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:50.760
culture. Then when someone asks
you how you are, you

325
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.890
know, the literal translation is
that the response is not

326
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.040
the, I am fine because
the translation is I exist.

327
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:04.380
Right? Yeah. I am alive
still. I'm alive. I exist.

328
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.630
And, and, and it gets
quite colorful if the person

329
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.750
doesn't feel too good or
overlooked. So say something like

330
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.530
I'm filling my pants, you
know, I don't even have

331
00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:20.340
time to eat, you know,
really working really hard. So

332
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.770
in, in conversation, I, I
would like people to explain

333
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.560
a little bit more about
how they really mean, because

334
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.930
the water cooler passing in
the corridor type of, type

335
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.090
of, Hey, Bob, how are
you? You know, I'm fine.

336
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.930
Just carry on walking. It's
a meaningless engagement. It's completely

337
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.770
meaningless. Right. But maybe not
to other people I say,

338
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.480
Yeah. So if people just
took the time out to

339
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.240
say a little bit more
about, yeah, this is how

340
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.360
it really feels, you know,
No, it's interesting. A, a

341
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.720
friend of ours who is
from Swazi land is now

342
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.360
living in France. He called
me a couple of hours

343
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.490
ago. And just to say,
hello, he was thinking about

344
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.300
us. And this always surprises
me, married to my wife

345
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.050
for 10 years. She's in
Baldwin. And we have all

346
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.080
of these international friends. And,
and this, this Swazi I

347
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.110
haven't talked to in two
years, how are you doing

348
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:21.570
first sentence, second sentence. How
are your parents? I, you

349
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.940
know, I, he met my
parents eight years ago, 10

350
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.940
years ago at our wedding,
but that's just such a,

351
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.790
that's such an African South
African thing to do. How

352
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.550
are you parents? How are
they keeping? I mean, he

353
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.790
remembers brothers and sisters in
laws and cousins. And how

354
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.770
are they? And, and, and
the, the, the, how are

355
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:43.050
you doing throwaway statements that,
that, that Americans typically use?

356
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.610
You know, how are you
doing when I don't really

357
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.640
want to know answer? If
the answer is not fine,

358
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.650
then, then just tell me,
you're fine. And we'll move

359
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:55.010
on. Is there's almost a
ceremonial reverence that happens in,

360
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.350
in African cultures around something
as simple as how are

361
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.510
you doing? He sincerely wants
to know how my parents

362
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:04.160
are doing You're right. It
is not uncommon it. And,

363
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.240
and it comes from the
fact that the atomic unit

364
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.340
in fact, is still the
family and not the individual.

365
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.120
So when you think about
someone in interact with someone,

366
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:22.180
you interact with them and
the entire family, I mean,

367
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.330
I listened to your show
where you did your interview

368
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.040
with a few people in
South Africa, including your wife. And

369
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.490
you spoke a little bit
about what the elders in

370
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:37.180
her family and the respect
that was offered to them.

371
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:43.210
It's the fact that the
family is still the unit

372
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.570
in society and not individual.
And that makes a big

373
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.550
difference. That is why we
still ask how is your

374
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:52.120
family, but it also creates
more meaningful understanding of the

375
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.680
person. If you're actually bringing
a part of the person's

376
00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.910
life outside, outside the work
environment, into the work environment,

377
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.550
if you do, if you
do do something like that.

378
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:08.860
And when I think about
working in a team, it's

379
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.530
like working in a drum
and what is the ceiling?

380
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.980
It's the lid of the
drum. But when people come

381
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.130
into work environment and walk
into the morning, what can

382
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.890
every morning, you have no
idea whether they've had a

383
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:25.690
bad traffic day, a sick
child at home, or they're

384
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.270
worried about something else, and
that could affect the performance.

385
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.940
It could affect the behavior.
And we have no idea

386
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.660
about that. And so we
have to, we have to

387
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.270
bridge that in some way.
And I think that simple

388
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.590
conversations that are meaningful to
do that, it doesn't mean

389
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.440
that it's sit down and,
and, you know, 15 minutes,

390
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.790
just a few choice questions
that you can ask and

391
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.680
very politely, I think it
makes a huge difference. Hi,

392
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.780
it's Scott here from another
place in time. I hope

393
00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.570
you're enjoying the show so
far. I apologize for interrupting

394
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.130
it, but I wanted to
let you know that assembling

395
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.980
a podcast like this every
week, isn't free. Certainly the

396
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.020
bandwidth bill crushes us every
month. So I want to

397
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.120
let you know that this
show is sponsored by Tellerik.

398
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.160
They make the show possible,
and it makes it pretty

399
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.860
cool products as well. For
example, if you're trying to

400
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.800
build a web 2.0 Ajax
application, trying to use the

401
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.830
web 1.0 components, it's kind
of difficult. You've got to

402
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.180
get the next gen stuff.
If you want to build

403
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.640
the next gen websites. And
that's exactly what the folks

404
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.160
at Telerx have got and
their new upcoming product, which

405
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.610
is code named rad controls.
Prometheus's big pack, a web

406
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.640
controls built entirely on top
of the Microsoft ASP net

407
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.070
Ajax stuff that you already
understand. It's going to give

408
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.380
you a lot of performance
interactivity on your next project.

409
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.530
They mirror the ASP net
Ajax API. So the development's

410
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.490
really straightforward client scripture's shared
loading time is pretty fast

411
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.790
set a couple of properties.
You can even bind to

412
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:48.330
web services for really efficient
operation. The new rad editor

413
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.520
for ASP and Ajax loads
up to four times faster

414
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.310
than before. And the rad
grid will do thousands of

415
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.190
records in milliseconds. But of
course, it's better to try

416
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.500
these things for yourself. So
you can visit <inaudible> dot

417
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.100
com slash ASP, net Ajax,
and download a trial. Thanks

418
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.690
a lot for listening, and
we'll get right back to

419
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.710
the show. So bringing that
back to the concrete, I'm

420
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.640
hearing you say that that
kind of paraphrasing and adding

421
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.810
a little color of my
own, that, you know, we

422
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:17.070
are such a logical beings.
This is such a hyper

423
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.410
logical, almost dysfunctional thing of
making the making of software.

424
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.020
It, you know, we are
asked as humans to almost,

425
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.040
you know, to think like
machines. I can see where

426
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.890
if I was on a
diverse team that had a

427
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.830
large number of people that
valued family, and I was

428
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.530
the, Hey, how's it going?
All right, let's get this.

429
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.040
Let's get to work individual
that they could start to

430
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.560
distrust me feel that I
didn't value the things that

431
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.230
they valued. They might not
be able to put their

432
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.980
finger on it and say,
it's because Scott's not asking

433
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.960
me how my parents are.
It's not it's, you know,

434
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.300
they may just have a
sense of, I don't think

435
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:58.250
he cares. Is that a
fair thing to say? It's

436
00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.610
a very real possibility because
you just didn't make the

437
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.540
time, take the time to,
to, to understand how I

438
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:11.030
feel very real possibility. And
it could manifest beyond just

439
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.960
finding out how the person
is. The fact is that

440
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.710
if you don't take the
time out to understand the

441
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:22.150
individual's value system and the,
and the value system is,

442
00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.700
comes from the value system
of the family, of the

443
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:31.040
culture over decades and generations.
So what are the things

444
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.820
in South Africa, in a previous
company that it looks at

445
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.420
director used to call it
a one to 10, one

446
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.780
to 10 is driving him
crazy because punctuality was not

447
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:46.670
that important. So if you
set a meeting for 10:00 AM

448
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.000
and people walked in 15
minutes past, it was actually

449
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.950
okay, because walking to the
meeting in the car, though,

450
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.800
in the passage, I met
someone and decided to have

451
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:03.710
a conversation and then come
in, you know, so it

452
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.820
manifests itself in so many
different ways that we have

453
00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.090
to become aware of these
tiny little things and define

454
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.530
our own value system. Now,
when you, it's funny that

455
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.020
you get that you brought
this up because I posted

456
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.530
about this and I called
it African time. And there's

457
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.880
been a number of different
names for this thing. And

458
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.550
I posted about this and
I got some very pointed

459
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:32.120
responses on my, on my
blog about, you know, who

460
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.980
well, that's you, who are,
who are you to impose

461
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.050
your value system and insist
that people are on time?

462
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.030
Or how can you make
a judgment about a whole

463
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.790
group of people implying that
they're, they're not on time.

464
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.870
So I have a, a
South African to, to prove

465
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.500
that these things do exist,
that, that it's not making

466
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.620
a value judgment, that a
person is a bad person

467
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.820
to say they are showing
up late. They simply value

468
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.300
different things. They're not meaning
to disrespect me. Like if

469
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.610
my wife shows up late
for an appointment that we

470
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.540
set, it's not that she
doesn't value the appointment or

471
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.630
the time or my time
it's that something happened that

472
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:12.730
she valued more or differently.
And she made that judgment

473
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.760
call. And while people will,
people in the States might

474
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.760
rush away from a chance
meeting with a friend in

475
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.030
order to make it to
a meeting on time, someone

476
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.880
that values something differently like
my wife or yourself perhaps

477
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.150
might let that chance meeting
with a friend linger and

478
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.450
be 15, 20 minutes late.
And if the people at

479
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:35.230
the meeting value that same
thing also, then no one

480
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.150
would be insulted. Or if
it feel at all that

481
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.770
it was an inappropriate thing
to do. It can't necessarily

482
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.070
be inappropriate. Just, just falling
on what you're saying is

483
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:49.800
that, and the concept is
we're born to, you know,

484
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:55.200
I think is, is extremely
powerful for diverse team, because

485
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.640
it's about, it's about defining
so simple philosophy. You mentioned

486
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.920
it in your, in your
interview with your wife, that

487
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.760
is about, it says that
you are who you are

488
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.190
through other people, you know,
people are people through other

489
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:13.200
people. So I call it
a one to 10 because

490
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.360
people often get delayed, not
as it's sitting at their

491
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.590
desk, you know, hacking away
at some code because they,

492
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.260
it is, it is important
to them to have a

493
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.800
two minute engagement with someone
that they did not see

494
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.160
it the day before they
get to the meeting. And

495
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.970
that is important today in
value. That that is an

496
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:40.140
extremely important thing that punches
it is. So you can't

497
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.160
say that, you know, coming
late to the meeting was

498
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.460
disrespectful to the meeting and
the people that it's just

499
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:52.590
that this person at a
mall had executed a different

500
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:56.880
value at this made a
baby. So, you know, and

501
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.880
I think about the hardwood
experience I had with that

502
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.760
particular project and all the
conflicts that we had. And

503
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.350
I think that if we
had just dropped back to

504
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.350
some of the concepts philosophies,
or from Bluetooth would have

505
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:12.090
helped. So we've, and we've,
and we've had leadership in

506
00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:15.870
the country and has been
trying to reinforce this. So

507
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:24.390
when Nelson Mandela, he talks
about it, as simply as

508
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.300
when you do something in
your community, are you doing

509
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.510
it for yourself, or are
you thinking about how it's

510
00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.030
going to benefit the next
person in your community or

511
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:42.440
your entire community? I think
from a perspective writing software,

512
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.730
the action that you do
have you thought about whether

513
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.280
that action is going to
benefit the rest of the

514
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.210
team often we don't know,
and this might be my

515
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.120
experience, you know? And so
let's take a trivial example.

516
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.680
Someone come with broken, you
know, broken bones. Have you

517
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.410
thought about it, about how
it affects the rest of

518
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:08.780
the team? And if you
wrote this line of code,

519
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.410
have you thought about how
it fits? If you communicate

520
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.480
in a particular way, have
you thought about hot fix?

521
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.230
And it's just about thinking
beyond yourself, that's what it

522
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.760
is. Yeah. So now some
people, some people might say

523
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.460
though, that this is a
very kind of Eastern, you

524
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:29.500
know, humanist philosophy. That's very
different. You know, it's very

525
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.600
intangible. You know, this is
a, it's just a philosophy

526
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.560
and your one could, could
push back a little bit

527
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.390
and say what you're telling
me to, you know, think

528
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:43.040
about how this line of
code affects my coworkers. There

529
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.750
was actually, there's an interesting
book by a Harvard sociologist

530
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.090
that is making the rounds
in the U S right

531
00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:53.890
now. And it's, it's called
the no asshole rule. And

532
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.710
it is a, you would,
you would dismiss one would

533
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.500
dismiss it based entirely on
its title. They would say,

534
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.110
Oh, well, this is a
very course, a very course

535
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.060
term. We don't want to
be any part of that,

536
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.280
but this is an actual,
you know, Harvard, PhD is

537
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.070
put, thought into why he
picked such a course word

538
00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:15.310
and the whole book could
be summed up into that

539
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:20.290
Zulu saying, well, <inaudible>, you
know, a person is a

540
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.700
person that other people don't
be an asshole and you

541
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:29.050
you'll see things like that
around the web for years,

542
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:34.210
that that just do, we
have to be so intense,

543
00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:37.690
so angry. So whatever in
everything that we do as,

544
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.740
as developers, it is what
we're describing and getting involved

545
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.490
and getting in, getting along
rather on, on diverse teams,

546
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:47.860
as simple as just try
not to be a jerk

547
00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:51.400
and think about what you're
doing. Is it that easy?

548
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:55.210
You could break, you can
break it down to, to

549
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.870
B to be something as,
as simple as that, but

550
00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.530
the impact it has is
profound because how you, how

551
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:05.350
you, how do you execute,
not being a joke is

552
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.770
what is important to saying
that not being a jerk

553
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.590
is a simple statement. How
do you not be a

554
00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.860
jerk? It was really important.
And it's really hard thing

555
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:21.610
to do, defining a jerk.
You know, it varies between

556
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:26.590
people, you know, some people
might find you completely obnoxious

557
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.460
and others might find you
extremely likable. And it's just

558
00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.070
because the criteria they use
to judge you a completely

559
00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:39.240
different. And that gets into
the cultural context of, you

560
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.760
know, someone might say, well,
I really like how efficient

561
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.010
Scott is. He doesn't mince
words. He gets right down

562
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.890
to business. Well, someone who
values something differently might say,

563
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:49.320
wow, he's so cold. He
has no interest in our

564
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.720
daily life. And all he
thinks about his work and

565
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.340
that could elicit completely opposite
results. How do you, how

566
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.660
do you reconcile that? Does
that mean I need to

567
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.750
change? We all need to
change our behavior or does

568
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.280
it just really mean that
we all, as a team

569
00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.630
need to temper our behavior
and understand that maybe Scott

570
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.450
acts that way because he
is here. I am talking

571
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.460
about myself in the third
person. You know, maybe this

572
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:16.170
individual talks this way because
that's what they value. And

573
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.620
I will not be offended
as I ordinarily would be.

574
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.450
It's just a matter of
relaxing. I think when we

575
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:28.790
impose individual value systems, we
really impose it on others.

576
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:36.740
We started getting conflict. If
these people don't, don't tolerate

577
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.370
in positions, having the will
of someone else imposed upon

578
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:45.770
them. And the way you,
you way to get harmony

579
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:50.660
is when you, when you
do make compromises and the

580
00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:56.030
acts of compromise that brings
about that harmony, and you

581
00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:00.530
can't have compromise unless you
understand the position that the

582
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.320
person is coming from, you
understand your own mission. You

583
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:07.580
have some reconciliation with that,
and don't take it back

584
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.600
to listen in South Africa. Again,
I spoke about Nelson Mandela

585
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.400
and how he describes the
Archbishop Desmond Tutu would describe

586
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:20.810
the bull too, as a
way of respecting someone regardless

587
00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.890
of, of, of what they
have done in the past.

588
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:30.050
And here's a, here's a,
here's a, you know, an

589
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:34.220
amazing individual who, who chaired
the truth and reconciliation commission

590
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:42.380
in South Africa, which was, I
personally believe was, was the

591
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.730
instrumental that prevented us from
going into civil war. Like

592
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.270
the rest of Africa. People
still think that, that the

593
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.370
truth and reconciliation, the way
that they ran the truth

594
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.610
and reconciliation commission is the
model for doing such things

595
00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.540
and needs to be done
in other places. Yes. So

596
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.890
we had, we had, it
was such a simple concept,

597
00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.920
but it came back to
the same philosophy that we

598
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.760
had closure. And we had
understanding people could see who

599
00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:15.740
did what wrong to their
family in the past. And

600
00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:20.000
it's just understanding what happened
that people were able to

601
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.940
reconcile and move on. And
I think it's the same

602
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.000
thing. When you have conflicts
in teams, you just need

603
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.530
to actually just sit down
and just hear the other

604
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.800
person out and try to
understand a little bit more

605
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.190
about the motor that came
from it. And a lot

606
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.040
of the times we live
with the blame culture. You

607
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.710
know, we always want to,
you always want to blame

608
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:46.170
someone else. A lot of
the times the issue is

609
00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.820
it's just that someone made
a mistake. It's just simple

610
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:52.270
as that. That's just an
honest mistake is not being

611
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.970
blown out of proportion. You
know, we have the blame

612
00:38:54.970 --> 00:39:00.850
culture, which, which detracts from
accepting responsibility. And when we

613
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:05.290
go into the blame mode,
we don't think back to

614
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.750
our South and say, Oh,
what am I doing wrong?

615
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.400
Probably someone else's thing that
comes back to the way

616
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:17.410
business Tutu describes the wound
and how it helps with

617
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:23.470
radiation, the society. It's not
different. We see it. I

618
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.570
mean, it's not a, it's
not an African thing. Masa,

619
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:31.840
Gandy basically said the same
thing. You got gotta, you

620
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.580
gotta measure your worth by
what you've done to help

621
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.720
the next person and the
same ideas. And I think

622
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.990
in software teams, we don't
do enough of that. We

623
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:49.000
just sit down. And when
we think about, you know,

624
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.420
the technical challenges that you're
facing, yes, we have to

625
00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.480
sit down and be social
before we can solve problems

626
00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:01.320
together. Hmm. Yeah. It really
is a matter of being

627
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.950
present and being conscious. And,
you know, so much of,

628
00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:12.210
of interaction with people is,
is without formal thought, it's,

629
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.660
it's just easier to let
the interaction happen. And in

630
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.530
those cases, you fall back
on all of the things

631
00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.710
that define you as an
individual. Are you gonna respond

632
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.770
to someone consciously or are
you going to let whatever

633
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.270
pops out of your mouth
happen? And I'm hearing you

634
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:34.170
say, you know, code consciously,
BA BA member of the

635
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:39.690
team that is present and
aware, it doesn't necessarily mean

636
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:44.370
tiptoe around differences with people,
but approach them with an

637
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:47.940
open mind and an understanding
that they are not necessarily,

638
00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.450
or almost assuredly coming at
it at the same direction

639
00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:57.030
that you are Tiptoeing around.
People becomes the extreme opposite,

640
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.880
where you actually walking on
these eggshells and it's being,

641
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.390
I mean, it's about political
correctness, which is just as

642
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:11.790
meaningless because you don't have
to be offensive to people

643
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:17.250
if you're trying to understand
their position, it's, it's the

644
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.830
same, it's the same example
as coming late for a

645
00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:24.180
meeting. You know, it's a
similar thing when, when you

646
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.490
talk to someone and say,
but I didn't understand that,

647
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:31.500
you know, Zulu people or,
or, you know, Latinos or

648
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.450
whatever it is, did things
like that. You may be

649
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:40.040
doing a, you know, a
generalization or stereotyping, but it's

650
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.560
not necessarily that you mean
it in an offensive way.

651
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.680
We don't have to necessarily
go to the other extreme

652
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.130
of being extremely politically, correct.
Just to get, just to

653
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.860
avoid the issues. You don't
want to avoid issues. You

654
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:57.400
want deal with the issue.
So There's the problem of

655
00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.450
political correctness, a big thing
in South Africa. Yes. Very much.

656
00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.960
So everything is a big,
big in South Africa. I'm just

657
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.790
saying that sometimes as a
white guy, I feel like

658
00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.150
maybe it's like maybe white
people have the, the market

659
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:14.770
cornered on being extra. Careful
not to offend anyone. It's

660
00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.600
such a, it's such a,
it's such an odd thing

661
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.090
because sometimes I think people
are, I don't know whether

662
00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:23.980
people are being politically correct.
Right. Or they're being euphemistic.

663
00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.750
Yeah. That's a very good
question. I mean, I, I

664
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.540
usually pre start sentences with
you. I hope I'm not

665
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.540
offending you, but you know,
I mean, there's, there's various

666
00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.960
levels of offensive, right. I
mean, as, as a, as

667
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.230
a parent of two young
black men, there's the, there's

668
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.930
the, Hey, let me touch
their hair without asking level

669
00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:48.040
of offensiveness, which is kind
of a lowercase O but

670
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.080
then there's kind of the
more, like, what are you,

671
00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.650
what are they, which is,
you know, getting to full

672
00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.390
on kind of, Hey, w
w what are you trying

673
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:59.020
to say? There are ways
to approach these differences without

674
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:03.400
making people feel bad about
them. Sometimes I think that

675
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.060
that political correctness should be
reserved for bureaucrats and for

676
00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:13.000
legalees and getting it right
in government communications and communication.

677
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:18.910
And when it starts creeping
into, you know, social conversation,

678
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.630
I wonder whether it's used
as, as, just as a

679
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:28.690
euphemism for, you know, for
being scared of offending people.

680
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:33.250
So you tone it down
and maybe we shouldn't turn

681
00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:37.510
it down. No one wants
to offend someone. I hope

682
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.970
unless you were going out,
looking for a fight. The

683
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:41.980
goal here is not to
offend anyone. I think there's

684
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.220
that. I mean, I wanna,
I wanna talk radios here.

685
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.360
There's a nine o'clock show
and the guy is coming.

686
00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:53.950
And he, he has some
really extreme people, you know,

687
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:59.380
people that are extremely tolerant
to taking a non politically

688
00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:04.450
correct politically incorrect statements against
him and, and just dealing

689
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.490
with this and other people
can take a very, very

690
00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:11.200
soft issue and really, really
hard done by. And so

691
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.770
that's what I think we
have. We have to some

692
00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:20.830
extent learned how to deal
with, with, with what could

693
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.130
be considered really offensive to
other people we've learned to

694
00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:29.230
deal with it in some
ways it's okay to be

695
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.580
very forthright about certain issues.
I don't think you can't,

696
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.100
I don't think you can
be subtle about something in

697
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.240
South Africa. Well, and in any,
anywhere in the world, I

698
00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.960
have found almost always that
if one is earnest in

699
00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.590
their, in the, in their
quest for understanding, right, if

700
00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.080
I'm, if I'm here just
to do a better job

701
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.720
and just understand things better
so that we can be

702
00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.780
a team, then no matter
how I phrase it, I

703
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.850
can usually not offend somebody.
What I found is where

704
00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:11.030
it goes wrong is when,
when in that discussion that

705
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:15.740
you having to gain that
understanding when you have this

706
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.170
violence slip over from understanding
in general, and people start

707
00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:28.580
becoming very personal, they start
judging the person and not

708
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:34.580
judging the situation. So we
start having this personal conflict,

709
00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.760
and that becomes a that's
getting nasty. Well, I think

710
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.970
that that's very good advice.
The idea that whatever this

711
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.960
is, it's not about you
personally. There's another important thing.

712
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.640
They always say, check your
ego at the door. Yeah,

713
00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.690
it really is. It really
is. And the, the other

714
00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:00.770
day I watched on, on,
on one of the Ted

715
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:06.740
talk is a UCLA legendary
basketball coach. I forget his

716
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.690
name. It was really great
talk. And all of the

717
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:15.350
things he was talking about,
how we define success and

718
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.840
a few other things, and
his life philosophies and stuff.

719
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:20.960
One thing that he said
that really hits me was

720
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.120
it don't, don't try to
be better than what else

721
00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:31.910
all you gotta do is
learn from someone else. Don't

722
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.980
be better than someone else
just learn from someone else.

723
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:37.430
If you don't have to
be better than someone else,

724
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.730
you just have to learn
from someone else, which may

725
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.030
be the thing that, you
know, there is no such

726
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.640
thing as a top dog
in a team. There isn't

727
00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:52.040
someone who, who is above
anyone else. It's just sitting

728
00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:57.950
and working with people and
learning from each other, as

729
00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.610
opposed to trying to find
which strata in the team

730
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:06.350
you actually fit in and
give love that love great

731
00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:09.440
thing is Trotter and slotting
people in, you know, it

732
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:12.770
comes down to the job
description, you know, junior developer,

733
00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:19.640
senior analyst, you know, test
as compared to develop a

734
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.150
unit test. Oh my goodness.
Yeah. Yeah. That's definitely not

735
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:26.280
agile. Not it's kind of
against the agile style. And,

736
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.060
and I, I, I definitely
have that. I like to,

737
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.530
I mean, even though we
all, I mean at one

738
00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.410
person might have 20 years
experience and another person might

739
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.740
have a, you know, a
year's experience. I've always kind

740
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.260
of liked the two things
that I think Jeff Atwood

741
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:45.340
mentioned that one was, you
know, have a really strong

742
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.570
opinion, but have a weakly
held, you know, fight and

743
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.520
no one to stop and
say, Oh, Oh, I guess

744
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.360
you are right. Then move
on. And then the other

745
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.630
one was, we are all
amateurs. You know, about how

746
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:00.640
much experience you've got. We're
really all amateurs. This is

747
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.790
a very young discipline. And
we're all in this together.

748
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.710
You know, Intel actually has
a, a statement in working

749
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:11.800
in teams that they call
disagree and commit. And that's

750
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.470
really worked well for me
in working in diverse teams

751
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.860
to say, let's have a
fight. Here's the, here are

752
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.050
the bounds of the fight.
You know, here's the cage

753
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:22.690
match we're going to get
in here. It's not personal.

754
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:26.080
Let's fight it out, no
yelling, no personal attacks. And

755
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.690
when we're done, though, we
will all just, you know,

756
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.180
we'll disagree if you didn't
like the idea, but we

757
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.220
will commit to it. And
we don't want to hear,

758
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:36.940
I told you so or
arguments afterwards. And if the

759
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.790
entire team in their list
of team values can agree

760
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.190
that we will disagree. And
we will commit though and

761
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:47.260
put all of our weight
behind a particular solution that

762
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.570
works great. As a, as
a, as a team value

763
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.770
in a diverse team, That's
similar to one of the

764
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.970
tier two contradictions. There's a
great book called extreme theater

765
00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:01.450
that has been reading. And
one of the contradictions into

766
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.980
that, they have a strong
sense of, of structure and,

767
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:13.530
and, and an order in
the company hierarchy, which everybody

768
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:17.190
honors in respect and, and
both through the post, through

769
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:20.130
the normal channels to get
things done. But at the

770
00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:24.210
same time, they really encourage
people to be extremely vocal,

771
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.770
regardless of what position they
hold in the company. So

772
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.940
it, it, it doesn't seem
like it can work together,

773
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.330
but the fact that they
allow people to be extremely

774
00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:40.590
vocal means that they do
get to hear about things

775
00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:45.690
that concern people, which would
ordinarily have been blocked by

776
00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:50.520
the strong bureaucratic structures that
exist. So it's an interesting

777
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.370
way in which they try
to manage feedback. Yeah. I

778
00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:58.140
think that that's a very
good value. I think Microsoft

779
00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:00.750
does that sometimes in the
sense of I can speak

780
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:05.190
up. I basically know that
you can speak up and

781
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.530
know when to shut up
or kind of too good

782
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.750
values for, you know, two
good skills for anyone to

783
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:12.540
develop. I don't think that
if you are, if you're

784
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.790
in a culture that allows
that, that allows you to

785
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:18.870
speak to the president of
the company or whoever, or

786
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:22.020
your manager or your manager's
manager's manager, if it's an

787
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.080
appropriate bit of feedback and
communication, and it should be

788
00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.310
in, and it's welcomed, you
should use that. And then

789
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.980
if anybody, at the same
time, you should know when

790
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.110
to stop. You should say,
okay, well, I've said my

791
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:36.440
thing. I'm not going to
beat this horse anymore. I

792
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.810
have been heard. And then
now I'm going to disagree

793
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.650
and commit. I've. I've learned
that in the last six

794
00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:47.200
months from my fender Navien
colleagues, I'm new, I'm sitting

795
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.360
in South Africa and the rest
of my colleagues are in

796
00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:55.390
Sweden. And I learned very
quickly that they listen a

797
00:50:55.390 --> 00:51:00.160
lot more than I do.
They really practice the art

798
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.770
of lifting. That is very
a Scandinavian thing. No. And

799
00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:09.670
a silence at the end
of a telephone line for

800
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.780
a few seconds. And then
you get a response or

801
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.240
maybe just, maybe even the
next day, you get a

802
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:22.510
response. And I constantly teased
it, you know, about, about

803
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.230
how polite they're, it comes
across to being extremely polite.

804
00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:32.020
I said to anything when
I say that, so, you

805
00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.490
know, if they have to
go back into war with

806
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.650
Denmark, then was probably invite
them over for a cup

807
00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:41.490
of tea, talk about, instead
of budding down the oldest

808
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.620
on the bridge. And, you
know, and I said, I've

809
00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:48.670
collected anymore, but it's, but
it's, it's a really a

810
00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:55.780
great value to, to hold.
You know, it's exactly the

811
00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:00.100
same thing you're saying, be
quiet, listen, before you respond.

812
00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.530
And, and so some of
the teams that I find

813
00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:10.690
here in South Africa is that
we fought too eager sometimes

814
00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:14.170
to just get our point
across. And we interrupt people

815
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:18.160
a lot when they speak
That that's, that's interesting. So

816
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:19.660
I think it was my
wife that told me this,

817
00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:23.380
actually, I should say, publicly
on my podcast at all

818
00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.620
good things flow from my
wife. She said, are you

819
00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:31.600
listening? Or are you waiting
to speak? And when we're

820
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.870
arguing, I find that I
am sometimes not listening, but

821
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:38.590
rather waiting for my turn
to throw words at her.

822
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:45.490
So I think that's a
very interesting, I think I've

823
00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:50.860
just now understood what she
meant by that. Well, I'm

824
00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:54.670
bad about you. Good. Well,
I think this is probably

825
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:56.830
a good place to end
our discussion. And I thank

826
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:58.600
you so much for taking
the time out of your,

827
00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:01.090
your busy schedule. And I
know I've kept you up

828
00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.940
late in South Africa. I'm sure
our listeners do appreciate it.

829
00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:09.580
Well, I am really privileged
to be speaking to you,

830
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:14.620
and I hope that what
is spoken about will help

831
00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.640
someone else and their teams
and help us all to

832
00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:23.110
be a little bit better
species going forward. I really

833
00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:27.000
do hope so. Definitely will
buy you A lunch and

834
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.490
a coffee. And the next
time that I go at

835
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.960
Gaia, come back to a
Saturday. You got to do

836
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.270
that. You got to do
that. Were you in Cape

837
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:37.550
town in December? And I
missed it. I don't know

838
00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.700
how that happened. Scandalous. I
wouldn't have, I wouldn't have

839
00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:46.730
made it anyway. I had
a very long you're you're

840
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:50.630
working far too hard. Well,
I had a horrible 2007,

841
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:54.620
2008. I was spending weekends
in Cape town with my

842
00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:59.540
family and living in Victoria.
Oh my goodness. Yeah. So

843
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:05.180
I think, I think I'm
going to the website called

844
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:10.730
flight all the flights, my
soon as I've had, Hmm.

845
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.910
You're racking up the miles,
but you're helping people. And

846
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.520
I think that we appreciate
it and folks can check

847
00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.330
out your blog@ozlemcon.net. And I
will put all those links

848
00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.000
up on the show notes.
And this has been another

849
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.670
episode of Hansel minutes, and
I'll see you again next

850
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.910
week.
