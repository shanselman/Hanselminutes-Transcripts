00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.540
Problem hanselminutes.com. It's Hanselman. It's
our weekly discussion with web

2
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.670
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

3
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.590
number 551. In this episode,
Scott talks with digital ocean

4
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.190
product engineer. Yhonnie eco to
Google about working in both

5
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:41.370
design and development. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

6
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
another episode of Hansel minutes
today. I'm talking with <inaudible>.

7
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.760
He is a software engineer
at digital ocean. How are

8
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.250
you sir? Doing well, Scott,
how are you doing? I'm

9
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.780
feeling pretty good. And I'm
happy to chat with you

10
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.010
today. You, you posed a
really interesting question on Twitter

11
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.180
about this idea of should
developers design. And it was

12
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.610
funny when I saw that,
because I thought I usually

13
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.130
see people saying should designers
code. Yeah. Yeah. Like I

14
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.580
definitely wanted to think about
that question because primarily because

15
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.870
you know, a lot of
people are like, Oh, should

16
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.480
designers code. And that's like
the running joke, but nobody

17
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.890
really reverses the question says,
Oh, should developers design? And

18
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.080
you know, it's funny because
I have like a background

19
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.740
in computer science and both
computer science and graphic design.

20
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.920
So I wanted to like
really posit that question. And

21
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.410
a lot of people are
like, yes, but why aren't

22
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.280
we pushing more developers to
be more interested in design

23
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610
or improving the design skills?
Well, I think that some

24
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.400
people think, and we're just
generalizing here, but I think

25
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.250
some people think that designers
have a design ability that

26
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.540
somehow is innate. Like you're,
you're born knowing design, and

27
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.860
then you hone it through
education while anybody can learn

28
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.750
how to code. Like, I
feel like I have no

29
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.500
design ability, so I'm a
lost cause. Hmm. Yeah. I

30
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.840
mean, I guess I, I
mean, I guess that could

31
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.210
be the case, but to
be honest, like with anything

32
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.060
it's just a matter of
practice, right? Like nobody came

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.280
out of the womb, the
innate ability to learn how

34
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.010
to like, program. Right. And
even when me, like, I'm

35
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.140
not really, I could have
been an artist, but even

36
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.800
doing design education, even from
like before I started doing

37
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.410
design and is looking at
what, like I was designing

38
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.050
in terms of applications or
user interfaces. And then what

39
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.950
I can produce afterwards does
a dramatic difference in like

40
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.790
the quality and all the
theoretical concepts I learned from

41
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.580
it because he learned the
fundamentals that help you build

42
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.750
better products and design better
products. Now, when we say

43
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.590
design, just like saying, you
know, software or engineering, that's,

44
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.260
it's one of those words
that can explode into a

45
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.610
million different words, a design.
I think if it's just

46
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.730
like the innate ability to
make something pretty like, but

47
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.780
what are the, you know,
what are the kind of

48
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.850
the components of design when
you think about it in

49
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.550
the context of making software
In the context of making

50
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.680
software? I think about design
being not only like a

51
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.690
lot of people may think
of it only as aesthetics

52
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.940
and like, you know, making
things look pretty, but it's

53
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.450
also centered around, you know,
to use there. And in

54
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.680
building products, you want to
build delightful user experiences for

55
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.760
your customers or your end
users. And that being there

56
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.850
is like the flow of
the application, how it performs

57
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.680
or to more accessible design
patterns like <inaudible> or accessibility

58
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.280
is very important as well.
Whenever you're also being like

59
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.630
building out products, Right? So
if you think about design

60
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.500
in the context of like
painting or drawing, you know,

61
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.410
they teach us about color
and shape and form, and

62
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.590
they use terms like harmony.
But when you start thinking

63
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.600
about user interface design, it's
more about a flow through

64
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.730
time. How does someone use
this as they move from

65
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.940
screen to screen, to screen
Affordances and all that, a

66
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.760
good book to read, to
get a good sense of

67
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.300
design and even design terminologies,
the design of everyday things

68
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.540
and is really good at
teaching like core concepts of

69
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.560
like design and even human
center design from a physical

70
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.880
product standpoint, but it can
also be revamped or applied

71
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.090
to digital products. Well, you
know, that's a really great

72
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.180
point, right? The design of
everyday things is a classic

73
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.590
classic book by Donald Norman. And
one of the great examples

74
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.410
in that book is the
idea of where they push

75
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.360
you. You know, when you're
opening a door, I hate

76
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.030
that so much. Tell us
about the door, yo. So

77
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.870
what the door, you know,
whenever you see a door

78
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.930
and you think you see
as like a handle, but

79
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.420
then cross it all the
way and you didn't get

80
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.570
like, Oh, you're supposed to
like push for whatever, but

81
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.320
then you end up like,
you know, you end up

82
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.900
pushing it, it doesn't open.
You ended up having to

83
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.730
pull it. Or if at
the same way, if you

84
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.980
have a door that has
a natural handle, like a

85
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.320
curved handle, you may think
like, okay, let me pull

86
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.510
open this door. But it's
like, Oh no, just kidding.

87
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.820
You have to actually push
it. And it's like, those

88
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.640
things that are, you may
like, you know, you may

89
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.550
not think that it's like
user hostile, but you know,

90
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.220
your brain has a certain
context of like the way

91
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.440
to interact with these products
or not products are these

92
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.540
like yeah. And you just
get confused by it. Right.

93
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.780
And it's like, you know,
and it's, it's frustrating. And

94
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.640
a lot of times, you
know, you, a lot of

95
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.730
times it's frustrating in a
sense that you can notice

96
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.670
when something's bad, but you
know, something is good design

97
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.190
whenever it goes unnoticed. Right.
A lot of things that

98
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.440
make your life easy to
use are just dead simple

99
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.050
to use. You know, you
don't ever really reflect on

100
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.100
it. It's just like there
in the background. So, yeah.

101
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.160
Right. I think that there's
a great example in the

102
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.200
design of everyday things where
they talk about the difference

103
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.250
between a product that satisfies
the customer. Like they just

104
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.640
feel good about the product
while another one frustrates them,

105
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.930
but they can't, they can't
express why they're frustrated. They

106
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.170
just know that they are.
Yeah. And I think that

107
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.810
it's really difficult when you're
trying to design software, because

108
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.060
now that software seems really,
really easy and accessible people

109
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.450
who are not programmers are
not, designers will try to

110
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.010
try to tell you how
they want it. They don't,

111
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.890
I'll put the button over
here. Right. And that's not

112
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.870
the, that's not the feedback
that I'm looking for from

113
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.370
a customer. I don't want
them to tell me where

114
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.520
to put the button. You
know what I mean? You

115
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.620
want them to be able
to give you in depth

116
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.420
feedback, like saying, so I
know in critique, in design

117
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.840
school, whenever we're doing critique,
my professor banned the words,

118
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.750
I like this. Or I
don't like this. You want

119
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.330
to say, I think this
is successful because X, Y,

120
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.180
and Z, right? On the
other hand, like, or I

121
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.240
think this fall short is
not successful because of X,

122
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.220
Y, and Z. And when
it comes to giving feedback,

123
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.510
that kind of feedback is
important when building products, they're

124
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.440
like, Oh, I think this
is really confusing for the

125
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.490
user because you're forcing them
to memorize two main things

126
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.940
and like between the different
screens and it may not

127
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.250
be the most optimal experience
for them, or, yeah. Yeah.

128
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.770
We talked about concept count.
And even whenever, like thinking

129
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.230
about it, there was another
like application I used to

130
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.620
work on or like a
project at my previous job.

131
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.190
I remember prime example was,
Oh, I used to go

132
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.770
to this page and we
wanted to like prompt them

133
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.010
to sign up. But then
somebody, like after they would

134
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.740
close out the modal that
says like, Hey, register for

135
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.610
an account. Like somebody made
a choice of saying like,

136
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.880
Hey, 10, 10 to 15
seconds later have had that

137
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.270
modal reappear. Again, I'm just
like, that's user hostile because

138
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.350
it's nagging and that's not
successful because it nags the

139
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.310
user, obscures them from taking
into content. And that is

140
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.740
how you drive users away
from your website and your

141
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.020
product. It did not go
on, go to your product

142
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.400
if they know, is this
going to be nagging them

143
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.200
to sign up if they
don't want to sign up?

144
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.790
You know, one thing I
think that's interesting when developers

145
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.960
start thinking about design, is
we, the developer minded person,

146
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.830
we start looking for rules,
right? We love rules. Remember

147
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.620
we used to say, people
don't scroll. And then of

148
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.350
course we solve that problem
by putting scroll wheels on

149
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.080
every mouse. Right? So now
the, the people don't scroll,

150
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.100
put everything above the fold
rule doesn't necessarily apply. Right?

151
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.910
And then we made the
three click rule where it's

152
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.370
like, you know, every page
has to be three clicks

153
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.220
away from any other page.
And we would just, these,

154
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.840
we tell each other these
rules, but we have no

155
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.510
proof that this is a
rule Or nurses sit no

156
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.960
a stats to back it
up. You know, I saw

157
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.730
this really interesting article at,
at UX booth that talked

158
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.360
about how people insist on
using click counting to decide

159
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.940
if something is a good
design or not. And he

160
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.860
had this great analogy. I'm
wondering what you think about

161
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.860
this. He says, we shouldn't
be using click counting. We

162
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.710
should think about it in
terms of cycling. If you're

163
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.100
riding your bike and you're
in a good gear and

164
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.410
you're going up a Hill,
you're doing a difficult thing.

165
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.430
Maybe you have to peddle
faster, but each pedal turn

166
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.190
takes less effort. I'm thinking
about going through online or

167
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.160
on my app that might
involve lots of swiping and

168
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.820
moving. But if it's intuitive,
those turns of the pedal

169
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.300
don't really hurt. Well, if
it's like, I'm staring at

170
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.190
it, trying to figure out
what to push or what

171
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.770
to swipe or which way
to swipe it does hurt.

172
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.350
So I like that idea
that we should maybe stop

173
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.800
counting so much and start
thinking about how it feels.

174
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.670
Yeah. I think that's a,
I think that's very important

175
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.030
too. I like that quote,
to be honest, because once

176
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.090
again, you know, it ties
back to what I said

177
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.940
earlier. Right? Bad design. You
get really frustrated with it,

178
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.790
but something's just natural. Like
I know something that was

179
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.510
kind of, or foreign to
me in the sense was

180
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.170
whenever I had friends that
had an iPhone, wherever it

181
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.840
came out to seeing all
these applications, I think one

182
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.360
is called, is like clear
back. It was like a,

183
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.790
to do app or something,
but it had a lot

184
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.090
of like, it's UX was
primarily focused around these gestures

185
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.720
and to add things or
even an inbox by Google

186
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.510
or other mailbox apps like,
Oh, swipe left to like

187
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.290
our child archive it or
our swipe, right. To like,

188
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.320
you know, send it to
the trash or Mark has

189
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.610
done and everything like that.
But I think it's just,

190
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.690
you, it feels easier because
especially with, I think I

191
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.830
liked that because rather than
memorizing clicks or if it

192
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.010
just flows, naturally users will
get used to like, get

193
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.710
into groove of things. Right.
Like just have the effort

194
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.100
of cycling. It seems like
easy and straightforward. And like,

195
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.820
not that painful or stressful
on your muscles, like, like

196
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.180
memorizing how to use like
an interface through muscle memory

197
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.780
and everything like that. Through
gestures, I think sticks more

198
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.950
than clicking just because we're
clicking is just a very,

199
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.270
I don't know, it seems
very binary, right? Tap down,

200
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.200
tap up where I have
like movement and like, just

201
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.540
like whenever it comes to
writing and like, I don't

202
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.670
know, I don't even speak
any of the like Eastern

203
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.430
languages, but like a lot
of my friends would I'd

204
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.800
see them studying for Chinese
exams and what they would

205
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.480
be doing. They'd just be
using their fingers to draw

206
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.330
characters in the air and
associating those finger movements with

207
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.300
each characters. I think there's
something inherent to that movement

208
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.200
that allows you to memorize
how to use things better,

209
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.970
at least in term. And
like, I'm just thinking from

210
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.120
a mobile perspective primarily. Right,
right. Right. The word for

211
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.560
that is kinesthetic learning. It's
the idea that it's tactile

212
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.370
learning. So it's where by
moving your body, you're basically

213
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.700
remembering it better. This is
the thing that people do

214
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.310
when they take notes, but
they never read the notes.

215
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.370
We had that situation. It's
the moving of your body

216
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.890
that helps you remember it.
But that application that you

217
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.560
bring up, it was called
clear or clear tasks. It's

218
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.500
from real Mac software. That
was one of the first

219
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.540
to do apps that was
like swipe here, swipe left.

220
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.280
It was before Tinder and
all that kind of stuff.

221
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.600
A good example of this,
it takes a say, take

222
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.730
something that would ordinarily be
difficult. It makes it intuitive.

223
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.090
But at the same time,
if everyone starts doing it,

224
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.830
then it becomes a chore.
If they don't do consistently,

225
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.680
I'll give you an example.
I've got the app inbox

226
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.520
for my Gmail. Yep. And
I've got outlook for my

227
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.910
work email on my iPhone.
Okay. Well, on one of

228
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.420
them, swipe left does archive
on the other one swipe.

229
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.130
Right. Does archive. Oh, wow.
Oh no. That's like a,

230
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:16.140
Yeah, exactly. Oh, wow. Yeah.
So, and it's hard, right?

231
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.340
Because there's no set patterns
on it, but you know,

232
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.110
like people go against the
norms and that's why I

233
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.350
guess having standards is like
kind of important in a

234
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.770
sense it's extremely important. Apple
has their, like a human

235
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:34.950
interface guidelines. Google's like evolve
material designs. Those concepts have

236
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:40.740
been like the main guiding
principle around applications. And yeah.

237
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.220
Do you think though, that
these guidelines, I mean, it

238
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.860
doesn't feel like we innovate
and we confuse the user

239
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.530
and then we standardize and
then we standardized for bit,

240
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.240
and then we go and
confuse them again by trying

241
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.420
some new concept, like three
D touch is really confusing

242
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.330
me because I never know
how hard to push, you

243
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.400
know, to get the thing
to work. Yeah. That's a

244
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.850
good point. Very good point.
I think it can be

245
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.690
kind of confusing to the
user, especially if not everybody

246
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.330
uses like three D touch,
right? Like, like, Oh, I

247
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.590
wonder if this has like
three D touch support and

248
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:15.120
you've like, tried to do
it. And you're like, Oh

249
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.180
wait, it doesn't, you know,
it's kind of disappointing, but

250
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.520
you know, I don't know.
It's hard for me to

251
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.220
speak on that, to be
honest. Where do you think

252
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.320
if you're right now, you
live in a world where

253
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.890
you have a developer, your
developer, your professional developer, but

254
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.040
you also have a background
in design. They always joke

255
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.920
about the unicorn out there,
the right, the developer who

256
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.500
can design or the designer
who can develop. Does that

257
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.290
mean that if you can
speak both languages, that you

258
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.530
can be the bridge between
the developers and the designer?

259
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.390
No. Actually describe myself as
a bridge between developers and

260
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.820
designers, because a lot of
times things get lost in

261
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.800
the middle, like in terms
of communication. And, you know,

262
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.700
I've seen situations where designers
build out these really ambitious

263
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.180
user interfaces. And like, they
may like, you know, they

264
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.220
may have a visual design
background and not a product

265
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.630
design background. And so it
may look really amazing and

266
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.030
be very ambitious, but then
like, you know, developers, like

267
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.920
what the heck we can't
do this. Or even if

268
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.020
we did, it's not worth
like the effort. Cause it's

269
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.900
like really complicated. So it's
like, and like, but they're

270
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.830
not really communicating that well
to the designer. And then

271
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.860
the designers like, Oh wait,
this isn't like, why doesn't

272
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.760
this look exactly like the
mock and like, yeah. Well,

273
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.260
and what I think happens
though, is that when you

274
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.860
have those back and forth,
it makes developers and project

275
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.290
managers feel like there's friction
now. It's like, wow, you're

276
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.750
just slowing us down. And
it seems like the first

277
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.750
one that gets kicked out
is the designer. Yeah. I

278
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.860
definitely, and I don't know.
I think it's because that's,

279
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.230
that's a good point in
the sense that I don't

280
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.130
know, probably because we're engineers,
I guess, supply and demand.

281
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.460
Like they're very high in
demand, even though there's a

282
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.390
huge demand for designers as
well, But doesn't it feel

283
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.460
like the, that we know
that we need the developer

284
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.430
because they're the one that
pushes deploy. Yeah. So, so

285
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.470
ultimately like the designer we
don't care about, cause we've

286
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.010
seen a lot of really
poorly designed, you know, websites

287
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.320
out there. It just seems
like, and it also seems

288
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.840
like there's design culture, right?
Like it's clear that Apple

289
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.840
products seem, seem to, as
a general rule, you know,

290
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.660
value design maybe more than,
than Google products because it's

291
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.300
at there, it's in their
DNA. Yep. Yeah. I think

292
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.870
it's also in the last
six years, like maybe, maybe

293
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.410
even like longer than that,
but I guess six years

294
00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.720
is just how long I've
been. Like the industry since

295
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.810
I got to college design
really didn't come to prominence

296
00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.080
until like, I guess probably
the last six years or

297
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.460
so maybe even 2008, at
least digital product design, because

298
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.460
we can all remember like,
you know, how websites from

299
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.160
back in the late two
thousands look like and how

300
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.240
they like interacted with, but
really the game started changing,

301
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.730
I think with the release
of the iPhone and even

302
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:59.140
like these like touchscreen smart,
like smart phones, just because,

303
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.690
you know, it changed the
nature of how we interact

304
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:06.640
with products. Well, it introduced,
it introduced a personal relationship

305
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.530
with a thing. Like right
now I don't really feel

306
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.680
a personal relationship with web
sites, but somehow when I'm

307
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.010
sitting there with just me
and my little phone, it's

308
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.040
my brain, it's my portable
pocket supercomputer. And I really

309
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.950
care if, and if you
move my cheese, like man

310
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.190
who moved my cheese, like
why does this behave like

311
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.740
this? Then I, I care
more viscerally than as Bo

312
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.730
as opposed to a web
website visit another site. Yeah,

313
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.840
definitely. And that makes a
really good sense. And it's

314
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.060
just interesting to see how
the mobile, like, you know,

315
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.660
the introduction of mobile DS
you at like UX patterns

316
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.270
or there are new UX
patterns invented, like rather than

317
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.360
pressing, like, you know, a
button to refresh. You have

318
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.560
like pull down to refresh
rather than having email, at

319
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.160
least on Android devices typing
in on a keyboard. You

320
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.820
now can have like swiping
for input and everything like

321
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.560
that as well. So just
like really changed the nature

322
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.340
of the game that like
from, and I'm only like

323
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.130
24. So I don't even
know how like much it

324
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.050
changed, but it's changed a
lot from since when I

325
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.660
was a little kid to
now, Well it changed. I

326
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.540
can tell as someone who's
almost double that age, I

327
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.740
can tell you that things
design, design elements will come

328
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.120
up like the hamburger menu
and someone will say, Oh,

329
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.370
look at that. There's a
hamburger menu. And then like,

330
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.700
that's the thing, that's the
hammer that we all needed.

331
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.500
Yeah. We know what I
mean. Like we were waiting

332
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.420
for a tool and someone
had been at the hamburger

333
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.200
menu and now everything looks
like a nail and we're

334
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.920
hammering in screws and rivets
and all kinds of things

335
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.780
that don't need to be
hammered because we just got

336
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.880
a new tool. And then
of course another tool will

337
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.650
come out and that might
be three D touch or

338
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:50.130
swipe thing or whatever. Yeah,
definitely. Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. So

339
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.860
Where do you think that
design is going to converge?

340
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.560
Are we going to see
that mobile websites and mobile

341
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.440
apps are going to use
the same design language? You

342
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.530
know, I'm not sure. Where
does design go into conferred

343
00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.910
website and mobile apps? We've
seen responsive apps, right? You've

344
00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.610
done responsive. Mobile will always
be ahead of web. To

345
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.540
be honest, I feel like
Why is that? I'm surprised

346
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.370
that you say that because
I feel that the web

347
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.230
kind of leads in design
Depends, right? Because I've tried

348
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.860
to design a website, a
website that's like, you know,

349
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.400
or leaking a web app
that's mobile first and it's

350
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.770
doable. But at the same
time, like it will go

351
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.320
once again, it goes back
to these like gestures and

352
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.120
these complex user interactions. It's
not as easy to create

353
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.050
those into browser. Like are
at least, you know, out

354
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.450
of the box as is
to do in a native

355
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.260
mobile application. But you know,
it may, it may be

356
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.180
getting better. And if you're
like, you know, you have

357
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.660
framework or like technologies like
react native. Like, you know,

358
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.210
whether, even though it's like,
not exactly the same, but

359
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.880
like you still able to
use the same framework or

360
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.640
library that you're using to
build your web apps, to

361
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.370
build your mobile applications as
well. That is a really

362
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.380
interesting point. I have been
talking, I've talking to people

363
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.840
and a lot of people
feel that that react native

364
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.480
is kind of going to
sneak up on the internet.

365
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.390
Like people who know they,
they know, they know react

366
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.850
native is great, but, but
other people will say react,

367
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.820
gosh, what what's that about?
And people are saying that

368
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:25.010
react and catalogs of react
parts yeah. Are going to

369
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.910
become extremely popular or very,
very soon. Yeah. And to

370
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.860
be honest, you can find
a react component for like

371
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.070
pretty much anything that you
need nowadays, you know, and

372
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.360
it is just amazing to
see how in such like

373
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.720
in just a couple years,
react has like blown up

374
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.720
in terms of popularity. But
I think design development also

375
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.840
gone converged because something we
haven't really talked about is

376
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.400
like, for example, you got
augmented reality, like Pokemon go

377
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.300
and even virtual reality as
well. Like with VR being

378
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.510
a whole nother, like, you
know, the future, this is

379
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.400
going to be a really
good, like a really huge

380
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.800
convergence because you know, you
have to need to have

381
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.260
your three D modeling and
like VR is going to

382
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.710
change how we going to
do what the like smartphones

383
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.750
did back in like 2008
or whenever the iPhone was

384
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.020
released, it's going to change
the nature of UX. Again.

385
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.780
That is interesting that you
say that because actually for

386
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.960
folks that are listening and
maybe listened last last month,

387
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.350
we had Scott Anderson who was
a virtual reality and augmented

388
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.820
reality game designer and people
are really still discovering what

389
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.640
what's even possible. Just like,
if you remember when the

390
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.770
iPhone first came out, people
said it would be a

391
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.640
lousy platform for mobile games
because no one had figured

392
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.760
out how to move their
fingers. Right. So people said,

393
00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.380
Oh, will I be able
to play call of duty

394
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.660
on my iPhone? And they're
like, well, no, of course

395
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.850
not because how would you
have your fingers? And we

396
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.140
were, we remember how we
used to put like super

397
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.250
Nintendo fake virtual buttons on
the screen. Yep. And they

398
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.190
like, okay, well maybe, maybe
it'll work like this. And

399
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.280
then they've, they've found their
way to a metaphor that

400
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.980
worked the people, I guess,
in the VR and AR

401
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:08.140
world are, are poking at
different, different interfaces. And we

402
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.700
don't know yet what it's
going to look like, but

403
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.530
like you're saying, if they
get it right, it's going

404
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.670
to change everything. Yeah. And
I think, I don't know.

405
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.670
I think it's like once
VR or virtual reality becomes

406
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.390
more accessible, then we'll start
seeing more and more people

407
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.340
getting into it. You know?
I don't know. It's just

408
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.710
hard for me to say
without it being so mainstream.

409
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.220
Cause certainly It costs me
less than $3,000. Yeah. I

410
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.930
don't even have any, I
don't have a virtual reality

411
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.340
had to say I've dabbled
with it, like tech events

412
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.130
and all that. But you
know, I don't have really

413
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.920
deep pockets deep enough. It's
an interesting point because I

414
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.740
think that for a lot
of people, when the iPhone

415
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.720
or the iPad first came
out and it was expensive,

416
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.880
people dabbled with these devices
and they said, all right,

417
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.340
well, that's cute, but I've
got my, my flip, my

418
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.580
got my flip phone or
whatever. And then I've, I

419
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.560
know that I tried an
Oculus a couple of years

420
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.780
ago and I thought to
myself, all right, that's cool,

421
00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.130
but I don't really have
the money. And I don't

422
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.260
want to spend that money
on that. But one of

423
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.140
these days it's going to
be it, whatever it is,

424
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.540
the new thing, it will
be 300 bucks and it'll

425
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.210
be at best buy and
I'll pick it up and

426
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.730
it'll be amazing, but we're
not going to see how

427
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.750
hard the designers and developers
worked to, to make that

428
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.850
happen. Yeah. And actually, I
guess like, since we're on

429
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.160
topic, you work on Microsoft
y'all demo in a really

430
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.040
cool piece of technology. Like
the hollow lens. That was

431
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.140
pretty like pretty darn cool.
Yeah. It is. It's $3,000

432
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.310
though, right? Yeah. Funny. I
don't have again. No, exactly.

433
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.110
But I hear what you're
saying. Like that's an example

434
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.960
where designers and developers are
on the edge of an

435
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.900
idea and they're poking at
that edge of the envelope

436
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.370
to see if they can,
if they can break it

437
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:46.470
or what, what the right
metaphor is. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

438
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.960
So are, what kind of
apps are you working on

439
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.450
primarily? Are you working on
mobile apps or web, Oh

440
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.270
no. Web web. Most, we
don't really have that many

441
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.630
like mobile apps at the
O to be honest, But

442
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.210
do you, don't you make
those mobile first or responsive

443
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.770
so they can at least
load on us on a

444
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.360
phones website or web browser?
Yeah, We do. To be

445
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.090
honest, like, I don't think
we have a lot of

446
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.940
mobile visitors, but all of
our apps do scale down

447
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.850
to a mobile device. I
believe at least the product

448
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.520
I work on. I know
that it does Because you

449
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.950
insisted or is that why
did it, Oh, no, I

450
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.410
don't know. I inherited it.
And luckily it was, it

451
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.230
worked on mobile. So now
there have been situations where

452
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.600
we are adding new features
and we had like, okay,

453
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.690
or we've seen other parts
of the application that aren't

454
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.760
mobile first and we're like,
Oh, okay, well, or not

455
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.910
even aren't responsive. Sorry. And
we're like, okay, well we

456
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.760
have to make this responsive.
So we go like, you

457
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.550
know, just have a brainstorming
session with our designer and

458
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.190
she lets us know or
she whips up something really

459
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.770
quick. Really? And yeah, we
bought it out. How often

460
00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:51.100
does your work? I was
going to say kind of

461
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.790
butt up against hers, but
if she there's, there's that

462
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.710
bright line between she is
the designer, you are the

463
00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.370
developer. Does she give you
designs? And then you just

464
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.560
simply have to take them
or because you can bridge

465
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.920
that gap. Do you maybe
collaborate a little bit more?

466
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.710
We collaborate a lot. We,
I don't even know, like,

467
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.230
you know, we do eat
per pair programming, right. Oh,

468
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.360
interesting. Do you have pair
programming between the developer and

469
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.480
the designer? Because a lot
of times, like when, after

470
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:21.010
we're done implementing her designs
or something, if there comes

471
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.840
around a feed, but like,
I think the rule of

472
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.230
thumb that we settled on
was if it goes back

473
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.570
and forth, like more than
three or four times in

474
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.000
terms of feedback rounds that
we should just take, like

475
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.720
schedule a meeting and pair
together on implementing feedback in

476
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.420
real time. Because otherwise it's
just gone. It's not going

477
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.970
to be the best use
of time. Right. Because it's

478
00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.000
going to, it's going to
be asynchronous, but rather like

479
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.570
asynchronous, isn't the best for
everything. It just like is

480
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.910
good to pair up and
be like, all right, let's

481
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.590
fix this out. And that
way, since we're working together,

482
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.830
she like, she knows that
it's good to go and

483
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.570
I don't even have to
wait for a review. I

484
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.840
can just ship it after
we're done. Are you as

485
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.740
a developer enabled to make
design decisions or changes, if

486
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.560
you think that something shipped
with the wrong design or

487
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.330
do you take it back
to the designer? And then

488
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.220
To be honest, like, I
don't really tweak designs, but

489
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.910
like if I see something
that makes me feel uneasy,

490
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.660
I know I, that I
will like ask her, like

491
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.490
ask our designer about it.
Like, Hey, what do you

492
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.270
think about this? I don't
know. It doesn't feel right

493
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.400
to me, but then like,
you know, she'll ask me

494
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.440
why and I'll give my
rationale. I don't think it's

495
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.780
like work doesn't work well
for these reasons. And most

496
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.280
of the time we'll think
through together, she's like, Hm,

497
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.840
what do you think we
should do? She's like, how

498
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.960
about, what if we did
this? And you know, we'll

499
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.870
talk it out and sometimes
will be like, okay, nah,

500
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.510
maybe this is like the
most optimal way. But then

501
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.760
sometimes like, we're both like,
Oh yeah. I think like

502
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.910
we like this way better.
And we like continue on

503
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.840
You think that someone who's
listening, who is a developer

504
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.260
on the way to a,
to work should do in

505
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.390
order to become a better
designer. Cause they may have

506
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.030
long ago decided that they're
just never going to be

507
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:12.640
a great designer. What should
I do? I think probably

508
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.480
to be a better designer.
I think everybody has the

509
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.210
ability to at least like
be a designer. You may

510
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.100
not be building like the
next Apple app of the

511
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.260
year, but you, I think
everybody can at least develop

512
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.470
taste to tell like whether
something is good or something

513
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.970
is like bad. It's interesting.
The way that you phrase

514
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.080
that, like, I don't think
you meant it to be

515
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.600
funny, but I was like,
well, you all could at

516
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.800
least become somewhat, you know,
what's the word literate it's

517
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.860
I literally, Yeah, no. So
like, I don't know. There's

518
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.860
always the running joke, right?
Like when, whenever an engineer

519
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.040
develops and are like an
interface, did this add a

520
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.320
new button for every single
new feature that they want?

521
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.880
You know, It's absolutely right.
Because we all joke about

522
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.420
the, the developer who tried
to design an app and

523
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.700
we look at those apps
and they are full of

524
00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:09.830
text boxes and bad colors,
Buttons, and like for everything

525
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.470
rather than trying to simplify
it and group the like

526
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.600
actions together. But yeah, I
think like really try to

527
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.250
develop taste for those working
on web or even mobile.

528
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:26.060
It's really important to understand
like something like typography, excessive.

529
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:32.960
Yup, yup. Kerning tracking, letting
all that good stuff. Accessibility.

530
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.870
And I think another good
book to read outside of

531
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.530
a design of everyday things
is called it's called don't

532
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.980
make me think by Steve
crew. I think it was

533
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.260
the name. That's a really
good book to read, especially

534
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.320
for those on the web.
That's a really good book

535
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.540
to read to just to
like get a taste of

536
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.070
UX. Right. Don't make me
think is about this idea

537
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.730
of a common sense approach
to usability so that the

538
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.130
users can just do their
job. And that gets back

539
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.110
to the beginning of the
conversation where we were talking

540
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.130
about that, that friction, right.
That, that they, the analogy

541
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.770
I used about the bicycle.
Right. Yeah. Make it, make

542
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.440
it easy. Don't make them
have to, to jump through

543
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.090
any hoops. Just they want
to get their jobs done.

544
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.840
Yeah, exactly. That's actually a
very short book. In fact,

545
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.360
really it's a very easy,
very easy reads. Maybe a

546
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.910
couple hundred pages. Yeah. Like
running a couple of days,

547
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.710
it was pretty straight forward
and there's lots of good

548
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:29.000
like illustrations as well to
illustrate the concepts. So don't

549
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.010
make me think as one
we said the design of

550
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:36.230
everyday thing is another one
And grid systems like actually

551
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.780
really, I mean, actually to
be honest, like whenever I

552
00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.460
redesigned my website, I had
been reading a lot on

553
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:49.040
grid systems. Recently there's a
book on grid systems by

554
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.800
this Swedish, Swedish or German.
It's really good. It's just

555
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.100
called grid systems and like
graphic design or something. Right,

556
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.930
Right. Yeah. That's by Yosef
Mueller. Broccoli. Yeah. And that's

557
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.300
a really good book to
read and thinking grids, like

558
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.690
once you start learning about
grids, you'll be able to

559
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.290
like, like the way I
think about a user interface,

560
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.750
I try to break it
down and see if there's

561
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.450
an underlying grid with it.
And you know, frameworks like

562
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.510
on the web, like, you
know, bootstrap, it became popular

563
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.190
just because it made it
easy to build out these

564
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.670
like UIs. But even though
I'm a daily mail look

565
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.920
the same, but still have
a concept of a grid

566
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.130
underneath it. And the greatest
like will do wonders for

567
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.430
designing, like just being able
to mock something out and

568
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.350
break it up into a
grid to make sure all

569
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.930
of your elements are aligned
together. And just like, you

570
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.370
know, everything's uniform, like it
goes a long way May

571
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.960
seem like nip, like minor
nitpicky details. But it actually

572
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.170
is very important. That's actually
funny that you bring up

573
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.700
something like that because here
we are in 2016 talking

574
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.860
about mobile design on pocket
supercomputers, and you mentioned the

575
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.910
grid system. And I started
thinking about CSS grids and

576
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.370
grid systems and you know,
bootstrap and things you can

577
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.160
download. But the book that
you referenced, which is about

578
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.940
grids in design grid systems
and graphic design is by

579
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.700
a person who was born
in 1914. Mueller Brockman has

580
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.550
been dead for dead for
20 years, but that, that

581
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:24.160
kind of classic design was,
was standards, grid systems in

582
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.580
the forties and fifties apply.
Even now I'm on the

583
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.860
web and that's why it's
important. That's why I majored

584
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.860
in graphic design. Right. Because
even though it may be

585
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.010
a whole different medium, the
concepts of the core concepts

586
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.720
are still what makes somebody
a better designer and allows

587
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.020
them to develop better taste
as well. So it really

588
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.790
is like the fundamental as
it may seem like, Oh,

589
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.040
why would I learn about
grit? It's like, why is

590
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.860
this? Like, I'm not in
geometry class, but no, really

591
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.560
like, we'll help you design
since a lot. And most

592
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.510
people, I know, even a
lot of our designers work

593
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:59.130
with like grids, even thinking
about wire framing, right? Like

594
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.770
if it's like a very
like broken down version or

595
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.440
a simplified version of laying
things out into a grid.

596
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.670
So actually I'll end on
reminding you of another great

597
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.520
book called thinking with type
it out books kind of

598
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.480
dry. So you have a
better, a better topography book

599
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.670
because I feel like that's
the best one out there.

600
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.500
It's not awful. There's just
feels like the, one of

601
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.610
the elements of typographic style
thing of what types of

602
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:28.410
good one my bad. Okay.
Okay. Is the elements of

603
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.360
typographic style is, is a,
is a little older book,

604
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.050
but the idea that, you
know, like understanding fonts on

605
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.240
understanding how white space should
be used, you know, it's

606
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.220
amazing how you'll show up
on a website and it'll

607
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.770
just have a white background
and a gorgeous font, but

608
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.510
somehow you'll just feel good
about it. Like if you

609
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.350
think about medium.com yup. It
almost has no design at

610
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.680
all, but we know it's
we know it's awesome works.

611
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.220
Yeah. It's like works out
simple. Like I think a

612
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.100
lot of things nowadays are
over engineered or just over

613
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.310
designed, but I'm like, I'm
glad we're like brutalism or

614
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:04.540
even just dislike returned back
to simplicity in a sense.

615
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.840
And topography as a UI,
like as a UX, like

616
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.960
the tight, like the content
and the type defined a

617
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.160
hierarchy in terms of like
your websites or applications. But

618
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.610
it's interesting. Well, thanks so
much for chatting with me

619
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.430
today. No problem. Appreciate it.
And you can check out

620
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.510
<inaudible> on his own podcast
called two black nerds.com. So

621
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.310
be sure to check that
out. And we have been

622
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.640
collecting links and mentioning books
and I promise I will

623
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.190
put all of those links
and books in the show

624
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.010
notes. So very cool. Thanks
a lot. Awesome. No, thank

625
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.770
you, Scott. I appreciate it.
This has been another episode

626
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.870
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
