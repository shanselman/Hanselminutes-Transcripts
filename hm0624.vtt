Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

11
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.300
Hansel minutes today. I've got
a very special show for

12
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
you. I'm talking with Kent
Sullivan and Derek coin. They

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.690
are user research and UX
consultants, and they're currently working

14
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.400
with be curious with us
great URL, be curious with

15
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.420
dot U S a. They
help teams and individuals develop

16
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.930
capabilities to make great user
experiences. But I want to

17
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.840
talk to you all about
history. Thanks for being with

18
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.150
me today. Hey, great to
be on the show, Scott.

19
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.660
Yeah, thanks God. So I'm
sitting here in front of

20
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.970
my windows machine. I'm running
windows 10 and then to

21
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.340
my right is my son's
Chromebook. And then I'll be

22
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.260
on that as an, a
boon to machine. And in

23
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.860
all instances, there's some button
in the corner that I

24
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.410
click on a, for a
lot of machines it's that

25
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.870
lower left corner. And for
other ones, they mix it

26
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.050
up, put it in another
upper left corner. I started

27
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.440
realizing that's ubiquitous. There's always
a start menu somewhere. So

28
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.290
I wanted to figure out
where that came from. Maybe

29
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.200
one of you could give
me a little background on

30
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.390
where did the start, when
you come from and where

31
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.660
were you when it happened?
Yeah, so Kent and I

32
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.060
were actually, so this is
Derek Kent and I were

33
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.890
actually some of the first
members of the user research

34
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.450
team at Microsoft. And so
we started in the late

35
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.570
eighties and at that time,
dos reign Supreme, at least

36
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.930
in the PC world, there
were some other, you know,

37
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.310
<inaudible> out and there was,
you know, other graphical UX

38
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.210
is in development. I should
say operating systems was shells

39
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.180
is the proper term of
the developer term that were

40
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.850
graphical. So Microsoft saw that
it kind of had work

41
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.780
to do to improve what
was going to be the

42
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.690
future of the operating system.
And so obviously like Microsoft

43
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.560
had had several versions of
windows already in development windows

44
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.880
3.0 was in beta when
Kent and I started. And

45
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.830
so we, we were wondering
like, well, where do we

46
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.830
start? You know, where do
we take Microsoft? There were

47
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.970
various efforts and different kind
of user testing efforts going

48
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.600
on kind of bootstrapping within
our group with different product

49
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.110
teams. But we knew that
the, that the real heart

50
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.400
of the battle was to
start to bring some user

51
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.920
feedback into the windows development
process. So, and can you

52
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.020
feel free to jump in
here at any time, but

53
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.900
we, you know, at some
point we were like, you

54
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.870
know what we need to
do. We need to start

55
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.130
kind of benchmarking where some
of the, where we're, where

56
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.660
we're at. And so we
started to put windows 3.0,

57
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.210
and then subsequently windows 3.1
in front of different users.

58
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.500
And we trusted everybody from
kids to grandmas. And you

59
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.290
have to remember at the
time there was a large

60
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.020
percentage of the population that
had never even used a

61
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.050
computer before. So we use
those people. We used developers.

62
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.790
I mean, so we had
re we really had the

63
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.620
range of capabilities and abilities
of people and experience with

64
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.620
computers. So we were putting
them in front of windows.

65
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.140
Then we also put them
in front of the Mac

66
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.140
and we started noticing some
patterns. And one of them

67
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.630
was the fact that people
generally, you know, obviously the

68
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.390
more advanced you got in
your computer know how you

69
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.110
could figure things out or,
you know, deduct certain things

70
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.860
if you were in an
unfamiliar environment, but for by

71
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.520
and large, if you were
new, you wouldn't know really

72
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.970
where to start. And so
we would give people a

73
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.270
task like, Hey, you know,
open up a note pad

74
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.240
or can jump in here.
Cause you were very familiar

75
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.860
with some of the tasks
that we were giving them.

76
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.470
No, it was really basic
stuff. Start notepad, openness, Microsoft

77
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.590
word, document, you know, draw
a picture and paint, really

78
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.690
easy stuff. And people were
just constantly relearning and would

79
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.360
get lost, you know, and
have multiple copies of the

80
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.390
same application open. It was
just way worse than we

81
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.870
thought, because basically up until
that point, the only people

82
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.140
using it more or less
were people who already had

83
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.240
a fair amount of computer
knowledge. And as Derek said,

84
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.200
we were really interested in
broadening who was using computers.

85
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.930
That was really not just
the mandate from management. Really

86
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.510
the whole company is like,
Hey, you know, computers are,

87
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.190
if we're going to get
one on every desktop and

88
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.750
every home we need to,
we've got a lot of

89
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.740
work to do <inaudible> and
windows 3.0, came out in

90
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.000
1990, but people were thinking
about windowing operating systems, you

91
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.370
know, long before that. But
I think in all of

92
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.980
those instances, when once a
window, whether it be mindscape

93
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.690
Minesweeper and notepad got to
be full screen that took

94
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.900
over and it felt like
Minesweeper was the operating system.

95
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.390
You couldn't find your way
back. And I don't suppose

96
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.010
hitting alt tab is very
intuitive. No one's going to

97
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.490
Ever discover it. That's in
the same category as control

98
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.670
delete. Unfortunately, It's just something
you pass on by telling

99
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.000
you, Right? And the discoverability
is something like that is

100
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.020
near zero. Remember that there
was talk when double-clicking became

101
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.690
a thing that people were
concerned. That double-clicking was a

102
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.050
bad idea because it itself
was not discoverable. I don't

103
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.450
remember reading a usability study
that said a monkey would

104
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.050
never intuitively DoubleClick, but a
monkey would take a mouse,

105
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.360
see how the mouse is
connected to the pointer. And

106
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.180
it would click a single
time. Right? If you look

107
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.790
at the psychology and human
development of all these things,

108
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.040
the things we call intuitive
tend to be the things

109
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.840
that we learned when we
were so young, we don't

110
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.680
remember learning them. All knowledge
is learned, you know, think

111
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.650
about how many hours baby
spend holding objects out in

112
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.600
front of them and turning
them in their hands and

113
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.900
that kind of spatial work.
So yeah, DoubleClick needs to

114
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.760
be learned. And once it's
learned it can be remembered.

115
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.460
Same thing with context venues,
right. There was a huge

116
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.050
controversy at Microsoft about whether
to put commands on that

117
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.660
right button, menu. And today
you don't even think about

118
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.760
it. Cause that's something that
people learn. The moment they

119
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.220
start using computers. But to
begin with, we were very,

120
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.740
very careful to only put
stuff there that was redundant

121
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.100
and that it could be
found somewhere else, visibly. Cause

122
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.680
it's basically hidden. Right. Right.
And that's interesting because that

123
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.770
makes me think about things
like iPads, where clearly touching

124
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.410
things is intuitive. And one
doesn't need to learn to

125
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.650
like take this magical bright
window and put it in

126
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.350
your hands and touch it.
But now we've got iPhone

127
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.260
Xs with like two fingers
swipe from the upper right.

128
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.450
Corner type, totally undiscoverable things
that we complain about today.

129
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.280
But tomorrow they might not
be a problem. Yeah. And

130
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.090
I think there's an assumption,
right. That these gestures yeah.

131
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.390
Like Ken was saying might
be intuitive or something, but

132
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.820
they aren't for, there's always
going to be a set

133
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.920
of people where they aren't.
And so usually gestures need

134
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.480
some sort of visual cue
first and then the gesture

135
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.970
can be learned and then
used as more of as

136
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.510
an accelerator. But you know,
so back to, you know,

137
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.880
the early days of windows,
like, you know, we were

138
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.050
coming from dos windows had
already kind of like again

139
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.230
had several versions, but there
was a lot to be

140
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.680
done in terms of bringing
user direct user feedback into

141
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.460
the development process. Right. So
that's kind of where we

142
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.070
came into the picture. And
actually there was a, I

143
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.940
think a broad acknowledgement at
Microsoft too, that windows could

144
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.050
be a ton better. So
there were several kind of

145
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.510
characters that we want to
introduce into the story here.

146
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.300
One of them was one
of the program managers of

147
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.860
windows 3.1, her name was
Liz Dunn. There was another

148
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.020
person Mark Malamud who became
one of the lead program

149
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.540
managers. And I guess you
could say was kind of

150
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.340
the first true interaction designer
at Microsoft. And he led

151
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.180
a new advanced windows team
that they were going to

152
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.860
call when X and then
who else was on that

153
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.430
team can Roy Levian. Right.
And, and so he was

154
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.240
a developer on windows as
well. And so the three

155
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.340
of them, and I think
probably a couple other people

156
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.910
had gotten together and started
to talk about, okay, what

157
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.230
could the future windows look
like? And they started paying

158
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.590
us for data to say,
what do you guys know?

159
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.110
What do we know about
windows? And then that's when

160
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.960
we had, I think, begun
and started to, you know,

161
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.420
started to collect data on
this, what we call our

162
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.190
benchmarking effort. And we found
that, you know, again, Mack

163
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.340
had the same problem that
people didn't know where to

164
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.430
start. In fact, on the
Mac, what was interesting is

165
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.580
that the Apple menu was
the place that people would

166
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.480
go repeatedly to say, start
a program or go find

167
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.690
a document or something like
that. Now the, the Apple

168
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.640
menu has gotten a lot
better over the years. It's

169
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.820
still not perfect. But back
then in the eighties, it

170
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.510
was a really weird collection
of things. None of which

171
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.230
were primary tasks. Yeah. I
had the font, da mover

172
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.700
control panel. I think shutdown
was always there setting up

173
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.630
your printer, you have printers
and stuff like that. It

174
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.080
was really a weird collection.
And we were like, wow,

175
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.390
you know, there's a bit
of an Achilles heel there.

176
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.610
And we were like, wow,
you know, we could definitely

177
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.940
do this better. And I
think Mark, Malamud he, and

178
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.430
some other people that had
done some studies of different

179
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.990
operating systems, like obviously they
looked at the star system

180
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.770
from Xerox park, which was
the predecessor to the Mac,

181
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.740
you know, that Steve jobs
had also seen, you know,

182
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.980
that was documented in the
book, fumbling the future. Anyway.

183
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.910
So he saw across these
different operating systems that there

184
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.840
were, was kind of a
persistent thing in the UI

185
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.230
where people could return to
which windows three Oh and

186
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.560
windows 3.0, did not have,
there was this thing called

187
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.970
file manager and program manager.
But if you were unlucky

188
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.940
unlucky enough to minimize them,
and there was no really

189
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.610
good animation that told you
where these things went, they

190
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.170
would just kind of collect
at the bottom of the

191
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:06.270
screen. Under these two, mr.
Is icons. People would generally

192
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.720
just think they just went
away and we saw that

193
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.760
over and over and over
again. And can't do you

194
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.580
want to give us some
anecdotes or anything from that?

195
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.570
It was a while we're
not cursing on this show,

196
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.410
but it was not pleasant.
And th th th exposing

197
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.750
the developers to windows of
that in the usability lab

198
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.910
is a super eyeopening for
them. Cause of course, it's

199
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.820
the same thing we see
today, right? Once you know,

200
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.760
something you can't, it's really
hard to take the viewpoint

201
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.500
of somebody who doesn't know
it. So they, people were

202
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.190
just amazed that, you know,
ordinary users were having these

203
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.340
kinds of problems, but specifically
the fact that when you

204
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.820
minimize things, they just disappear
and windows, unlike most of

205
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.520
the other gooeys at that
point, the desktop wasn't really

206
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.030
usable for anything. It was
just a blank space. And

207
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.740
that was a huge problem.
A big opportunity was missed.

208
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.080
And then within program manager,
which is where you went

209
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.860
to start all your programs,
the metaphor was a multiple

210
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.200
document interface. It was as
it was called in those

211
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.960
days. So it was really,
really easy to get lost

212
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.600
inside of program manager. Can,
you know, screens, weren't very

213
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.670
big in those days, right?
Six 40 by four 80.

214
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.500
And here you were trying
to manipulate three or four

215
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.470
windows at once potentially. And
they would clip each other.

216
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.360
And then if you maximized
one, you couldn't see the

217
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.150
rest of them. It was
just, it was really, really

218
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.000
bad. Yeah. It would be
worth having the listeners check

219
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.420
out and go and Google
for Xerox star and Xerox

220
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.120
Park's operating system. And you'll
note that there is a

221
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.750
persistent text box across the
top. It's on a menu.

222
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.480
It's not a start menu.
It's not a, a persistent

223
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.000
menu bar. It's just basically,
it's almost like the Cortana

224
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.330
text box, but you couldn't
minimize things. You could move

225
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.620
them around. But in the,
in early 1980 10 years

226
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.130
before windows 3.1, they were
putting stuff on the desktop.

227
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.590
So I think that your,
your point about that being

228
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.680
a missed opportunity was, was
significant. One other thing I

229
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.300
wanted to point out and
see what you thought about

230
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.350
was that the science itself
of usability was developing kind

231
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.230
of in the late, mid
to late seventies at IBM.

232
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.810
And it wasn't until the
eighties really that people were

233
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.560
doing usability studies. So you're
only 10 years into this

234
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.160
burgeoning, a science aren't you
at this point? Yeah. That's

235
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.370
a good point. You know,
really credit to bill Gates

236
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.000
for having the vision that
he knew he needed to

237
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.100
do something. And he knew
that he needed to bring

238
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.700
people in to do it.
So he turned to different

239
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.080
people in the company. And
one of the people that

240
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.300
really got interested, it was
a guy named Tandy Trower

241
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.480
and Tandy studied it and
said, you know what? We

242
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.240
need to really think about
investing in UX. And so

243
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.080
he got the charter from
bill to start a centralized

244
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.290
UX group. And he hired
designers and researchers. And we

245
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.330
starting with a couple of
people that he thought could

246
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.790
grow into managers. And they
did a woman named Virginia

247
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.460
Howlett who grew to be
the manager of the design

248
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.640
group and a woman named
Mary D Ellie who built

249
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.980
a user research team. And
that's who we reported to

250
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.290
when we, when we first
started it's I know crazy

251
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.420
to imagine, but there was
kind of one team for

252
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.000
the entire company at that
time. How many people at

253
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.340
the company, while y'all all
are off doing this when

254
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.770
I started Derek, when you
and I started about 4,000

255
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.490
worldwide, wasn't it? Wow. Yeah,
I was, I would say

256
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.120
it was like 2,500. Yeah.
4,000 somewhere in there. I

257
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.870
thought, I think it was
around 2,500. There might've been

258
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.740
maybe 4,000 on the outside
cause of international, but domestically,

259
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.860
yeah. Domestically, there was about
2,500 people. It's a big

260
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.850
number, but not, not completely
impossible to, to know most

261
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.480
people for sure. Yeah. We
could, we could walk down

262
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.420
the halls and, you know,
bill would walk by or

263
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.760
Steve bomber would walk by
and you'd say, hi, you

264
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.430
know, and you know, over
time you could see them

265
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.920
enough that they might recognize
your face, you know, kind

266
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.400
of thing. So that, that
definitely was a, was an

267
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.880
interesting time to be at
the company. The way we

268
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.760
got connected was really that
paper that I wrote after

269
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.060
windows five was done. It
Was for a, a UX

270
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.810
conference, ACM sick guy. And
I was interested, I was

271
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.870
surprised about the reaction people
had, was like, wow, Microsoft

272
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.810
was doing this that long
ago. And I think that's

273
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.840
a really interesting point is
that we did make an

274
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.240
early investment in that. And
of course there's lots of

275
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.910
criticism. You could lob at
Microsoft for kind of falling

276
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.490
off the path here and
there, you know, during its

277
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.030
growth and maturation as a
company, they're doing great. Now

278
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.850
they've got some really great
UX people, but it is

279
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.150
true that we really did
have things going on way

280
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.850
back in 1988, 89, where
we were really trying to

281
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.050
be driven by a good
design and good research principles.

282
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.100
How often would people say
no, do it this way?

283
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.570
Because I'm the manager, as
opposed to the user experience

284
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:42.220
be darned A lot. I
mean, it was like, yup,

285
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.850
that's fair. It was probably
like 80% of the time,

286
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.030
you know, and that's where
we tended to work with

287
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.870
teams. We were a central
resource within Microsoft. And so

288
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.870
we'd kind of be put
on loan to different product

289
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.380
teams for periods of time
and certain teams would go,

290
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.360
wow, this is such a
great resource. We want to

291
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.730
keep using them. And so
we would just kind of

292
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.060
build more with those teams
who were more receptive that's

293
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.500
right. I mean, over time
now it's pervasive. Right? So

294
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.950
it worked, but it definitely
took decades. That's right. Our

295
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.760
managers, Mary Virginia Tandy were
very explicit. It's like, you

296
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.010
know, work with the teams
that want to work with

297
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.590
us and, you know, we'll
build from success. Cause we

298
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.560
knew that the key was
having the program managers and

299
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.260
the developers talk to each
other about the great results

300
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.930
they were getting. Cause there's,
you know, Microsoft has this

301
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.130
history of hopefully friendly, sometimes
not friendly competition between teams.

302
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.920
And so if team B
sees the teammates had a

303
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.320
great result doing something new,
they might be more willing

304
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.320
to try it. Mm well,
that's a good, a good

305
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.910
point. And it also brings
up something we want to

306
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.400
underscore is that, you know,
great design is a team

307
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.010
effort. It's not that one
of you or one of

308
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.620
your bosses was just showed
up one day and said,

309
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.690
here are the designs for
the start menu. I did

310
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.170
it overnight. But was there
a moment though, where someone

311
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.410
was like, let's use the
four infinite corners as they

312
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.230
refer to the, the four
corners of the monitor? Well,

313
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.600
we definitely saw that. I
mean, it was kind of

314
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.200
a convergence of two things.
So the Winex program management

315
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.830
team that we just talked
about, they got together and

316
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.960
they were like, you know,
we see this certain pattern

317
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.470
across other products. And then,
you know, we in the

318
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.940
usability lab, we're seeing how
coroners were so important to

319
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.770
people, you know, that they
would grow. Like if you

320
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.950
just gave them no instruction
and a blank screen and

321
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.510
a mouse, they would go
to corners, you know, like

322
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.170
as a force of gravity
kind of thing. So from

323
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.050
a human perception, point of
view, they're very important. And

324
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.270
so then that's when we
discovered like, Oh wow, you

325
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.190
know, on the Mac, it's
got the Apple menu in

326
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.350
the upper left. And Mark
Malamud's team was like, okay,

327
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.230
well, what we should do
is make this persistent space

328
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.290
in windows, kind of as
a part of our trademark,

329
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.950
essentially be the bottom. And
then we could put other

330
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.520
things down there. And so
back to this idea of,

331
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.630
you know, minimizing windows, people
would minimize those windows and

332
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.130
then they would think they
were gone. We were like,

333
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.140
well, one of the primary
things that you should be

334
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.840
able to do with this
persistent space down below is

335
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.560
be able to switch tasks.
So essentially making all tab

336
00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.750
visible. And that's a perfect
example of using the two,

337
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.410
like using a visible cue
and then using an accelerator

338
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.810
or AKA gesture, if you
want to call it that.

339
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.750
And so once you know
what the visual cue is,

340
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.320
you can just use the
accelerator once you've learned it,

341
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.680
you know, Hey friends, This
is Scott, and I've got

342
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.960
a word from a new
sponsor and a really cool

343
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.380
sponsor. In fact that I
use myself, they are Sikh

344
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.720
that's S E Q and
you can check them out

345
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.760
at, get seek.net. That's G
E T S E q.net

346
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.910
seek is the easiest way
for your team to capture

347
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.290
and search and visualize structured
log events. You probably do

348
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.600
logging. Maybe you have a
node app or an asp.net

349
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:05.120
core app, move beyond text
files, check out structured, logging

350
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.390
it, preserves those individual property
values. As well as the

351
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.910
text that's associated with each
event, they get sent across

352
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.000
the network to seek which
then displays them and makes

353
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.030
them searchable. It's really easy
to get started. You can

354
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.630
probably instrument your application if
you're already using logging in

355
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.690
just minutes, just go to
get seek that's G T

356
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.380
S E q.net. You install
the seek server, it's a

357
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.850
windows service. And then it
listens and handles all of

358
00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.440
the logging, whether you're using
no JS and the Bunyan

359
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.490
logging library, or maybe you
use Sera log on.net or

360
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.970
just asp.net core is built
in logging. Sikh is there

361
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.070
for whatever you want to
use, whether it be.net or

362
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.370
node or Python or Java,
it's a really great product.

363
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.650
And I encourage you to
check them out and support

364
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:51.350
them the way that they
support us here at Hansel

365
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.350
minutes, when windows 95 started
out for the first time,

366
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.770
There's this thing that they
use internally at Microsoft called

367
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.620
the Oop, the O O
B the out of box

368
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.440
experience. And it would play
a little video and tell

369
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.690
you that the start menu
is a thing. And it's

370
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.210
over here. I remember one
of you said something that

371
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.190
there was a problem with
that video. People would click

372
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.460
on the start menu picture
in the video. Oh yeah,

373
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.460
we definitely did see that,
that kind of stuff happens

374
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.520
when you're teaching something that's
brand new people have a

375
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.580
hard time, often differentiating the
thing from talking about the

376
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.070
thing. And that's just something
that you like, what do

377
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.260
you do? Do you plan,
did you solve that problem

378
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.810
or do you make a
giant arrow, like start in

379
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.160
the center of the screen
and then point down to

380
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.680
the corner? Well, in fact,
one of the mitigations we

381
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.500
did do that got a
little bit of laughter I

382
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.170
think from people, but you
know, it was effective was

383
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.410
the, the bouncing animation that
would come out from the

384
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.960
right side along the task
bar, when you first started

385
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.830
in pointing out the start
menu. So kind embedding that

386
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.560
in The product, rather than
having a separate popup window

387
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.320
that might confuse people because
there's two pictures of the

388
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.920
same thing on the screen
Are things like that considered

389
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.070
poor form or is that
a pro appropriate UX? Yeah.

390
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.580
I mean, you know, great
UX. Sometimes you get lucky

391
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.670
and it's just totally obvious.
And there's zero trial learning.

392
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.910
And we realized that we
were making such a huge

393
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.690
change from what people had
before that we were gaming

394
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.700
for what I would call
one trial learning, you know,

395
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.980
once you understand what it
is, you don't ever forget

396
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.770
it. And it makes sense
from then on. And that's

397
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.750
really what we were aiming
for. I see. So it's

398
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.890
not necessarily a, it's not
impugning the idea as bad

399
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.680
design because you have to
teach them that once. Right?

400
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.160
It's, it's changing, you know,
everything about how you use

401
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.310
windows. If you were a
windows three user, right. Everything

402
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.160
looked different on windows 95
program manager was gone, file

403
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.480
manager was transformed into a
windows Explorer. So for those

404
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.030
people, well, yeah, we did
the testing, right? So we

405
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.450
saw that for computer novices,
for example, trying to find

406
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.610
a program in the first
place and started took on

407
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.090
average, like 11 minutes. It
was so incredibly painful. And

408
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.710
then when we got the
start button up and running,

409
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.490
even without the animation, depending,
you know, we ran there's

410
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.130
variability because different people who'd
never used a computer before.

411
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.040
Obviously had some challenges with
the mouse, potentially things like

412
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.350
that. But it was down
around two and a half

413
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.510
minutes to get started the
very first time, which we

414
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.970
thought was completely reasonable. I'm
I'm curious, culturally is the

415
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.960
start menu on the lower
right corner, in a right

416
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.650
to left language society and
like Arabic countries. No, I

417
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.720
think it is. It's been
a long time since I've

418
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.660
looked at a right to
left UI. Derek, do you

419
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.350
remember? I don't remember. I
think it is Scott. Yeah.

420
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.630
I'm curious if that scratches
your itch and makes you

421
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.600
wonder like why the, why
that corner, because I don't

422
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.850
think, I think it's now
so ubiquitous that in windows

423
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.740
10, it's every, it's always
on the lower left corner,

424
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.690
but I'm curious if that
was something you remember coming

425
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.170
up Definitely right. To left
language did come up maybe

426
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.120
more so in the, in
those days there was the

427
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.540
applications group, right? That's how
Microsoft is organized. I know

428
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.270
they were talking about it
extensively in the context of

429
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.490
things like word and Excel.
You know, one thing I

430
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.220
wanted to mention about the
coroners is we had a,

431
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.970
a really brilliant guy in
our user research team, a

432
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.880
guy named Marshall McClintock. And
when we started seeing this

433
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.670
pattern of the coroners, he
was very quick to educate

434
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.310
us all about Fitz law,
F I T T S,

435
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.120
which talks about the speed
to acquire target, right. It

436
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.310
has to do with acceleration
and seeking and all that

437
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.470
sort of stuff. But that's
where this idea of infinite

438
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.170
corners comes from is you
can slam the mouse as

439
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.870
fast as you want into
a corner and you can't

440
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.780
overshoot it. And so that's
another reason why the corners

441
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.170
are such powerful places to
put things is the accuracy

442
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.510
you have to use to
get there is very low.

443
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.120
And so it doesn't take
you out of the flow

444
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.100
of whatever else you might
be trying to get done.

445
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.520
Yeah. Interesting. I'm actually, I
will put some of these

446
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.010
things in the show notes,
but I'm looking at a,

447
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.960
a screenshot of windows XP,
desktop that is Arabic. And

448
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.850
in fact, the start menu
is in the lower right

449
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.350
corner. So now I'm going
to have to go and

450
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.150
do a little research myself
and find out that it's

451
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.830
still the case in windows
10. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting.

452
00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.000
Yeah. Yeah. And back to
some Microsoft history too. So

453
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.510
about the time that we
were working on these issues,

454
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.200
well, particularly with the start
menu, Microsoft had kind of

455
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.900
formalized this when X a
mythical product and turned it

456
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.830
into a thing called Cairo
name and yeah. Code named

457
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.060
Cairo and S some very
lucky few people at Microsoft

458
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.300
probably still have the tee
shirt. And Mark Malamud was

459
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.650
the head of the, essentially
the UX team for Cairo.

460
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.100
And it was going to
essentially merge a bunch of

461
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.410
different technologies. So I think
at the time that they

462
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.180
made a code name for
it, it was going to

463
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.380
be based on the windows
NT code base, which was

464
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.970
pretty ambitious given that Microsoft's
entire, like, you know, millions

465
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.420
of lines of code was
all 16 bit legacy code.

466
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.600
And then they wanted to
build this advanced UI on

467
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.430
top of it. And then
also it was going to

468
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.240
have some sort of like
database as the file system

469
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.180
kind of thing, which is
even kind of being bandied

470
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.600
about these days too, like
from Oracle and other other

471
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.440
companies. And anyway, so that
was the idea behind Cairo.

472
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.760
And so Cairo was going
along and doing some really

473
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.960
amazing things with regards to
the user interface. But as

474
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.380
things got scheduled out, they
saw that the timeline was

475
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.470
kind of too long to
be able to, you know,

476
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.250
keep the pipeline flowing for
both revenue and just delivering

477
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:31.750
products that people want. And
so they, they created another

478
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:36.400
product called codename Chicago, which
was not as far away.

479
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.650
And that became known as
windows 95. Right. And that's

480
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.460
where Kent got placed on
the windows 95 team as

481
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:50.110
their main user research guy,
then a woman named Jill

482
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.960
wrote Jack and I got
placed on the Cairo team

483
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.780
as the user research people
on the Cairo effort. So

484
00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:00.280
we were working on two
parallel, essentially code bases, but

485
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.600
trying to share some common
user interface ideas that had

486
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.900
been spearheaded by the Cairo
team and the Windex team.

487
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:12.460
So one of the things
that became controversial was the

488
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.490
word start and whether or
not it was okay to

489
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:19.600
put the word start next
to the windows logo, because

490
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.820
guys on the Cairo team
or people on the Cairo

491
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.330
team thought that, you know,
the windows logo should stand

492
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.270
on its own. Right. As
a representation of the brand.

493
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.450
Oh, right. It looks like
the company has start. Right.

494
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.990
Right. But what we were
seeing in the user research

495
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.670
lab and kind of back
to what you guys were

496
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.080
talking about about these animations,
we were trying different animations

497
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.230
to point people to the
windows. Sometimes they would get

498
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.440
it. Sometimes they wouldn't and
we couldn't rely on it.

499
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.450
So although it was working,
it wasn't perfect. And so

500
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.090
I was a huge advocate.
Honestly, I was the one

501
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.910
that was kind of talking
to Kent, I think every

502
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.770
other day, have they put
the word start on the

503
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.490
button yet? Cause Chicago was
going to ship first. So

504
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.590
can't, do you want to
talk about that? Yeah. I

505
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.140
mean, it was just really
a matter of what's the

506
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.710
priority here and we decided
the priority was making sure

507
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.880
people could get started like
immediately, immediately. Right. And just

508
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.520
really take that out of
the equation where, you know,

509
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.620
people are having to fumble
around. We did want that

510
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.350
to be their first experience,
again, thinking about the novices

511
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.360
in particular, because we were
trying to expand the market

512
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.910
and we're like, you know,
so what if it says

513
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.850
start, it's fine. And, and
you see what's happened. Of

514
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.240
course over time, we've been
able to remove that because

515
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.420
it's now something people worldwide
just kind of know what

516
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.580
the deal is and it
doesn't need to be there

517
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.410
as sort of a redundant
cue. Yeah. Interesting. Now this,

518
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.630
this actually speaks to something
that I think is super

519
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.120
important that you mentioned to
me before, when we were

520
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.080
preparing for this show, which
is that, that really good

521
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.160
user research is managing your
influence and your job as

522
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.340
the user researcher isn't to
advocate for the company. It's

523
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.170
the, be the voice of
the user. This is a

524
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.770
perfect example where you went
up against marketing and branding

525
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.320
and everyone to say, no,
it says, start it doesn't

526
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.690
say windows in the corner.
It should say. Yeah. And

527
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.880
we had really clear empirical
research. Like we had video

528
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.180
evidence and timing data that
showed like, if we gave

529
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.570
this task, this task list
of things to do with

530
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.700
a version of windows that
didn't have the word start

531
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.210
next to the windows logo.
And then one that didn't

532
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.090
the people that had the
word start, could do it.

533
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:35.420
Like, I don't know, twice
as fast, three times as

534
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.550
fast, I forget what the
numbers were exactly. But it

535
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.030
literally was like within 30
seconds, people could find the

536
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.730
button get started and be
on their Merry way and

537
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.400
complete all the tasks that
we had given them. And

538
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.920
this was the same task
list that Kent was using

539
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.070
on the Mac and other
things, when we saw that

540
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.330
repeatedly, we were like, there's,
it's undeniable. This is working.

541
00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:01.190
If this is science at
work. So it's same in

542
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.250
the same kind of vein,
you know, the, the whole

543
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.620
process of getting, finding the
start button and then getting

544
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.390
that first application launched. We
noticed that the hierarchical structure

545
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.340
worked pretty well. It was
way better than the program

546
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.310
manager. Cause you could see
all the folders and it

547
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.710
didn't take people long to
figure out the Aerosmith. They

548
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.620
could scoot to the right
and see something more, but

549
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.500
people would fall off the
menus because again, remember people

550
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.020
were brand new to the
mouse. And so I can't

551
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.030
remember if we were able
to get the code into

552
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.390
the very first shipping version
of windows 95 or if

553
00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.820
it was like a quick
followup we did where we

554
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.070
were able to relax, how
do you want to say

555
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.010
they hit target, I guess,
for the menu. So you

556
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.980
can write, you could wander
little bit in the menu,

557
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.590
wouldn't close on you anymore.
Yeah. And so just to

558
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.920
clarify some history too. So
Kent was working with a

559
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.100
program manager on the windows
95 team that AKA the

560
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.000
Chicago team, his name was
Danny Iran. And so if

561
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.450
you do searches on, you
know, the, the start button

562
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.080
and who created it, Danny
Iran's name really comes up

563
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.070
as the main, you know,
hit target. But the interesting

564
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.500
thing is there was a
lot of us, you know,

565
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.530
and I want to give
really shout out to Mark

566
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:16.210
Malamud who really, the design
came originally from him with

567
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:20.530
influence from the user research
team. And so there were

568
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.500
many people, so you can't
really point to one person,

569
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.770
there were many people involved.
And I think that that's

570
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.400
part of the hallmark of
arriving to great designs is

571
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.580
that it, you know, you
can't just rely on what,

572
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.100
you know, sometimes we call
a big brain like a

573
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.920
Steve jobs, just pluck it
out of thin air. And

574
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.580
then everybody worships it as
the best idea ever. Like

575
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.330
if you really want to
repeatedly deliver great products into

576
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.720
the marketplace, it has to
be a, a team effort

577
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.140
and B it has to
be backed by real user

578
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.590
data. And that takes a
team to really pull that

579
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:01.510
off. Yeah, definitely. Well, I
really appreciate you both chatting

580
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.360
with me today. This was
fun. Thanks. Yeah, this is

581
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.880
great, Scott. Thanks for having
us. I'm going to put

582
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.320
a lot of these things
we talked about in the

583
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.080
show notes, including an article
that the verge did on

584
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.260
the start menu in 2016.
And I want to make

585
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.610
sure that folks check out,
be curious with.us and you

586
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.340
can connect with Kent and
Derek. All right. Thanks so

587
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.940
much. Thank you, Scott. Thanks.
This has been another episode

588
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:47.370
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week. <inaudible>.
