From Hanselman it's dot com.
It's Hanselman. It's a weekly

2
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.150
discussion with web developer and
technologists. Scott Hanselman. This is

3
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.550
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number two
26. Recorded live Monday, August 9th, 2010.

4
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.230
Support for Hansel minutes is
provided by Telerik rad controls,

5
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.290
the most comprehensive suite of
components for windows forms and

6
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.410
asp.net web applications. online@wwwdottelerik.com. In
this episode, Scott talks about

7
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.500
the ultimate developer PC 2.0
with Pete Brown. Hi, this

8
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.690
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

9
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.260
We've got Pete Brown on
the phone, Pete and I

10
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.320
have been trying to build
God's own computer and failed.

11
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.720
I think that God has
a much nicer computer than

12
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.100
we do, but how are
you, Pete? I'm good. How

13
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.590
are you, Scott? Not too
bad. Not too bad. I've

14
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.620
been running this machine, this
new machine, the new ultimate

15
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.240
developer PC 2.04. What is
it now? A couple of

16
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.910
weeks. It's been what? A
week or two? At least.

17
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.380
Yeah, it's it's is really
quite lovely. I can definitely

18
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.350
go into your house or
anything. So it sounds like

19
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.260
it's working. Yeah, it does.
I haven't had any blue

20
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.930
screens. It doesn't, I don't
have to think about it.

21
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.110
It is extremely fast just
in the last week. I've

22
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.530
like builds. I don't even
think about bills. Nothing, no

23
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.970
project I'm working on is,
is massive enough to, for

24
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.070
this thing even blink out.
So every time I have

25
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.800
control shift B it's five
seconds tops or less, mostly

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.300
less. And for encoding videos
and stuff, it's, it's insane.

27
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.430
I had a video recently
that was going to take

28
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.150
something like 13 hours on
my laptop and ended up

29
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.780
taking like, you know, just
like 20 or 30 minutes.

30
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.110
There's a big HD video.
I had had no trouble

31
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.170
at all. So from a
raw processor, power, I'm thrilled.

32
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.430
I'm thrilled. What is the
status of your machine? Mine

33
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.240
is still sitting here on
my desk in a kind

34
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.910
of a benchtop configuration. So
I'm still playing around with

35
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.280
some tweaking, some of the
things and getting ready to

36
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.010
put the water cooling in
it. But I did the

37
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.650
live build of it and
tested it out and installed

38
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.140
windows like a hundred times,
which happens and you know,

39
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.860
like nine minutes or something
crazy like that. This, Oh

40
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.110
my goodness. This is, hang
on a second. This is

41
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.400
going to, we're going to
keep this in the show.

42
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.280
I think, because this is
a, this is just how

43
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.270
wonderful podcast is. Let me
see here. Is there a

44
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.700
man in my backyard mowing
the lawn? Of course there

45
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.810
is a dog barking next
door. Of course there is

46
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.640
Nice. I'm going to hang
on one second and I'm

47
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.250
just going to grab my
portable audio booth and I'm

48
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.050
going to just put it
in front of me here.

49
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.330
Change the audio, but keep
it rolling. Hanging out with

50
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.990
there. Alrighty. So now I'm
sequestered in my tiny audio

51
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.850
booth. This is your booth.
What's that? This is like

52
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.380
you have like the tartest
in your room or something.

53
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.990
What is, what is this
audio booth? It is a,

54
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.970
probably a two foot by
two foot hinged audio material

55
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.700
thing. It's like a, it
looks like a giant book,

56
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.060
like a giant black book.
It's got two, two foot

57
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.440
by two foot audio material
things with a hinge in

58
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.930
the middle. And you put
it in front of yourself

59
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.960
in a, in a, in
a, in a failed attempt

60
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.300
to make the background noise
go away. Hopefully as I'm

61
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.880
laughing here and I hear
the dog and the lawnmower

62
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.730
in the background and I'm,
I am, no one is

63
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.670
hearing that. It's probably just
in my head. Yeah, I

64
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.840
think it is in your
head. Cause I don't hear

65
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.970
it at all. So this
is great. And that, that

66
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.420
would be, that'd be success.
And Carl Franklin sent me this

67
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.420
and actually when we originally
started the show, Carl wanted

68
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.780
me to have a full
on Tartus and that's T

69
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.250
a R D I S,
for those of you who

70
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.110
are using Wikipedia to find
out what a Tardis is,

71
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.220
basically a phone booth that
would sit in my garage,

72
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.940
that I would do all
my recording via, But then

73
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.800
you could actually have your
house or your office in

74
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.390
the tartest. Cause there's so
much more room in there

75
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.660
anyway. I would have no
problem with that. I think

76
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.170
that would be good. All
right. So I've been using

77
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.760
my machine for two weeks
and I'm having no problem

78
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.070
with it. So let's walk
through this. The original goal

79
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.560
of course, was to get
a 7.9, the highest theoretical

80
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.890
score available on the windows
experience index. But a lot

81
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.320
of people thought that this
was a silly goal. And

82
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.630
do you think of it
as a silly goal? No,

83
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.820
I think it's, it's worth
pursuing. It's silly. It's silly

84
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.530
only if you have to
drop like another grand on

85
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.080
it to try and meet
the goal Was to make

86
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.830
the ultimate developer PC, but
the 7.9, I would think

87
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.020
it was secondary. I mean,
yeah, if we could do

88
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.490
it, we could do it.
That'd be great. But if

89
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.620
not, that's fine too. Yep.
Yep. What's different from the

90
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.660
ultimate developer PC. Cause the
number of people felt that

91
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.310
they were kind of offended
that I was just building

92
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.160
the ultimate gamer PC and
I really don't. I seriously

93
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.720
don't use this thing to
game. Right. And the biggest

94
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.940
thing was really the video.
Like what did you end

95
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.430
up with for a WPI
on, on video 7.8, 7.8.

96
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.230
Right. Okay. People felt that
was over the top. Like

97
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.140
totally not necessary. Another 0.1,
I think you would have

98
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.780
had to have gone up
and it's higher level of

99
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.300
card, like double the price
of your card or at

100
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.160
least another couple of hundred
bucks or something like that.

101
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.090
And that seems totally not
worth. And honestly, I mean,

102
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.160
let's just go through the
list, but I'll tell you

103
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.720
what I regret and what
I don't, because I think

104
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.780
that's really, what's important about
this is to provide guidance

105
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.340
to people who may agree
or disagree with our choices

106
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.040
and what would be right
for them. And each of

107
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.540
our machines ended up costing
about $3,000. Yep. So processor,

108
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.900
whether we get a processor,
it was a, I don't

109
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.400
have mine up in front
of me, but it was

110
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.130
like a seven, eight I
believe, right? No, no, but

111
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.870
like what, what process should
we buy? It was the

112
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.090
Intel extreme edition. I seven,
nine 80 X, right? Like

113
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.050
a thousand dollars, six core,
3.3 gigahertz processor. Right. And

114
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.750
it is, it is the
flagship desktop machine that there's

115
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.660
a processor you can get
from, from Intel. Right. And

116
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.180
Intel, it's not the only
six core. Now Intel has

117
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.460
one where they dropped the
price, like a hundred bucks,

118
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.620
but that a hundred dollars
that different Sarah is the,

119
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.540
the other processor is quite
a bit slower. I think

120
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.140
it was just, just straight
three. And doesn't have all

121
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.410
the unlock stuff you'd want
to do for overclocking. So

122
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.320
it's kind of, it's still,
it's still worth the extra

123
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.770
a hundred. Yeah. This, this
is known as an over

124
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.670
Clockers dream. Now we're not
talking about getting, you know,

125
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.070
well, there's a guy yesterday
who calculated PI to a

126
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.220
trillion digits or something using,
you know, an overclock machine

127
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.040
we liked, I think you
and I liked the idea

128
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.170
of overclocking in the sense
of I can get some

129
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.940
free speed or you can
effectively overclock this 3.4 or

130
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.100
3.3, three gigahertz processor to
four gigahertz using air cooling

131
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.480
and basically giving yourself a
20 to 30% speed increase

132
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.330
for free. Right. If you
get a top of the

133
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.990
line Intel processor and just
run it at stock, you're,

134
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.860
you're just throwing money out
the window. I mean the,

135
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.160
the whole point of those
processes is to let you

136
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.150
get some additional speed out
of that and it's free

137
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.980
speed effectively. Yeah. Yeah. Now
how have you been able

138
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.590
to overclock yours at all?
So I did just on

139
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.140
the bench, I went up
to 4.1 on air, just

140
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.260
using the stock cooler, which
is pretty impressive. That's almost

141
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.440
a full, a gigahertz difference
there just on stock cooling.

142
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.850
And it was good temperatures.
Yeah. That's pretty, that's pretty

143
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.340
slick. Yup. Now it is
open on my bench and

144
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.870
I had a big fan
blowing at it. So once

145
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.220
I go and shove it
in a case, I'm not

146
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.040
sure how high it could
go on air, but I'm

147
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.290
really hoping to get it
up a bit higher, at

148
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.170
least four or five using
the water cooling stuff where

149
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.120
the water cooling is, is
a bit of a fun

150
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.300
project for me, but still
ultimately it's about how much

151
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.880
stable free speed can I
get out of this process.

152
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.270
Right. And this is really
important, cause we're not, it's

153
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.180
important for the audience to
know that we're not overclocking

154
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.200
experts. We're not hardware walks
for developers and I, you

155
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.170
chose water cooling. I said,
that's too much hassle. I'm

156
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.590
not even overclocking that much
just because for me, if

157
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.320
this thing, blue screens, once,
I don't know if I'll

158
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.840
ever be able to trust
it again, Right. The blue

159
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.900
screening is a complete fail
on overclocking. Right. Okay. Blue

160
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.980
screening in everyday lives is
so it's so emotionally I

161
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.040
just got choked up there.
It's so emotionally scary that

162
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.920
like if a machine blue,
I mean think about that,

163
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.810
right? It's just like your
machine is cheating on you.

164
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.370
Exactly. You know, how can
I ever forgive it? It

165
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.400
is, it is a very
depressing experience. It is a

166
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.070
credit depressing. I mean, this
machine has been rock solid,

167
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.250
stable, and I'm, I'm I'm
I am reticent to give

168
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.100
up any kind of stability.
If I discover that it's

169
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.810
going to be great in
everyday life and it works

170
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.570
fine for email, but then
I decided to go and

171
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.080
I don't know, squish a
DVD and blue screens and

172
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.570
I'll be very sad. I
realized that I can run

173
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.560
stability tools like prime 95
and things for no overnight

174
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.860
to make sure that thing
is stable, but I don't

175
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.990
mind free speed, but I'm
going to lean more towards

176
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.170
stability. It's still pretty fast.
Now I'll tell you when

177
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.780
I was doing the research
for the cooling on this,

178
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.790
I was looking at all
the crazy things people were

179
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.700
doing with this processor. And
there are folks that build

180
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.750
like shrouds around the processor
and just dump in cooling

181
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.900
and get this thing up
to like almost six gigahertz

182
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.320
or they've. Some of them
have old air conditioners that

183
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.720
they've got hooked up to
it, like just, you know,

184
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.850
beat up old air conditioners
that they've gutted and ran

185
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.640
pipes directly onto the processor.
But these are guys that

186
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.430
are, you know, driving this,
get a blue screen. Cool.

187
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.530
Dial it back a little
bit. And I think that's

188
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.140
what you are. No, I
mean, this is, this is

189
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.500
the same kind of personality
that is trying to get

190
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.840
an extra horsepower out of
an old engine or whatever.

191
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.660
And I'm just, I'm driving
a Prius and neutral. So

192
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.890
definitely we're not over blockers.
So rest assured most people

193
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.700
could probably get away with
one processor down or two

194
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.210
processors down from this spot.
Yeah. A really good for

195
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.530
core will do well for
most folks. Yeah, definitely. Now

196
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.090
memory was a confusing one
to me. Cause we, we

197
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.860
heard in the original WEEI
podcast that there was some,

198
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.320
some tricks around memory. And
then at some point when

199
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.720
you got a fast enough
processor, the memory score didn't

200
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.110
really matter. But I don't
quite understand memory. I guess

201
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:56.450
I have one, three, three,
three memory, right? One, 1,333

202
00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.890
gigahertz or megahertz rather you
got faster memory and I'm

203
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.070
not sure did I make
a mistake? So I got

204
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.210
the 1600, which just in
the research I did, if

205
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.490
you want to, overclock quite
a bit, you need something,

206
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.320
you typically need something. That's
a step above the, the,

207
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.050
the one, three, three, three,
but I don't think what

208
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.670
you got will be a
problem. Cause you can usually

209
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.290
go a little bit higher.
The memory you've got is

210
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.700
a pretty good quality memory.
It's not just the, the

211
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.420
stuff from the loose been
down at the computer store.

212
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.930
Right. So I think you
should be able to overclock

213
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.910
that a little bit, but
you won't be able to

214
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.460
go quite as high. You
don't have as much headroom.

215
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.760
So does that mean that,
that my initial failures at

216
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.110
overclocking compared to your no
problem, getting to four gigahertz

217
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.910
on air are related to
possibly my cheap memory It's

218
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.790
possible, you know, it's so
hard to tell exactly what

219
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.290
the kind, what the, the
weakest link in the system

220
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.210
is. I mean, maybe the
people who do this constantly

221
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.890
can immediately say, yeah, that
that's obviously memory. Right, right.

222
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.220
But when I look at
it, there's nothing that says,

223
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.730
Hey, your memory is, is
frying here. Or it's not

224
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.470
keeping up without doing individual
tests on each component. I

225
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:13.500
paid three 74 for OCA
Z memory that, and I

226
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.200
got, I got a 12
gig kit. Apparently these motherboards

227
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.240
really liked their memory to
all come from one place.

228
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.440
Yeah. They can spot like
the one man out. So

229
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.670
you can't buy, you know,
eight gigs and then add,

230
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.070
add another four gigs later
on. They really like everyone

231
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.010
to be from the same
family. At least when you're

232
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.270
in the same channel, you
know, especially like for mine,

233
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.200
I got two six gig
kits from the same manufacturer.

234
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.320
Like a single 12 gig
kit would be, would definitely

235
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.910
be better. I mean, you'd
probably have a little bit

236
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.820
more headroom, but the two,
six from the same manufacturer

237
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.700
is not bad. As long
as you have each set

238
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.130
in its own channel. So
that, you know, the three

239
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.680
sticks that I got together,
as one set are going

240
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.570
to be one channel on
the board. And the other

241
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.640
three that I got will
be the second channel And

242
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.710
you filled up your motherboard.
And this is an interesting

243
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.950
thing because both of us
bought the gigabyte. This is

244
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.640
then that's the brand named
gigabyte, a UT nine motherboard,

245
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.350
which is considered a big
over overpriced giant flagship motherboard.

246
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.780
But it has everything in
the kitchen sink. And it's

247
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.100
interesting because it has six
memory slots. Yup. So you

248
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.760
filled yours up, Right? I
mean, you can theoretically go

249
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.250
to, or not even theoretically
you can practically go to

250
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.340
24 gig on this And
not practically, I got a

251
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.910
12 gig kit. So three
of my slots are fours.

252
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.060
And then I've got room
for another 12 gigs to

253
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.670
get up 24. Exactly. And
24 gigs is pretty awesome,

254
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.340
but I was interested in
getting some speed out of

255
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.210
this. And I really felt
like I could do 12

256
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.700
gigs on this first build
and be happy with it.

257
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.190
And then when I wanted
to go to 24 gigs

258
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.560
later, I was probably going
to be better off buying

259
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.410
a 24 gig kit. That's
all in one. Right. Does

260
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.800
that exist? Same reasons you're
talking about, but they're not

261
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.650
quite out yet. Right. The
really good 24 gig kits

262
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.190
are a couple months out,
at least. So I figured

263
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.440
for the first time ever,
I would just fill all

264
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.480
the slots on my motherboard.
I've never done that before.

265
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.490
Well, one of the things
that I learned during this

266
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.040
bill, because we did the
build in public and we

267
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.110
had, we were unused stream.
You can go up to

268
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.580
our blogs and we video
streamed, the building, which is

269
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.990
geeky in itself was that
apparently this Intel new Halem

270
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.900
chip set, the chip set
that is on the motherboard

271
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.180
that is known for not
liking 12 gigs of Ram.

272
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.780
And I've had some trouble
with my box where I'll

273
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.390
boot once and it'll say
eight gigs and I'll boot

274
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.710
again, it'll be 12. And
it's about recognizing that, that

275
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.630
memory. And there's some kind
of a, and I thought

276
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.580
it was, is it that
gigabyte motherboard? Or is it

277
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.520
this Halem chipset? And apparently
this is a known thing.

278
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.090
And the other thing that's
known is that the more

279
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.210
memory you have, the harder
it is to overclock successfully

280
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.820
and the real hardcore over
Clockers will just pull all

281
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.980
the memory out and they'll
have like a gig or

282
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.340
two gigs. And then they'll
overclock. So maybe my problems

283
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.530
are that I'm running 12
gigs of this cheaper memory.

284
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.610
This is the part of
the show where I mock

285
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.230
you while actually Tellerik mocks
us your applications that you're

286
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.200
testing dependent on external systems
over which you have no

287
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.890
control. Maybe you're being slowed
down by those systems or

288
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.290
lack of availability. Responsiveness. Do
you want to do TDD?

289
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.380
Right? Our friends at telework
help you solve some of

290
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.360
those problems with their newest
mocking tool, just mock it'll

291
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.400
let you do fast, simple
controlled unit tests, independent of

292
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.860
external resources like databases, web
services, proprietary code, unlike some

293
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.850
mocking tools, just mock works
with non-virtual methods, seal classes,

294
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.050
static methods, giving you complete
control of your code. You

295
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.290
can get more details. You
can download just mock at

296
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.550
telerik.com/just mock. And don't forget
to thank Tellerik for supporting

297
00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:00.710
Hanselman it's on their Facebook
fan page, facebook.com/tellerik. Thanks a

298
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.020
lot. Now the 12 gauge
problem that you were mentioning,

299
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.200
I remember either you telling
me, or I was looking

300
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.100
it up, that it's very
sensitive to the voltage. So

301
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.350
if you go a little
low, you won't get 12

302
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.910
gigs. If you go a
little high, you won't get

303
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.010
12 gigs, but if you
hit the sweet spot, it'll

304
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:23.290
recognize 12. Well, and this
is just ridiculous. Is that

305
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.980
worth the hassle? Right? If
I buy a Dell, am

306
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.400
I going to have this
issue? Right? Yeah. And the

307
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.650
Dells will not allow you
to overclock so they'll have

308
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.230
all that stuff just dialed
in. Right? So it's whatever

309
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.050
your tolerance is for that.
Well, whatever your tolerance is

310
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.210
for tinkering, isn't it? I
mean, this is the thing,

311
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.330
right? I went down to
the local best buy and

312
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.180
I said, what's the best
computer in this entire place,

313
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.610
which is always a cool
thing. I recommend that everyone

314
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.340
try that, just walk in,
like you're like packing big

315
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.390
cash and just say, what's
the best computer here. And

316
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.700
it turned out that the
one that was there is

317
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.410
a, a quad core. And,
but only Mac, it maxes

318
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.470
out at 5.7, cause best
by our local computer store

319
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:10.210
here doesn't have any machines
with SSDs, but it's basically

320
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:18.790
getting like (717) 273-7359. And, but
it's still, I mean, I

321
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.180
clicked around it's it's ridiculously
fast, you know, once you're

322
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.740
looking at a seven class
machine, it's fast. So for

323
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.590
a grand that's a thousand
dollars, $1,100 machine. That's a

324
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.050
beautiful thing. Wow. Oh yeah.
But you can't, you know,

325
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.150
it's all one piece, you
know what I'm saying? It's,

326
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.490
it's like, it's a, at
some kind of Dell, that's

327
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.410
all one piece and it's
not something that are going

328
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.940
to be able to swap
something out later and bring

329
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.590
new life to it. One
of the things that I

330
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.860
liked about the last ultimate
developer PC is that twice

331
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.670
in the last three years,
I have been able to

332
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.680
give it new life with
a new video card or

333
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.810
a new memory or a
new hard drive. Yep. And

334
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.630
I think even with that
Dell PC, I mean, that

335
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.370
sounds like it would be
a pretty good dev box.

336
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.600
If you can get an
SSD and, and be able

337
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.280
to crack it open and
not have a little sticker

338
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.830
on there that says warranty
void, if you replace a

339
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:13.700
drive. Right, right. Right. Exactly.
And actually speaking of drives.

340
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.160
So some of the, some
of the things that were

341
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.070
interesting in the building of
this machine was I put

342
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.790
it together and I needed
to remember to get the

343
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.880
latest bios for the motherboard
or the flash. The bios,

344
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.870
the hard drive is an
SSD. There's a crucial S

345
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:35.960
300, 300 or C 300
C 300 C 300, 256

346
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.770
gig SSD. I had to
flash that as well. There's

347
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.250
firmware on the, on the
SSD. So that was interesting.

348
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.150
And that involves basically burning
an ISO disc hooting off

349
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.760
of it. And then having
it boot into this Linux

350
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.680
disc and then find the
drive and then flash it.

351
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.440
And it's important because every
time you flash the firmware

352
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.120
on your SSD, you're going
to lose all your data.

353
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.050
So you get that. And
that minority came with to

354
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.960
tell you how new this
stuff is, firmware revision two,

355
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.440
which is the latest. So
I didn't have to go

356
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.840
through that whole flashing process.
Okay. Yeah. I didn't have

357
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.770
that. I actually did have
to flash mine. Interesting. But

358
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:18.890
also there's, there's different Satta
plugs on the motherboard. There's

359
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.100
sat a two instead of
three, this particular motor over

360
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.530
them on this board. Yeah.
This particular one has an

361
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.950
Intel Satta section and a
Marvel section. So I had

362
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.750
to decide which one of
those to plug it into

363
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.160
because it appeared that the
SSD was maxing out the

364
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.630
Intel side. It was, there
were some really weird stuff

365
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:43.340
going on there where like
the Marvell controller, which is

366
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.880
the six gigabit controller in
the board. If you install

367
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.790
the driver from Marvell, you
would end up with a

368
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.630
five something on the, on
WEEI. It really like knocked

369
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.270
the throughput in half. But
if you were able to

370
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.000
just use the Microsoft driver
and you didn't ever download

371
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.820
the Marvell driver, then you
would get a seven, nine

372
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.260
reinstalling a couple of times
trying that out and trying

373
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.330
to figure out exactly where
that step is, where that's

374
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.090
happening. And also just to
make sure that people who

375
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.400
are listening don't think that
we're only looking at the

376
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.620
WWII, that was kind of
our broad strokes. We were

377
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.800
also looking at different disc
benchmarks. And I was noticing

378
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.000
that the throughput on my
SSD when using the wrong

379
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.640
drivers are plugged into an
inappropriate port, would give me

380
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.870
things like 200 or 250
megabytes a second. But when

381
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.020
plugged into the Satta three
port with the correct drivers,

382
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:38.510
I was getting 320 megabytes
a second. Right. Which is

383
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.700
significant. Yup. And then when
I put this thing together

384
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.280
and on the six gigabit
port, sorry, we on the

385
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.230
six gigabit with the right
drivers, it was getting even

386
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.880
a little bit better than
that. Really? Yeah. Yeah. And

387
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.380
this is stuff you can
plug it in and it

388
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.840
will just work. And that's
the thing, that's the trickiest.

389
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.670
You can, you can just
plug this into any old

390
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.800
port, not think about it
and it'll just work fine.

391
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.080
But if you're willing to
put a little bit of

392
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.300
work into it, you'll realize
that there's actually performance there

393
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.450
that you may be missing
out on An important part

394
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.780
of that is what mode
you're running the drives in

395
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.290
or the ports. Remember you
had to decide between a

396
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:25.590
IDE or what's an ACI
HCI. Yeah. And if you

397
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:31.020
didn't have it in that
HHI mode, you wouldn't get

398
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.360
trimmed commands on the other
stuff that the SSD can

399
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.470
support. And by default, it
was just IDE mode. I

400
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.240
actually, I was very disappointed
with a lot of the

401
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.090
default settings in the bios
for this board. Yeah. They're

402
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.480
very conservative. They actually recommend
that you go right into

403
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.540
the bios and select optimized
that they're optimized or kind

404
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.400
of what they think of
as the defaults, the defaults

405
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.680
are not even anything really.
Yup. Yup. And actually another

406
00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.060
thing, speaking of slots and
things, you turned me on

407
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.120
to the fact that they're
a while these are, these

408
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:08.550
have many PCI, 16 X
slots. Some of them share

409
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.630
the same bus. So there's
like slots one, three, and

410
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.450
five are on one bus
and two, four and six

411
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.870
on another. And I didn't
realize that I was actually

412
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.890
cutting the speed of my
video in half by plugging

413
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:27.330
the cards into the wrong
slots. Right. Which is bizarre,

414
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.460
Easiest boards are not very
forgiving. No. They really expect

415
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.610
you to have cracked open
the manual and kind of

416
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.920
done a little research before
you start plugging stuff in.

417
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.530
Whereas just all the motherboards
I've bought in the past.

418
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.450
I just, I, I take
it out of the box.

419
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.010
I plugged this stuff and
put it in the machine

420
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.230
and I'm done Well, that's
the funny thing, right? Why

421
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.230
someone was saying in the,
in the comments that they

422
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.640
said that it seemed like
it was a bunch of

423
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.310
cul guys trying to design
a user interface. There's like,

424
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.380
this is ridiculous. What are
you guys doing? You're useless.

425
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.300
And I was like, yeah,
man, if I, if we

426
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.000
were building a 46 DX,
I could rock this build.

427
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.550
I would be, I will
be your guy, but I'm

428
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.730
catching up on this stuff.
The last time I did

429
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.010
this bill was three years
ago with Jeff Atwood. And

430
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.220
he was schooling me on
all the new slots and

431
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.680
this and that. That's our,
that is available. And this

432
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.840
is the first build I've
done alone in a while.

433
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.010
If you go around and
read all the documents, you

434
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.410
know, if you're, if you're
detail oriented, you'll be fine.

435
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.320
But if you just slap
this together, like a 46

436
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.420
it'll work, but you probably
have a machine that's half

437
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.050
as fast as it could
be just for wanting, putting

438
00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.780
the wrong slot, the wrong
card in the wrong slot

439
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.890
or the wrong chord in
the wrong, whatever. You know,

440
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.370
I didn't quite come out
how I imagined in my

441
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.900
head. But point is though
you plug the hard drive

442
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.080
into a set of two
and a two video cards

443
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.390
that are supposed to be
running multiple monitors into the

444
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.700
slot. That's on the same
bus and you're, you're just

445
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.430
was bandwidth or you're wasting.
So I ended up moving

446
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:03.640
a video card over and
everything became snappier. Nice. Yeah,

447
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.520
definitely. Yeah. And actually the
video card, that's the one

448
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.250
thing I regret everyone insisted
I should buy an, an

449
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:14.230
ATI and I just have
religious issues with ATI. I

450
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.830
used to be hardcore ATI
guy, literally like hardcore from

451
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.210
like 1989, 1990. Like I
have the first ATI, I

452
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.940
think it was called an
89, 14 slash EI. It

453
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.820
was the first ATI car
that would run 1,024. I

454
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.480
ran it on last 13
inch monitor. Yeah. And then

455
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.930
somewhere in the early two
thousands or mid two thousands,

456
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.020
my ATI experience went South
and I started blue screening

457
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.780
and I just gave up
on ATI and I went

458
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.540
Nvidia and I've been happy
ever since, but I made

459
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.060
the mistake of going with
my gut rather than going

460
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.610
with Tom's hardware on a
non tech and the people

461
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:53.020
in the comments. And I
bought an GTX four 70

462
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.950
and this, this card is
wonderful in the sense that

463
00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:02.230
it's unbelievably fast, but it
is so freaking hot that

464
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.210
I'm running. I'm having to
like keep the window open.

465
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.420
I think I may have
to sell the card. It's

466
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.940
just too hot. So why
is it so hot? It's

467
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.880
90 Celsius. Wow. Wow. And
then you actually figured out

468
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.300
why it was 90 Celsius,
which is even more disturbing

469
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.000
that you might want to
talk about the multiple monitor

470
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.270
thing. Yes. So that was
really crazy. So you just,

471
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.020
just the act of plugging
that second monitor into your

472
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.890
card. What did it added?
Like another 50 degrees or

473
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.040
40 degrees Celsius or something
like that to the, to

474
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.220
the board temperature, which was
insane. Right. And I don't

475
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.050
remember if it was the
memory or the, or the

476
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.290
GPS clock, the clocks, just
having a second monitor. Yeah.

477
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.140
Apparently the deal is that
there's a bug in this

478
00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.090
particular, it's called the Fermi
F E R M I

479
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.760
chip set. And the Fermi
chip set has a flicker

480
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.700
issue when you plug in
two monitors at a low

481
00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.770
clock speeds. So the way
they get rid of the

482
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.830
flicker is they double the
clock speed and that doubles

483
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.250
the heat. And it's not
really literally double, but it's

484
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:10.180
the difference between about 50
to 53 Celsius on one

485
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.710
monitor. And literally I just
plug in the, the other

486
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.150
cable and it goes up
70, 80, 90, depending on

487
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.120
how hard the load is,
but it's enough to raise

488
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.400
the temperature in the room,
you know, five, 10 degrees.

489
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.990
And that's just insane. I
don't get how you, it,

490
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.220
that particular problem truthfully has
shaken my faith and Nvidia.

491
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.530
Cause I don't know how
you produce a boy. Yeah.

492
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.260
It's, it's pretty horrific. Now
the thing is that they're

493
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.340
saying that the, the Fermi
GTX four 60 is a

494
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.690
great card and a great
balance of power and heat.

495
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.440
And, and I've seen a
number of articles, including one

496
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.050
that had the headline, the
Fermi we've been waiting for,

497
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.440
but because I've got three
monitors, everyone's saying that I

498
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.080
should have just bought the
ATI affinity that would be

499
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.050
able to run for all
three monitors, happily and what

500
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.030
I ended up doing. Cause
I have a 30 inch

501
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:07.170
monitor and then two 20
fours is running the main,

502
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.730
the main 30 on the
new card. And then the

503
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.240
other two on the, a
GTX two 75 that I

504
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.280
had lying around. So honestly,
for, for what I'm doing,

505
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.810
the four 70 is ridiculous.
It's totally overkill. And I

506
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.430
could have saved 150 bucks,
right? I think any $200

507
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:34.350
or $250, more expensive than
usual, but not really expensive

508
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.400
card would be fine for
a developer. And the GTX

509
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.610
two 75 would have been
just fine and that's running

510
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.080
my two secondary monitors anyway.
Right. And you're, you're not

511
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.420
going to get a seven
nine, but it's a seven,

512
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.700
nine is a gaming machine.
Again, that wasn't the point.

513
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.910
The point was monitors. And
in my last developer PC,

514
00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:57.680
I ran two GTX, two
70 fives. And I actually

515
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.520
lowered the power by getting
a, a specific brand. I

516
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.770
think it was called Virto
V E R T O.

517
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.430
That is an air. It's
an air cooled Nvidia. So

518
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.920
they basically modify the bore
that they get from Nvidia.

519
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.110
They put a giant heat
sink on it and they

520
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.800
have no fan. So it's
an incredibly quiet board. And

521
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.130
this was a great board,
three years, top line board

522
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.470
three years ago, very inexpensive
boards, like a hundred dollars,

523
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:25.460
$150 board now. And it
runs these machines. It runs

524
00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.030
these, these 24 inch monitors
just fine. So to those

525
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.790
of you, including a anonymous
poster who eventually told me

526
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.940
his name was David in
the comments, I was wrong,

527
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.740
please forgive me. Don't buy
the GTX four 70. Now

528
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.400
that said, that said, stepping
aside from the, I don't

529
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.130
play games, I did install
steam. And I did play

530
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:53.060
Counterstrike at 2,560 by a
thousand whatever frequent relive resolution

531
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.610
that this 30 inch monitor
runs. And I did it

532
00:28:55.610 --> 00:29:00.530
at 90 frames a second.
Wow. So that said, don't

533
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:04.730
buy this sport because Hey,
so, so I actually got

534
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.580
an ATI card for my
bills. I, I bowed to

535
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.620
the pressure from the community,
even though I had the

536
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.470
same experience that you did
back in the two thousands,

537
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.110
right. With the early radians.
Right. And it goes get

538
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.540
a lower score and it's
not as good of a

539
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.830
board performance wise as yours
is, but it's been it'll

540
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.350
support three displays and it
just does a great job.

541
00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:28.400
Otherwise, is it hot? No,
it's, it's actually a really

542
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.450
cool board. It's a Sapphire
Raytheon and they don't use

543
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.630
the reference layout. They have
their own layout with their

544
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.170
custom cooling solution on here.
So it runs something like

545
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.120
10 degrees Celsius, a cooler
than the stock boards do.

546
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.960
And it comes over COVID
It's by default. Yeah. And

547
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.000
this is another thing to
watch out for is that

548
00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.940
these boards, these high end
equipment that you buy and

549
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.090
we bought from Newegg, or
I think you bought from

550
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.640
some stuff from a local
shop, people don't like you

551
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.370
returning these from back in
the day, you could like

552
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.640
buy something like this at
a local warehouse, computer store,

553
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.770
you know, effectively renting it,
try it out and then

554
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.610
take it back. Not anymore.
I'm stuck with this board,

555
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.520
new egg, we'll swap it
for another board, but this

556
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.200
particular board, they don't allow
refunds on. Yeah. And they'll

557
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.880
only swap it for the
same thing I think. Right?

558
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.490
Yep. So watch out if
you're gonna, if you're going

559
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.820
to do something like this,
don't, don't be like me.

560
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.700
Right. And do it, do
your research and make sure

561
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.580
that you can return something.
And actually speaking of returning

562
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.490
things, one thing that new
egg did return nicely was

563
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.700
my power supply. I was
unable to get the board

564
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.450
to put up for the
first two days. I got

565
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.230
a very strange error message
on the L a on

566
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.670
the led. There's a little,
little red led display with

567
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:51.820
two eight digit segmented LEDs
on the motherboard on a

568
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.450
gigabyte. And it's meant to
help for overclocking. It's supposed

569
00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.840
to tell you why this
isn't working. So you boot

570
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.180
up and your monitor doesn't
work, and maybe you don't

571
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.420
have a video card. And
it says two F and

572
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.890
you go and say, Oh,
two F and it's too

573
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.410
much voltage to the memory
or whatever. And I was

574
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:10.530
getting eight eight. And if
you search around on the

575
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:14.010
web for gigabyte, UT nine
and eight, eight, people think

576
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.610
that it's, that it's code
eight B, which I think

577
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.220
is silly to think that
because they would have just

578
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.240
used a lower case B
a right, but they're convinced

579
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.790
that it's like, it's a
code to code. So here's

580
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.600
the new slash eight, eight
is not a code. It

581
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.310
is actually the, all of
the segments on the segment

582
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.820
that display lighting up. So
it hasn't even gotten to

583
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.030
the part where it outputs
an actual letter and a

584
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.000
number. It doesn't, you know,
it's just literally just lighting

585
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.060
up and going eight, eight,
because everything's lit up, it's

586
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.600
a power supply problem. It's
not getting the voltage that

587
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.840
it needs. And it just
won't go beyond that. And

588
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.090
I was finding out of
10 boots, I could get

589
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.460
it to boot once. And
then I went over and

590
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.800
I returned my Silverstone power
supply. I picked up an

591
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.180
Antech and it worked instantly
and every time good to

592
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.420
know it's very, very persnickety
motherboard. And if you search

593
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.580
around, people are having all
sorts of problems with that.

594
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.010
And it's all power related
to some of these power

595
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.130
supplies just don't put out
consistent power, even though, even

596
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.500
though they were hiring power
supplies and Newegg, fortunately took

597
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.450
that power supply back and
returned it with a small

598
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.740
restocking fee. Yeah. I ended
up with a course air

599
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.540
power supply cause I've had
good luck with them in

600
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.640
the past. And that seems
to have done pretty well.

601
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.910
Yeah. You said you were
able to solve windows, how

602
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.780
quickly I can do windows.
So I had a really

603
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.800
slow USB stick that I
was using to boot directly

604
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.320
from an installed windows. And
even with that, it was

605
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.670
under 10 minutes. So I
actually ordered a replacement USB

606
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.790
stick that is supposed to
be just wicked fast. And

607
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.050
I'm just gonna try it
again and see if I

608
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.870
can do like a seven
minute windows seven install. And

609
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.530
that's including typing in the
user ID picking your time

610
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:02.790
zone. So you're saying from
completely dead naked machine, no

611
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:07.780
file system to working desktop
in 10 minutes. Yes. Yeah.

612
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.170
And that was just amazing.
That is nice. I happy

613
00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.140
with the experience. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, and, and so

614
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.240
what that has, let me
do this time that I've

615
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.110
never done before is I
keep rebuilding the machine till

616
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:23.890
I get to the optimal
configuration. Because if you, if

617
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.660
you tinker with some things
in the bios, it, you

618
00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.310
know, it sets stuff up
in windows that are really

619
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.860
hard to change later on.
So I'm like, Oh, 10

620
00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.780
minutes to re-install, I'll just
go and play around the

621
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.500
bios and learn some more
and reinstall it. And it's

622
00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.750
not painful at all. That
is an interesting perspective. I

623
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.990
mean, I'm used to putting
machines together, closing the box

624
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.420
up and putting the box
under my desk, but the

625
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.300
open bench build, which is
what the pros do is

626
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.500
really a nice way to
do it. And that's what

627
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.510
I ended up doing is
just put the thing on

628
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.380
a big wooden door. And
it was sitting out in

629
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.680
my garage with a big
wooden door and change things

630
00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.110
and move cords around. And
then didn't actually button the

631
00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.410
thing up. Actually, honestly, I
took the, the side off,

632
00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.810
I'm still moving things around.
It's not a hundred percent

633
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.930
buttoned up even, even two
weeks in, but it does

634
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.100
feel a lot more flexible
being able to, I think

635
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.970
so. Yeah. So, Hey, during
your bill, did you do

636
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:20.290
anything dumb? Well, other than
building it on carpet originally,

637
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.890
that was kind of stupid.
Okay. I lost a screw

638
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:29.290
once almost shorted, the whole
thing out installed windows using

639
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:34.630
IDE mode and then had
to reinstall an ACH. What

640
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.080
else did I do? A
couple of stupid things like

641
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.260
that. What did you do?
So my, my dumb thing

642
00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.300
that I did on here
is, you know, I, I

643
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.910
got the thermal grease and
stuff on the CPU, and

644
00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:47.560
then I put the heat
sink down, got it all

645
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.710
tightened up and thought, Oh,
I missed a step in

646
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:54.070
here. And so I asked
and nobody else had picked

647
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.720
it up though. There was
watching at the time, but

648
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.330
I unscrewed the whole, the
heat sink pulled it all

649
00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.120
off and it still had
the little flat plastic protective

650
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.580
film on the bottom of
the heat sink. So that

651
00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.440
was my dumb mistake for
the time. I forgot to

652
00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.050
remove that plastic cover off
there. So I had to

653
00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.360
clean up the CPU, get
rid of all the grease,

654
00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.790
take the sticker off and
do it all over again.

655
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.510
Cool. Well, I posted three
different posts on my blog

656
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.480
about the experience, and I
know you're continuing your, your

657
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.570
series on the ultimate developer
PC. I've also got some,

658
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.100
some interesting benchmarks as I
built some larger projects like

659
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.270
in hibernate and effectively getting
to X performance for my,

660
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:35.350
my medium sized project builds
or my, my previous one.

661
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.070
And I'm, I'm feeling pretty
good about it. I, I,

662
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.940
I'm a little sad about
the video card, but maybe

663
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.350
I'll get someone on to
buy it from me on

664
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.470
Craigslist at all. Won't lose
too much money. Yeah. But

665
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.170
was it fun stuff? Yeah,
it was fun. It's actually,

666
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:50.850
it was most fun I
had since I built the

667
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.670
arcade and think about what
else I want to go.

668
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.370
And I still, I need
to build a surface. I

669
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.880
feel like I need a
big ass table. So maybe

670
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.710
I'll do that next. Maybe
actually, maybe I'll use the

671
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.460
old ultimate power, the big
ass table. That might be

672
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.070
good. That'd be good. Now
I've got to go. All

673
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.370
right. I gotta go build
this now. Great. Thanks Pete.

674
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.970
Thank you, Scott. This has
been another episode of Hansel

675
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.890
minutes. We'll see you again
next week.
