the pleasure of sitting down

11
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.380

Molly is a web evangelist

14
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.370

opera browser, opera.com. And she's

15
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.790
also the author of 35
books, including the very popular

16
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.500
Zen of CSS design. Molly
has also a longtime relationship

17
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.580
with the W3C standards body,
including being on the CSS

18
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.240
three working group, the CSS
working group, or the CSS

19
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.370
work we're working on CSS
three. Right? So you have

20
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.210
a credentials as long as
my arm around standards on

21
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.970
the web. I've been involved
for a long time. Yes.

22
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.670
And did you just fall
into this one day? Yeah.

23
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.800
You know, when I was
growing up, it wasn't like

24
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.920
there was an option to
become a web developer mom.

25
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.120
When I grow up, I
want to be a web

26
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.300
developer. We didn't have that.
So yeah, it was just

27
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.010
a matter of being in
the right place at the

28
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.950
right time and having gone
to, you know, a certain

29
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.590
conference or something and somebody
going, Oh, that HTML stuff.

30
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.780
Oh, well, yeah, put Molly
on it. Or, you know,

31
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.360
so everything was a bit
of everything that happened was

32
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.380
sort of non, not planned,
definitely not planned. And it's

33
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.850
just been a wild ride.
Very, very wild, interesting ride

34
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.740
to grow up with the
web. And this started somewhere

35
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.500
around 92. Well, I've been
in it, I've been in

36
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.690
it since about 88 or
so, something like that. So

37
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.450
I started my career around
then and I was already

38
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.620
a technical writer. I was
doing other things, getting into

39
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.260
technology more and more and
more of an interest in

40
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.110
technology. And, you know, so
I was around the internet

41
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.870
used net gopher back in
the day, back in the

42
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.750
day, BBS is all the
way. Totally. Yeah. So it

43
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.730
was a really great time.
And then of course, when

44
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.310
the web came along and,
and you know, my first

45
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.990
view of it was, you
know, on the, on the

46
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.840
line, you know, on the
line command, a command line

47
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.920
there using, you know, an
Apache server and Lynx browser

48
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.620
and checking out what this
was all about, you know,

49
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.140
C so I, I, the
great fortune to have been

50
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.380
at the earliest point of
the web's birth and, you

51
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.350
know, have grown up with
it. So I think that's

52
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.930
part of the reason that,
you know, it's been a

53
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.870
highly productive career for me
because there's just been so

54
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.350
much cool stuff going on,
But being there at the

55
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.460
beginning, like when I was
there and, you know, Jeannie

56
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.510
and prodigy and CompuServe, you
know, I could stuff 95

57
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.550
a month, all you could
eat from the hours of,

58
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.250
And I ran a wild
cat PBS, but there's a

59
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.430
different team being there. I
had a multiline Wildcat video.

60
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.370
We did a show with
the creators of the Wildcat

61
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.240
PBS I'm seriously impressed. They're
very cool people. You should

62
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.700
listen to that show, but
that doesn't, that means I've

63
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.000
been a user since day,
day zero, but that's a

64
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.730
big difference between being a
user and being interested in

65
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.120
driving the direction of the
way. When did you start

66
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.180
pushing the direction things were
going, as opposed to just

67
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.600
consume? That's a very interesting
question, because I think it

68
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.360
was, it's just in my
nature. I've always been, you

69
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.160
know, when I was a
kid, I, you know, I

70
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.140
was growing up and I
was thinking about the peace

71
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.390
Corps as a future. I've
always been, you know, a

72
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.550
bit of a, of a,
of a let's get stuff

73
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.560
done. You know, let's not
just talk about it, let's

74
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.240
go and change the world
and that sort of my

75
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.540
personality. So I think it
was inevitable that, that when

76
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.840
the web came along immediately,
I began to see it

77
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.490
will. In fact, it was
even before the web. I

78
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.550
have to be honest, the
moment that I really knew

79
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.060
that that, that I was
going to be somehow significantly

80
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.840
involved in a push forward
in technology, happens on cue

81
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.770
link with my, with my
Commodore 64, when I saw

82
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.510
international chat for the first
time international. Not, yes. And

83
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.660
it w it was people
from around the world in,

84
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.170
in pretty much real time.
I mean, we're talking about

85
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.320
300 baud modems here, but,
but I mean, amazing. You

86
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.360
know, I knew that this
was the beginning. There was

87
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.350
to some instinct in a
Score with angle brackets. Yes,

88
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.180
Exactly. It was like, it
was like, I could do

89
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.460
the peace Corps from my
bedroom here, you know, and

90
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.100
I, and then, you know,
of course that morphed into

91
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.060
later becoming the web and
becoming a huge opportunity, you

92
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.180
know, to, to move things
forward and to take this

93
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.450
a little further, I have,
my youngest brother always teases

94
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.760
me. He says, you were
talking about the NPR. And

95
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.590
he says, you know, I'm
a PBS, or like the

96
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.590
NPR of the web Right.
NPR for our international listeners

97
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.530
is the national public radio.
Yeah, exactly. Or the PBS

98
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.680
public broadcasting system. In other
words, those, those systems that

99
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.410
are of the people like
the BBC. Right. So, so

100
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.520
the idea being that, that
I've always had that attitude

101
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.980
and that, that was always,
you know, my personality, I

102
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.160
think, so the two just
meshed right away. And then

103
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.140
I began to see, as
you know, I've always had

104
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.270
an interest in education and
I began to see people

105
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.610
really struggling. And I got,
you know, I began to

106
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.650
teach web design classes and
the more and more I

107
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.690
got into that, I was
offered a book deal. I

108
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.640
got, you know, and the
deeper I got the deeper,

109
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.030
you know, the faster it
went. Yeah. There's, it's interesting.

110
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.340
There's a, I work with
the team works at Microsoft

111
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.920
developer network and I was
reading some research and they

112
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.340
were talking about different kinds
of personalities that exist on

113
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.100
the, on the web and
in developer communities. And with,

114
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.320
with all of these kinds
of research, they inevitably end

115
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.620
up using a alliteration and
they had different kinds of

116
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:19.490
people. And it was like
critic consumer collector. And there

117
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.540
was one collaborator, right. And
I put up a Twitter

118
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.950
poll up and I said,
well, which one of these

119
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.130
personalities are you? And I
got chastised for using radio

120
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.010
buttons instead of check boxes.
Cause people wanted to be

121
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.960
multiple personality. I think there
is that, I mean, we

122
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.540
are, we are not one
thing, are we sure, But

123
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.350
it sounds like a collaborator.
I mean, you're bringing multiple

124
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.670
people together. Yeah, Absolutely. I'm
actually Tim Berners Lee, the

125
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.380
inventor of the worldwide web
during one of our conversations

126
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.710
at T pack got very
excited. And actually he used

127
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.340
a Malcolm Gladwell name, which
was the connector. They says,

128
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.740
you're the connector, you're the
connector. That's one of the

129
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.690
nicest things. Yeah. Well, it's
different. The collaborator collaborators collaborate

130
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.140
in, in work environments. And
of course now that I'm

131
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.960
part of an actual team
of people. Whereas I was

132
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.470
independent from most of my
career. The collaboration factor is

133
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.400
really important, but the connection
factor, bringing people together, linking

134
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.540
this is part of the
philosophy that emerged for me

135
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.810
with the early web, where
I began to see very

136
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.130
clearly that the link was
a representative of human links

137
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.650
as well. And this is,
you know, this sounds a

138
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.130
little, maybe a little off
to some up, but it's

139
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.110
not really, if you look
at the writing and the,

140
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.500
and the discussions about with
Tim Berners Lee, a physicist,

141
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.680
a brilliant physicist, brilliant scientist,
and an, and the inventor

142
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.020
of the worldwide web. We're
not talking about, you know,

143
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.220
we're talking about incredible here,
give him some credit that

144
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.490
one small thing that changed
the world. Right? Exactly. If

145
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.440
he doesn't get a Nobel,
I'm going to be surprised

146
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.590
he's already won the Japan
prize. But that, that, that

147
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.840
aside, he, his early writings
were also sociologically important. He

148
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.140
always saw the social aspect.
And as time went on,

149
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.480
you look at his writings
and how he's become even

150
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.210
more and more into that.
So I don't think it's

151
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.450
wrong, you know, to say
that it's not me. It

152
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.610
was there in the heart
of the web already. Yeah.

153
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.520
You know, cause we're here
at the software guru conference

154
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.490
in Mexico. And in both
of our talks, we always

155
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.740
inject the sense of the
social web. My talk was

156
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.190
about social networking for developers.
And one of the questions

157
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.960
that someone asked, which I
thought was kind of an

158
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.990
audacious question was I may
have been a joke, but

159
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.750
they said, what is the
future of social networking on

160
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.780
the web? My first impression
was I am no more

161
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.520
qualified to answer that question
then than anyone. But the

162
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.840
thing that really struck me
was that it's changing fundamentally

163
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.150
how we interact with people.
I mean, do you ever

164
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.950
have conversation like with, let
me give you a perfect

165
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.410
example as a, as a,
as a professional speaker in

166
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.040
a, in a collaborator and
a connector, you're going all

167
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.590
over the world. You very
likely have had the experience

168
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.960
where you have interacted with
someone for months on a

169
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.410
project. Having never met them
or shook their hand and

170
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.050
then simply go, Oh, and
here we are in the

171
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.540
same country or the same
city. And you just keep

172
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.300
talking. The conversation moves through.
In fact, in fact, I

173
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.430
have years of experience like
that, even back in the

174
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.860
BBS days, when we would
do our GTS, our get

175
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.800
togethers where people would actually,
you know, you'd have the

176
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.580
original, the original tweetups. And
I think that, I think

177
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.670
that it, you said something
in your session yesterday about,

178
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.400
you know, the need, like
you were making jokes about

179
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.890
how, you know, most of
us want to connect with

180
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.690
people, but we don't necessarily
want to do it with

181
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.620
them without yeah, exactly. Without
having to actually be with

182
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.720
people. You know, we're always
looking for ways to do

183
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.850
that, which in a way
was, you know, it's obviously

184
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.330
your humor, but it it's
a point there, there are

185
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.460
times that it's an opt
in thing. And I really

186
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.130
liked that. I liked the
fact that we have an

187
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.350
entire social world that we
can opt in or out

188
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.230
of, depending upon, you know,
our mood or our needs,

189
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.050
you know? And that really
is very cool to answer

190
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.780
a question like that though,
is, is an impossibility. First

191
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.030
of all, anybody who's walking
around with a crystal ball

192
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.490
and says, this is the
future of the web. I'm

193
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.710
not going to believe them.
And I would suggest to

194
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.320
others that they think very
carefully and listen carefully to

195
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.150
what that person is saying
and weigh it on their

196
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.700
own measure. Because I don't
think we can tell the

197
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.370
future. We've already seen that
as we think we know

198
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.320
what the future is, what
as we were talking about

199
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.600
with XHTML right. Just yesterday,
suddenly something happens and the

200
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.940
whole world changes Right yesterday.
I said to you how

201
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.020
proud I was that one
of our websites was validated

202
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.870
as XHTML strict. And I
kind of got you to

203
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.250
look on your face. That
kind of said like, Oh,

204
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.250
welcome to last year. Yeah.
Welcome to 10 years ago

205
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.240
for some of us, for
some of them. Yeah. But

206
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.960
actually realistically we do see
a huge shift now technologically,

207
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.570
where X H smell too
is, is, has lost it

208
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.190
at the end of this
year. Its charter is up

209
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.550
December 31st of this year. And
actually each mill to work

210
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.610
will stop. And the W3C
has made a very overt

211
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.580
statement that in fact it
is putting its energy toward

212
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.940
HTML five, which is changing
the ball game completely. I

213
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.720
mean, we're talking about absolutely
shifting toward application mentality and

214
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.110
software development, as opposed to
just, I shouldn't say that

215
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.470
he's just writing pages, but
it's no longer a document

216
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.830
format only, But forgive my
ignorance. I'm going to ask

217
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.480
some questions. I know the
answers to, but other ones

218
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.150
I'm just purely ignorant about
and I'll let the listener,

219
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.010
that's an exercise to the
listener to figure out whether

220
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.950
they have any idea. Okay.
If I'm completely clueless about

221
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.820
this, but is HTML five
XML or is it SGML

222
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.750
Oh, wow. Okay. So there's
a, there's a good answer

223
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.160
for this. Let me, let
me explain. If we look

224
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.170
at HTML five, there are
because of the XML, the

225
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.440
fact that XML is so
widely, widely used and so

226
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.210
much extra everything at W3C,
pretty much outside of HTML.

227
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.460
CSS is done in XML
serialization. So HTML five has

228
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.660
a responsibility to be backward
compatible XHTML too. Of course,

229
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.670
this is one of the
reasons that it probably, you

230
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.860
know, ran into a dead
end. Part of the problem

231
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:11.230
is, is it's not backward
compatible with non XML documentation.

232
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.080
So, and mom typing. So
the thing is, is that

233
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.780
if you were running an
XHTML to document and delivering

234
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:21.100
it as XML or application
XML, or XHTML, you would

235
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.150
actually not be able to
have an older browser appear

236
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.460
on that site. They would
either that or an error

237
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.950
would be thrown. It's very,
very, you know, I don't

238
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.460
know how, you know, different
browser vendors would implement that,

239
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.860
but you know, it, it,
it just basically says this

240
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.510
application can't run. Okay. And
your programming stops there. And

241
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.120
that could be okay at
a very high level of

242
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.990
pro production, but for the
democratic web, it simply doesn't

243
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.710
work. So the ideologies in
HTML five were not only

244
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.830
to maintain that backward compatibility
so that we always have

245
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.310
the SGML and the HTML
language, but to also be

246
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.750
inclusive of XML syntax. So
there are two ways that

247
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.230
you can go about writing
HTML five and you can

248
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.760
do it in XML syntax.
Right. What do you mean?

249
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.510
Meaning strict well, Well formed.
Isn't the right word? Well

250
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.680
formed. Well, yeah, strict would
be the rigor XML rigor.

251
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.010
Okay. So the, you know,
every attribute value is quoted.

252
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.160
You use a trailing slash
you make sure that all

253
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.590
your non empty elements are
closed. Exactly. All of the

254
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.950
rules, but the, if you
are going to do X

255
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.450
XML there, you have to
serve as XML. Okay. Application.

256
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.370
I see. Okay. So when
we say serve as one

257
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.750
of the things that you've
been talking about that we

258
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.900
haven't called that explicitly is
the importance of mind types,

259
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.520
which I think is one
of the number one things

260
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.600
that people ignore on the
web And, and that ignorance

261
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.960
that ignorance is, is, is
becomes more of a problem

262
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.390
when the more media types
we get, right? The more,

263
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.030
the more we have needs
there. So I think in,

264
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.360
in an internet Explorer really
never implemented the mine types

265
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.000
for XHTML, which is one
of the reasons that I

266
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.370
think it's not Microsoft's fault.
I mean, there was a

267
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.990
general consensus among browser vendors
that, that XHTML was a

268
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.050
nonstarter. Despite the fact that
we learned a great deal.

269
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.690
I think one of the
things we learned was how

270
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.450
to be better coders. We
learned how to respect the

271
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.970
rigor. And one of my
fears about HTML five is

272
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.520
that because in this other,
in this, in the notation,

273
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.520
the HTML five notation, if
you're using SGML notation or,

274
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.310
well, both are SGML really.
So if you're using the

275
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.570
HTML notation versus the XML
notation in HTML five, the

276
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.270
sloppiness all comes back. If
you want it to, you

277
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:37.200
don't have to, Hey everybody,
this is Scott coming at

278
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.660
you from another place in
time. No doubt. You probably

279
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.210
bump into testing tasks now,
and then, and your work

280
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.850
and, you know, writing functional
tests is probably not your

281
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.100
favorite thing. It's kind of
difficult. It takes time and

282
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.680
the results can be dubious.
Well, get ready to start

283
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.960
liking tests. Thanks to with
the, the new whereby testing

284
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.380
framework building web automation test
is a breeze. You've got

285
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.010
code automation with advanced asp.net
Ajax, and several light applications.

286
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.650
You can write a single
test, have it executed against

287
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.100
multiple browsers at once. You'd
benefit from a rich API

288
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.640
there's link support integration with
visual studio unit testing, also

289
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.000
in unit X unit and
MB unit, not to mention

290
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.850
the free rappers for Telerik
rad controls for ESPN and

291
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.390
Ajax, and several light, all
shipping with Telerik's new testing

292
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.840
tool. One of the best
features, the web testing framework,

293
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.750
which is developed by art
of test is it's absolutely

294
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.560
free. Freddie got hooked on
web by testing framework, start

295
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.800
using it right away, go
to tellerik.com for more info.

296
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.460
Thanks a lot. So for
the six of us that

297
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.250
are listening that have actually
followed this so far, let's

298
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:45.230
just do a real quick
reset. So SGML, it has

299
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.930
tags and elements that we're
familiar with. It uses open,

300
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.230
open angle brackets, right? Except
it's not required to close

301
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.290
the tech. No, no, Let's
go back a sec. Okay.

302
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.340
So SGML the standard generalized
markup language was a language,

303
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.410
a document management Metta language
that was created by in

304
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.720
the sixties, by a guy
named Charles Goldfarb who was

305
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.500
a lawyer. So it's a
huge spec. What it simply

306
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.220
does is it basically create
it. It basically has in

307
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:18.280
it semantics that Tim Berners-Lee
and his colleagues used to

308
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.110
create HTML, which is a
completely different, very, very simplistic

309
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:29.650
for the web markup language.
So the parents of HTML,

310
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.570
you know, HTML is an
application of SGML or a

311
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:41.260
subset of XML is also
an application of SGML. Okay.

312
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.290
So it's like, what we
did is we went back

313
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.410
in the W3C and we
reviewed the sloppiness and we

314
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.680
viewed the problems that we
were finding with that notation

315
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.380
issue. And we said, okay,
we want the XML rigor

316
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.970
XML brings this strictness, this
rigor back into, into it,

317
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.060
makes it more of a,
of a, a programmatic, you

318
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.650
know, process unforgiving on purpose,
on purpose. Right. But still

319
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.570
forgiving. And in that it's
HTML vocabulary, right? So it's

320
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.430
backward compatible, right? So as
long as you're not delivering

321
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.280
it as an XML application,
that is going to be

322
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.600
available to the masses for
as long as browsers are

323
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.850
capable of handling that. So
actually XML, when we look

324
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:28.510
at XML itself, it like
its parent SGML is also

325
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.560
a Metta language. In other
words, we use its guidelines

326
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.150
and its syntax to create
other ontologies and languages. So

327
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.580
HTML is just one of
the vocabularies atrial five is,

328
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.480
is, and it includes both
of these vocals. So does

329
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.940
that mean that H so
HTML five, I've got this,

330
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.010
this taxonomy, this, this glossary
of choices. I different tags

331
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.290
I can use and I
can choose to serve it

332
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:57.540
in a less rigorous, more
SGML like format where I

333
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.510
don't necessarily close every tag,
but I have a mind

334
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.840
type that explicitly declares my
intent to do that. Or

335
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.700
I can return HTML five
and use application forward slash

336
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.360
XML indicating that I choose
to opt into that record.

337
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.800
Right? So either you are
delivering your HTML five document

338
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.380
as an XML document, in
which case you must be

339
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.400
confined to that rigor, or
you are using HTML and

340
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.150
you are sending it as
text HTML text. Yeah. And

341
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.750
that is, and that does
not require the rigor, which

342
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.360
is a concern, a concern
for me as an educator,

343
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.220
I think we can still
maintain good practice and make

344
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.620
sure we still, you know,
when you're working in cross

345
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.620
document management, as I know
you probably have done many

346
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.050
times, it becomes a nightmare
when you have everybody just

347
00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:49.100
different coding styles, getting away
from their HTML. Yeah, exactly.

348
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.080
But I want to get
back to this, this, this,

349
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.750
the importance of the mind
type. Could you juxtapose that

350
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.900
with doc type? Because it
feels like the new web

351
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.860
is putting much more import
on mime type when it

352
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.630
would have previously. I would've
thought about doc type stuff.

353
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.990
Well, actually there's a big
mystique about, or a mystery.

354
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.870
I think about doc types,
that probably would be good

355
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:13.700
to demystify for the audience.
A doc type declaration is

356
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.880
a piece of SGML that
exists at the top of

357
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.600
documents that are SGML or
in the case of XML,

358
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.080
you have an XML declaration
followed by a doc type

359
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.990
declaration. So it's both. So
essentially those declarations were passive.

360
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.330
They were not meant to
do anything, but to declare

361
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.220
which language and which language
version you are using. And

362
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.860
the only time that it
would become active is when

363
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.550
you instigated purposely validation. Okay.
So you went to a

364
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.180
validator or you use some
validation tool. The doc type

365
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.730
was then in his used
venues, this is still true

366
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.390
today. The doc type then
looks at the spec and

367
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.150
compares what you say you're
writing to, to the document

368
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.570
and throws back errors or
warnings based on what you

369
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.660
have done or not done
in that document. Okay. So

370
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.270
really when we think about
doc types, we're thinking about

371
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.450
something that, that was very
passive and was never meant

372
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.080
to be what it does
now in the I E

373
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:16.010
process, when I E six
came along, there were, there

374
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.760
was the implementation of the
HTML box model. And there

375
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.970
was also in, in the
newer rendering. And <inaudible> when

376
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.700
it came out very, very,
you know, great CSS browser.

377
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.830
It would have lasted five
years if it, if it

378
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.080
hadn't been sure, but of
course, five years, a long

379
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.310
time to wait. But that
aside the, there was in

380
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.010
fact in the Trident, the
CSS rent, rent box model,

381
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.610
rendering, and box model rendering
is different, right? Yes. You

382
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.770
just use code names and
things. Oh, I'm not supposed

383
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.090
to do that. You can
use them, just make sure

384
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.100
the listeners know, Try it.
And the is the, is

385
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.450
the rent is the engine,
which within the layout engine

386
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:54.880
inside of I E right.
Okay. And each, each, each

387
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.540
browser has a different layout
engine. Although we see certain

388
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.990
layout engines now being adopted,
like for example, both Safari

389
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.920
and Chrome use a WebKit
engine or pieces of that

390
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.400
engine is the gecko would
be for Mozilla opera is

391
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.510
Presto. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay.
And we're about to emerge

392
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.510
with a new, new version
of that. Very soon, if

393
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.850
we go back to the
dock type issue, what happened

394
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.020
there is. So in order
to be able to make

395
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.310
I E run so that
CSS would be more available

396
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:32.230
and more consistent across browsers.
Some people at Microsoft, including

397
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.170
contact shellac, who is well
known for micro formats. And

398
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.780
I know that, you know,
naming names is always confusing

399
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.410
for people, but he really
deserves some, some credit here

400
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.010
because he had built the
Mac version of, of I

401
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.230
E prior to that, that
what was known as the

402
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.260
Tasman engine. So he took
the doc type along with

403
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.330
somebody else, and they said,
look, what we're going to

404
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.130
do in ice six for
windows is we're going to

405
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.050
put this in there. And
we're gonna use this as

406
00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.520
a switching mechanism so that
if people use the proper

407
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.830
doc type, that will automatically
switch the browser, <inaudible> specifically

408
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.120
into the mode where the
box model is consistent with

409
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.030
other rendering engine box models,
so that we get a

410
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.600
consistent look and feel and
are able to use CSS

411
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.920
based layouts consistently. So there's,
no, This model is padding

412
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.730
margins, right. It's the core
model of what we have

413
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.910
now in CSS. Okay. Okay.
So in order to use

414
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.360
CSS, well, cascading style sheets,
well, and get away from

415
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.630
the deeply nested table based
layouts of that were causing

416
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.600
us certain problems and, you
know, in maintenance and okay.

417
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.350
I was the King of
one pixel gifts inside of

418
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.040
it Too. I mean, I,
you know, if there was,

419
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.020
if there was, you know,
a crime against web standards,

420
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.750
I've committed it, you know,
that's why I think that's

421
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.210
also part of evangelism. You
get, you get the religion

422
00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.420
because you've done all the
mistakes, right? So this is,

423
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.900
it's a very complex issue.
And it's of course, related

424
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.400
to how, how browsers now
other browsers adopted that. So

425
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.370
now we have this doc
type switching, and this now

426
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.550
puts a lot of, a
lot of pressure on the

427
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.530
doc type to be something
more than it ever was.

428
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.780
It is essentially a hack,
but it was one that

429
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.360
was necessary to advance the
web, I think. And that's

430
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.490
why I wanted to call
out, you know, some people

431
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.620
there to, to let you
know, let folks know that,

432
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.570
you know, there's some good
work that people have done,

433
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.990
but it's also added a
layer of confusion for that

434
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:24.750
reason. So it's interesting when
we compare the doc types,

435
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.990
now we would go over
to HTML five and we

436
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.060
look at the doc type
and the doc type is,

437
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:36.090
is simply angle bracket, exclamation
point doc type in lowercase,

438
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:41.610
HTML. That is the doc
type. There's nothing else. It

439
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.310
just says the kind of
document. This is, is an

440
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.390
HTML. That's all it says.
And it will flip the

441
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.990
doc type switch. That's too
simple. How could that possibly

442
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:55.480
work? Cause it's too simple.
It's brilliant in some ways.

443
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.780
And it's also very controversial.
I like it. I saw

444
00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.840
it. It made sense to
me immediately because, well, I

445
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.730
think of the growth of
the web, I think of

446
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.460
like a cone, like an
ice cream cone moving out,

447
00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.740
right? Like where you are
moving out and wider and

448
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.950
wider and wider, right. The
world wide web. Right. So

449
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.100
we, we often forget the
world and we often forget

450
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.790
the wide. So we just
think about the web. And

451
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.800
I think we have to
think about the width of

452
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.690
it and the breadth of
it and how it's going

453
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.630
to grow. And that to
me is representative of saying,

454
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.320
it doesn't matter. This is
just HTML. Okay. So before

455
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.750
you had started saying that
that HTML five is turning

456
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.380
everything on its ear, that
this document focused model that

457
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.470
kind of timid originally in
versioned and visioned rather, excuse

458
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:42.010
me, is now really an
application focused model. Yes. And

459
00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.190
I think that's the inevitable,
you know, the thing that

460
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.490
the, the buzz about web
2.0 and Ajax and all

461
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.180
those technologies that at the
turn of our time, and

462
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.470
in 2000, 2001, around that,
around that time, it, we

463
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.500
really are in the web
2.0 sense without the buzz

464
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.790
word, a web of application,
We're bringing X windows to

465
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.240
the web now. Yes, yes.
We are building software. That's,

466
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.780
that's a different thing Flat
out doing that. It's like,

467
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.240
yes, it's like a, the
web, you know, it's like,

468
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.760
you know what, it was
called VT 100, you know,

469
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.440
and everything was a dump
terminal. And now we have

470
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.680
dump terminals that are dual
core processors that can do

471
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:23.140
30 BT 100, except with
seven 20 <inaudible> It's hysterical.

472
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.540
But it's getting, I wouldn't
say that quite yet, but

473
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.150
it's, it's working toward it.
I mean, it's definitely, you

474
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.420
know, somebody asked me in
a class about HTML five

475
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.820
just last week, you know,
why do we need to

476
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.460
do this? Can't we just
stop right here. And it's

477
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.340
like, no, because where's the
fun in that That would

478
00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.380
be done. I think was
a good question to ask,

479
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.450
can we just be done
for a minute? Okay. No.

480
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.490
Yeah. You know, I just,
I can't ever, I mean,

481
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.500
and that's something I have
to say to people that

482
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.650
are interested in careers in
the web, they have to

483
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.470
really think about, you know,
the fact that nothing is

484
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.940
ever the same and they
have to be willing to

485
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.720
be agile themselves and able
to switch horses. Midstream. You've

486
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.050
described it to, to have
a little analogy overload here.

487
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.790
I've described it as like,
when you're a little kid

488
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.060
and you're running down the
Hill, as long as you

489
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.510
don't look at your feet,
you can run really, really

490
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.670
fast. And then as soon
as you go, Oh crap,

491
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.820
I'm running way too. Right.
On your face. Yeah, exactly.

492
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.090
That's a good analogy. That
is the web. Now I

493
00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.490
profess my ignorance in this,
but as I understand it,

494
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.530
would you say it is
fair to say that the

495
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.350
thing that is kind of,
I wouldn't say holding HTML

496
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.440
five back, but a point
of contention is the codex

497
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.040
around the video tag. I
understand that every browser vendors

498
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.420
putting their weight behind a
different co compressor decompressor, I'm

499
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.450
not so sure it's different
browser vendors that are the

500
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.500
problem. The problem is simply
making sure that we end

501
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.530
up choosing or whatever, if
there's more than one even

502
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.860
better. Right. Choice. Of course,
I'm always about that licensing

503
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.910
and things. Yes. There's patents.
Okay. It's about patents. Yeah.

504
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.240
And software, of course, software
patents, another really, really hot

505
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.060
area where there's going to
be really religious Wars. And

506
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.580
that's what we see HTML
five in and of itself

507
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.810
is highly controversial. There are
many things about it. In

508
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.960
essence, the, you know, that,
that people are not happy

509
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.840
with it is an ongoing
issue. It's, you know, the

510
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.780
spec is, is, is going
to take time. But what's

511
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.110
really interesting is the implementation.
And this is my message

512
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.840
about HTML five, whether we
like it or not implementation

513
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.300
will Trump, the specification, if
the, if it's in the

514
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.360
browser, you know, people are
gonna use it. Right. Yeah.

515
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.420
And it is going into,
in some form, every single

516
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.540
browser, we're all working on
it. Opera Chrome, of course,

517
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.330
is bleeding the way Google
is. We have to be

518
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.490
careful with Google because they
call everything HTML five. And

519
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.610
sometimes it isn't like, you
know, like maybe geolocation, somebody

520
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.510
will say a geolocation API.
All right. So let me

521
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.030
step back a second. And
also mentioned that the other

522
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.280
thing to remember about HTML
five is that it's not

523
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.610
just a document language. We
have new sides to, you

524
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.400
know, we have new elements,
we have new ways of

525
00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.340
doing things in the document,
but the other piece of

526
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.230
it, and of course, Oh,
the other thing is enhanced

527
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.650
forms, web forms, 2.0 Yeah.
I think that people right

528
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.750
now are focusing on the
video tag. If you ask

529
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:09.620
the average, Joe Canvas would
be their, their focus because

530
00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.080
this is something very new.
But we also have to

531
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.540
remember that the other side
of HTML five is in

532
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.490
fact API APIs, it's all
about being able to expand

533
00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.270
through programming and the application
programming interfaces, what we can

534
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.900
do with a browser. So
that's really where the critical

535
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:32.330
shift has, has come. So
to get back to the

536
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:37.670
HTML five, as a, as
a application based, what's really

537
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.180
happening there is that we,
the whole ideology is that

538
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.970
we will be able to
create apps and the software,

539
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.960
the browser, right. It's the
runtime environment. And this is

540
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.470
a fascinating kind of concept
where in essence, this is

541
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.540
a metaphor, but, and it
may be a bad one,

542
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.310
but I like it anyway.
Cause it helps kind of

543
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.640
clarify that browsers now are
really becoming the dot XC

544
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.770
or the.app where our applications
run. Okay. And, and we

545
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.770
have the browser runtime environment
and we really see every

546
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.430
single browser on board with
this, every single browser. So

547
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.700
when you see buy-in from
the W3C and every single

548
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.210
major browser vendor. Yeah. That
to me says, we gotta

549
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.220
pay attention. Well, it's, it's
pretty clear that everyone is

550
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.470
trying to push things forward.
And I know sometimes the

551
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.500
people say that like Microsoft's
trying to hold things back.

552
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.650
I, some people have said
that some of our critics

553
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.260
and I just am watching
all of this, I'm not

554
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.090
involved in any of those
groups, but I found that

555
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.470
the recent announcement of Google
Chrome frame, Oh, that'd be

556
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.920
a really interesting, it's almost
like we're playing thumb war

557
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.270
now. I mean, they actually
use the IAE extensibility model

558
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.920
to insert the, the, the
WebKit base rendering engine inside

559
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.590
of the I E Chrome.
So Chrome within Chrome. It's

560
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.560
very interesting. Yeah. That's, that's
good. Yeah. But the thing

561
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.580
is you have to remember,
okay, Google is calling frame

562
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.160
a plugin. I'm not so
sure it's a plugin. I

563
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.800
don't, I don't think it's
a true plugin because while

564
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.160
it is being something that
gets injected, so somebody has

565
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.670
to download it right. And,
and deploy it in their

566
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.100
it department or on their
local machine, if they want

567
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.100
that value. Right. The other
piece is, is that it

568
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.600
developers then have to say
in their documents Yes. With

569
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.140
an interesting tag that is
itself controversial. It's an extra

570
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.890
way. Compat, the XCA compat
stuff is controversial. I don't

571
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.070
think in the case of,
of frame, it doesn't have

572
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.350
anything to do with versioning,
which is a whole nother

573
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.490
hold. Other Holy war going
on A declaration that Google

574
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.220
is saying is that as
I understand it, that Google

575
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.740
wave is so advanced and
so wonderful. And so super

576
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:49.200
duper that you need this
basically they're punting on compatibility

577
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.320
and standards. And just saying,
we'll run great on our

578
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.140
browser. Yeah. It's a radical
move. And I'm not sure

579
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.750
it's going to work because
it takes both opt in

580
00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.430
from the individual or the
it departments. Right. And or

581
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.280
it also takes the developers
knowing how to activate it.

582
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.220
But it is a statement
if anything that, that, you

583
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.310
know, Google and Google is
doing some very interesting work,

584
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:17.220
but do we really want,
we really want one engine

585
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.830
and that's, that's really the
question we want one in,

586
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.200
because even so let's say,
I mean, many people have

587
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.310
said, even people within IAE
have stated sometimes as on

588
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:28.080
a sidebar conversation, well, why
don't we just put WebKit

589
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.670
or gecko in and get
rid of tried it? Well,

590
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:34.260
of course Trident is the
rendering engine, but everything else,

591
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.390
you, you know, you have
a browser that is tied

592
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.730
to OSS, which is part
of the problem. It's, you

593
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.210
know, the, the, the difficulty
with Microsoft, the challenge that

594
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.910
you have as developers at
Microsoft browsers is that you

595
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.810
are unable to, to create
the software as quickly as

596
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.510
others, because you have to
test in every, in, in

597
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.480
your office environments. Right. And
I think that that's really

598
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.150
what, what the Chrome frame
thing is about. It's trying

599
00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.390
to say, yo, Microsoft, you
know, I can inject this

600
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.690
into you. Yes. And, and
we also see that has

601
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:09.450
happened earlier via Dean Edwards
did htc.htc, which are our

602
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:14.010
internet Explorer only technologies. And
he did JavaScript that basically

603
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.800
added, if you would run
this library and added all

604
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.990
the features that were in
an ISX, right. There's actually

605
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.790
an interest. There's some interesting
work that was being done

606
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.490
by the, the DLR team
at Microsoft, that dynamic language

607
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.890
runtime that would allow you
to have a script that

608
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.360
would say open script tag
type equals text slash Python.

609
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.120
Oh wow. And then we
would use Silverlight, we'd bring

610
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.940
up an invisible zero by
zero Silverlight plugin, like a

611
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.130
flash plug in server light.
Then you would take that

612
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:42.200
script, but actual inline script,
just instead of JavaScript it's

613
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.950
Python or Ruby, and then
drop it into the Silverlight.

614
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.410
So the server light provides
the engine. It's similar to

615
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:52.990
the Chrome frame idea. It's
like injecting another technology. Well,

616
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.900
we can script the web
was JavaScript. Why not script

617
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.210
it with Ruby? And then
it has full Dom access

618
00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.240
and you can write client
side routes. You're making, you're

619
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.100
making me have goosebumps, you
know, cause this is, this

620
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.470
is, this is the stuff
that gets me excited because

621
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.370
we are talking about complex
application development. And I think

622
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.990
it's scary also. I mean,
I think a lot of

623
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.390
people out there in the
field are worried and I

624
00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.340
want to just say that
that's the nature of our

625
00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.500
beast. And I think that
we're going to be fine.

626
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.690
You know, that the things
you're doing today, like my

627
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.820
joke yesterday, when you said,
well, I just, you know,

628
00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.090
I just built XHTML one
strictly I said XHTML is

629
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.750
dead, but it's like, you
know, it was a joke

630
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:31.720
on my part because XHTML,
you can still use it

631
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.450
and serve it as text
HTML. XHTML 1.0, strict as

632
00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:38.110
a perfectly legitimate language for
the current web, My ugly

633
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:43.030
Netscape three. It still looks
great. It's still render sure.

634
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.400
I can still open text
files. So as long as

635
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.440
I have that, Yes, that's
what I would, I would

636
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.050
say, as long as you've
got that backward compatibility and

637
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.360
you're able to progressively enhance
this is, this is how

638
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.910
we grow wide. Yeah. Let
me ask one last question

639
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.220
and, and forgive me if
this is an inappropriate question,

640
00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:02.170
but why do we need
opera? You had presented, well,

641
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.970
why don't we pick WebKit
why don't we pick gecko?

642
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.160
Why don't we pick Presto
and why do we need

643
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:11.800
more choice? Well, Yes. I,
I, I don't know. I

644
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.840
don't know how to answer.
Why do we need opera?

645
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.900
Because actually it's, it's a
hard question because it doesn't

646
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.470
make logical sense to me.
Opera was there very early

647
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:26.560
on operas started building browser
technology before just about anybody.

648
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.710
Okay. Pretty amazing stuff. Early
versions of opera, the scale,

649
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:33.550
the ability to scale The
zoom, that if you think

650
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:37.840
of a feature, we probably
invented it. Probably that doesn't

651
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.910
mean we did it well.
And we also became the

652
00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:41.740
kitchen sink. I think in
a lot of ways just

653
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.680
offer on the web because
the desk, because of that,

654
00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.950
on the desktop, we do
own the mobile web. We

655
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:51.850
are, we opera mini and
opera mobile opera mobile is,

656
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.960
is used on more devices
in the world than any

657
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:59.110
other browser. So we own
that space. And that's where

658
00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.180
it's, it's interesting to know
that opera comes out of

659
00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.470
Telenor. So the Norwegian tele
tele communications network, right? So

660
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.750
this is where they started.
And so their interest in

661
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:10.960
their location, the Scandinavians of
course, with Erickson and Nokia

662
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:16.150
and the rise of the
mobile, the mobile lifestyle really

663
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.390
came from both Asia and
Scandinavia. Right? And so I

664
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.970
think it's only a natural
thing. Now, let me just

665
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.600
say this. What is interesting
about operas technology is what

666
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.180
is in our core is
what goes in every single

667
00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.990
device. So the idea is
to get the best quality

668
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:35.320
experience on every device. And
so we are device oriented,

669
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.550
as well as desktop oriented.
We have had a big

670
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.160
struggle on the desktop. I
think there were a lot

671
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.100
of reasons that that has
happened and far probably we

672
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.120
could talk far, far into
the night about that, but

673
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.760
we are very much, if
you notice, there's a lot

674
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.400
of activity. I mean, clearly
opera's becoming a sponsor at

675
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.800
a major conference in all
parts of the world. Like

676
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.940
here, we've got a whole
evangelical team working on, not

677
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.100
on, not necessarily on evangelizing
opera. We have plenty of

678
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.100
people doing that, but, but
really if you listen to

679
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.560
what people from opera talking
about, they're talking about the

680
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.370
quality of experience and code
and what the web is

681
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.280
becoming. And that is what
we've always done. We've always

682
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.940
been a leader in innovation.
And I think that's what

683
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.450
opera it does offer an
innovative opera is the, is

684
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.630
the innovator. And it's the
little engine that could, and

685
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.670
I think that we are
really, you know, we're really

686
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.910
going to make a presence
on the, on the desktop,

687
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.900
in the future, because of
course we have some wonderful

688
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.650
people, well known designers who
have come in to fix

689
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.080
the problem with the Chrome,
with the Chrome, because the

690
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.010
rendering is great. The problem
really has been that, that

691
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:49.020
it's a kitchen. There's just
too much. Yes. There was

692
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.880
just too much. And how
do you get your mom

693
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.070
to like, like that? So
now we have a lovely

694
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:56.030
interface and I think that's
good. Well, very cool. Well,

695
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.430
thank you so much, Molly.
<inaudible> for hanging out with

696
00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.890
me today and chatting up
web standards. Thank you so

697
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.170
much, Scott. It's been a
pleasure. This has been another

698
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.780
