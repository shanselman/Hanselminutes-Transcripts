9
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.860
today. I'm talking with Helen,
<inaudible> the open source director

10
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.470
of initiatives at 10 up
and the lead developer for

11
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.720
WordPress. How are you? I
am great. How are you

12
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.920
doing Well? I'm getting there.
I'm not, not exactly living

13
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.530
the dream. Of course, we're
recording this during the time

14
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.890
of coronavirus. So I am
sequestered in my home in

15
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.100
Portland, Oregon. Where are you?
I am sequestered in my

16
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.070
home fully down in San
Jose, Costa Rica, Costa Rica. That's where

17
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.510
I think we all want
to be right now. That

18
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.480
sounds amazing. Have you been
there a long time? I

19
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.320
have been here. It's been
almost two years. My husband

20
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.550
is actually Costa Rican and
we have two kids. So

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.790
I kind of overwhelming to
live in the New York Metro,

22
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.210
I guess it's always kind
of overwhelming to live in

23
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.820
the New York Metro, but we
a couple of years ago

24
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.010
just kind of gave up
on it and moved here

25
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.330
to be with family. That
sounds amazing. I understand the

26
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.780
certainly with the, the tightness,
the tight knit aspect of

27
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.610
things in New York, being in
the New York, subway is not

28
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.220
a place to be right
now. Yeah, no, I am

29
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.110
definitely glad to have space
here and the kids are

30
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.010
not going too wild, I
guess. Cause they're not too

31
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.980
cooped up. You know, How
was your Spanish? I was

32
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.160
talking to someone earlier today
and they had amazing English

33
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.680
and after they talked to
me in English, they were

34
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.200
like, Oh, I'm so sorry
for my poor English. And

35
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.320
I'm like, Oh, I can't
sorry for not speaking another

36
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.060
language at all. Yeah, I
speak Spanish. Okay. I think

37
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.630
there's this like perfectionist streak
at me. So I get

38
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.830
really nervous about making mistakes.
And so I kind of

39
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.620
hate doing it. I am,
I'm the same way about

40
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.740
languages in general. And you
know, they always use that

41
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.400
term, idiomatic, whatever. Like, you
know, I can speak Chipotle

42
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.190
they Spanish, but if I
speak idiomatic Spanish, you know,

43
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.960
it doesn't sound right. And
then of course I always

44
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.480
get in trouble cause I
was in the Dominican Republic and

45
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.360
their Spanish is different than
Mexican Spanish, which is the

46
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.460
Spanish that I've learned, which
is different than, you know,

47
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.040
whatever. So then you, you,
you, you say some term

48
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.480
and they're like, Oh my
goodness. We don't say that

49
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.880
here. That's a swear word.
It was like, is it

50
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.100
really a show? Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah. Lots of jokes

51
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.310
about lots of jokes about
straws, I think is I

52
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.100
got in huge trouble with
a straw. We'll talk about

53
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.040
that another time. And we,
don't not on this show,

54
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.100
but yeah, I got an,
a horrible, horrible straw based

55
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.220
Spanish situation. So someone, if
you see me on the

56
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.470
street, friends and listeners of
the podcast, feel free to

57
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.220
ask me about that nightmare
situation. Cause that was bad.

58
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.120
Yeah. And speaking of languages
and idiomatic languages. So I,

59
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.990
I speak C-sharp and you
are one of the lead

60
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.110
developers on WordPress. WordPress is,
is that still primarily or

61
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.500
100% written in PHP on
the service side. It is

62
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.740
primarily, there's a fair amount
of JavaScript now that runs

63
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.130
the new editor and some
other experiences. So that kind

64
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.320
of bridges somewhere between PHP
and JavaScript on the server

65
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.720
side of things. Yeah. Now
PHP, one time I was

66
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.850
a, you know, we always
tease different languages. You always

67
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.470
tease the language that you
don't speak. And then you

68
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.320
talk privately, you know, internally
with your group about how

69
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.660
your language sucks. Like all
of us internally, we talk

70
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.240
about how C sharp sucks,
but I was teasing once

71
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.390
PHP, I think it was
in a talk and someone

72
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.670
said I was language shaming,
but then I went and

73
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.460
looked at the numbers and
PHP is killing it. Like

74
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.410
you can tease PHP all
they want, but it's like

75
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.450
60 million people using the thing.
Yeah. It's, it's, it's honestly

76
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.880
like a big part of
what got me kind of

77
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.820
back into computers after a
long, long time away from

78
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.420
them. Cause it's like instant,
right? Like you just kinda

79
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.840
make this thing go and
it's forgiving in both good

80
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.150
and bad ways. I think
that's what people really like

81
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.610
to make fun of. Right?
Like you can do these

82
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.890
things and in any other
language, it would be like,

83
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.410
that's a dumb thing to
do, but PHP is like,

84
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.710
ah, sure. I'll guess I'll
take a guess as to

85
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.990
what you mean, but that
was kind of the fun

86
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.870
thing about getting into PHP
was that it was forgiving

87
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.450
and it, let me try
a lot of different things

88
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.520
and yeah. And we like
to have our fights in

89
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.250
public. I think that's another
thing about it. It itself

90
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.420
being developed as open source,
right. Is that all the

91
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.920
fights and everything happened in
the open. So it gets

92
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.470
a lot of attention for
that. Why do you think

93
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.680
PHP gets a bad name?
Why do Pete? Why is

94
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.900
it, is it because it's
so popular that people think

95
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.400
they can throw rocks at
it? I think they're a

96
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.430
bunch of different things. I
mean, there is the, you

97
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.620
know, at least in, in
order versions of PHP, how

98
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.610
lax it was about a
lot of things, just, you

99
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.990
know, like typing or yeah,
mostly typing honestly, and not

100
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.990
having like best practices around
how you structure things that

101
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.790
you're writing. Right. Like it
used to be a lot

102
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.310
of procedural code and a
lot of, you know, I

103
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.640
don't know what to call
it, but just a lot

104
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.180
of sort of elitism around,
Oh, you're not using objects.

105
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.750
Not everything can just be
functional the time. Yeah. I

106
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.990
think with, with the type
of usage, I think WordPress

107
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.880
is like this too, right?
Like with that type of,

108
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.960
you have a lot of
eyes on both of the

109
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.820
things that are good and
the things that are bad.

110
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.910
Right. So they just kind
of get a lot more

111
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.090
attention generally. And we like
to pick on things that

112
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.440
are bad, But that, that
lose that looseness, that, that

113
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.200
dynamism, if that's a word
is why it was so

114
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.110
successful. I mean, it's a
fairly young language. It's only

115
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.690
been around for 25 years.
And I think the thing

116
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.060
that's most interesting about PHP
is that it kind of

117
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.040
grew and developed with no
formal specification until like five

118
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.530
years ago or six years
ago. So the first 20

119
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.590
years they were just kinda
making stuff up. Yeah. I

120
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.360
mean, you could see it,
you know, we have, they're

121
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.510
like, there's like a function
to find the date of

122
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.130
Easter in alternate calendars. Like
it's just kind of, there

123
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.280
was a funny language, but
you know, we, it, again,

124
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.340
it works right. Like it
works, we get stuff done.

125
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.220
So Exactly. And that's the
thing. There's no room for

126
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.850
a and when you're getting
work done. Yep. One of

127
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.670
the things that we say
at Microsoft where I work

128
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.100
and my day job is
we, we refer to a

129
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.330
thing about the developers inner
loop, the experience that the

130
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.600
developer goes through to make
a change and then see

131
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.080
the change and how long
it takes. Now, my language

132
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.190
is strongly typed and compiled.
So you could spend a

133
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.920
couple seconds or even many
seconds where you make a

134
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.370
change, compile it, run a
test, hit refresh. The power

135
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.400
of PHP for me has
always been the, make a

136
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.560
change and hit refresh in
the browser. So the amount

137
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.960
of time spent let's just
like hit save, and then

138
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.440
you see immediately what you
just did. And I think

139
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.460
that that's always been the
success for me. Yes, absolutely.

140
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.040
That's that's definitely what drew
me in as well. Like

141
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.160
I mentioned, it just, it
was exciting to get into

142
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.560
something. I was very briefly
a computer science major, double

143
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.180
major. And it was in
Java at the time, I

144
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.200
think was the, the, the
primary language used for classes.

145
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.740
And before that had done
some C plus plus. So

146
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.490
for me, just coming from
compiled languages where everything was

147
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.440
very punitive almost, and, and
taking forever to, you know,

148
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.680
compile things and required certain
resources and all of that,

149
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.950
and to come from that
and having given up on

150
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.870
it, because it was so
frustrating and I did not

151
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.660
have resources available to me
the way that they sort

152
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.800
of expected you to have
to, to get to something

153
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.790
like PHP, where you can
just refresh and everything is

154
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.920
good, was really exciting. And
it kind of reignited my

155
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.450
excitement about computers sort of
generally. And so now I'm

156
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.570
here. I like that because
they're like right now, I

157
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.750
just taught when I went,
my nephew is in school

158
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.810
at Oregon state and he
Skyped me a couple of

159
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.490
days ago because he's like,
I want to be a

160
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.830
computer programmer any, and they're
making them do C plus

161
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.430
plus, and he's just, he's
hating it. And it's, it's

162
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.540
taking his excitement, which was
from age 13 to age

163
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.660
19. And it's just pounding
him into the ground because

164
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.390
he's there like, you know,
write a connect four game

165
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.250
or do a tic TAC
toe and make sure you

166
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.520
use pointers to pointers, to
pointers, to do a raise

167
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.400
of multidimensional, whatever. And he's
just like, but this isn't

168
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.190
like this, isn't what I
signed up for. And it's

169
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.680
like, when my dad told
me, Hey, we're going to

170
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.660
learn, teach you how to
drive. And I'm like, Oh

171
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.310
great. Can I drive this
car? And he's like, no,

172
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.740
no, we're going to learn
to drive, stick shift first.

173
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.110
We're going to make you
suffer. Right. It's like, Hey,

174
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:30.060
let's all learn computers now.
Assembly language. Yeah. That's so

175
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.520
fun. So you, you got,
you got the fun beaten

176
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.660
out of you and then
you found PHP. Yeah. Yeah.

177
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.970
That's totally what it was.
You know, we all started

178
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:44.780
with the like geo cities,
aim profiles, pretty generated each

179
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:48.080
team, a playlist from Winnie
app onto our all profiles.

180
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.370
Right. And we kind of
went from that and tinkering

181
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.430
with HTML. And again, the
fun of seeing something just

182
00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:00.080
happened when you refreshed and
went from that into compiled

183
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.150
languages. And what you said
about like connect four, I

184
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.670
was like, Oh my God,
I'm back in AP, computer

185
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.060
science all over again, being
shoved into that was very

186
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.280
like, this is not exciting
for me. And this is

187
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.030
not something that I relate
to. Right. Like my, when

188
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.490
I thought about, if I
wanted to do computers for

189
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.140
a living, what would I
want to do? And for

190
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.020
me, it was never like,
I want to write, you

191
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.920
know, operating systems. I don't
want to write games when

192
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.370
I'm familiar with is the
web. I'm familiar with stuff

193
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.030
on the internet. Right. That's
my, my generation, my childhood.

194
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.120
And for me, it was
very much like, okay, this

195
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.620
is not what I want
to do. I don't see

196
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.000
how it's relevant at all.
And I don't want to

197
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.890
do it anymore. So I
stopped doing it for a

198
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.630
long time. Cool. Who remember
like geo cities and, you

199
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.270
know, they've, they've gone and
made similar sites. You can

200
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.820
find Neo cities. But like,
if I talk to someone

201
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.530
who's in their twenties and
they say, Oh man, geo

202
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.340
cities and my space and,
you know, few source, it's

203
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.900
always so disappointing. Now, when
you go and do a

204
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.180
view source on a website
and it's completely unreadable and

205
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.910
you go, Oh, that's a
single div and some JavaScript

206
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.120
that's office gated. Do you
think that WordPress is kind

207
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.370
of the new geo cities
or is there a generation

208
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.400
that's WordPress? Is there they're
geo cities? That's the thing

209
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.760
that they're hacking on and
getting passionate about? I think

210
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.640
specifically in the developer and
the open source community. Yes.

211
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.780
There are a significant number
of people who came up

212
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.150
through a project like WordPress
and for a lot of

213
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.420
people that is exactly WordPress,
right? Like hacking on themes

214
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.580
or, you know, trying to
figure out what the bug

215
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.460
is and doing what we
always tell people not to

216
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.930
do like hacking core, like,
you know, altering core P

217
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.990
you know, WordPress files on
the server. So we do

218
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.430
have a lot of people
who've kind of come up

219
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.470
through that. And a lot
of it again, is thanks

220
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.490
to it being just like
PHP, HTML, and basic CSS

221
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.370
for a long time. We
had no preprocessor and a

222
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.010
lot of, a lot of
opposition to that was that

223
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.760
feeling of, you know, as
such a large project and

224
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.180
one that's so established in
the open source community, you

225
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.080
know, do you still have
the obligation to occupy this

226
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.150
sort of like entry level
space, right. Where we continue

227
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:15.970
as a project to, you
know, not over prioritize tooling

228
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.440
over the experience of not
just incoming contributors to WordPress,

229
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.790
but people who are learning
about open source and PHP

230
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.970
and CMS is, and whatever,
you know, all for the

231
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.790
first time. And so that's
something that we, I think

232
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.370
we struggle with a little
bit as a project is,

233
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.310
you know, how do we
move forward with something like

234
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.440
Gutenberg, which is the JavaScript
react based editor that we

235
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.710
have now, I guess it's
been a couple of years,

236
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.830
but so we have this,
we have this new editor

237
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.560
and it's JavaScript based. And
so it has, you know,

238
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.060
like a build process and,
you know, processors and typing.

239
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.240
And I don't even by
self necessarily know what's in

240
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.000
there as a lead developer,
cause it's a huge project

241
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.640
and it kind of runs
on its own leadership on

242
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.030
the side. And we merge
parts of it back into

243
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.110
the WordPress itself from time
to time. So, you know,

244
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.060
we, we struggle with that
is, you know, how do

245
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.530
you create a process that
still welcomes people to participate

246
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.620
no matter their skill level
and no matter their skill

247
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.380
set. Right. Cause it doesn't
necessarily have to be code.

248
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.160
We want people to be
able to participate in documentation

249
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.980
and you know, community events
and that sort of thing

250
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.090
as well. Right. So how
do we balance this desire

251
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.610
to move forward and to
be modern and all the

252
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.860
things that people like to
tease WordPress about, right? Like

253
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.990
for not, not being on
the cutting edge all the

254
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.110
time, but how do we
balance that with continuing to

255
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:49.540
want to bring people into
contributing, to open source broadly,

256
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.140
it's not just about WordPress,
like it's about that stewardship

257
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.510
for anything that you use
and then awareness that what

258
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.110
you're using is being built
by volunteers. And we want

259
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.660
everybody to be able to
participate in that process and

260
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.930
be aware of The fact
that everything is built by

261
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.380
volunteers, but there's still, there's
still on the part of

262
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.990
the users such as sense
of entitlement must be very

263
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.900
frustrating. I mean, you must,
I'm sure you've been either

264
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.000
on the phone or on
the other side of a

265
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.140
great deal of anger from
someone who's personally upset with

266
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.730
you because you represent WordPress
to them and their business

267
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.490
is now down because they
edited a file that they

268
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.460
shouldn't have directly on the
production server, et cetera, et

269
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.120
cetera. Why do they think
that they deserve your pound

270
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.690
of flesh, even though you're
a volunteer It's I think

271
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.720
in the WordPress space, it's
a little more complicated than

272
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.760
it can be for some
other projects. So in the

273
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.290
WordPress space, some people are
sponsored to work on things.

274
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.400
Automatic itself sponsors a ton
of people to work on

275
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.110
just the core software product
itself. Right. So that that's

276
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.400
their contribution back to, you
know, the community that upholds

277
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.670
its business. And so my
position is the same. I

278
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.930
am sponsored to work on
WordPress and WordPress related things

279
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.560
for the most part. I
like I don't work on

280
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.350
client stuff. Right. So tenet
is an agency. We do

281
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:17.030
client services. I very rarely
touch anything on the client

282
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.680
front. So my time is
a contribution back to the

283
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.710
open source community in that
world. It's a little more

284
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.950
complicated. I think like it,
I can understand somebody feeling

285
00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.180
like I'm personally responsible for
something, right. I would prefer

286
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.810
that they not, you know,
like be rude to me

287
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.700
or call me names, all
of which have happened. But

288
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.030
that part, I do understand
a little bit better. And

289
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.840
I don't, I don't expect
people out there who are

290
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.520
just running websites to necessarily
understand that, you know, this

291
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:59.450
thing exists as a publicly
created public. Good. I think

292
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.380
that's in human terms and
especially in, you know, like

293
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.960
the modern world that can
be sort of like just

294
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.830
hard to wrap your head
around at all, right. It's

295
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.830
hard, these free products. I
mean, Mike, to my parents,

296
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.730
to my nontechnical parents, Facebook
is a product that they

297
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.490
feel that they've purchased, but
they didn't put in a

298
00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.710
credit card. They just use
it. Therefore it must be

299
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.730
a thing. Therefore someone must
support them, Right. Somebody somewhere

300
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.720
is making money. Therefore somebody
is getting paid to help

301
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.610
me is sort of the
simplified thought process. Right. So,

302
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.690
yeah. So I think WordPress
there, I think there are

303
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.940
fewer and fewer honestly significant
volunteers in the community, right?

304
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:45.280
So the volunteerism is funded
in a lot of ways

305
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.970
by other companies who have
built their businesses, you know,

306
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:54.310
building WordPress sites or WordPress
products. So in, in our

307
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.830
space, it's become a lot
of, you know, funded work.

308
00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.930
So it's volunteerism in that
it's voluntary, but it's not

309
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.670
volunteerism as an it's devoid
of any sort of transactional

310
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:12.940
money component. Is that possible?
Only because of WordPress's dramatic

311
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.730
success. I mean, in like
I'm in the.net space, which

312
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.980
is certainly smaller than PHP
and there's a lot of

313
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.610
like super useful, like low
level stuff that people make.

314
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.260
And it may have been
one or two people working

315
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.560
on it and they're all
doing it entirely volunteerism, but

316
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.100
you can't compare a small
utility library and C-sharp, that

317
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.550
is used by 10,000 people
to something like WordPress, which

318
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.940
is used by hundreds of
millions of people. But how

319
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.890
do you get there? How
do you introduce someone into

320
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.780
open source and say, Hey,
this could also be a

321
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.970
career and you could potentially
get paid for working on

322
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.610
this and get sponsored as
well. I think in the

323
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.240
WordPress space, it's very much
that we continue to focus

324
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.330
on non developer experiences. Right?
And I, and again, I

325
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.220
think that that's also opened
us up to a lot

326
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.000
of criticism, you know, good
and bad over the years

327
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.350
in that we don't prioritize
developers. In some ways we

328
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.830
maybe make their lives worse
because we require certain things

329
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.260
around backwards compatibility. And we
ask that people create experiences

330
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.890
within a WordPress admin that
maybe doesn't provide everything experience-wise.

331
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.470
So you kind of have
to get imaginative about how

332
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.990
you integrate with it. So
that users are not left

333
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:27.330
feeling like they're using 17
different products within one administrative

334
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:32.070
interface. So like C panel,
right? Like every, every single

335
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.740
thing that you use in
C panel is like something

336
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.620
different entirely. Right? And we
don't want that in the

337
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.230
WordPress space. We want people
to feel like, you know,

338
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.630
when they click on something
in WordPress to edit some

339
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.450
settings or some content or
whatever it is that it's

340
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.490
going to be familiar, that
you're going to know what

341
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.390
to do, sort of intuitively
hopefully it'll kind of guide

342
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.510
you through it and that
you can save your changes

343
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.900
and not have it destroy
anything. Right. We want to

344
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.990
build this. We prioritize user
trust is what we talk

345
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.470
about. So the, the trust
of the user that they're

346
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.350
not going to lose content,
that they can try out

347
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.800
settings and preview them without
it being destructive or permanent.

348
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.400
These are all things that
are about building user trust.

349
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.940
But when we talk about
users, we're talking about non

350
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.540
non developer users. And so
in that space, we have

351
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.920
a much bigger audience, right.
Of people who can use

352
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:31.170
our products and use our
work. So you, there are

353
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.470
people who develop, you know,
like utilities in the WordPress

354
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.580
space, right? Like theme things
to like build themes on

355
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.910
top of various tooling. Like
at 10 up, we do

356
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.600
these things where we have
like a Docker image that

357
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:51.870
supports, you know, local WordPress
development. Or I think we

358
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.980
have, like, I don't know
a jobs system kind of

359
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.340
thing that uses WordPress. So
we have, you know, a

360
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:02.760
bunch of things that are
more technical developer oriented, but

361
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.220
for the most part, especially
what I work on in

362
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.860
the open source end of
things, these are things that

363
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:13.530
are geared toward nontechnical users.
Right? And I think that

364
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.660
that's, that's been a big
part of it is just

365
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.670
that we are, we're appealing
toward a much bigger group

366
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.030
and a group that, you
know, in many ways is

367
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.660
used to paying for software,
right. Or at least support

368
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.450
for their software. And so
that's the space that we

369
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:38.750
to operated is the consulting
space, right? Providing services, No

370
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.360
one wants to manage databases
if they can avoid it.

371
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.490
That's why Mongo DB made
Mongo DB Atlas, a global

372
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:51.340
cloud service that runs on
AWS, GCP and Azure. You

373
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.030
can deploy a fully managed
Mongo DB database in minutes

374
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.850
with just a few clicks
or a few API calls,

375
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.370
Mongo DB, Atlas, automates deployment,
automates updates, handles scaling, and

376
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.520
more so that you can
focus on your application instead

377
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.220
of taking care of your
database, you can get started

378
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:15.550
free@mongodb.com slash Atlas. Now, if
you're already managing a Mongo

379
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.480
DB deployment, Atlas has a
live migration service. So you

380
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.390
can migrate it easily with
minimal downtime and then get

381
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.810
back to what matters, stop
managing your database and start

382
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:30.640
using Mongo DB Atlas. So
these, these core tenants, these

383
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.520
kind of this, we believe,
you know, the 10 commandments

384
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.530
of WordPress and what you
all believe you, there's a

385
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.290
core leadership team, right. And
you've got the WordPress co

386
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.470
founder, Matt, and then there's
five is a correct five

387
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.990
lead developers. And then a
number of core developers. It's

388
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.790
kind of, there's kind of
a hierarchy there. Did that

389
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.100
naturally happen? How did you
become a lead developer? That's

390
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.740
a really good question. Sometimes
I'm not, I'm not 100%

391
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:57.900
sure. I, it's not a
very clear or clean hierarchy.

392
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.430
We have sort of these
labels and we sometimes function

393
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.630
in those roles. I think
that with, especially with Gutenberg

394
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.930
and the way that it's
changed, like the pace and

395
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:14.670
structure of development of WordPress
itself, it's somewhat less relevant.

396
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.780
What, what that named hierarchy
means. But yeah, I, I

397
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:27.060
started with wanting to understand
what opensource meant. Cause I

398
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.280
had no idea what it
meant. I worked at a

399
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.340
university as a web developer
and we were using WordPress

400
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.090
for some projects. And I
thought, you know, I see

401
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.210
something in the WordPress admin
that looks funny to me.

402
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.840
And I just wanna like
understand what, what does open

403
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.390
source mean? They keep telling
me, you can, if you

404
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.940
see something wrong, you can
do something about it. And

405
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.840
what does that even mean?
You know, what subversion, what,

406
00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:56.190
what does CSS? I dunno.
And so I submitted a

407
00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:00.300
patch. We use track, people
hate it. We use track

408
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:06.030
and subversion and patch files
still. So I, yeah, Sorry.

409
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.670
I didn't mean to say
it like that. It's fine.

410
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.820
You can use get hub.
We have some tools around

411
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.220
that, but yeah, for the
most part for years, it's

412
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.280
been version, track and patch
files. No, I, I did

413
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.350
that. I mean, I lived
that whole thing. That was

414
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.020
15 years ago. I still
love patch files, but whatever.

415
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:27.240
So I submitted a patch
file for some CSS to

416
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.890
fix like a border on
something and got some feedback

417
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.200
very quickly. That was like,
you also have to make

418
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.800
this other change and like
very quickly iterated on it.

419
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.560
And they merged it into
WordPress. And that was like

420
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.770
my first open source contribution,
I think about years ago.

421
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.000
And so I was like,
Whoa, that's, I mean, just

422
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.040
like the quickness of their
process. And I think that

423
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.010
even that, you know, the,
the team was prioritizing first

424
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.850
time contributors to kind of
give you that satisfaction and

425
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.160
let you decide whether or
not that was something you

426
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.240
wanted to keep participating in.
And so I was, I

427
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.110
was hooked on it and
was like, Oh wow, this

428
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.480
is super cool. I want
to, I want to keep

429
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.320
doing this and just kind
of stuck with it. Some

430
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.880
of it was front end
development, even though at the

431
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.950
time I wasn't a friend
developer at all. I was

432
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:22.220
like a PHP and my
SQL applications developer and just

433
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.920
kinda stuck with it. And
over the years, I guess,

434
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.950
gained, gained a lot of
trust and went to a

435
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.800
lot of community events. So
we have word camps, right?

436
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.990
Like local, local conferences about
various aspects of WordPress. And

437
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:40.430
so I would go to
those and eventually landed at

438
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.230
up as a first employee,
actually about eight and a

439
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.220
half years ago and landed
at 10 up and over

440
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.580
the years had, you know,
more and more community time,

441
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.930
what we call it given
to me. And in 2013,

442
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.490
after my first maternity leave,
when I came back to

443
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.490
Tennessee after maternity leave, I
basically just never rolled back

444
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.120
on the client projects and
went full time into open

445
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.690
source work. So I'm hearing
that I'm interested in something

446
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.370
I'm going to poke at
it. I want to understand

447
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.420
this and then showing up
consistently, like if you could,

448
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.450
is showing up is how
you succeed in open source.

449
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.360
You are, Hey, it's Helen
again. Oh, she is helpful.

450
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.120
Oh, look at this. And
then you just keep showing

451
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.090
up until they, they, they
move you up in the

452
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.700
process and they go, wow.
The people who showed up

453
00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.980
are here and the people
who stopped showing up, we

454
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.070
don't talk to them anymore.
I mean, when everything is

455
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.880
online, right? Like we're, we're
using now we use Slack

456
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.850
in that time. It was
IRC, but you're, you're just

457
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:51.730
doing text, text based chat.
Right. And so my handle

458
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.390
has always been Helen because
they're not very many Helens,

459
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.960
I guess. So even on
Freenode I was just Helen.

460
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.880
I was, I was Scott
at AOL. Yep. There you

461
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.540
go. Early adopter. Now I'm
Helen on like GitHub and

462
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.540
a whole bunch of things.
So I'm just not very

463
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.600
many of us, I guess.
And so I always use

464
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.120
my real name. So I
think it was, I think

465
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.000
even easier for people to
recognize that I was continuing

466
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.070
to show up. And I
think another part of it

467
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.710
was also being willing to
say like, Oh, I was

468
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.570
definitely wrong about that. Right.
Rather than letting a mistake,

469
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:33.160
sit and fester and like
never acknowledge it, you know?

470
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.130
And especially in opensource because
like somebody else will probably

471
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.120
see it at some point
and experience it. And I

472
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.100
think there was also a
lot of value in just

473
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.970
being proactive and being like,
wait, wait, wait, that was

474
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.560
not great. Let's try something
else. Or, you know, I

475
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.620
would like to you, you
know, revert my patch and

476
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.310
try to attack, or here's
a patch that, you know,

477
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.870
is maybe a little too
forward facing right now, but

478
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.760
you know, five years from
now, it might become relevant.

479
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.730
So let me just throw
it up here basically for,

480
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.870
you know, to see if
it means anything later on.

481
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.960
So yeah, there's a lot
of value in showing up

482
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.200
and not necessarily like being
hyper productive, right. Like I

483
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.860
think there's too much focus
on how do you define

484
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.480
productivity and how do you
meet, you know, goals and

485
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.170
KPIs or whatever. Right. And
I think, I think that

486
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.630
that in open source at
least is not nearly as

487
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.970
important and it's much more
important to be consistent and

488
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.610
to be honest about what's
going on. And I think

489
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.200
people do notice that I
think that that's True. Like

490
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.990
I think that we, we,
and I'm, I don't know

491
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.000
who the Royal we is
in this context, but we

492
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.220
seem to mythologize the, you
know, the, the, the, the

493
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:51.530
mean super hyper productive 10
X developer, and it's all

494
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.020
a myth. I would much
rather have a very nice

495
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.920
pleasant. One X developer who
shows up consistently is easy

496
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.280
to work with and has
both good technical skills and

497
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.650
is also pleasant on conference
calls. You know what I

498
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.780
mean? Like, what is the
name for that developer? Let's

499
00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.970
have, give me 10 of
those and we'll have a

500
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.700
nice little project Professionals I
think is what we used

501
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.750
to call Nationals. That is
a very, I love that

502
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.970
we should make more professionals.
So this Gutenberg I'm seeing,

503
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.810
there's really interesting articles around
like, you know, is word,

504
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:29.420
press survive, Gutenberg, you know,
it's pretty interesting stuff and

505
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.550
it's, it's a lovely editor.
And one of the things

506
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.070
that I've noticed about it
is that to your original

507
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.770
point, at the very beginning
of the podcast, focusing on

508
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:42.410
users, you know, when WordPress
for me was the blog

509
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.890
that allowed people to upload
eight megabyte JPEGs, and then

510
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.680
resize them, ruin the aspect
ratio and then keep them

511
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.100
there. So then I could
visit their website and you

512
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.390
know, like, Oh, look, I
took a look at my

513
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.360
website for my bagel shop.
That's like a 25 Meg

514
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.100
website and I hit F
12 and I go, Oh

515
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.150
my God, you uploaded an
eight Meg JPEG. But Gutenberg

516
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.870
in doing that, it allows
the customer to fall into

517
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.960
what we at Microsoft call
the pit of success. Like,

518
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.600
even if you messed up,
it's you still succeed. Like

519
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.570
your, your images are pretty
and they have all text

520
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.670
and they have title and
they'd got resized correctly and

521
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.980
you can't, you really have
to work to mess up

522
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.530
the aspect ratio. Why would
anyone have a problem with

523
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.010
that? That sounds great. Yeah.
I, you know, I think

524
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.280
there's, Oh, let's see. There,
there are a lot of

525
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.730
things tied up in that
one. One thing is that

526
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:36.020
separately from the editor itself,
there have been, there's been

527
00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.980
a big push to meet
better web standards. I mean,

528
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.390
WordPress itself was about web
standards. I know that when

529
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.820
Matt talks about, you know,
the origins of WordPress, a

530
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.030
lot of it was about
wanting to have Symantec, HTML

531
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.810
and micro formats and ping
backs and trackbacks and RSS

532
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.490
feeds and all of that,
right. About being a part

533
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.370
of the open web and
being a part of, you

534
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:01.030
know, information sharing. And so
there is this continue to

535
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.390
push for, you know, web
standards. So one thing that

536
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.930
was implemented, I mean, years
ago, before it was even,

537
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:12.940
I think a formal, formal
spec was responsive images, right?

538
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.360
Where you upload stuff to
WordPress and it does its

539
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.140
best to chop it into
a bunch of different, you

540
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.480
know, sizes and compressions and,
and make those available so

541
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.800
that you're no longer defaulting
to 25 Meg images. Right.

542
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.650
And I think another fairly
recent change, actually, there were

543
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.440
two, two parts, one was
longer ago, which was that

544
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:44.590
somebody went through and did
a whole study about the

545
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:48.640
effects that changing the default
compression would have on JPEGs.

546
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.600
So they use like an
algorithm to detect like the

547
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.290
differences and what is your
threshold of tolerance as like

548
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.590
a human viewer and presented
all of that work. And

549
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.590
so we changed the default
compression and it, I mean,

550
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.350
it saved, I don't know,
the actual statistics are out

551
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.000
there somewhere, so I'm not
just gonna make up numbers,

552
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.880
but the amount of bandwidth
that we were saving, you

553
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.090
know, in such a large
percentage of the web and

554
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.460
with more and more people
uploading images directly from their

555
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.400
phones, right. Where we have
like up until recently, no

556
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.210
control over the size of
those, I think made a

557
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:26.500
big difference. And then you
get into things like, you

558
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.290
know, serving up responsive sizes
for different devices. And then

559
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.890
I think Gutenberg itself as
the editor, I think gives

560
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.890
you a better sense of
how exactly it's going to

561
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:43.360
look on the front end.
Right. So instead of figuring,

562
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.610
okay, I'll just put the
biggest size image, cause that's

563
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.590
going to be the best
possible look, no matter what

564
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.530
somebody is using, it gives
you a better shot at

565
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.170
understanding, you know, this, this
image size is going to

566
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.640
look great, you know, in
most situations. Yeah. It makes

567
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.560
responsive design like for the
humans, for normal people. Yeah.

568
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.740
I've been watching all of
the, like the web, like

569
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.000
you all, I'm always impressed
when you go to a

570
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.220
website and you scroll down
and then like they have

571
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.230
like the really low res
version of the image. And

572
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.970
then it kind of fades
in because now it's in

573
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.460
the viewport and you're looking
at it and then, you

574
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.950
know, I'll put up like
a really big animated gift,

575
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.360
but I don't want to
mess up someone on a

576
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.690
low data plan overseas. All
of that should be handled

577
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.080
magically for me by some
image thing in the background.

578
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.620
But unfortunately my images are
just big giant images that

579
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.050
sit on an FTP server
and it's nice. It's 2020,

580
00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.960
that's horrible. I should do
better. I should get WordPress.

581
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.690
Well, we, you know, we
would love for you to

582
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.950
use WordPress. And if I,
if I can plug else,

583
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.490
one of the things that
I've been working on recently,

584
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.550
like within our own like
10 up open opensource projects

585
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.180
is a plugin a, we
call it classify. I'm not,

586
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.060
I'm not much for like,
Oh, let's remember names of

587
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.410
things, but it's a plugin
that connects with various, you

588
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:02.210
know, cloud services to sort
of automatically process and categorize

589
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:06.560
your content. So right now
we're using as so yay.

590
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.420
Shout out to Microsoft, we're
using that for image processing.

591
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.020
Right? So when you upload
an image, it automatically gets

592
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.700
back a caption as your
all tag and some taxonomy

593
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.010
data. Right? So like I
see, like it sees a

594
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.320
building or it sees a
sandwich or whatever. So now

595
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.740
you have all of that
data in WordPress for you

596
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:33.410
automatically. So not only for
you as like the administrator

597
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.840
or content creator on your
own site, you're now able

598
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.660
to like search for things
without you manually having to

599
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.680
tag everything. And then for
your readers, for the consumers

600
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.430
of your site, they're getting
all tags on images again,

601
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:50.540
without you having to necessarily
put effort into it immediately.

602
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.840
Right. So instead of all
of these images that have

603
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.950
like, you know, DSC 1980
as they're all tagged, because

604
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.140
we pick that up from
the file name. Now you're

605
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.260
actually getting a description of
like, you know, a person

606
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.550
smiling in sunglasses or whatever.
And so it's just a

607
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.790
better experience all around for
everybody, right? To be able

608
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.570
to provide descriptive text for
various technologies and users, and

609
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.630
then for you as a
content manager to actually be

610
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.330
able to like find your
content later. It's really nice

611
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.520
to have. So if you're
interested, what does that plugin

612
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.810
called again? Classify. So we
spell it like classify C

613
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:37.160
L a S S I
F a I classify classify

614
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.160
plugin.com. I'll make sure to
put a link to that

615
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.670
in the show notes. Thanks
so much for chatting with

616
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.310
me today. Of course. Thanks
for having me. We've been

617
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.180
talking with Helen host, Sandy.
She's a lead developer at

618
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:53.450
WordPress and the director of
open source initiatives for 10

619
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:56.360
up. We'll have links to
the show notes to Helen

620
00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.980
on Twitter, as well as
tenup.com. Thanks so much. This

621
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.980
has been another episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

622
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:19.300
again. Next time. <inaudible>.
