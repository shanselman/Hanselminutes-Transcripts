00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.360
In this episode, it's gotten
crawled discussed calendar synchronization. Hi,

12
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.600
this is Carl Franklin and you're
listening to Hansel minutes. I'm

13
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
here with Scott Hanselman. Of
course. Hi Scott. How's it

14
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.610
going? It's good to be
back in the old chair

15
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.470
again. Yeah, it's fits good
at, we have a number

16
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.380
of interview shows there for
awhile and I suffice to

17
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.810
say, I thought they were
great. Well, let's get right

18
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.790
back into what we do
the best, which is complaining

19
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.930
about Microsoft office. Absolutely. So
I've had an immense amount

20
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.450
of pain recently about this
DST change. Have you missed

21
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.150
any appointments because of it?
Yes. As a matter of

22
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.310
fact, I had to have
my cell phone, which is

23
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.900
running windows pocket PC 2003.
I had to have that

24
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.110
in the Atlantic time zone.
So for the last month

25
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.520
I've been living off the
coast of Connecticut insane. We've

26
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.230
had a heck of a
time. One of the things

27
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.660
that really almost got me
in a lot of trouble

28
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.790
actually was we were supposed
to go and visit a

29
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.720
daycare. And my, my wife
uses Google calendar and I

30
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.230
sync my outlook with her
Google calendar. I use outlook

31
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.170
2007. And somehow during that
middle place, that, that kind

32
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.340
of dead man zone when
daylight savings times was supposed

33
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.290
to start. And the new
one started there was that

34
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.060
kind of two week period.
Her, her, her appointments were

35
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.530
an hour forward. So they
were showing up in my

36
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.230
outlook as being an hour
later than they really were.

37
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.390
You know, I also saw
a story on dig that

38
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.960
this whole thing has been
for. Not no, no electricity

39
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.810
was saved. It was just
a big waste of time.

40
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.200
Yeah, well it did get
me thinking about sinking calendars

41
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.590
and stuff. The wife really,
really likes Google calendar. A

42
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.650
lot uses it all the
time. And you know, recently

43
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.350
I had my dad's email
lost, so I've been, he

44
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.060
lost actually two years of
email. Well, he lost it.

45
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.270
I lost it. Outlook PST
file. No, it was actually

46
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.840
Thunderbird and I lost his
email. I copied something around

47
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.910
then somehow I got nailed.
I don't know what happened.

48
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.390
Well, my mother too, she
used Thunderbird and lost a

49
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.830
whole bunch of stuff. I
don't know what the story

50
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.930
was. Well, in this particular
instance, it was me being

51
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.300
stupid. I'm not really sure
how it happened, but the

52
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.330
point is, I'm trying to
think about synchronizing. These folks'

53
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.490
lives. He's got a really
old Palm pilot. He's got

54
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.360
calendar information in the Palm
application. He's got email and

55
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.470
Thunderbird. The wife's got stuff,
email on Gmail, email calendar

56
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.310
on calendar. Exactly. So I
wanted to make it so

57
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.430
I could see my wife's
Google calendar in my outlook.

58
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.650
And she could see my
outlook calendar in her Google

59
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.070
calendar. And Just real quick.
Did it work? Did you

60
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.680
actually find a solution? Yeah,
Exactly. And that's what this

61
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.860
podcast is all about. Kidding.
Cause this is no trivial

62
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.830
task, You know, and the
fact that it's no trivial

63
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.860
task and that I struggled
with, it kind of speaks

64
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.980
to the state of internet
calendars in general. Right? Cause

65
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.250
there's this ICL format. If
you've probably seen this before,

66
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.030
it's not a particularly amazing
format. It's actually kind of

67
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.430
difficult to read. It looks
like an old style, any

68
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.950
file it's, you know, it's
a very not, well, I

69
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.170
guess I'm saying, and I
mean a bigoted way that

70
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.150
if it's not angled brackets,
then I don't really think

71
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.490
it's pretty. Okay. So I
mean, it's certainly not an

72
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:26.880
XML based format, but this
I California is these standard

73
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.820
just like V cards are
the standards for passing people's

74
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.900
contact information around and Google
calendar is really good about

75
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.070
this. You can go into
Google calendar, click on, share

76
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.790
this calendar within one of
your calendars. And they'll give

77
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.510
you a, not a particularly
secure link, but a very

78
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.080
obfuscated link to that particular
calendar. So is it to

79
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.270
you? It's not a web
service. It's just a link

80
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.730
you can hit anytime. It's
just a link. They've got

81
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.280
basically three different kinds of
links that they'll give you.

82
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.900
They'll give you a, an
XML link, which is their

83
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.930
own kind of format. They'll
give you an I Cal

84
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.540
link and then they'll give
you an HTML link. And

85
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.400
these are all links that
you could give someone if,

86
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.780
if you wanted to show
them your, your calendar. So

87
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.820
the, the I Cal link
was the one that I

88
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.890
was most interested in. So
I have to go explicitly

89
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.220
into my sharing settings and
then share. I can either

90
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.010
share all my information or
just my free, busy information.

91
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.220
So I shared my free
busy information within my Google

92
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.790
calendar. Now this is getting
a little complicated here. I'm

93
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.790
lost already. Let's back up.
Okay. So here's the deal.

94
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.060
My wife has Google calendar,
right? I want, let's start

95
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.130
this way. I want to
see her calendar in my

96
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.800
outlook. So let's figure that
out. So we go into

97
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.770
her calendar and she clicks
on share my calendar. Okay.

98
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.350
It gives her a, a
link with a good in

99
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.560
the Earl, right? That is
for an I Cal file.

100
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.680
Got it. Then I go
into outlook 2007. I click

101
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.790
on tools, account settings and
tools, account settings. There's a

102
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.480
number of things now, including
RSS feeds, you know, you

103
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.260
can get RSS within Google
and a new tab called

104
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.830
internet calendars. So I say
new internet calendar, and I

105
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.030
give the link to her
ICS file, which is the

106
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.630
big, long Google good link.
Really sometimes you'll see these

107
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.140
on the net with web
Cal Colin, whack whack in

108
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.070
front of it, rather than
HDP colon whack. Hm. Which

109
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.740
is interestingly becoming very popular,
which I think is ironic

110
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.430
because I was all about
the whole feed colon quack.

111
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.210
Right. And everyone else thought
that was lame. But then

112
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.490
at the same people are
excited about ICS files. So

113
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.090
whatever. So then I go,
We can talk about that

114
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.280
on another show. Cause I
have some opinions about the

115
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.800
feedback rack thing. It's kind
of weak. It is. It's

116
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.200
not it's HTML. Yeah. PTA
rather it's HDDP yeah. So

117
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.220
then I can subscribe to
her calendar and then it'll

118
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.110
automatically show up in my
outlook 2007 as another calendar,

119
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.560
which I can then click
the little checkbox and I

120
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.710
can actually overlay a ghost
of her calendar over mine.

121
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.110
So this makes, you know,
deciding when we're going to

122
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.940
have dinner and have people
over for dinner or this,

123
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.970
you know, the Easter egg
hunt this year or whatever

124
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.700
it makes coordinating really easily
because I can see her

125
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.920
Google calendar. Okay. Okay. So
now on my other monitor

126
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.800
here, I've got her calendar
up in Google calendar. I

127
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.260
want it so she can
see my free busy information.

128
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.070
And this is where it
got really hairy. So first

129
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.690
I said, Oh, well maybe
I'll use some of the

130
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.310
new features of outlook 2007
and I'll publish my calendar.

131
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.350
So I go and I
click and outlook and I

132
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.100
click publish my calendar back
in the day. You know,

133
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.900
you could do all sorts
of things back in the

134
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.430
day in the betas, you
could do a number of

135
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.530
weird things with outlook 2007.
They made it a little

136
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.010
harder. Now, if you right
click on your calendar, you

137
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.100
can say publish to internet.
And you've got two choices.

138
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.330
You can either publish to
office online, which is like

139
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.300
a whole kind of universe.
I click on that basically

140
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.360
they'll ask me for my,
my passport, my live account,

141
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.200
and I can publish the
availability or the limited details

142
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.690
or whatever, and I can
make it available to the

143
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.080
community or just to invite
a users. Okay. So like

144
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.290
we're merging with another company
right now and they don't

145
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.560
use outlook. So, and, but
for security reasons, I don't

146
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.080
want to publish the full
details of my calendar, but

147
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.550
I do want those guys
to be able to schedule

148
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.990
meetings. So I publish my
calendar to office online and

149
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.960
I publish just my availability.
So it shows free, busy

150
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.180
out of office. And then
I get a private link

151
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.920
that I can email those
guys and they can see

152
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.730
an HTML representation of my
calendar, not the ideal thing.

153
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.350
Cause they're, I mean, they're
using notes or something. I

154
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.290
don't know. And, and again,
it's not, it's not the

155
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.300
details of where you are
and what you're doing. It's

156
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.680
just, just the general availability.
Yeah. Out of busy and

157
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.060
out of box actually that's
or I can right. Click

158
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.060
what's ideal because it's not
integrated. Right. I could go

159
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.430
and say publish to web
dev server and I could

160
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.970
put maybe Polish it to
hanselman.com if I wanted to

161
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.490
and have more kind of
more control as opposed to

162
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.700
having office do it. But
in this instance, I really

163
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.900
just want to get my
stuff into her Google. Yeah.

164
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.420
So I started looking around
for this and what I've

165
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.090
found is a number of
different tools. That'll do this

166
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.960
because they're basically using the
Google calendar API APIs. But

167
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.350
the one that just worked
was this sink, my Cal

168
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.560
sink, my cal.com or@ashrinkstir.com slash
and M Z. I think

169
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.960
the real Earl is easier
than the shrinks to Earl

170
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.210
in that instance. And this
is basically a outlook add

171
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.860
in that synchronizes automatically to
the, it puts a toolbar

172
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.380
in your, your outlook and
synchronizes to the Google calendar.

173
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.130
Nice. It can be upload,
download details, not details, et

174
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.680
cetera, and works with 2007
works fine. They say that

175
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.450
they're working on getting this
to work in the PDA,

176
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.490
but I'll talk about some
other tools that'll already do

177
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.710
that. So then basically I'm
synchronizing my information, the private

178
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.010
information up to me, the,
the, not the private information,

179
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.020
but just the details that,
about where I'm going to

180
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.230
be in stuff up to
my Google calendar. So I

181
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.070
made a Google calendar. Okay.
Okay. Yeah. Made it private,

182
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.320
invited just my wife to
it. So now she sees

183
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.310
in her Google calendars, a
Scott Hanselman calendar that she

184
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.280
can then click on it.
It'll overlay my information. It's

185
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.390
private to her. Doesn't include
proprietary information about work stuff,

186
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.160
but lets her know where
I'm going to be generally

187
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.190
during the, during the day
and lets her schedule stuff,

188
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.170
Schedule stuff. Okay. So she
can add something like, you

189
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.200
know, pick up milk at
the store on your way

190
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.870
home. Exactly. So this is
the part that's tricky. You

191
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.290
can either synchronize, which would
set it. So if she

192
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.840
added something like an invite
to my Google calendar, cause

193
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.660
she has that power, it
would show up automatically in

194
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.440
my outlook and invite to
like, like, like sending me

195
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.540
an ICS file, like an,
like a, like an outlook

196
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.690
meeting request. Okay. The notion
of a meeting request is

197
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.140
not a unique to outlook
thing. Right. But I like

198
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.500
to be able to decline
tentative accept. So I set

199
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.920
my sync, my Cal to
just upload. So basically my

200
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.550
Google calendar is a snapshot
and I do this with

201
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.580
all my synchronization type situations.
I don't ever want to

202
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.530
have multiple authoritative sources. Right.
So Google is a read

203
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.340
only calendar kind of thing.
Exactly, exactly. Right. So Google

204
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.680
is my read only calendar.
If she wants to add

205
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.380
something to my calendar, she
just goes into Google, adds

206
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.860
it to her calendar says
invite Scott. Then it shows

207
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.800
up in my outlook at
work as an invite I

208
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.530
add, I accepted it gets
added to my calendar, shows

209
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.230
up on Google. Everyone's happy.
Okay. And I know this

210
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.460
sounds a little more administrative
it's like Robin. Yeah, exactly,

211
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.390
exactly. Advantage. Kind of the
circle of calendar life. It

212
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.060
might sound a little, a
little bit. Ministrative like, wow,

213
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.270
you make your wife send
you invites. It's not that

214
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.640
bad. I mean, literally she
manages her life. I mean,

215
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.560
I'm looking at her calendar
right now. We've got Easter

216
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.320
egg, Hong Kong, Easter egg hunt
on Saturday. We've got a

217
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.140
play date on Monday, went
to the zoo and you

218
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.710
know, it's, it's, it's very
straightforward stuff. But if she

219
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.070
doesn't know if I'm going
to be, if I, you

220
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.840
know, she will, I tell
her everything, but I'm saying

221
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.240
that I'm like, here we
go. We've got a dinner

222
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.780
on Friday, but I've got
some people visiting from out

223
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.960
of town to visit Karelian
to visit our company. She

224
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.990
can see that those people
visiting might, but right up

225
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.470
against that particular dinner. And
she can see that without

226
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.200
having to, to do this
all sorts of coordination. Well,

227
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.390
what are you doing Friday?
Dah, dah, dah. It really

228
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.480
is very seamless. The point
is that I feel really

229
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.870
comfortable in outlook and she
feels really comfortable in Google.

230
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.110
And between the two, we
have the best of both

231
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.360
worlds. I see her calendar
and outlook. She sees mine

232
00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.130
and Google. Then I have
a Blackberry right Before you

233
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.270
get into that. Sure. What,
what would this be all

234
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.490
easier if she used that
look like my wife uses

235
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.890
outlook and I use outlook.
So, but we haven't gotten

236
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.470
into the calendar synchronization stuff
that I know. Is there

237
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.940
would, would it be easier
for us just to publish

238
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.020
to office online and to
use that? Yeah. That's a

239
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.820
very good point. One of
the issues is that there's

240
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.480
still this split brain thing
with outlook. There's the people

241
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.270
on exchange and people not
on exchange and we are

242
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.450
not on exchange. Right. So
yeah, if you are not

243
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.610
on exchange, you're using pop
or I'm app and you're

244
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.830
using, and you're both using
outlook and you're cool with

245
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.460
that then. Yeah. You could
totally publish the calendar to

246
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.490
office online and then each
of you could subscribe to

247
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.350
the other and then It's
the way to do it.

248
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.600
I mean, there's your machine
running? No, if you're both

249
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.000
running outlook, that's the easiest
possible thing to do. Okay.

250
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.850
If you're both, both running
out, unless you want to

251
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.580
run a hosted exchange. No,
no, no. I get it.

252
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.070
Yeah, Exactly. It's it kind
of gets messy. Now there

253
00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:01.350
are other ways for awhile.
I was using Plaxo, flax.com.

254
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.110
Keep your contacts in sync.
Sort of like a viral

255
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.840
marketing thing too. Isn't it?
I mean, well, I like

256
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.120
sort of like sign up
your buddies to put all

257
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.660
their contact information. What's weird
is that you see that

258
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.790
it's somebody's birthday and you
email them a thing that

259
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.130
says happy birthday and they
didn't even know they freak

260
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.080
out. They're like, how did
you know that? Well that's

261
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.120
because they weren't being thoughtful
about what they chose to

262
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.990
share on Plaxo. Glaxo has
a very good privacy policy.

263
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.600
They have a full time
individual. Who's their privacy officer.

264
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.120
I like plaques. So a
lot, you know, I use

265
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.160
it, but I'm very specific
about what people can see

266
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.500
and what they can't see.
Yeah. But I, but plaques

267
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.890
was a great way. If
you have outlook at work,

268
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:42.660
running exchange and outlook at
home, not running exchange and

269
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.850
you want to keep your
calendars in sync, but you

270
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.590
need to check with your
it department to make sure

271
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.050
that kind of stuff is
cool because of course Microsoft

272
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.560
has shut that down. They
don't like that idea, but

273
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.720
that's just one example of
how you can synchronize your

274
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.450
calendars. Okay. You were talking
about your Blackberry. Okay. So

275
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.900
my Blackberry uses the Blackberry
enterprise server or whatever. And

276
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.060
I don't know anything about
that, but I do know

277
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.370
that all I had to
do was tell the it

278
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.300
guys, make sure my calendar
is synchronized. So my Blackberry

279
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.500
calendar happens. The synchronization happens
automatically. So if my wife

280
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.830
sends me an invite, it
shows up my calendar and

281
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.650
it'll show up on my
Blackberry wirelessly just because blackberries

282
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.730
are magic. So what's nice
about this is that. Now

283
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.850
I have the one calendar,
my work outlook calendar on

284
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.060
exchange. I liked your explanation
of that. Blackberries are magic.

285
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.700
Blackberries are magic. I have
no idea how they work.

286
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.950
They're absolute voodoo. They just
work. It's like, it's an

287
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.920
appliance for me. It's like
my refrigerator. Okay. I would

288
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.900
freak out if it stopped
working. So I've got my,

289
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.100
my main calendar, my outlook
at work, we synchronize it

290
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.780
to Google calendar read only
partial details. If Google calendar

291
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.790
went away, my, I don't
have to worry about my

292
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.450
data because it's in exchange.
It also gets synchronized to

293
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.870
the Blackberry. So the idea
here is that you want

294
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.410
your, your, your calendar, your
life, your brain, your extra

295
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.900
brain here to be synchronized
in a way that is

296
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.790
seamless. If you have to
think about any of this

297
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.390
stuff, then you're, you're in
trouble. Right? What I'm just

298
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.820
sick about is that this
is, this is necessary at

299
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.580
all. There's a really great
blog post. This guy wrote

300
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.150
called the Holy grail of
calendar sync at a <inaudible>

301
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.380
dot com slash N and
six N as in Nancy

302
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.300
and, and six. And he's
got this amazing kind of

303
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.760
manifesto about the Holy grail
of synchronization. He's got outlook,

304
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.570
calendar, iPod, and a mobile
phone, all shrink and rising.

305
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.530
And it's absolutely insane. That
is insane. And he's got

306
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.580
this amazing diagram. He's actually
drawn it all up. I'm

307
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.430
looking at it and he's
look, he's got calendars contacts.

308
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.700
He's got outlook sinking to
his iPod outlook, sinking to

309
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.560
his mobile phone outlook, sinking
to something called schedule world.com,

310
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.970
which then sinks to Gmail
and Google calendar. And then

311
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.260
his work outlook goes into
schedule world. That seems so

312
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.780
fragile. Well, you know, it
seems kind of fragile, but

313
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.640
if you really think about
what I just described, I'm

314
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.430
kind of doing the same
thing, Michelle, right? I got

315
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.740
outlook and work and home
talking to via plaque. So

316
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.570
Google calendar and Gmail though,
are, are, are sinking via

317
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.020
these, these plugins. If you're
going to do something like

318
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.400
this, no matter how you
do it, whether you do

319
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.020
it this way or my
way or some way that

320
00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.510
you came up with your
own, I would really encourage

321
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.080
people to be aware of
what's being sent around. I'm

322
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.040
all about privacy information. And
I don't want like my

323
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.160
account, my, my contacts. I
don't sync those with, with

324
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.170
my iPod. I don't want
to lose my iPod and

325
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.410
have someone, you know, like
Paris Hilton lost her phone

326
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.510
and suddenly Tom cruise gets
a call. Cause his number

327
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.610
was in her phone. I
don't want to be the

328
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.620
guy that, you know, when
Carl Franklin's phone phone number

329
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.240
gets out and people start
calling you Carl with not

330
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.100
much of a problem, but
you know what I'm saying?

331
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.760
But things like this, I,
each tool that I look

332
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.170
at, I want to make
sure I have the ability

333
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.260
to filter, to provide access.
I don't need to include

334
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.570
notes. I want to be
able to send just free

335
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:10.050
busy information in some places
know where your data is.

336
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.200
And especially at work. Now
that outlook 2007 includes a

337
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.770
lot of really nice share
my calendar type stuff. Be

338
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.610
sure to right click on
the, on the appointments that

339
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.180
you don't want to be
a public and click the

340
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.360
private check box. You know,
there's no reason for my

341
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.930
dentist appointment to be published
out to the universe as,

342
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.730
Hey, Scott's got a dentist
appointment and that's why he's

343
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.580
not coming to the code
review that day, right? If

344
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.430
private stuff should stay private
and it seems like such

345
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.220
a simple thing, but people
forget that, you know, and

346
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.320
then we've got a lot
of shared calendars. You click

347
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.840
on one, somebody's got a
massage and a Thursday morning

348
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.000
TMI, too much information, right?
Private, private appointment. I say,

349
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.290
there's also ways to sync
your pocket PC to your

350
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.210
Google calendar. Lots of people
have been trying to figure

351
00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:03.160
this out. shrinker.com/n N four
is one. Well, Your links

352
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.900
to founders. If your Google
calendar is sync to outlook,

353
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.060
how it looks things to
your pocket PC, why don't

354
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.610
you pick those things up?
Sure. But there are people

355
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.390
who don't necessarily want to
use outlook to do that

356
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.940
kind of work. Also, there
might be people who are

357
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.060
using outlook 2003, and they
want to be able to

358
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.330
synchronize to outlook 2003 and
then synchronize to their pocket

359
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.250
pieces. Right? So you want
to just go Google right

360
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.710
to your pocket PC. You
never know. There's all sorts

361
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.440
of ways. People work their
stuff. There is a, an

362
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.490
open source project called remote
calendar. It's unsourced forge, it

363
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.360
shrinks your slash and N
five. And this is basically

364
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.470
a, an open source project
that lets you to plug

365
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.010
in into outlook 2003. That
lets you speak to anything

366
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:50.690
that talks by Cal. Okay.
Alright. So subscribe. There are

367
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.900
lots of I calendar things
out there. For example, there

368
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.460
was a website around here
in Portland. I think it

369
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.610
was called like kids in
Portland. And it was basically

370
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.560
a guy publishing an I
calendar feed basically. And I

371
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.800
calendar as a feed of
events going on around town.

372
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.790
You can find Al I
calendar feeds out there about

373
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.140
concerts or your favorite band.
I calendar used correctly can

374
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.970
actually be like RSS for
events. So it's a really

375
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.060
great way to find out
about information and subscribe in

376
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.050
your calendar. That Google's ad
that added that recently in

377
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.960
their Google calendar. If you
have a Google calendar account,

378
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.640
you can see that right
next to the search. My

379
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.510
calendars button is a search
public events. So people have

380
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.720
been using Google calendar and
making ones for their band

381
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.260
for, for their organization that
you could then subscribe to.

382
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.370
Cool. Very cool stuff. How
do you manage your calendar?

383
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:51.190
I I'm just straight Outlook
and a pocket PC. Yup.

384
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.190
And, and I rely on
my pocket PC for reminders

385
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.550
and things like that. If
you know, so that's basically

386
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.160
yeah. What it is in
your pocket. PC is a

387
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.410
phone also. Yeah. It's pocket
PC phone. So you got

388
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:06.330
the smart World phone, the
Samsung eight 30. Yeah. Yep.

389
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.990
I love it. Your wife
just uses outlook. Yeah. Is

390
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.330
outlook. And when you know,
there's things that she needs

391
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.910
to invite me to, she
just invites me. Yeah. So,

392
00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.270
so what are the rest
of your family use? What's

393
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.580
your mom use for her?
For her calendar. All right.

394
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.740
Well, you know, my dad's
no longer with us. My

395
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.300
mom, she uses, she doesn't
use a calendar, a computer

396
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.990
calendar. She uses the computer
for surfing and something to

397
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.000
yell at because she doesn't
have my brother and I

398
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.430
around anymore. So Well, I've
been trying to turn on

399
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.350
some of the family members
onto, you know, open source

400
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.810
stuff. A lot of people
are using Firefox using a

401
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.410
Thunderbird, no reason to use
an outlook license for mom

402
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:50.670
and dad. I've been looking
at Mozilla Sunbird, you've seen

403
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.090
this. It's basically like it's
like Firebird Thunderbird. Sunbird, it's

404
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.210
a cross platform calendar application.
And what's great about it

405
00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.750
is that it uses ICL,
right? So you could potentially

406
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.600
sync your Google calendar to
your Sunbird and vice versa.

407
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.410
This I Cal format it's
sloppy, but you know, when

408
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.960
it works, it pretty much
works. Of course, in the

409
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.890
example that I gave earlier
about Google calendar, they kind

410
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.920
of goofed up on the
daylight savings time stuff. And

411
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.340
I, I sniff the wire
and watch the, the ICS

412
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.170
file coming down and the
dates were just flat out

413
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.770
wrong. My wife's for my
wife's appointments that were showing

414
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.950
up an hour late. Bummer.
Yeah. It was a bummer.

415
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.410
It's amazing how these things
cause a lot of pain

416
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.780
and you don't even realize
it until, you know, your

417
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.510
calendar just works. And then
one day it stops on.

418
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.590
Last thing I wanted to
mention is that Microsoft is

419
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.330
really actually kind of getting
in onto this whole, this

420
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:47.220
whole thing. They respect that
people have Google calendars out

421
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.070
there and there's actually a,
what do you call it?

422
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.850
A knowledge base article on
how to sync Google calendar

423
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.390
with office with office 2007.
So this is at a

424
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.350
shrink stir slash a, I
think it's N N eight.

425
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.590
And this is up at
the office online. And it's

426
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.470
step by step on how
to synchronize your, your calendars.

427
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.440
I think the point is
is that if you have

428
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.440
been looking for a solution
for this kind of problem,

429
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.600
you maybe never got around
to it. I think this

430
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.510
is a pretty good time.
The I Cal format works

431
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.180
nicely. You've got tools like
Sunbird, you've got sink. My

432
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.630
Cal, if you are interested
in getting your calendar life

433
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.300
organized, you know, what better
time than now, you know?

434
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.490
So there's, there's a task
for the weekend for folks

435
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.280
to synchronize their calendars Stuff
is actually working. That's a

436
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.950
good sign. Yeah. This that
I got to go in.

437
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.730
I think I'm on a
trial of sync Michaela. It's

438
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.650
probably time for me to
pay for it. Okay. Well,

439
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.530
Scott, that's a great show.
I'm very timely because I

440
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.330
was interested in all this
stuff and thanks once again.

441
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.460
All right. Good deal. All
right. And we'll see you

442
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:57.430
next time. <inaudible>.
