technologist Scott Hanselman. This is
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number 567.

10
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.610
In this episode, scout talks
with his wife Mo discussing

11
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.400
her health, her new job
and his recent trip to

12
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.990
Kenya and South Africa. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

13
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.320
another episode of Hansel minutes.
It has been two or

14
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.090
300 episodes since I had
my wife on episode two

15
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.630
14. I think it was
on relationship hacks, which started

16
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.170
us working on the book
that we have never released.

17
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.550
Hello love. Why did we
not release the book? We're

18
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.160
like four or five chapters
in and then life happened.

19
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.650
Yeah, I mean, I was
at school, went to work

20
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.340
that can see lot of
happened. And I was told

21
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.530
not to finish it by
myself. Cause it wouldn't be

22
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.500
a relationship book. If I
wrote it by myself, that's

23
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.240
more of a monologue really?
You know, this was the

24
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.640
book my wife said was
not okay for me to

25
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.400
write. Yeah, we need to
get that book done. I

26
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.950
need to quit my job
and we need to finish

27
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.070
that book. No kidding. I
think it will be an

28
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.740
important book when we get
to it. Yeah, it's been

29
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.030
busy. I think it was
up. So 214, we did

30
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.370
a thing on relationship packs
and we talked about the

31
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.070
allowance system and all that
kind of stuff. But since

32
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.520
then you had cancer and
we did an episode of

33
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.650
this developer's life about cancer.
I know how you are,

34
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.940
but here's the question. How
are you? Thank you for

35
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.900
asking how's that cancer on.
Yeah. You know, only in

36
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.940
this household and the hands
on the household, could I

37
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.240
be told, get away from
diet cancer? I did not

38
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.530
say diet cancer either died.
Cancer, cancer, light cancer, light.

39
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.830
It wasn't cancer zero, but
I'm just saying it could

40
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.100
have been worse. Absolutely. It
could have been worse. And

41
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.260
I'm glad that, you know,
again, I didn't need chemo.

42
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.990
I didn't need radiation. So
it really feels like it

43
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.780
was a bullet dodged. It's
going to be five years

44
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.970
this year and it's pretty
exciting. It's pretty exciting. I'm

45
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.820
glad that so far knock
on wood. I've been good,

46
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.430
Right? So no, no chemo,
but extensive surgery with some

47
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.920
side effects, but you're basically
100% people can't tell that

48
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.420
you had cancer when you
walking around. Oh, which of

49
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.270
course is the point You
got all your fingers and

50
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.360
toes. Right? You got the
important stuff I've got the

51
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.400
important stuff is here for
cancer light. To be clear.

52
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.280
I don't remember saying cancer.
I think the point was

53
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.160
it could have been. Yeah,
absolutely. And I don't want

54
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.370
to make a, Now we're
here making fun of cancer

55
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.590
people. We have had friends
who have had considerably the

56
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.350
worst cancers. So to be
clear, we are not trying

57
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.580
to make light of cancer
just yours. No, I think

58
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.830
part of it was, I'm
sure we talked about this

59
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.640
before as the guilt of
having this big label assigned

60
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.940
to me when I felt
good and have continued to

61
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.490
feel good. It is very
hard sometimes to, to be

62
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.680
told, Oh yeah. Oh, you
have cancer. And you have

63
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.190
people give you this respect
and, and look at you

64
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.920
with such all. And you
think I don't deserve this

65
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.810
because my experience was different
than most. And again, I'll

66
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.830
take a second to tell
people, go in for your

67
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.470
annual exams, go in and
get your tests done because

68
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.570
truly it could save your
life as it did mine.

69
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.260
Right. This was picked up
on, on an annual exam,

70
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.720
on a regular exam. And
as we all know that

71
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.030
there are multiple stages of
cancer and this was one

72
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.970
of the, the lower one,
two, three stages and not

73
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.520
the major, like major stages.
So yeah. And just, just

74
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.710
same thing kind of applies
with, with diabetes. Like people

75
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.290
will see my pump, my
insulin pump, and they'll say,

76
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.410
Oh, you have really bad
diabetes. Like, Oh my goodness.

77
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.360
And then suddenly they start
treating you with this deference

78
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.890
that's maybe undeserved, right? Because
there are diabetics that have

79
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.930
brittle diabetes or have become
unconscious and crash their car.

80
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.380
Who am I to complain
so levels in all things.

81
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.520
Yeah, absolutely. I think, you
know, for me, the, the

82
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.690
one sort of takeaway from
this experience was an innocence

83
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.260
was lost if you will,
as far as how I

84
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.990
perceive my body, you know,
and that's been interesting to

85
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.420
me in part, because I
am a nurse now and

86
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.980
you know, I see people
coming all the time to

87
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.100
the hospital, but also because
of my own journey where

88
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.100
it's like, yeah, you know,
you talked about brittle diabetes,

89
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.650
this, this faith, if you
will let ahead in my

90
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.430
body that, you know, my,
my job was to, to

91
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.420
continue to do the best
I could to eat. You

92
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.490
know? I mean, I don't
eat amazingly well, I don't

93
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.800
exercise like at all. Okay.
Co-sign that you do not

94
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.890
eat amazing, But that's still
for the most part, you

95
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.680
know, I don't eat junk
food 24 seven. Right. We

96
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.910
don't, we don't drink, we
don't smoke. We don't eat

97
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.410
junk. We, when you say
innocence lost, you're really meaning

98
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.670
that you're not invincible and
you finally figured out. Yeah.

99
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.710
Yeah. And it's, it manifests
in very interesting ways. When

100
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.660
I was going to nursing
school, they, they required that

101
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.420
we take these tests and
one of the tests that

102
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.710
I needed, I think it
need an xray for this.

103
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.240
And I needed blood work
for that. And I just

104
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.580
remember thinking, Oh my gosh,
you know, this reminded me

105
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.560
so much of when I
went in for my path,

106
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.740
I was feeling just fine.
Had no symptoms at all.

107
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.780
You know? And then when
all of a sudden Diane,

108
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.280
I was told, okay, you
have cancer. So I was

109
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.640
kind of, I had this
anxiety of, okay, I'm going

110
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.560
in for, it's supposed to
be a routine blood test

111
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.630
for school, you know, who
knows what else they're going

112
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.030
to find. And as it
turned out, you couldn't come

113
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.320
with me. I think you
had to drop the boys

114
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.000
off at school or something
when I got the results.

115
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.880
And I remember sitting in
the car, holding this envelope

116
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.450
and thinking, okay, here we
go again. So yeah, that,

117
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.980
that really, I had never
felt that before, before I

118
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.780
just took my part for
granted, of course I was

119
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.820
fine. Of course I felt
fine, you know, kind of

120
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.340
thing. So that's been an
interesting thing that I've sort

121
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.080
of taken away from my
experience. Remember also, one of

122
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.600
the weird things about your
cancer situation is that you

123
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.600
learned, you had cancer through
a, a clerical mistake where

124
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.930
they called you, the, the
cancer doctor called for an

125
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.070
appointment and said, hi, we're
calling from the oncologist to

126
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.980
make an appointment, to deal
with your cancer. And you

127
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.210
were like, Whoa, I had
cancer because the doctor had

128
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.970
been calling from a blocked
number. So we don't pick

129
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.980
up on known numbers and
we'd missed that out. So

130
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.130
after a week of him
calling after your path, he

131
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.100
finally gave up and referred
you to the cancer doctor.

132
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.940
So unfortunately we learned from
the scheduler that you have

133
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.320
cancer, which is not the
way you want to learn

134
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.500
these things. Yeah. I mean,
it didn't go down quite

135
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.100
like that. I wasn't ignoring
any cause. Cause we, you

136
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.060
know, we listened to voicemail.
Right. Actively. I know the

137
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.680
point is, was we never
heard the guy was calling.

138
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.200
I mean, didn't even know
He didn't call, he didn't

139
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.920
call. He, he got a
consult and the oncologist assumed

140
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.520
that he was doing a
handoff. So my OB GYN

141
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.800
called the oncologist and said,
I want to consult on

142
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.750
such and such a patient.
And then colleges took that

143
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.750
to me. I'm transferring her
to your care. So then

144
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.780
college is very efficient and
got his people working on

145
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.570
it. So yeah, not quite
as long, I thought we

146
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.000
were missing his calls because
I blocked on own calls

147
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.360
and they don't even ring.
No, no, it wasn't that.

148
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.580
But anyway, he was going
to call me when he

149
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.040
got back from vacation. So
the whole thing was quite,

150
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.960
But is it a comedy
of errors is the point.

151
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.420
Yeah, but again, I mean,
I think the truth of

152
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.560
the matter is no matter
how you learn, if it

153
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.560
being told that you have
cancer is never going to

154
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.960
be a good day for
anybody. Right. I don't care

155
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.030
if my we'll be joined
himself had called me. It

156
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.270
still would not have been
a good experience that yes,

157
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.180
definitely far better to hear
it from him than to

158
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.360
hear it from the secretary
who then was doing her

159
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.190
best. I mean, talk about
somebody at a rough day

160
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.440
at the office. I can
imagine that she had a

161
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.380
pretty bad day that day.
You know, she just, you

162
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.810
could just hear in her
voice, she was just felt

163
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.780
so bad that I'm so
sorry. I'm trying to backpedal.

164
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.940
How do you undo that
and how do you, how

165
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.370
do you sell that, that,
you know, rung Mo I

166
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.430
mean, rung, Hanselman, what, when
do you say, you know,

167
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.860
but it's, it is what
it is and we got

168
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.240
through it and yeah, So
many years ago when we

169
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.060
did the first podcast, you
have, you have an MBA,

170
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.670
you were doing finance, you
were working at a nonprofit

171
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.200
fast forward. Now you are
working nurse as a medical

172
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.520
surgical nurse. Did you getting
cancer caused you to go

173
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.460
into nursing or is that
unrelated? It was unrelated. I

174
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.150
had already started the process
of taking classes. I was

175
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.230
doing anatomy and physiology at
the time. So actually having

176
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.780
the classes kind of helped
me cause they were a

177
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.360
distraction, you know? So there
wasn't a lot of downtime

178
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.580
to sit there and sort
of have a pity party.

179
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.650
I mean, between, you know,
you being on the road

180
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.660
every so often and the
kids and then me being

181
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.330
in class that there just,
wasn't a lot of downtime

182
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.100
for me to agonize and
worry and be like, Oh

183
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.950
my gosh, you know, it
was pretty much just go

184
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.170
in and get the path,
come back at the results,

185
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.730
go back again, you know,
back and forth, do what

186
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.680
we had to do, have
the surgery. And I remember

187
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.840
like a couple, I had
my surgery on a Friday

188
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.840
and then on Tuesday I
had an anatomy physiology exam.

189
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.730
And it just, just like,
you gotta, you gotta do

190
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.100
it all. You gotta repeat
the class and no way,

191
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.960
cause I repeat it, you
know, I was going to

192
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.730
drop out of the class
or anything like that. So

193
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.360
it really helped me. I
mean, it's it's of course

194
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.030
by far was the support
that I got from you

195
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.640
right in family and stuff
like that. But having other

196
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.480
things to distract me, made
the time pass by quicker.

197
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.760
And I, in hindsight, I
really appreciate that and thankful

198
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.980
that I had that. So
It seems like you and

199
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.350
I tend to do dumb
stuff like that. I remember

200
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.760
I had my appendix out
on a Tuesday and then

201
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.980
that Wednesday or Thursday, I
was on a plane to

202
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.120
Sweden for a conference. And
I remember being scolded for

203
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.130
doing stuff immediately after surgery.
So it seems to be

204
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.060
a recurring theme of staying
busy, but also perhaps making

205
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.270
foolish decisions. So we do,
I mean, if it was

206
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.370
foolishness on your part, because
you had a choice, you

207
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.080
know, for me, I was
committed. It was a class

208
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.420
for God's sake, man. I
had no choice. My hands

209
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.050
were tied. Why don't we
do stuff like that? Like

210
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.840
I just got back from
South Africa and then you were

211
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.450
mad at me because I
didn't take Monday off work.

212
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.220
Are we both trying to
tell each other to take

213
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.430
a break and we each
refuse to do it? Oh,

214
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.170
you refused to do it.
Don't take a break all

215
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.500
the time. I'm trying to
imply symmetry here and the

216
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.900
relationship and you are not
taking, you're not going for

217
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.170
it. Why, why is that?
There is none. I'm the

218
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.010
better person. No, but seriously
we both do that. We

219
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.680
knew neither one of us
takes the other's advice for

220
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.050
like chilling out. We're always
telling each other, you should

221
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.770
probably chill out. Yeah. I
mean, when you know, most

222
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.930
people, I think I'm pretty
bad at that. You know,

223
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.880
we know what the right
thing to do is in

224
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.860
some of these cases we
just don't do it. So

225
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.140
yeah. We both need to
get better at that. And

226
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.900
it's a responsible thing to
do really. You know, you

227
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.700
know, you're gonna be jetlagged
take a day or two

228
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.580
and just give yourself permission
to recover and along event.

229
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.840
Yeah. So I went to
South Africa and I got to

230
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.910
speak at a couple of
conferences and I went to,

231
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.080
and while I was in
South Africa, I got to hang

232
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.470
out with your family. Cause
you've got seven. Well, you

233
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.590
are four of seven. So
there's six brothers and sisters

234
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.310
get to hang out with
them. This is the second

235
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.520
time we went. One of
us went down there, but

236
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.880
we didn't go together. Right.
They came up here for

237
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.580
our 15 year wedding vow,
renewal. But that was an

238
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.280
interesting thing like like 10
years ago, I don't think

239
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.370
I would imagine like traveling
alone, like me going to

240
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.080
see your family, who you
going to see your family

241
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.050
alone. Because when you're at
that point in marriage where

242
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.180
it's like, we have to
do everything together, you know,

243
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.160
we have to buy all
produce together. We have to

244
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.070
go to the shop. You
know what I'm saying? But

245
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.500
now we're like, yeah, I'm
going to South Africa. I'll see

246
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.170
your family while I'm there.
You know what I'm saying?

247
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.620
Is that like something that's
only happens after 15, 17

248
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.030
years of marriage? I don't
know. I mean, I think

249
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.610
as we mature right in
the relationship, I mean, we

250
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.610
get more comfortable with each
other and you probably have

251
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.520
got more comfortable with my
family. Right. We are a

252
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.310
bit of an obnoxious group
and it takes awhile to

253
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.540
really get us and what
we're about. And so by

254
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.040
the time you reach, you
know, once it has a

255
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.750
10 year Mark, I think
you're in you. You've made

256
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.730
it the decided, okay, this
guy is here to stay.

257
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.510
I think it's 17 years
this year. Right. I keep

258
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.260
saying 15, but you corrected
me today, publicly on Facebook.

259
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.150
Thank you for that. That
it's 17 years. I'm I

260
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.700
think I may be. They
may be cool with me

261
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.890
now. Yeah. Cool with you
now. Yeah. Yeah. I just

262
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.270
feel like I've possibly reached
that, that level, which is

263
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.700
cool. So yeah, it was
good to see them. Of

264
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.700
course you, you made me
take a lot of gifts.

265
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.280
And when I post, I
always post little cute things

266
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.130
like that on Facebook, about
how you always have me

267
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.530
take gifts. Everyone who has
family overseas apparently does this.

268
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.160
I thought it was a,
you know, South African thing

269
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.710
or Zimbabwean thing. Apparently it's
universal. You have to take

270
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.070
the maximum number of poundage,
no matter what country you're

271
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:03.960
going to, to like take
jeans and shirts and candy

272
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.990
and stuff like that. So
I apologize for implying that

273
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.530
maybe it was just your
family that wanted the maximum

274
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.940
kg of baggage. That's right.
That judgment that I heard

275
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.520
before. I'm glad to see
that you're eating humble pie.

276
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.650
No, but it's funny. My
sister and I were kind

277
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.170
of kidding. When you came
back, I asked you what

278
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.370
your allowance was for the
weight of the suitcase. I

279
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.040
think you said it was
22. I think it's the

280
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.960
20, 23 is the max.
So when you said 23

281
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.460
was a max and then
I asked you how much

282
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.190
a bag weight, and you
said 22.5. And I said,

283
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.820
Oh, it lost half a
kilo farmer. You know? Yeah.

284
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.180
It is sometimes been much.
It's an expensive way to

285
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.540
be, but really it's supposed
to be expressing, you know,

286
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.720
thoughtfulness and just, you're happy
to see people in here.

287
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.580
It's a small thing. I
used to show that. I

288
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.310
thought if you, so when
it's done, right, it's not

289
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.350
supposed to be expensive. A
thoughtful. Yeah. Although tragically, U

290
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.230
S customs took all the
biltong, all of the beef

291
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:03.830
Turkey was taken at the
border and deed. And that

292
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.340
sucked because that was like
fricking two kg of meat,

293
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.780
our laws. Well, it turns
out we were, we were

294
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.240
cheated because the biltong salespeople
said, Oh yeah, just it's

295
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.030
okay if you bring it
when it's vacuum packed, that's

296
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.390
a lie. It's never okay.
They're trying to sneak it

297
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.490
past the dogs or whatever.
So I didn't mean to

298
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.810
break international law, but fortunately
I declared everything. So tip,

299
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.260
tip to anyone who travels
declare stuff. Cause if you

300
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.440
don't, they'll just take the
whole bag or actually it

301
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.700
can be arrested. I mean,
so full of dark there

302
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.980
as well. But yeah. And
I guess we should have

303
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.840
known better in that. I
think we kind of knew

304
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.370
that meat isn't it isn't
a lot. I really, I

305
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.380
mean, I'm not, I wasn't
trying to sneak meat in.

306
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.930
I honestly thought that if
it was vacuum packed, that

307
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.620
somehow meant something like it
was a feeling about it

308
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.130
at the store. I didn't
go and like tromp around

309
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:05.330
on a farm, getting farm
dirt on my feet. Yeah.

310
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.640
Insult the meat myself. I
just seemed, I was just

311
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.950
kind of bummed, but there
was another two kg loss

312
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:16.140
that could have been spent
on Nando's sauce. Yeah. Yeah.

313
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.510
Every time one travels, I
think you learn one new

314
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.000
thing, right. At least. So
it's, it's, it's always a

315
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.250
good lesson, but I have
a question for you. How

316
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.550
was that experience? I mean,
being there, not just with

317
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.070
my family, of course, but
just being in South Africa as

318
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.480
a white male, without your
black wife, did you feel

319
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.920
different? Did you, did you
notice anything? That's an interesting

320
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.250
question because last time you
and I were in Zimbabwe,

321
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.060
we, we did like a
little mini experiment where you

322
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.880
and I were standing on
the corner in downtown, below

323
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.300
iOS and way. And we
were, I think it's fair

324
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.810
to say extremely conspicuous. Like,
you know, I was the

325
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.380
only white guy within several
kilometers. Let's say, if not,

326
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.380
if not dozens of kilometers
and everyone was looking at

327
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.140
me and then I just
went and kind of like

328
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.470
went into an alleyway. And
then the whole, you know,

329
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.800
after about three minutes, the
entire street changed. Like the,

330
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.850
I was not visible. I
will, you, you became immediately

331
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.760
invisible. And no one noticed
that there was a visitor

332
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.160
in South Africa. I found that
kind of the same thing.

333
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.360
I was effectively invisible depending
on which spaces that I

334
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.200
was in. So if we
were at a predominantly white

335
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.360
mall and I'm walking around
and we just assumed it

336
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.700
was a white South African
until I opened my mouth.

337
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:43.000
But, but of course I
always open my mouth. That's

338
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.900
right. Yeah. Thank you for
your confidence. So like whenever

339
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.980
I go to a country
that is not an English

340
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.740
speaking country, I do my
very best to at least

341
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.360
get 10, 12, 20 phrases
down. I think it's polite

342
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.610
to try to order in
the local language. Of course,

343
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.540
every country is different. The
French don't like you speaking,

344
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.210
Pat French, nothing's worse than
ordering in the local language

345
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.260
and having them switch to
English with that quiet implicit.

346
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.840
Oh wow. You don't speak
the language. So I'll switch

347
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.090
to English, The effort, no
matter where you are, the

348
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.510
French, you know, South Africans
Zimbabweans, everybody appreciates the effort

349
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.370
to say, wow, this guy
is trying so kudos to

350
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.480
yeah. Yeah. It was funny.
I was ordering something at

351
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.900
a restaurant and tried to,
you know, try to basically

352
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.910
the whole greeting. How are
you doing? What am I

353
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.260
going to order? What can
I get, try to do

354
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.760
the whole thing. And in
Zulu, and that immediately caused

355
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.120
all of the ladies who
were running the front desk

356
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.330
to kind of run over.
Where's your wife, who is

357
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.550
your wife? Who taught you
this? Where's your wife right

358
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:51.170
now? Well, it became, I
wouldn't say virtue. It became

359
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.540
a little weird when they
said, where's your wife currently.

360
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:59.030
There is, I don't mean
to in any way, imply

361
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.200
that. I just thought it
was interesting that your location

362
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:08.960
currently became quite, quite the
point of interest. Yeah. It

363
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.540
didn't, it didn't quite devolve
to the point where baby

364
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.930
pictures came out, you know,
of the boys, but it

365
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.590
was interesting. And then someone
said, wow, you've got to

366
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.240
be careful. You're going to
give people a bad name

367
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.790
because you can make everyone
have to learn the local

368
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.850
language. So I don't know,
I enjoy it. I enjoy

369
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.480
trying to fit in any
time I travel. So it

370
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:34.070
was weird though, because there's
the travel ban that's going

371
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.370
on, made things awkward. It
was always the number one

372
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.990
point of conversation. But showing
people that you're willing to

373
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.970
try to speak the local
language or at least limp

374
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.680
your way through the local
language, inevitably made everyone smile

375
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.740
and actually got me through
a number of weird things

376
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.930
that happened at the airport.
I think I told you

377
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.640
that I didn't have a
ticket when I got there

378
00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.080
because of some confusion. And
there was a missing seat

379
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:05.990
and there were double bookings.
And I, I believe that

380
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.070
through being pleasant, through being
kind and through, you know,

381
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:14.480
like I said, 20 odd
words of Zulu got me,

382
00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.570
at least I wouldn't say
charmed my way through, but

383
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.910
at least made them realize,
Oh, this person's kind and

384
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.670
worth helping. And they had
a little more patience with

385
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.650
me then maybe I think,
yeah, Yeah. I mean, and

386
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.580
that's true everywhere. You know,
I, many years ago I

387
00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.430
worked as a, a waitress
and you know, right now

388
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.080
I work as a nurse,
as I said, and you

389
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.170
work with people and I'm
always surprised at how people

390
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.380
forget that basic concept, that
little pro tip that you're

391
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.200
giving that be pleasant, you
know, for crying out loud.

392
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.590
It, it helps make the
conversation go better for you.

393
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.090
The patient says to me,
Hey, Mo, do you have

394
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.010
time to bring me some
ice water is more likely

395
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.660
to get that ice water
as soon as I can.

396
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.060
And the one that says,
I demand my ice water

397
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.450
now, you know, so all
the time, because people think

398
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.160
they're not in a hospital
and they take that to

399
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.260
be a hotel. So it's
like chop, chop get to

400
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.720
it quickly. And sometimes it's
like, no, that's not going

401
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.820
to happen. And now that
you've talked to me that

402
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.210
way, it's going to take
even longer. It's being been

403
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.180
God for being respectful, being
polite, being patient yourself, it's

404
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.920
a good way to travel.
It's a good way to

405
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.980
visit another country. And it
just, it makes us look

406
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.920
good. Say, wow, he is
a pleasant American, you know,

407
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.910
coming to visit. And how
nice is that? So Yeah,

408
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.390
of course, when you do
learn to speak a little

409
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.750
bit of a language and
you speak it well, or

410
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.300
at least it sounds like
you're speaking it. Well, I

411
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:37.620
do get myself into a
number of situations where I

412
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.610
was asking for directions and
they gave the directions entirely

413
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.580
in the local language. And
I was only getting like

414
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.950
every other word, you know
what I mean? So like

415
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.780
I was at a mall
and I went up to

416
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.480
the information booth and I
was like, you know, Johnny

417
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.220
CC, Gabrielle, and Johnny assay.
And then it's like, since

418
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.170
she's like, okay, and she's
saying all this and Julia,

419
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:02.040
you know, okay, go down
here, hang a left. <inaudible>.

420
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.260
And I'm like, and I'm
like, ah, and I'm in

421
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.810
my mind, I'm going left.
Right. Left straight. Right. And

422
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.790
like, that's all I've got,
you know what I mean?

423
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.710
So I'm pretty sure I
know where I'm going, but

424
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.420
I'm just nodding. Oh yeah.
Coconut. Apple. Okay. Okay. Okay.

425
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:21.120
You know, and then, then
I'm like, okay. And then

426
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.450
I'm in my mind, I'm
playing back the conversation, trying

427
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.990
to remember which words would
happen because talking to you

428
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.140
and practicing is one thing,
but then being dropped into

429
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.930
a country where they're busting
it out at, you know,

430
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.380
a hundred words a minute,
it's fast, it's fast and

431
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.190
the words squished together. Yeah.
So you, it turns out

432
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.380
all these years, you've been
not squishing the words together.

433
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.690
And if you get down
there, it's just like, Oh

434
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.520
wow. They really talk fast
here. Yeah. It's no different.

435
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.950
They didn't listen to the
TV and just like, Whoa,

436
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.010
Holy cow. Yeah. Like trying
to practice my Spanish while

437
00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.170
watching, you know, Spanish teach
Spanish news. Yeah. It's, it's

438
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.270
interesting. It's interesting. If someone
would just close caption them,

439
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.460
then I'd be fine. You
know what I mean? I

440
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.400
need people close captioning and
then it would be totally

441
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.320
cool. So your family misses
you and wants you to

442
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.070
come down there. So you
should, you should get down

443
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.910
there right away. It was
a long flight It's long

444
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.070
and it's expensive. I mean,
cause when we travel now

445
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.930
as a family, you know,
taking the four of us,

446
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.410
man, it adds up. Yeah.
It's really challenging. And of

447
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.350
course, trying to travel with
two boys that are not

448
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.940
teenagers, it was two 10
hour flights and a seven

449
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.430
hour flight plus two and
a half to three hour

450
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.280
layover. So I think what
was I, 30, 33 or

451
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.680
34 hours door to door.
And even, I don't know

452
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.920
where I am or what's
going on. You know, I

453
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.430
don't know what time it
is. I mean, jet lag,

454
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.230
jet lag is a real
thing, you know? And it's,

455
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.930
it's tough for parents because
you know, I mean we're

456
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.210
reasonably good parents and, and
we don't want to fill

457
00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.150
our kids with, you know,
nothing but TV for 34

458
00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.790
hours or whatever. But man,
it's tough at some point

459
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.360
you're like, there's nothing of
a trap in this tiny

460
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.700
plane. You know, there's no
one for you to kick

461
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.770
a ball so you can
work off that energy and

462
00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.050
it should be a ball
kicking areas right in the

463
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.950
plane plane. But you know,
honestly watching, like I used

464
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.140
to think, Oh, I'll just
watch every movie that I

465
00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.870
didn't see in the theaters
that almost makes it worse.

466
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.040
The, the headache you get,
the I'm watching too many

467
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.880
screens headache. So you have
the I'm in an aluminum

468
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.870
tin can in the sky
headache, there's the, I'm not

469
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.080
drinking enough water. I'm eating
crappy food. Cause I'm on

470
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.680
a plane combine. All of
those are all distinct individual

471
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.520
kinds of like feeling gross.
You know what I mean?

472
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.460
Like I've been up too
long. I feel gross. I'm

473
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.070
eating crappy food. I feel
gross. I'm not drinking enough

474
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.670
water. I feel gross. And
now I've been watching TV

475
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.360
for the last 13 hours.
I feel gross. You know,

476
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.240
there's just no solution. If
there was just a track

477
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.830
in the back that I
could like run our a

478
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.040
hamster wheel, because what you
want to do is like

479
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.570
sprint, just, just to get
your legs stretched or a

480
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.390
yoga class in the back,
you think it's cyclist do

481
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.160
a yoga class. That'd be
an amazing way to fly.

482
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.280
But you know, and the
interesting thing is I always

483
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.170
used to pride myself on
being disciplined to be like,

484
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.420
okay, well I'm going to
go to the bathroom cause

485
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.770
I can stand airplane toilets.
I mean, so I'm like,

486
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.360
okay, I'm going to go
before I get on the

487
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.520
plane, then I'll, I'll drink
a little as possible. Then

488
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.910
I'll go. No, I mean,
it's not a 27 hour

489
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.680
flight, right. You've got it's
10 hours and you can

490
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.210
lay over it. So I'm
like, I'll go before the

491
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.270
turnover flight, you know, all
that. Well, it's a good

492
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.890
bladder right back in the
day when I had a

493
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.350
good bladder anyway, you know,
and of course that's the

494
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.750
worst thing you can possibly
do cause you've got a

495
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.640
hydrate and then you've got
to get up and move.

496
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.170
You know, those are gonna
end up with his blood

497
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.270
clots and when have you
in your legs. So anyway,

498
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.490
it's like, Yeah, disturbing all
this stuff that you know,

499
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.530
now that you're a nurse
of like all the bad

500
00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.140
things that can happen. I've
been doing this wrong all

501
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.720
my life. So yeah, it's,
it's, it's important to get

502
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.240
up, to drink your water,
to hydrate. You know, I

503
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.700
actually went and hit out
in the, in the, in

504
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.890
the handicap bathroom for five
minutes because it's like the

505
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.850
biggest bathroom. Cause it's like
a shame. Well, I mean

506
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.740
there were no people in
line to be clear. I'm

507
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.170
just pointing out that like
when you need a bright,

508
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.320
small office where you can
just kind of lay in

509
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.000
an airplane where you can
just kind of like rock

510
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.310
back and forth and say,
I have, you know, cause

511
00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:31.960
10 hours and 54 K
you know, kinda sucks. He

512
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.220
was not the awesomest seat.
So I just felt I

513
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.980
needed a bright place to
hide. So I went to

514
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.590
the portal, I went to
the porta-potty and just sat

515
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.580
there and just said, Oh,
this, you know what I

516
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.660
mean? Can I just see
the sun again? That's all

517
00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:52.460
right. Will this never end?
Yeah. But it's always nice

518
00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.050
then when you land on
the other side and then

519
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.050
there's always just for me
anyway, this, this moment when

520
00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:00.020
you're just like, wow, this
morning I was in Johannesburg

521
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.080
and now I'm in Portland,
Oregon. How amazing is that?

522
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.380
Like how, how great is
technology? You know, That that

523
00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.810
is, is weird because there's
no actual border between the

524
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.140
days cause you sleep, but
it's never like Epic eight

525
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.800
hour. I fell asleep in
a day past sleep. It's

526
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.040
always like, your body knows
that it's fake, not really

527
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.850
good sleep. So I, I
get off the plane, you

528
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.710
pick me up and then
we go and we get

529
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.020
some food that like makes
us happy. Right. So I

530
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.450
go to my bagel shop
or whatever, and then I'm

531
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.640
there. And the guy's like,
how are you doing? And

532
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.620
I look at him and
I go, I was in

533
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.830
Johannesburg like an hour ago
because that's what it feels

534
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.330
like. You know what I
mean? Cause there was like,

535
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.240
I got up this morning,
I put my feet on

536
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.690
the ground and I was
on the African continent and

537
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:52.370
then some stuff happened, yada,
yada, yada. And now I'm

538
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.850
in Portland getting a bagel.
That, that part is weird.

539
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.510
So then, then you find
yourself questioning like, did it

540
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.410
ever happen? Was I there
for two weeks? What, what

541
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.150
was going on? What was
it happening when you were

542
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.240
here? You know, one thing
that I realized that's changed

543
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.590
since cause you and I
have been going back and

544
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:15.410
forth to the African continent
for 17 years, plus the,

545
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.830
the sense of isolation is
less. So we never had

546
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:23.780
WhatsApp. We never had Skype.
When we went originally we

547
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.990
had $3 and $3, a
minute phone calls that were

548
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:30.440
scratching. What was different with
me being gone over there,

549
00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.050
but being able to FaceTime
you and the boys every

550
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.780
day. Did that feel like
I was closer? Yeah. I

551
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.640
mean, it definitely felt like
you were close. I think

552
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.980
only a couple of times
where either we couldn't hear

553
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.590
you clearly or something like
that, but otherwise man, when

554
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.900
the connection was great, you
were right here. I mean,

555
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.910
it could have been like
I was in Wichita. Right.

556
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.860
I mean, it wasn't the,
you said it was a

557
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.800
weird connection sometimes, but that
happens in here. Right, right.

558
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.360
But I mean, it felt
like we were right next

559
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.400
door, like in your office
and I was outside, you

560
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.760
know? So that was, that
was just, yeah. Again, technology

561
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.280
is just amazing and they
do that. Everybody's got cell

562
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.740
phones at this way. More
people there than did before

563
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.980
and know the technology is
amazing and that's, that's pretty,

564
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.620
pretty interesting. I didn't have
a question for you though.

565
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.050
It's also as far as
the weather, I mean, cause

566
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.780
you know, it's winter over
here, some over there and

567
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.380
that juxtaposition and the aggressiveness
of one moment Trent summer,

568
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.150
the next year in winter
or how has that as

569
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.760
a diabetic, too, to deal
with that, the back and

570
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.640
forth. No, I'm interested that
you added as a diabetic.

571
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.130
I don't know. What does
diabetes have to do with

572
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.980
the weather for you? Well,
I mean, it's, you know,

573
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.410
if you're a sweaty, then
they might change your insulin

574
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.970
and how long it lasts.
That kind of a thing.

575
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.020
Not really. I think it's
more I've I was born

576
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.590
in Oregon, you know, I
don't know what it is

577
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.500
in Celsius, but room temperature
for me is about 65.

578
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.830
You know, I grew up
sleeping with the windows open

579
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:54.670
because that's how you were
meant to sleep. Right? Well,

580
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.950
well here we are. And
you know, you're using the

581
00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.100
fuck. The fireplace is on
because when you have a

582
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.300
blanket, that's an electric blanket.
So you and I, you

583
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.010
know, after all these years
of marriage, I would say

584
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:11.080
are one 80 degrees off,
what do you think? 15,

585
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.830
20 degrees. Let's just be
real. What's your preferred temperature

586
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:19.810
in Fahrenheit? No, really. Come
on. Don't be silly When

587
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.140
I feel like I don't
need a sweater. I'm comfortable,

588
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.890
you know? Yeah. Maybe five,
nine 90 or a dry

589
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:31.080
dry humidity please. Okay. Well,
so while I was there,

590
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.250
it was 87 to 90,
but it was like 80

591
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.620
plus humid. It was just
ridiculous. So it was like

592
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.140
get out of the shower,
towel off and then you're

593
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.440
wet. Yeah, that it's the
humidity that bothers me the

594
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.770
most, it was a crisp,
dry 90. I could handle

595
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.680
that, but it was just
the I'm sweating my hair,

596
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:53.550
sweaty, everything sweaty that I
don't like, but, but you're

597
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:58.230
right. Like I got back
and it was 68, 65

598
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.800
and it was like if
like the world's air conditioning

599
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.590
was on and I was
just like, I found my

600
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.980
set point. So yeah, I
would definitely say that. I

601
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.870
don't think I would ever,
if we lived, we lived

602
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.880
there and moved there. It
would be very challenging for

603
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.090
me to get used to
the heat, not to mention

604
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.970
I got burned. I wasn't
paying attention, walking in the

605
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:22.260
streets of Nairobi, you know,
with all my buddies, of

606
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.150
course I'm the one that
gets burned and it took

607
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.450
six minutes. You know what
I mean? Like we walked

608
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.460
to the Messiah market and
we walked back and they're

609
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.850
like, you don't look so
good Scott. And you're like,

610
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.800
Oh yeah, I've been on
the content for six minutes

611
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.510
and I'm already, I'm exactly,
I'm a lobster. So I

612
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.340
don't know that's a challenge,
but it was, it, it

613
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.330
is always a good experience
to go over there. Met

614
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.220
a lot of great friends,
got to hang out with

615
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.860
your family, which is cool.
And, and then we'll head

616
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.760
back there next year. Hopefully,
Hopefully. Yeah. Pretty excited by

617
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.620
my brother getting married and
my sister getting married. So

618
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.670
that should be fun. Cool.
Well, that's our time. Thank

619
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.700
you. Small life for hanging
out with me here on

620
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.420
Hansel minutes. I'd love to
say we didn't talk about

621
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.350
the working both couples working,
you know, both members of

622
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.120
the, of the teamwork and
all that stuff. But we'll

623
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.070
have to say that the
next time. Right? Well, so

624
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.440
last time we did this
with 300 episodes ago. Do

625
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.260
we wait 300 episodes? If
you want to hear more

626
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.980
from my wife on this
podcast, let me know in

627
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.910
the comments and maybe she
will come on. I don't

628
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.190
know, couple times a year
