of the startup series, Scott

7
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.010
talks with Alex Pappa. Deimos
one of the founders of

8
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.050
UNIDO. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

9
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.500
of Hansel minutes or continuing
these startup series. Today. We've

10
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.980
got Alex Pepperdine, Wallace, who
is a founder at <inaudible>

11
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.890
creators of build master. And
he is also an editor

12
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.620
at a blog that you
very likely read. Dear reader,

13
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.230
the daily WTF. Thanks so
much, Alex, for chatting with

14
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.040
me today. Oh my pleasure,
Scott. Thanks for having me

15
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.810
on. So build master and
Nido, bill masters, your product,

16
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
and Anita is your company.
This was a, a consultancy

17
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.280
originally, is that right? Yeah.
Yeah. So, so back in

18
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.820
Oh three, you know, like
a lot of software developers

19
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.490
just decided that it was
time to kind of go

20
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.950
out on my own and
you know, a couple, a

21
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.710
couple other guys we got
let's, let's build some great

22
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.680
software. So we did that,
you know, we worked with

23
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.230
industries of all sizes, worked
on small, big projects, you

24
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.650
know, here, you know, mostly
some local, some international or

25
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.780
some national, but you know,
the idea was we just

26
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.200
kind of built custom software
it's consulting and that sort

27
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.070
of thing, you know, at
some point we, we kind

28
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.800
of got into, and I
think dotnet to, when that

29
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.180
really started hitting, we got
into sort of some training,

30
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.120
some coaching best practices, that
sort of thing. And, and

31
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.760
one of the big things
that we noticed was just

32
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.400
a big challenge at all.
The places that we work

33
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.540
with was, you know, this
notion of building and deploying,

34
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.900
you know, automation, making things
are where they're supposed to

35
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.390
be, all those sorts of
things. So, you know, being

36
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.480
a bunch of custom software
guys, we would go from

37
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.840
company to company and build
them their very own solution,

38
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.470
you know, cobbling together, you
know, various bits and, and

39
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.520
this, that, and, you know,
at some point we, we

40
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.400
said, you know, we've, we've
done this now three or

41
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.340
four times completely from the
ground up custom, all that

42
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.120
stuff. Why don't we turn
this into a product? And

43
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.750
so we had like a
good break, maybe three solid

44
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.680
months between, you know, between
big projects and said, right.

45
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.670
And three months we will
have a product turns out

46
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.560
that that was a terribly
bad estimation. And it was

47
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.250
a lot harder to go
from what we thought was

48
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.520
a good idea for a
product to, you know, where

49
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.370
we're at today and where
we should have been, you

50
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.810
know, at least a year
or two ago. And why

51
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.700
is that? Is that, is
that just a story of

52
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.140
bad estimating or what caused
such an such a discrepancy?

53
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.110
Well, you know, there was,
I'd say it was a

54
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.870
series of missteps along the
way. You know what I

55
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.210
mean? It took a lot
of time before we were

56
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.060
able to, you know, figure
out how to do the

57
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.030
right thing. I mean, the
first, the first challenge was

58
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.140
that, you know, our background
was that of custom software.

59
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.980
So it's relatively easy when
you develop custom software, right.

60
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.370
You talk to the customer
and then you ask what

61
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.230
he or she wants. And
then you build that for

62
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.050
them. When you're building a
product, you kind of have

63
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.710
to, you know, be the
customer yourself or try to

64
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.290
think what the customer want.
So it was a lot

65
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.020
of the micro decisions like,
wow, should they do what

66
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.360
they want to customize this?
Should this be built into

67
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.910
the software? You know, how
do we do this? How

68
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.520
do we do that? So
it was, it was those

69
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.560
little details that went from
custom software, custom built to

70
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.130
a product, you know, just
like you'd expect any other,

71
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.610
you know, organization to have,
or, or make. And I'd

72
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.850
say our estimate of three
months where, you know, should

73
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.740
have been a lot closer,
especially for the scope that

74
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.740
we were going for would
have been a lot closer

75
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.620
to 12 or 18 months
of just, you know, straight

76
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.220
development time. How, how should
a startup or a small

77
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.450
company stay, stay focused? Like
you're, I'm hearing you say

78
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.760
that you kind of got
caught up in the little

79
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.920
details. And I, I hear
from a lot of other

80
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.320
startups that I read about
like Dropbox and things like

81
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.140
that, that the trick for
a successful startup is to

82
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.710
do the least possible thing.
Like do it really, really

83
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.380
well do one thing or
two things, and really, really

84
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.600
well. And every time someone
fails, it's always because they

85
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.960
tried to bite off more
than they could chew. Yeah.

86
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.870
And I would say that
we were definitely on the,

87
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.630
on the verge of failure
on, on several cases. I

88
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.510
mean, if it weren't for,
you know, being able to

89
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.620
bootstrap with, you know, having,
having, having a consultancy as

90
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.910
well, we would have failed
hundreds of thousands of dollars

91
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.300
ago, but you know what
I mean? And that's, and

92
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.270
that's absolutely the, you know,
great advice. I look back

93
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.330
at some of the features
that, and this was, you

94
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.850
know, this was, I would
say probably eight months, nine

95
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.550
months into development. And we
had a team of, I'd

96
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.580
say four or five of
us working full time, eight

97
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.280
and nine months of development.
Or I remember thinking, okay,

98
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.760
are we were start telling
people about it now because

99
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.030
we need, we need to
finish the module that manages

100
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.390
people's configuration files. So then
we did that a month

101
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.000
later. Ah, okay, we're not
ready to Cisse yet. We

102
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.100
got to put something in
there to help them manage

103
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.430
database changes, you know, so
it was just feature after

104
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.250
feature. And, you know, we
had a really big disjoint

105
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.040
of, you know, just kind
of developing this with, with

106
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.420
new potential customer. You know,
we just didn't have a

107
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.840
idea of what the market
actually wanted. So, you know,

108
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.690
we went, you know, I
would say the complete opposite

109
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.070
of lean startup and did
a waterfall startup, which was

110
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.670
just come out the gate
with a giant development product.

111
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.030
And, you know, which may
or may not have been

112
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.320
with the market wanted You
think that lean and agile

113
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.700
is the only way to
do it when it comes

114
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.680
to startups. I mean, come
out of the Gates quickly

115
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.490
with something so that you're
not burning cash. Yeah. I

116
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.380
mean, I look back at
what we should have done

117
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.800
in the development phases. And
I think that, you know,

118
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.960
the right strategy would have
been to, to go with

119
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.270
that. You know, a lot
of people talk about the

120
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.250
minimally viable product and, you
know, some people are comfortable

121
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.010
doing that. Others, you know,
one, a little bit more

122
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.540
than minimum, but definitely don't
do maximum. You know, don't

123
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.560
try to, don't try to
put everything in there because

124
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.020
as soon as you start
getting users and you know,

125
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.150
you're going to get feedback
and that's going to tell

126
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.650
you the direction that you
need to go, what we,

127
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.950
you know, our, our big
mistake was really just not

128
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.860
thinking, you know, thinking that
we could just build it,

129
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.310
you know, create the product
and then users would, would

130
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.800
start using it right away
now. So that was a,

131
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.050
that was a pretty big
gap that we had to

132
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.480
do it all over. I
would have said, you know,

133
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.230
after six months of development,
maybe, you know, whatever, we

134
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.290
would come out with a
beta, tell the world about

135
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.020
it, maybe run some ads,
get some, get some folks

136
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.740
using it for free. Then
start building more features, you

137
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.040
know, getting users early on
would have made a huge,

138
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.160
huge difference for us. So
how did you, how did

139
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.660
you dig out of this?
I mean, you, you, you're

140
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.450
saying that it's, that it's
a mistake. I don't know.

141
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.640
Failure is the right word,
but you, you, you did

142
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.720
this thing and how did
you decide or know this

143
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.820
was a mistake. I mean,
why you're going three months,

144
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.180
four months, nine months, 10
months, someone's gotta be speaking

145
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.670
up and saying, gosh, guys,
is this really the right

146
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.170
strategy? Yeah. And, and you
know, it internally, we'd all

147
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.690
go around and say, you
know, and, and again, this

148
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.110
is just a bunch of
costs, custom software guys, me,

149
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.510
of course, one of them
just not knowing what we're

150
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.320
doing, right. Not of course
not doing research or this

151
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.690
because, you know, we didn't
even really think of ourselves

152
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.120
as a startup. You know,
we're a company building a

153
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.030
product, you know, but you
know, what, what we did

154
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.210
was, okay, we've got a
product, we're fine. Take it

155
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.580
to market. Well, how do
you take the product to

156
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:36.400
market? You hire somebody who's
really good at taking software

157
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.150
products to market. So that
was our solution to the

158
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.700
problem was, you know, we
built this, we built a

159
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.950
product that had, you know,
quite frankly for a one

160
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.330
point, LSU will way too
many features. And then we

161
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.790
just hired someone and hope
that that would kind of

162
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.170
solve the problem. Okay. So
you, you go out and

163
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.000
you hire someone and this
seems to be a win

164
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.950
in the startup process. Do
you know, it's time to

165
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.840
get a sales guy or
a marketing guy, like you,

166
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.880
you're almost done with the
product and then you go

167
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.430
out and you find the
guy who's got the contacts

168
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.560
and he knows how to
cold call and come up

169
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.300
with a strategy. Like what,
at what point do you

170
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.800
hire this guy? Well, you
know, I would suggest that

171
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.780
at the point that we
were doing at the time

172
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.410
was, was really never was
when was when we should

173
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.650
have done it. Because, you
know, at the end of

174
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.010
the day, who, who really
needed to be responsible for

175
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.770
getting the word out for
marketing the product for, for

176
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.000
getting folks to at least
in the early phases to

177
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.410
start using it was us
development, the development team, the

178
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.870
folks building the product, you
know, we needed to be

179
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.420
out there at conferences. We
need to be, you know,

180
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.630
on the, you know, writing
blogs, just really engaging the

181
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:50.060
community to get feedback. Once
we started having more revenue.

182
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.390
And basically once we started
having good problems to have

183
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.780
where, you know, we're spending
a lot of our time,

184
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.520
we're making a little money,
but we're spending a lot

185
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.350
of our time doing marketing.
That's the right time to,

186
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.520
to bring on a marketing
expert and, you know, a

187
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.360
full time marketing resources once
it's really creeping into your

188
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.060
own time. And maybe if
you want to scale, but

189
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.570
we brought on, we brought
them some really good help

190
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.020
way too early in the
process. So does that mean

191
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.700
that they were selling a
product that wasn't ready to

192
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.400
be sold? Well, the product,
the product was definitely, you

193
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.930
know, well, no, there's really
two things. Right? So, so

194
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.990
the software itself was, was
absolutely ready. You know, I,

195
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.930
I was fortunate to, to
know a few folks and

196
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.560
to reach out to the
first beta a user. So

197
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.920
we had two or three
companies that use it. So

198
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.970
we know from a, you
know, from a strictly software

199
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.410
and features standpoint, the software
was great. You know, it

200
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.540
did everything that was supposed
to with it kind of

201
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.260
met all the requirements, but
it wasn't remotely ready to

202
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.620
be sold. One thing that
you don't think about, well,

203
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.860
I should say we didn't
really consider is, you know,

204
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.530
when you put up software
product out there, you need

205
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:08.360
things like documentation. You need
things like a website that

206
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.680
describes all of the features.
You need videos, sell sheets,

207
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.190
brochures, you know, so it
was all that marketing material

208
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.840
that we had zero of.
And I, you know, what

209
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.210
we did is we just
kind of overloaded the, you

210
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.580
know, the, the sales and
marketing guy that we brought

211
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.000
on. So it took, you
know, this, this became his

212
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.330
responsibility to put together all
of this materials, build us

213
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.010
a new website, describe the
product help with documentation. And,

214
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.850
you know, for one guy
to go from zero to

215
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.620
ready, that took us another,
geez, I'd say solid nine

216
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.900
months, nine to 12 months,
maybe even more to even

217
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.800
be in a position where
we're ready to ourselves out

218
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.360
there from a marketing standpoint,
you know, with documentation, all

219
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:02.590
those things. So, you know,
that's so, so our take

220
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.800
on it was okay, well,
we built it. Okay. Now

221
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.710
we've got to spend a
whole other year figuring out

222
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.490
how we're going to sell
it so we could have,

223
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.640
of course done those in
parallel and saved a whole

224
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.720
year of time. So who,
who is paying for the

225
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.080
rent and the lights at
this point? I mean, you're,

226
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.370
you're describing months going by,
and I'm just thinking of

227
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.760
all this money being burned.
Oh yeah. And, and definitely

228
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.760
it was so, so what
we did, and I could

229
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.380
say that this is a
good and a bad thing.

230
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.060
You know, we were able
to bootstrap by having about

231
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.960
half of our time being
spent to, you know, w

232
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.300
w we'd say the main,
you know, the main job,

233
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.820
which was doing custom development,
you know, kind of what

234
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.120
we used to do. So,
you know, this, this, I

235
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.100
would say was, was definitely
one of the right things

236
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.990
to do. And I would,
you know, get having to

237
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.050
do it all over. I
would absolutely go back and,

238
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.960
you know, make sure that
you have a source of

239
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.050
income when you're developing a
product. So we were able

240
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.890
to pay the bills, get
things done as a result

241
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.550
of having, you know, custom
software projects that we're continuing

242
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:13.320
to develop for clients. So
that that's what paid the

243
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.680
bills at the time. Okay.
And then what about the

244
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.880
strategy, like who decided, who
you were going to sell

245
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.140
to? You know, so, so
when we, when we started,

246
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.900
you know, we, we knew
exactly who would you, you

247
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.870
know, we knew who our
target customer was because, you

248
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.530
know, we had all been
there before. It was teams

249
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.180
of software developers, maybe, you
know, a dozen to, you

250
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.150
know, a hundred, right. Not
the Microsofts of the world

251
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.880
and, and not the, you
know, the solo shop, the

252
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.650
one man shops. So we,
we knew who our customer

253
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.640
was, and we just didn't
know exactly how to get

254
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.140
him. So, you know, the,
the marketing, the marketing guy

255
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.930
who we brought on and
the marketing and sales, you

256
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.900
know, his, you know, he
doubles the great strategy to

257
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.210
say, well, you know, the
software that you guys are

258
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.010
have built is enterprise level
software, right. It's software that,

259
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.460
you know, helps the entire
it department, so on and

260
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.450
so forth. And it's something
that, you know, therefore needs

261
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.630
to be sold, you know,
from the top down, meaning,

262
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.300
you know, talk to the
CTO, then talk to the

263
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.560
director of applications and talk
to this for a particular

264
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.530
application. And that point you'll
be able to get in

265
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.820
and make your sale in,
in his many, many years

266
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.670
of experience, working on all
sorts of different software, this

267
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.630
is how software was sold.
It didn't, I don't know.

268
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.240
I mean, you know, from
our standpoint, none of us

269
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.200
were, you know, executives before
none of us were, you

270
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.000
know, CTOs and, and it,
but the idea didn't seem

271
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.300
right. You know, cause we
didn't buy software like that,

272
00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.740
but you know, it, it
was something that we bought

273
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.700
into largely because that meant
we didn't have to worry

274
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.830
about marketing. We could just
rely on him to do

275
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.660
it and we can get
back to what we really

276
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.290
want to do, which was
just write more software. So,

277
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.860
so our initial plan was
to, you know, really go

278
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:21.200
from a sort of enterprise
top down approach. And you

279
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.440
know, the problem in, in,
you know, much, you know,

280
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.310
many, many, many months later
is that, you know, today

281
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.150
software just isn't sold like
that. You know, the, the

282
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.260
people who influence software, even,
you know, a big software

283
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.400
purchases are the developers themselves.
And they're a big decision

284
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.610
maker. So that's, you know,
who we, who, you know,

285
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.880
we need to go for
and, and engage if you

286
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.890
will. This episode of Hansel
minutes is brought to you

287
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:55.120

303
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.900
for you as a Hansel

304
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:59.080
back head on over to
careers dot stack overflow.com/h M

305

to accept your invitation today,
once again, that's careers dot

306
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:09.340
stack, overflow.com/hm. I hope you
like it was this, the

307
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.910
old way to sell software.
Like you said, it didn't

308
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.890
feel right intuitively, but you
said, well, he's, you know,

309
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.550
he's my word would be
an adult. Right. You know,

310
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.250
he, we were just developers
and he was he's he's

311
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.560
the fancy, you know, C
level executor. He was, you

312
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.210
know, he was important at
some point in a company

313
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.300
I've had experiences like that
too, where I'll come in

314
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.950
contact with someone who I
consider to be like, you

315
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.870
know, a suit. And I
just assume that they're a

316
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.730
suit and they must know
more cause they have a

317
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.420
suit. Is it the old
way to write software and

318
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.900
sell software is top down?
Or is it just because

319
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.640
of the category that you're
in, that this wasn't the

320
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.760
right way. Yeah. I mean,
and, and I think I,

321
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.950
you know, the, the analogy
of right, you know, he

322
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.580
was the adult, he was,
this was absolutely app. I

323
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.330
mean, he was at least
20 years older than all

324
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.810
of us, you know, I
I'd say definitely, you know,

325
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.680
software, you know, let's, let's
go back 20 years, right.

326
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:08.100
To even even 10 years
software, even in our industry

327
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.220
used to be sold. And
in this manner, what I

328
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.130
think really ended up changing
a lot of it was

329
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.000
the, you know, the fact
that, you know, broadband in

330
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.030
the workplace, you know, certainly
help giving, you know, empowering

331
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:27.000
developers to make more decisions,
install stuff. You know, nowadays,

332
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.220
if you want to review
a tool as a developer,

333
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.820
you just, you know, somebody
tells you about it. You,

334
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.630
you know, you hear about
it through word of mouth,

335
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.620
you download it, install it
on your workstation. If you

336
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.890
like it, you tell your
boss back then you really

337
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.110
didn't have, you know, we'll
say this is, you know

338
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.960
what, let's flip back to
the eighties, right there, there

339
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.040
really was no ability to
log on to a software

340
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.910
vendors, website and download and
install. It just, you know,

341
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.090
if it existed back then,
it was really, really rare.

342
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.680
So software was sold by
magazines. It was, you know,

343
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.250
enterprise sales guys and their
suits would come and talk

344
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.360
to the CTO and the
CTO without ever showing it

345
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.480
to the developers would just
buy the next IDE or

346
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.050
decide, okay, everyone's going to
go on this platform. We're

347
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:20.580
going to use this for
source control. You know, even

348
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.160
in bigger shops, developers are
the ones who are now

349
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.230
kind of pushing the direction
of things. So it sounds

350
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.050
like that this is just
selling software has evolved. And

351
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.290
the top down for developer
tools is not the way.

352
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.570
Yeah. I mean, I think
it's, I think it's a

353
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.320
pendulum that's swung in the
favor of developers. I, you

354
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.150
know, there's, there's some negative
consequences to, you know, empowering

355
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.960
developers like this. You know,
one of, one of the

356
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.020
consequences is that, you know,
you pay a developer, you

357
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.270
know, if you're, you know,
the average software shop to

358
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.680
write software that developed, you
know, delivers business value. When,

359
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.220
you know, your desk guys
spends, you know, weeks of

360
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.060
time trying out new software
that really doesn't add to

361
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.480
value. And, you know, just
with something he happened to

362
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.900
her to hear about it,
you know, that's, it could

363
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.070
have some, some, you know,
longer term impacts of the

364
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.090
organization and, you know, companies,
especially with, you know, let's

365
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.690
take a brand new technology
or a new development framework,

366
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.830
something like that, jumping on
to a new tool every

367
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.250
year means that you're now
going to have after 15

368
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.870
years, 15 different types of
development, styles, tools, or practices.

369
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.440
So, you know, I think
one of these years, maybe

370
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.020
a decade from now it'll
swing back and, you know,

371
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.020
developers won't be the ones,
especially at the larger companies

372
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.770
kind of pushing this change,
but, you know, world we're

373
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.250
in now, developers are definitely
the ones who you need

374
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.170
to engage with your software
and get them to start

375
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.910
using. Right. So how, how
long did you go in

376
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.370
that direction, that strategic direction
until you realized that it

377
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:07.350
was a bad idea? I
say about, you know, ah,

378
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.670
maybe about six months and
it was about six months

379
00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.620
and, you know, w w
really opened our eyes, was

380
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.280
that, you know, against, you
know, the, the, you know,

381
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.890
adults, if you will, the
suits, you know, the, you

382
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.670
know, our, our marketing executive
against his, his advice, we

383
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.400
said, you know, we would
like to have a presence

384
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.970
at a, you know, at
a developer conference, you know,

385
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.670
there's one code Nash, which
has, you know, pretty close

386
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.400
to us here in Cleveland.
You know, we said, okay,

387
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.490
we'd like to, so we
did that. We didn't have

388
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.190
a very good presence at
all, but what it showed

389
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.670
was that people were really,
you know, we got there,

390
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.820
we don't want to demo
the software. And, you know,

391
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.580
the level of, you know,
the results, if you will,

392
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.310
the people who were very
interested, the people said, wow,

393
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.110
this is, this is really
cool. How do we get

394
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:03.090
this, the sheer numbers from
that single event, which was,

395
00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.750
you know, what two or
three days or so was,

396
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.010
I would say, a magnitude
greater in activity than what

397
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.440
then we were able to
get to the traditional methods,

398
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.530
if you will, over the
course of six months plus.

399
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.150
So, you know, that it
was, that's what really opened

400
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.360
up our eyes to say,
you know what, maybe, maybe

401
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.050
we're going in the wrong
direction from a marketing standpoint,

402
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.420
maybe we need to kind
of take control of this.

403
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.130
So in all of this,
during this entire process, the,

404
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:41.040
the, the, the inception of
this startup and the, the

405
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.450
goods and the bads, when
did this blog of yours

406
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.250
start, and how did that
relate into the larger scope

407
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.840
of things? So, you know,
the daily WTF has, has

408
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.710
been around for almost as
long as, as you know,

409
00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.730
ITTO has, but, you know,
it's, it's always been sort

410
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:04.290
of my nights and weekends
hobby project, right. It's, it's

411
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.440
a lot of fun to
do. And, you know, I

412
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.170
enjoy a lot, but, but
it never was really integrated

413
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.280
into the business. You know,
some, some bloggers will constantly

414
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.640
blog about, you know, their
day job. It just never

415
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.900
fit in too much with,
with WTF every now and

416
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.970
then, you know, I'll mention,
you know, Oh, by the

417
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.810
way, here's, here's what I
do all day long, but,

418
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.230
you know, so, so I'd
say WTF had, was assignable,

419
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.820
painless process. You know, it
kind of got a life

420
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.030
of its own, you know,
really took off in a

421
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.960
short while and, you know,
kind of went on its

422
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.060
own path if you will
pretty separate from, you know,

423
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.360
where Anita ones. Okay. So
it wasn't bringing in revenue

424
00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.730
to the company. It wasn't
associated with the company in

425
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:58.210
any fundamental way, Not at
all. And still to this

426
00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.690
day, there's, you know, about
the only relation is, you

427
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.920
know, if I, for whatever
reason, couldn't spend half of

428
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.730
my evening working on the
daily, you know, WTF for

429
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.730
the next day or whatever,
you know, maybe I'll just

430
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.980
take a morning and spend
some time there, but, you

431
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.220
know, that's, that's about it.
You know, there's not, there's,

432
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:22.390
there's very little relationship between,
you know, the blog and,

433
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.500
you know, and, and Anita,
you know, I think in

434
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:31.390
retrospect that that was something
that had, I, you know,

435
00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.600
again, playing back with probably
would have been a much

436
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:39.130
better strategic direction, going back
to when we started developing

437
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.370
the project after six months,
once we had something you

438
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.100
could, you know, people could
actually download and try and

439
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.240
everything, you know, we, we
should have mentioned that at

440
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.950
six months, I could have
done a post and said,

441
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.680
Hey, everyone, this is what
it is, check it out.

442
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.130
We think it's pretty cool.
You know, and I don't

443
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.140
think the readers would have
minded, you know, I don't

444
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.390
think it would have been
something that would have gotten

445
00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.490
the way of the other
content. And, you know, it's

446
00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.550
kind of interesting to see
what, what, what folks do

447
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.430
during their day. And we
certainly think we have a

448
00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.370
pretty exciting product, so you're
not, why not go out

449
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.550
there and share it. I'm
actually a little surprised that,

450
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.520
that you're, you're doing a
startup in the daytime and

451
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.460
you're working on an already
successful blog at night. And

452
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.610
it didn't seem immediately obvious
to use the one to

453
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.430
exploit the other. Yeah. It,
you know, it, and it

454
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.920
was always something, you know,
I don't know if it

455
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.090
was afraid of, of selling
out or, or, you know,

456
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:37.360
it, for whatever reason, it
just never clicked. You know,

457
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.320
it's like the most obvious
thing in the world. But

458
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.480
when we were in the,
you know, year and a

459
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.860
half of developing with no
customers or the, you know,

460
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.490
year and a half of,
of marketing in the completely

461
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:56.260
wrong direction, you know, it
never really occurred to us

462
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.210
that we have a huge,
you know, that, that it

463
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.050
Nieto has access to a
huge development audience. And, you

464
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:06.310
know, why don't we tap
into that audience? So strategically

465
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:11.650
another, another pretty big, a
mistake not to leverage were

466
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:15.130
exploited or, or whatever the,
you know, the folks in

467
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:20.020
the community that we knew
already. So what, what's the

468
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.400
direction now? I mean, do
you think that you're still

469
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.680
a startup or are you,
have you reached success and

470
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.690
when do you stop being
a startup and start being,

471
00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.100
you know, a real life,
a real life company? Yeah.

472
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.900
I think that's a, that's
a really good question. And

473
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.970
I, and, and I don't
know, I don't know the

474
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.760
answer to that, but what
would I, what I do

475
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.320
know is that, you know,
since we kind of got

476
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:46.020
out of our three year
funk, if you will, and

477
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.050
started realizing that, you know,
shoot, we need to take

478
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.300
things in a new direction.
That's, that's when I really

479
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.480
consider that we were, you
know, starting fresh, starting new.

480
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.970
So, you know, we had
to do all the things

481
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.340
that, that a normal startup
would have to do. We

482
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.940
had, you know, a, I'd
say, you know, a product

483
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.740
that, that was really, really
far developed, but it didn't

484
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.560
have an installer, right. Because
if you just go to

485
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.270
someone's site and install it,
what do you need an

486
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.180
install it for? It's just
a.net application. So we had

487
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.330
to build an install. We
had to build a website.

488
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.030
We had to, you know,
a website where you can

489
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.020
request keys and do that.
We had to develop a

490
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.880
free version of the software,
you know, not only a

491
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.270
trial, then we wanted to
come out with a, what

492
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.830
a lot of folks are
doing the, you know, a

493
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.980
free version, right. We have
a free version that can,

494
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.440
you know, that has five
users, 10 apps, that sort

495
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.680
of thing. So all these
steps were things that, you

496
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.930
know, just about every other
startup would have to do

497
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.130
in our position. And, you
know, that's, that's really been

498
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.160
the direction that we've been
going in the past. You

499
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.040
know, I'd say about a
year now is, is where

500
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.960
we've is, where we're at.
So I, I consider ourselves

501
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.470
a startup because we're, we're
shift finally. Now, starting to,

502
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.710
to get the word out
there. I mean, before nobody

503
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.790
was talking about our product,
nobody knew about it. Now

504
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.270
we're starting to see people,
people are just searching for

505
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.880
it. People are coming to
the site, we're getting support

506
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.410
questions from people we've never
met before. So I, you

507
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.750
know, I'd say we are
in the, you know, we're

508
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.660
in the early phases of,
of kind of pushing this,

509
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.620
this big Boulder up the
Hill, you know, again, where

510
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.950
we should have been three
years ago, two years ago.

511
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.360
So I'd say, yeah, I'd
say, yes. I think we

512
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.450
still are a startup in
that, in that sense. Do

513
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.670
you, do you have a
sense of when you'll stop

514
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:44.120
being, like, when when's the,
you wake up on a

515
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.010
Tuesday and you go, all
right, we're going to start

516
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.460
up anymore because we know
where our revenue is going

517
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.040
to come to the next
year, or, you know, when,

518
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.190
when do you officially graduate?
I think that, you know,

519
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.140
what, what you said, I
know, you know, we know

520
00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.850
where our revenues are going
to come from the next

521
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.420
year is a, is a
good Mark. You know, at,

522
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.020
at that point, once you're,
once you're a, you know,

523
00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:10.880
fully sustainable from your software,
have a ability to grow.

524
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.280
That's a, or I'd say
a good, you know, not

525
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.560
only know where your revenues
are, but know how you're

526
00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.350
going to grow the organization.
I'd say at that point

527
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:22.790
is, is when you start
becoming a startup, maybe when

528
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.480
you have to start hiring
support staff, you know, to

529
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.840
me, that's a, that's another,
when, when you're no longer

530
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.470
just a team of developers,
you know, muddling through, when

531
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.340
we need to start hiring,
you know, a sales staff,

532
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:42.610
a, you know, marketing staff,
people like that. I think

533
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.400
that's when, you know, that's
a slow transition. I don't

534
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.740
think you just wake up
one day and Hey, we're

535
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.740
no longer a startup. You
know, I think that's what,

536
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.480
or, you know, the other
way is maybe when our

537
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.770
spark subscription runs out, that's
when we officially are no

538
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.070
longer a startup. So yeah,
When you have to start

539
00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.610
paying Microsoft, when you have
to start paying Microsoft licensing,

540
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.860
you're officially not a startup.
Right. Right. Right. So, so

541
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.170
maybe that's what it is,
you know, too, but, but

542
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.050
I think it's a slow
transition, but, you know, even,

543
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.240
you know, even some of
the big, or, you know,

544
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.900
we'll say midsize software companies
out there, you know, I

545
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.310
think you absolutely need to
never lose your startup mindset.

546
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.830
And the startup mindset is
that, you know, you need

547
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.890
to take control of, of,
you know, what you're doing

548
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.130
and really understand all aspects
of it. It's not like

549
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.240
you can't, you know, build
an organization where you, you

550
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.000
know, as a founder, as
an executive, as a leader

551
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.210
in the company are just
a copying and you just

552
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.580
do your part and hope
somebody else does their part.

553
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.580
You really need to take
ownership and, you know, get

554
00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.400
other people to, you know,
you need to understand what

555
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.600
they're doing and very possibly
do it yourself. Yeah. I

556
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.540
think that that's the best
advice, you know, stay, stay

557
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.560
lean, stay hungry is, is
the way to be successful.

558
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.970
And, you know, people always
talk about Microsoft or Apple

559
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.190
or Amazon. And when they
do something great, they say,

560
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.170
yeah, they're getting the startup
mentality back. You know, they're

561
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.970
starting to think about being
more lean and when they

562
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.640
do something wrong, they always
compare them to IBM or

563
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.690
some big giant monolith. Yeah.
And I think that's exactly

564
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.120
what it is. You know,
you know, the, the biggest

565
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.060
thing, I would say the
biggest difference that I think

566
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.150
any startup could make is,
you know, if, if they're

567
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.900
familiar with the principles of
agile software development, which I

568
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.630
would, I would say any
developer wanting to start a

569
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.570
company would, would be very
familiar with, with, you know,

570
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.820
the concepts of agile, you
know, those need to be

571
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:40.740
applied to all aspects of
your business, you know, you

572
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.610
know, try something small from
a marketing standpoint, see how

573
00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.540
that works and then measure
the results and do something

574
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.090
different. You know, if you're
just doing the same thing

575
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.060
again and again, that means
that you're not trying to

576
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.910
do better, which you know,
is not, you know, not

577
00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.640
the direction that you want
to go or, you know,

578
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.530
you could be, you could
be just doing the wrong

579
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.770
thing. And that's, that was
a big mistake that we

580
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.190
made for so many years
was just, we never validated

581
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.620
that how we had spent
the last three months was

582
00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.650
the best way to spend
the last three months. We

583
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.870
should have looked at it,
not on, not on a

584
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.660
quarterly basis on a, you
know, maybe even a weekly

585
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.090
basis to say, you know,
did we do the right

586
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.450
thing last week? Are we
on the right direction? So

587
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.990
shorter increments for, for a
lot of things. Good advice,

588
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.450
good advice. Well, I appreciate
your sharing your success and

589
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.930
also your, your failures with
us today. It's been my

590
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.960
pleasure. And I think we're,
you know, still working on

591
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.970
that success thing, you know,
the biggest challenge and, you

592
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.970
know, the, the other folks
on the startup podcast, especially

593
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.150
on the startup series, especially
Kendall talk a lot about

594
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.690
the challenges of, of marketing,
getting the word out and,

595
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.440
you know, that's, that's really
where we're at right now.

596
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.750
You know, we're, we're fortunate
to be, you know, I'd

597
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:04.040
say literally years ahead in,
in development, but you know,

598
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.760
at the same time, we're
years behind in marketing, they

599
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.900
really should align, you know,
and that's, that's, that's a

600
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:15.190
pretty important thing to do.
All right. Thank you so

601
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:20.350
much, Alex <inaudible> and people
