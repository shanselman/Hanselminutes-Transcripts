From Hansel minutes.com it's Hansel
minutes, but weekly discussion with

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.410
web developer and technologist and
Scott Hanselman hosted by Carl Franklin.

3
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.300
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing. So
number one 53 recorded live

4
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.590
Wednesday, March 11th, 2009. Support for Hanselman
it's just provided by. Tellerik

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.420
already controls the most comprehensive
suite of components for windows

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:46.070
forms and asp.net web applications.
online@wwwdottelerikdotcomandby.net developers journal, the world's

7
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.830
leading developer magazine online at
www dot <inaudible> dot com.

8
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.890
In this episode, the tables
are turned and Scott is

9
00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.800
interviewed by his wife. Hi
everyone. I'm dimension Keilani I'm

10
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.160
Scott's wife. And actually you
can call me Mo. So

11
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.310
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes and squats asked

12
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.590
me to step up because
he got a cancellation and

13
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.730
I jumped at the chance
because I'll be interviewing Scott

14
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.670
Hanselman, web developer. And I
get to do all the

15
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.710
asking this time. So Scott,
how's it going? It's too

16
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.040
soon to say yes. Okay.
All right. So I probably

17
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.410
am not the best person
to be asking you these

18
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.620
questions because I'm not an
engineer or a techie, but

19
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.260
I thought people kind of
interested in tech, but I

20
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.080
think people kind of want
to know about the, the,

21
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.910
the essence of the handsome
man. So I thought we

22
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.880
kind of dig deep into,
into what makes you tick.

23
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.860
Tell me a little bit
about yourself. Oh my goodness.

24
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.960
Is that the wreck? It's
just the direction that we

25
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.100
really want to take this
deer run with it. Tell

26
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.520
you about myself. Yeah, just
a little bit. You'll have

27
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.790
to lead the interview more
than that. How man? Sorry.

28
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.940
It's not going to be
that easy, Right? Okay. Well,

29
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.640
let's start at the beginning
then. I guess, what have

30
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.250
you been working on these
days? What's going on? Well,

31
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.520
I mean, I just really
sat nerd dinner thing. I

32
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.080
haven't had a chance to
show you yet, but you've

33
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.700
been listening to me. Talk
about it for how long,

34
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.870
how many nights did I
stay up late this time?

35
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.990
Does that bug you? When
I stay up late? See

36
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.500
how I turned that around.
Nice. This focus on you.

37
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.990
Okay. So let me try
to turn it around again

38
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.360
a little bit more. Really?
I am interested in what

39
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.460
you've been working on. I
know that you're going to

40
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.460
Vegas now. Yeah, we got
mixed, mixed next week. Do

41
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.380
you look forward to those
kinds of things? It's kind

42
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.840
of a love, hate relationship
because I don't like being

43
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.190
away from you and the
kids, but I mean, Vegas

44
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.920
is Vegas, right? I mean,
Vegas is just this horrific

45
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.550
hell hole of a, of
a town, not Vegas, like

46
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.460
the incorporated town of Vegas,
but like the strip, I

47
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.220
just hate it. I just,
there's just nothing to do

48
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.550
there. So I like meeting
all the people though. I

49
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.510
mean, that's, it's nice to
meet people. So I assume

50
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.530
to totally random people, like
some of the most fun

51
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.480
I've had at conferences, I've
told you about this before

52
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.000
would be like, like one
time I was in an

53
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.330
elevator in Vegas and I
was by myself and these

54
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.400
like Norwegian guys were in
the elevator and they're like,

55
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.100
Hey, it's got Hanselman. I
can't do a Norwegian accent.

56
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.870
So I'll just make them
surfer dudes. It's got handsome,

57
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.540
man. Hey, do you doing
anything right now? Let's let's

58
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.460
go have dinner or you
look alone. I'm like, Oh,

59
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.710
that was so nice. You
know, it's just like, Oh

60
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.560
man, that's so thoughtful. I
wish everybody could do that.

61
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.050
You know, just because you
recognize one person, that's cool

62
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.520
to ask them to dinner.
But at the same time,

63
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.200
random people should ask each
other to dinner at, at

64
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.450
technical events. Cause nobody wants
to be away from home.

65
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.140
So yeah. Hence the nerd
dinner, I guess I kind

66
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.540
of brought that around. Didn't
even realize I was doing

67
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.410
it. I didn't know I
was completed. That's right. That's

68
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.590
right. So, and when people
do that, when, when you're,

69
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.120
I was going to say,
I cost it, but that's

70
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.580
really not the essence behind
it. When you approach that

71
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.030
way and people are so
sort of Reverend about meeting

72
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.360
the Scott Hanson, what goes through
your mind? I mean, do

73
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.970
you get that? You're this
big deal out there. I'm

74
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.980
not a big deal. I'm
only a big deal to

75
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.890
you because I forward you.
The emails that people send

76
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.170
me. Oh, I saw your
talk. It was cool. You

77
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.820
have no idea, but any
of this stuff, right? You

78
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.580
don't care. I mean, I'm
not even as quote unquote

79
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.700
famous as like a local
news anchor. You know what

80
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.220
I mean? If you see
the weather check at Safeway,

81
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.730
you're like, Aw dude, it's
the lady from channel two.

82
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.200
I am not at that
level yet. There are probably

83
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.480
a few thousand people in
the world that give a

84
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.050
crap about what I do
that said it's kind of

85
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.080
like being a really like
a, like a lifetime television

86
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.200
character actor, like, Oh, it's
that dude with a familiar

87
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.890
face. But Phil hacks said
something really interesting on his

88
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.820
blog today where he said,
authorship does not equal authority.

89
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.380
Everyone can write a book,
right? Anybody can write a

90
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.740
book, you right. Anybody can
write a book. Writing a

91
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.710
book means that you are
loud. Not that you are

92
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.820
an authority and Jeff Atwood
who I think you've either

93
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.440
met or I've mentioned him
enough that you might as

94
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.260
well have met him. And
he talks to J J

95
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.030
money yet you and Jay
money are really tight. I'm

96
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.810
sure you've never met him.
Have you talks about the

97
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.360
idea that we're all amateurs,
right? I mean, Jeff is

98
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.410
loud and I am cloudish.
That doesn't mean that I'm

99
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.340
a good programmer. So do
you struggle with that though?

100
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.650
I mean, if you're, if
you're loud, obviously people listening

101
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.560
to you, do you struggle
with trying to sort of

102
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.680
not bring out your own
opinion, but you know, speaking

103
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.960
for the many minions out
there who are not as

104
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.290
loud as you are at
the moment, The minions, the

105
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.230
Hansel minions, the many, I
mean, I'm just a guy

106
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.450
who started a blog six
years ago. You remember when

107
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.880
I started it and I
just did it so I

108
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.120
could Google myself later. I
wasn't trying to do anything

109
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.850
impressive with it. I just
wanted to be able to

110
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.690
search for code later on.
So I'm not really sure

111
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.340
why anyone applied. I'm not,
I'm, I'm skirting the issue

112
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.000
here. Clearly. I'm famous in
a tiny, tiny group of

113
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.790
people. And sometimes when you
put enough of them in

114
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.040
a town, it's like, I'm
famous for a little bit.

115
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.300
Like, like, like Bruce Campbell, the
actor, which you said once,

116
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.120
who, so now you watch
burn notice. So you think

117
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.620
this campus is awesome, but
you know what I'm saying?

118
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.080
You don't know who post
Campbell is. You would see

119
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.390
him at Safeway and you
go, is that that guy

120
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.180
for burn notice? That's not
famous. That's not like Tom

121
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.400
cruise famous. Like I'm looking
at Twitter here. I'm like

122
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.060
Aston Kutcher is on Twitter.
Right? Okay. So like I've

123
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.130
got 8,000 people that follow
me on Twitter and you're

124
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.710
like, yeah, that's creepy. Stop
tweeting about the kid's poop

125
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.140
asking. Cause your has 150,000
or 220,000 people following him.

126
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.560
If there's like this famous.
And then there's like another

127
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.500
word that's not even in
the same, in the same

128
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.920
sport. So I'm in the
same ballpark. So what do

129
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.410
I think about this is
what it is. I don't

130
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.990
think about it really that
humble or are you just

131
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.750
sounding humble? No, it's about
being humble. It's about your

132
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.850
mean man? What kind of
questions are these? Are you

133
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.540
faking it or something? Taking
humility? No. Most people who

134
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.360
have any amount of fame
at all are probably have

135
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.490
a great deal of self-loathing.
And I probably have that

136
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.560
too. Everyone's got that. What
have they done for me

137
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.460
lately thing? Ultimately, I am
a teacher. Like I was

138
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.190
at my, my buddy, Greg
Jackson called me and said,

139
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.160
come down to Portland, community
college and give a talk.

140
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.880
Right. I went out, this
was last night. So I

141
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.390
went over and I talked
to his 202 level asp.net

142
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.600
class. And they're using the
book that me and bill

143
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.890
Evian and Devin Raider wrote
mostly bill. And they're using

144
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.230
that as their text. And
like the first thing out

145
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.670
of the mouse was like,
wow, you're not as fat

146
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.450
as you were on your
book. Yeah. Thanks. It got

147
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.920
the point. You're not, you're
much younger in person. And

148
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.430
I talked to these guys
for like two hours, three

149
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.990
hours and I was there
until like 10, right? I

150
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.080
mean they stayed way late
at a community college and

151
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.860
Oh man, I forgot how
good I was at that.

152
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.470
And I don't, I'm not
saying good at speaking, what

153
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:20.350
am I good at teaching?
So all this Microsoft shell,

154
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.670
Twitter blog, blah, blah, blah.
It's all BS. I'm a

155
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.210
teacher and teachers don't necessarily
know what they're talking about,

156
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.220
which is another important thing
to note about teachers. And

157
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.730
I've told you this before,
there's a mystery amount of

158
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.570
hubris involved in being a
teacher because you, you think

159
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.970
you might possibly have a
better idea than the students,

160
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.430
but you're you still, maybe
just a chapter or two

161
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.520
ahead. Right. And you're not
really awesome until you've taught

162
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.180
the class a couple of
times, This is hard. You

163
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.700
know, I listened to NPR
and Neil Conan and all

164
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.100
those guys and they're jumping
in every 30 seconds. You've

165
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.000
been going on for like
minutes. So Tonight now the

166
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.770
next question, dear should be,
why do you talk so

167
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.910
much? That's right. And how
does one shut you up?

168
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.690
Really? No, I'm pretty interested
in that because you're talking

169
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.660
about teaching and connect that
to ego. I mean, we've

170
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.910
talked about this a little.
Well, what feeds, what feeds

171
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.910
you? I mean, my dad
always says like, what feeds

172
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.400
your spirit? Right? And he
always said, growing up, if

173
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.700
you and people can go
listen to the podcast where

174
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.570
I interviewed my dad, he
always says like, you know,

175
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.940
if you want to dig
ditches, if that feeds your

176
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.340
spirit, do it right. You
know, my, my little brother

177
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.070
always wanted to be a,
a fire man. So he's

178
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.440
a fireman and that's what
feeds his spirit. That's what

179
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.420
he likes to do. I
just really like to run

180
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.480
down the hall with an
open laptop going dude, check

181
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.780
this out. So everything that
I do, whether it be

182
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.360
hanging out at a local
community college, talking to 20

183
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.440
kids for three hours on
a Tuesday night or talking

184
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.180
to you about what I
worked on that day or

185
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.490
speaking at a conference in
front of a thousand people,

186
00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.020
it's all the equivalent of
running down the hall with

187
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.320
a laptop, going to check
this out. I laugh. I

188
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.140
have visions of like, you
know, Lillian, you know, other

189
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.510
nieces and nephews who are
like uncle Scott. I have

190
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.730
a quick question. And then,
you know, they get this

191
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.320
long, 20 minute answer to
their quick question. What you're

192
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.290
referring to is when, when,
when one of our nieces

193
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.440
came over from, I think
they were coming from Tanzania

194
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.090
and they said something very
innocuous, like, why is it

195
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.570
this time here? And it's
like, you know, two in

196
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.830
the morning and Tanzania. And
I was like, well, here,

197
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.740
hold this here. Okay. You're
the sun right here. Use

198
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.480
the orange, says this side.
Right? Use the orange, just

199
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.740
the sun. I'll be the
moon. Okay. Quick turn this

200
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.380
23 degrees. Okay. So the
earth is tilted like this.

201
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.980
All right. Now, move this
here. I'll hold the sun.

202
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.870
So then suddenly the question
about what the temper, you

203
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.510
know, it became a lesson
on the solar system and

204
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.400
like they groaned, how could
they not find that? Awesome.

205
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.960
How could these people not
want to listen to science

206
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.050
Friday? You know what I'm
saying? That's a teacher, you

207
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.050
know, like talk, talk about,
here you go, dear. You

208
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.640
know how Zensa will say,
like, why is the sky

209
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.690
blue or whatever? And he's
like, our son he's three.

210
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.590
Right? Well here's how light
refresh. Okay. Let's go. Let's

211
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.210
go to the science museums.
And so on. Let's talk

212
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.970
about a prism. Here's the,
here's the visible spectrum of

213
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.060
light. That's right. Because I,
in my infinite wisdom, when

214
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.920
I'm asked, why is the
sun blue? You know, I

215
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.080
have the sky blue rather
I have the time I'm

216
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.880
thinking, you know, I've got
to, you know, change the

217
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.710
baby. You've got to do
this, then that we've got

218
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.690
to move on. So, you
know, my answer and it's

219
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.970
wisdom is because it's not
red or something like that.

220
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.160
And you, I mean, you're
going to really, you know,

221
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.160
give it the respect that
it deserves and sit there

222
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.260
and then dig into this.
I think it says a

223
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.990
lot about the kind of
person that you are and

224
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.720
your desire to share this
knowledge. But moving on just

225
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.420
a little bit, Tom, talk
real briefly about your path.

226
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.100
I know you've talked about
this with your dad about

227
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.550
how you, how you to
this point. But I want

228
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.560
to go back to my
initial question. What is it

229
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.600
that makes you tick? I
mean, what is the nature?

230
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.910
So passionate about this stuff
that you do? Why don't

231
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.050
you get tired of it?
You've gone to programming programming.

232
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.870
I mean, web development, you
know, dot net, this whole

233
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.820
thing. How do you, how
do you keep it fresh

234
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.830
frosty? How did you just
stay frosty? I taught you

235
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.670
that stay frosty and you're
staying frosty and I never

236
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.760
even saw the movie. You
never finished the movie. And

237
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.180
I love that you can
watch Terminator the TV show

238
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.550
without having ever watched or
wanting to watch even a

239
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:31.440
single Terminator. Guess back to
the issue at hand. Yes.

240
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.000
From time to say, we
know that was not an

241
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.290
appropriate time for woot. What
was the question? What drives

242
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:42.570
me? I don't know. I
mean, it's empowerment. Like why

243
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.790
do I try to keep
a running tally of the

244
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.430
groceries and my head and
see if I can come

245
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.820
up with it total within
a dollar faster than the

246
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.900
check at the checkout thing,
because it's cool. It's interesting.

247
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.390
I was gonna say, it's
cool. It's not cool. I

248
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.660
wasn't cool in high school.
Nobody wanted to be my

249
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.010
friend. No, but I mean,
how, how can you not

250
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.210
right. One of the examples
that I gave to, to

251
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.900
the guys at the, the
kids, the kids, the 30

252
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.610
to 40 year old men
and women that I met

253
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.770
at the local community college
yesterday was, you know, if

254
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.740
you took apart your, your,
your toaster oven, if you

255
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.370
took apart your, your clock
radio, if you put it

256
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.350
back together again, you know,
these are all the signs

257
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.830
of wanting to be a,
a computer minded person, not

258
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.530
even a computer minded person,
but, and an engineer, you

259
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.700
know, wondering why it works.
Like I give the example

260
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.820
of teaching your sister, how
to drive a car, her

261
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.510
concept of the relationship between
the steering wheel and the

262
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.180
wheels. When I was teaching
her to parallel park, was

263
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.640
that the steering wheel disappears
into the dashboard. You know,

264
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.220
there's like this there's this
like steering shaft that goes

265
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.310
into the desk, turns into
magic, right? And then the

266
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.540
wheels turn, which is probably
your perception of how the

267
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.540
one, which is probably your
perception. You know what I'm

268
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.440
saying, though? It goes, as
you know, it's attached to

269
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.560
the dashboard, but then there's
a cloud of Magic happens

270
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.360
under the hood. Exactly. If
your mind goes farther into

271
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.000
the dashboard and you want
to rip the dashboard open

272
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.550
and find out what's going
on, then you may be

273
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.850
a computer person. It's not
a qualitative judgment about being

274
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.600
a good person or bad
person. I'm not the curiosity

275
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.130
for this thing. You know?
I mean, you have an

276
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.710
MBA. I don't, I could
really care less about that

277
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.830
kind of thing. But, but
after what, 15 years, 16

278
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.010
years, what time is it?
This is your, this is

279
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.980
your 17, so 17 years
into it. I mean, how,

280
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.990
how do you still stay
as passionate about it as

281
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.570
you are? I mean, you're
not, I've met teachers who

282
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.850
initially, when they believed, you
know, when they started teaching

283
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.720
and were gung ho and
the system kind of beats

284
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.030
it out of them slowly,
how, how have you stayed

285
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.340
as passionate as you are?
And as, as committed to

286
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.800
being on top of, you
know, anything that comes out,

287
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.870
I mean, I caught this
thing on NPR today, where

288
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.290
they were talking about Twitter,
they were interviewing the two

289
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:11.270
guys, the Bevins, and they
were talking about, you know,

290
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.760
but I remembered you like
two years ago saying, I'm

291
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.920
going to tweet, you're talking
about your blood sugar. And

292
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.090
I remember, You know, I
diabetes for a day 24

293
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.660
hours. I thought it was
weird then. Yeah. And of

294
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.670
course it's a little weird
now, but still, you know,

295
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.090
how do you stay? So,
so like, you clearly enjoy

296
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.610
it. You enjoy what you
do. There's two different things

297
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.300
that you've brought up there
though. One is keeping up

298
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.710
on technology, which might mean
getting a new cell phone

299
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.080
or making sure you have
the best DVD player. Like,

300
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.610
you know, like we don't
have a blue Ray player.

301
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.050
We will soon, but, but
you know, we're up on

302
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.690
technology in some sense, but,
and then there's keeping up

303
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:57.010
on pop culture and technology,
what they call memes, you

304
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.300
know, like Twitter is a
fad, but compared to Facebook,

305
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.220
Twitter, can't even be seen
like there's like 8 million people

306
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.350
on Twitter. And I think
the only reason that it's

307
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:13.510
fun to, to talk about
Twitter is because it's fun

308
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.790
to say the word tweet.
That's like, that's my theory

309
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.590
about why people think Twitter
is cool. Cause it's fun

310
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.240
to say tweet and Twitter,
there are 175 million people on

311
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.560
Facebook. Okay. Like put that
into perspective, right? Twitter could

312
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.540
grow the way it is
growing for the next 200

313
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.540
years. And it would never
catch Facebook. Ever. Facebook is

314
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.050
mainstream. Twitter is a niche.
So I'm trying to make

315
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.040
the differentiation that there's being
up on stuff like, you

316
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.230
know, having a new computer
or the newest computer or

317
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.900
the newest iPod or whatever.
And then there's being up

318
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.240
on all the internet memes.
They're kind of two different.

319
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.830
They feed two different things.
Twitter feeds and an addiction

320
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.070
to being connected and an
addiction to being an urgency

321
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:59.500
addiction. Right. Right. The Stephen
Covey quadrants about urgent important,

322
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.070
important, neither urgent nor important.
Twitter is nice because it

323
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.800
is neither urgent or important
for the most of the

324
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.080
time. And then suddenly something
really important and urgent happens

325
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.260
like a plane hits the
Hudson and then Twitter finds

326
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.240
out first. But for the
most part, Twitter is very

327
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.050
low on the urgency stuff.
So that's one thing. So

328
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.510
Twitter and memes and all
that kind of crap and

329
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.570
funny videos on YouTube are
neither urgent or important, right?

330
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.200
But computers getting faster and
more memory. And the move

331
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.050
from 32 bit to 64
bit processors and going from

332
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.040
unmanaged code to manage code.
Those things are both urgent

333
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.050
and important. Those things are
interesting. That feeds a whole

334
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.130
different part of me. So
there's keeping up on memes.

335
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.560
I have less patience for,
I don't really care what

336
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.720
the new hot hip thing
is. I'm never going to

337
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.290
be like Robert Scoble, you
know, Robert Scoble, you have

338
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.620
no idea. Who's Robert scope.
I refuse to, You know,

339
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.870
really, I mean, we don't
have enough time in this

340
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.910
interview for me to dig
away. This is about you.

341
00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.700
Right? Okay. That you're dodging
this question. Just hold the

342
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.150
microphone there. The, the way
you're dodging. That is lovely.

343
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.910
You've heard Robert COVID. So
Robert Scoble is like the

344
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:11.030
quintessential UpToDate super connected meme
person. Right. I would like

345
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.920
to be like, you know,
I want to be more

346
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.640
focused on, on the, the
technology on the, the programming

347
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.320
and the computer side of
thing and not on the

348
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.860
social graph part of things.
I don't really care to

349
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.080
be connected to that many
people. I mean, the people

350
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.820
that I don't know from
high school that are trying

351
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.640
to get to know me
from Facebook, I don't re

352
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.840
I don't hang out with
them for a reason. You

353
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.480
hear that people out there
that you can reconnect with

354
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.190
people. Well, from high school,
it's like why, if I

355
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.110
wanted to reconnect with them,
we wouldn't have lost touch.

356
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.350
Fair enough. I hang out
with the people I want

357
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.560
to from high school. Hey,
okay. Fair enough. Right. They

358
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.630
were at our wedding. But,
but, but, but, but again,

359
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.030
I mean, though, I, I
think I, you answering the

360
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.550
fluffier side of the question,
how is it that you're

361
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.390
kept this, this, this attraction
with what it is that

362
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.760
you do so many people
search for so long? I

363
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.710
mean, I know of many
people who are in their

364
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.490
forties and fifties, I haven't
found that this one thing

365
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:14.180
that really motivates them Because
it is empowering because I

366
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.460
am yeah. Just to power
free. Cause this is the

367
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.670
third time you mentioned it,
Power in the greed and

368
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.660
power and money sense of
the word, but empowered in

369
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.550
the way that teenagers today
are not empowered. Like say

370
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:34.010
more please. Oh yes. They're
empowered. Like I have no

371
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.340
tolerance for like a 13
year olds. Like, Hey, it's

372
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.120
summertime. Yeah. I guess I'll
hang out with my friends.

373
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.520
You know, I really, can't
not much I can do.

374
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.100
I'm only 13 and I'm
only 14 or whatever. You

375
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.810
know, man, when I was
14, I got a job.

376
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.970
I got a, I got
a job permit and I

377
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.210
went and I folded shirts
at Nordstrom's. You know, when

378
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.210
I wanted to get a
car, my dad said, you

379
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.910
know, good, get a car.
I wish you all the

380
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.870
best, good luck with that
son. And, and I went

381
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.330
and I bought it for
$300 and I paid in

382
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.020
payments. Now this is like,
the, this is, this is

383
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.700
the part of my personality,
which is like, get off

384
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:16.460
my lawn, damn kids, you
know, be empowered, get out

385
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.950
there and do it. And
what's great about programming is

386
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:23.560
that you can think something
and then make you see

387
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.550
what I'm saying. Like, have
you ever looked at an

388
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.770
Excel spreadsheet? You do stuff
in Excel. Cause you're like

389
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.520
a business person. And then
you, you, you look at

390
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.910
those numbers and then you
can envision the crazy pivot

391
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.990
table. It hasn't been done
yet. And you say, I

392
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:44.090
can do this. Okay. Imagine
that feeling times of thousand,

393
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.220
that's what programming is like.
And that that's what You

394
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.710
feel every day. I mean,
maybe not necessarily every day,

395
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.980
but that's, what's allowed you
to keep it Staying with

396
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.270
this keeps you from feeling
helpless. I mean, I can't,

397
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.440
it's so sad to look
at someone's. This is horrible.

398
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.320
You ever get a resume
from somebody for some technical

399
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.690
job and then you turn
like the paragraph marks thing

400
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.050
on and suddenly instead of
seeing like nice tab stops

401
00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.700
and stuff, you just see
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,

402
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.210
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,
boom, sorry, delete, thrown away.

403
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.730
I mean, I don't really
mean that, but I kind

404
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.920
of mean that it's like,
if you, if you couldn't

405
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.590
master word and the basics
of the tab stop, I'm

406
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.760
I really going to hire
you because of, you know,

407
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.310
cause I don't want to
see a whole colorful array

408
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.040
of tabs and spaces and
chaos. And you know, I

409
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.960
know when this line is
11 point and that lines

410
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.890
12 point that shows attention
to detail and empowerment. So

411
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.590
the point I'm making is
that to, to master a

412
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.930
piece of software, even a
comparatively simple one, like word

413
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.350
or PowerPoint is the first
step. And this is the

414
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.880
feeling that you had when
you learned word. Right? And

415
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.950
when you, when I moved
you onto like Gmail and

416
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.570
you hated it, and then
you got it and then

417
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.270
suddenly you're tagging and star
and then search. And you're

418
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.890
like, Oh yeah, there's the
movement from, from non-computer person

419
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.490
to computer person to power
user, to programmer to really

420
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:10.890
good programmer each level. Each
time you level up. Oh,

421
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:15.420
that's so sad. Oh, Cause
I'm putting this in gaming

422
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.650
parlance. Each time you level
up like that, as you

423
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.310
reached level 70, you're getting
more of a sense of,

424
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.550
well, I can do this.
I can make things happen.

425
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.860
Someone can send me a
text file and I can

426
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.410
sort it and split it
and make everything uppercase and

427
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.160
send it back. Boom. It's
magic, man. How can you

428
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.520
not care about this stuff?
I know you do Gripped.

429
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.030
I mean, I am right
there with you. Do you

430
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.310
know how to make the
possible out of the impossible?

431
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.490
Well, the dotnet ninjas at
Telerik do they just released

432
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.740
a huge pack of web
controls, all built on top

433
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.550
of ESPN at Ajax, that'll
help you build impossibly fast

434
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.670
and interactive applications in no
time at all. They've made

435
00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.630
the impossible possible in desktop
development. If you think you

436
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.090
can't have a carousel component
and wind forms, well you

437
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.600
can. They're windows forms. Suite
features a super powerful grid

438
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.420
view control on 32 other
crazy desktop components that will

439
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.140
give you a dazzling WPF
like features, but in wind

440
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.990
forms, they do the same
thing in reporting solutions with

441
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.240
a new design surface, like
nothing else looks just like

442
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.680
graph paper. Cause you advanced
page layout capabilities makes it

443
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.930
feel more like a graphic
design software than a reporting

444
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:31.740
solution. Go check them out@telerikdotcomandbeat.net
Ninja. Thanks for listening. So

445
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.020
how do you manage to
fit all of this? And

446
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.810
this is a legitimate question
that many people have asked

447
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.590
me, how does this man
do it? You know, maybe

448
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.930
people ask you this. Yes.
All seven of them. I

449
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.260
mean, what do you give
up to, to have kind

450
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.850
of drive that you've got
or the kind of a

451
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.740
mission that you've got? The
vision that you've got? I

452
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.960
mean, I, and I don't
tell people that it's because

453
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.490
you know, in the middle
of the night at 3:00 AM.

454
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.800
Yeah. I'm up sobbing and
that's how he copes compile.

455
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.520
I mean, I don't think
you're making me, you're talking

456
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.820
to me up here. Love
ha ha. I mean like

457
00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.140
how do I fit it
all in a day? Well,

458
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.280
how do you think I
fit it all in a

459
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.380
day? Right? When did I
come to bed last night?

460
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.490
This is about you and
yeah, But you're not disinterested.

461
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.880
Neil Conan from NPR who
doesn't know the interviewer, you're

462
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.390
the wife. I'm not interviewing
as a life. I'm just,

463
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.020
I need you to interview
as the wife because I

464
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.820
can get her all sorts
of random interviews. Can we

465
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.210
start over? No. What time
did I come to bed

466
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.570
last night for, was it
four it's four 34. Is

467
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.090
that a good idea? That's
what we ask our three

468
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.000
year olds, right? No, that
is not a good idea,

469
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.140
but that was a sacrifice.
Now I don't, COVID 4:00 AM

470
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.460
4:30 AM every night, but, but
you've been very supportive in

471
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.750
the sense of, I can,
I can look you in

472
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.910
the eye and say, this
is important. Or you know,

473
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.460
this really isn't important. You
know, there's some stuff I

474
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.000
wanted to get done before
mics. And the day after

475
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.260
mix is over, we're going
on vacation. So it's about

476
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.190
balance. So there may be
days or even a week

477
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.430
or two where I might
work crazy crazy hours, but

478
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.040
you've got to temper that
with like, you know, we

479
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.520
went to Africa for a
month. We actually borrowed vacation

480
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.060
into the next year. We've
borrowed more vacation than I

481
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.180
actually have. So it's like
play hard, work hard, I

482
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.630
guess that you think that
we do that. I think

483
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.000
so. I mean, it's always
a balance. It's always a

484
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.490
struggle, but how do you
think it impacts your family?

485
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.390
Well, that's one of the
things like you could play

486
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.390
with the, with the boys
for 10 hours a day

487
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.090
and then, you know, like
10 solid hours play with

488
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.000
them. And then on the
11th hour say I'm going

489
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.680
to go and do something
else right now. And they

490
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.300
would make you feel like
you did not spend enough

491
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.340
time with them, you know?
Right. So, I mean, what

492
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.870
do we do? We get
up about what's an average

493
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.470
day here. We get up
about eight, eight. We get

494
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.370
the boys ready for school,
take them to school. Then

495
00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.070
I like a nomad run
from free wireless to free

496
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.880
wireless from Panera to Mose,
to Chipotle and back sometimes

497
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.670
work at the house and
I'll work until maybe, I

498
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.420
don't know, five or six
sometimes earlier, sometimes later kind

499
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.390
of depends on what's going
on at the time we

500
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.360
eat, we play with the
boys from, so we're pretty

501
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.860
much from the I'm from
I'm with the boys from

502
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.470
like five to eight, five
to nine. I try to

503
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.190
squeeze as much of that
as I can and put

504
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.230
him to bed. And then
depending on whether or not

505
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.480
we watch TV or we
hang out or read books

506
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.390
or do the taxes or
getting together to go to

507
00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:35.920
bed at like, I don't
know, one or two get

508
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.470
up at eight. You know,
we get to, we spent

509
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.790
three, four hours. I spent
three or four hours with

510
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.910
the boys. It's been forced
four to six hours with

511
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.450
plus on a, you know,
an eight, 10 hour day.

512
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.890
We get a lot of
there's a lot in a

513
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.110
day. There's a lot of
time when you go to

514
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.180
bed at 2:00 AM is a
lot in your time. And

515
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.010
then on the weekends, you
know, I get to hang

516
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.440
out with the boys all
weekend long, which is cool

517
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.240
when I'm not traveling, which
I don't travel too much.

518
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.740
And on those times when
I get a sense that

519
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.840
I'm maybe stealing an hour
here or stealing an hour

520
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.080
there, I try to give
that hour back. Wouldn't you

521
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.900
agree with that? Why are
you smiling? Why are you

522
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.250
teasing me, man, Conscientious about
giving back what you've taken.

523
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.090
And I think that's, that's
very awesome. So what, what

524
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.090
is your, what inspires you?
What's your source of inspiration

525
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.700
As you try to cram
so many things into one

526
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.910
thing, Source of inspiration. I
mean all of this work,

527
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.410
there's the work of the
creation, creating stuff, but the

528
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.930
older I am making something,
making something out of nothing.

529
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.240
Yeah. That's cool. Making lots
as much stuff as I

530
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:41.600
can, but I'm getting, you
know, not working anymore. Right.

531
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.740
As in retirement. Oh yeah.
Hell yeah. I mean, that's

532
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.210
what I want to do,
right? That was our plan.

533
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.330
Right? You are my still
my wife flash interviewer. That

534
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.640
is the plan right there.
Oh, we'll just stop doing

535
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.430
this as soon as possible.
Let me take a memo

536
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.660
here. Okay. That's the plan,
right? It's to be done

537
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.910
as soon as possible. And
the cool thing about the

538
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.760
plan is we may not
necessarily stop doing any of

539
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.370
this stuff, but at least
then I wouldn't have to

540
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:11.630
go to work. You know
what I'm saying? But I

541
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.490
think I probably go teach
high school. That would be

542
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:19.250
my retirement tired ties To,
to what you're talking about

543
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:25.580
before that I worked for
Microsoft because it lets me

544
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.350
work from home and it
lets me be a teacher.

545
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.490
That's pretty awesome. I'm not
a, not a professional fan

546
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.530
boy. Although I think some
people might think I am.

547
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.390
What is my job here?
What do you think my

548
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:41.560
job is again? Nice job.
No, I mean is in

549
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:46.130
my opinion and really Will
have emailed me personally. And

550
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.590
this is my podcast. What
do you think my job

551
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.110
is? This is my podcast.
Cause I'm the one interviewing

552
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.790
you and I'm going to
own it and focus on

553
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:56.030
that. Why don't we be
a team? How's that? What

554
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.780
do you think? I think
you are an educator. I

555
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.610
mean, I think your job
really does involve a lot

556
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.800
of teaching and reaching out
to people and that type

557
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.120
of thing, community building, et
cetera, et cetera. It's just

558
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.850
Community building. What is that?
Or I mean, but, but

559
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.280
you, you talk, you, you
network with a lot of

560
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.520
people, whether they're students, whether
they're, you know, business leaders,

561
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.250
I mean, you do a
lot of outreach when I

562
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.950
would call a region and
yet you're shaking hands, not

563
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.600
so much in the literal,
But is that a job?

564
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.430
I mean, everyone teased our
president for being a community

565
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.220
organizer. Is that what I
am doing? Want me to

566
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.350
jump? It's the way of
being, I think even if

567
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.530
you weren't working for necessarily
Microsoft It's, it's who you

568
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:38.510
are, you know? So that's,
that's that? What was it

569
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.790
that Mandela said talking about
prison is a state of

570
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.690
type of thing. It's it's,
it's just, this is who

571
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.460
Scott Hanselman needs, right? This
is what you do, regardless

572
00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.940
of whatever, whether they're getting
paid or not Labeled title,

573
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.450
you want payment, no payment.
That's a good answer. You,

574
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.340
I didn't think you could
pull that off. How would

575
00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.170
you answer? No, I couldn't.
I couldn't have answered it

576
00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:03.600
better. I mean, ultimately I'm
just testing you. It's the

577
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.470
back and forth. That makes
us a good team. Yeah.

578
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.260
I mean, that's, that's, that's
the deal it's about, I

579
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.880
mean, I'm excited about stuff
I'm usually, I mean, I'm

580
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.900
often excited about Microsoft stuff
and sometimes not. I took

581
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.430
a lot of who Boone
to discs with us to

582
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.030
South Africa, but yeah. And when
I'm not excited anymore, then

583
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:27.300
I probably go work somewhere
else. What'd you think? Cause

584
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.450
that would be sad to
be not excited. Yeah. I

585
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.820
think it's wonderful that you
have that philosophy. I find

586
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.730
it really great. Okay. Let
me see. I did try

587
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.710
to jot down a couple
of questions and you've dodged

588
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.870
all of them. None of
them have been answered, but

589
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.330
how much time do we
have? Probably a couple more

590
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.800
minutes. We can go as
long as you want here.

591
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.500
Oh wow. I'm just, I'm
just now getting, you know,

592
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.480
There's like five people listening
here at this point. I

593
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.370
started with a seven and
I've lost two in the

594
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:57.280
process, you know, I'm just
saying, okay, what's next for,

595
00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.180
for the handsome man? The
Hanselman. Yeah. Cause you call

596
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.540
me the handsome man around
that. Right. What's next? I

597
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.920
don't know what to tell
you. I'm going to keep

598
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.330
you on this until it's
boring and then I'll do

599
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.200
something else. Well, I'll tell
you before I quit And

600
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.170
nice non-answer so, No, I
mean, this was the thing

601
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.480
that like I had my
mid year review, like what

602
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:20.790
was it like last week?
And I told my boss,

603
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.340
I was like, yeah, this
is pretty cool. Because the

604
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.290
Microsoft people, they always want
you to grow up and

605
00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.660
like become a manager and
then a manager of managers.

606
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.030
And then, you know, God
amongst men and I've been

607
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.870
enjoying what I'm doing. Where
do you see yourself in

608
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.230
five years? I have no
plan that far in five

609
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.330
years. Everything I do in,
in terms of how many

610
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.630
years from now is in
context of the kids, right?

611
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.120
In five years, I see
us taking the older boy

612
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:52.290
to what third grade. Wow.
That's what I think about

613
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.270
what I'm doing as a
job in five years. It

614
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.840
doesn't really matter to me.
I was already a chief

615
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.330
architect and a very nice
publicly traded company. And I've,

616
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.700
I've made my, I've done
my job. I've made my

617
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.160
production at my proof. Maybe
I'll be the startup. I

618
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.690
don't know. As long as
I have good healthcare, it

619
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.150
doesn't really matter. As long
as I can get insulin

620
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.680
and a and T one
or some fiber optic, then

621
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.140
it doesn't really matter what
I'm doing. Right. And what

622
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.490
was the first thing that
we did when we built

623
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.590
this house? Talk to me.
What was the first thing

624
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:21.480
we did? When we built
this house? I was on

625
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.730
the ground and kicked out.
He goes, it's not a

626
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:28.440
mistake. No, nothing. No, we
are. We put in internet.

627
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.820
Absolutely. We, we pulled cable.
That's what we did. You

628
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.370
remember that? I do remember
that indeed. And it was

629
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:40.070
worth it. It was absolutely
worth it. Okay. Anything that

630
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.800
you think of your should
know about you partying? My

631
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.420
viewers and your listeners, parting
thoughts? I don't know. They

632
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.420
like to listen to you
talk about stuff. I think

633
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.430
I've taken over this interview
and talked about me and

634
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.630
we didn't get a chance
to talk to you about

635
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.690
you. It wasn't about me.
It was, it was about

636
00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.880
you and about the Scott
Hanselman that people don't know.

637
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.390
But in all seriousness, people
are interested in hearing about,

638
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.260
about you and your perspective.
I mean, when we, we

639
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.020
met, we've been together. What
is this now? How many

640
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.570
years has this been? Eight
years, nine years, 10 years.

641
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:15.760
Eight years. Nine years. Well,
it feels like 12. No,

642
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.320
we've been married a long
time coming up on 10

643
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:25.450
years here. And when, when
did you think that I

644
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:30.580
was louder than the average
programmer? Well, And I didn't

645
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.280
know a whole lot of
programs to begin with. So

646
00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.830
I've always rather thought that
you were loud. Yes. And

647
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.000
opinionated, And very, very eager
to share that opinion with

648
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.150
anybody who'd listened. So from
the beginning, really, it's not

649
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:46.990
the definition of pompous. Well,
you know your word, not

650
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.500
mine. No, it's a, it's
a fine dance that you,

651
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.380
you, you dance. There's, it's
a fine line too, that

652
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.310
you walk between saying, this
is what I think. And

653
00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:00.190
I make no apology for
having that opinion without wanting

654
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.950
to offend and without wanting
to put down at the

655
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:06.310
people that disagree. So it's,
it's, it's always, It's been

656
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.980
a very interesting thing to
observe for me and to

657
00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.440
see how you deal with
people that, whether it's on

658
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.450
your blog, but want to
say, you know, Scott, this

659
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:16.750
is stupid or Scott, you
know, the sex. I think

660
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.260
I've only seen you delete
comment, not related really to,

661
00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.630
it's not germane to anything
we're talking about, but going

662
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.920
to a blog for a
second, I think I've only

663
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.680
seen you delete one comment.
One time where the guy

664
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.160
was really offensive. I can't
remember if it was racist

665
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.570
or something, but it was
something that was yeah. But

666
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.510
otherwise everything else that says,
you know, you're an idiot,

667
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.670
you're not smart guy. Why
do you bother please stop

668
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.340
logging? You know, all those
comments. I mean, And he's

669
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.110
got an opinion. It doesn't
mean it doesn't hurt. Right?

670
00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.470
I mean, somebody tweeted something
about that. I was a

671
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:52.480
pompous asshole or something. So
I retweeted it last, you

672
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.430
know? So it's like, I
mean, it's a valid opinion,

673
00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.610
right? I don't want to
be a pompous asshole. So

674
00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.100
if somebody gives me feedback
like that, I'm like, okay,

675
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.310
I should probably think about
that. He might be right.

676
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:08.050
Who am I to, you
know, not to mention Jeff

677
00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.860
Atwood twice in a talk,
but he has this thing.

678
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.440
He quoted, he quotes people.
So I don't know if

679
00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.180
it's him or if it's
somebody quoted, but he said

680
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:23.320
something strong opinions, weakly held
nice. That's freaking awesome. You

681
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.240
know what I'm saying? Cause
this is the thing that

682
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.740
you hate about me. Cause
you and I will have

683
00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.540
a fight. Right. And when
I say fight, I mean,

684
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.050
lowercase F not capital left.
And our fights are like,

685
00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.540
pretty much like this I'm
going to reenact one of

686
00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.160
our fights. Right? Oh goodness.
Well, here's like an example.

687
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.140
Here's an example of a
fight we had that we

688
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.240
thought the interest rate on
something was, I thought it

689
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.570
was 0% and you thought
it was 1%. Right? Right.

690
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.700
And it was like, no,
it's 1%. Oh, it's 0%.

691
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.600
Oh, it's 1%. It's very
sophisticated. The fighting. And then,

692
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.480
and I'll be just fighting,
fighting, fighting. I'm like, no,

693
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.420
no, no. It's 1%. It's
1%. You're wrong. You're, you're

694
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.370
so full of crap. And
I'll just really pump it

695
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.310
up strong opinion. And then
you'll bring out the piece

696
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.500
of paper and you'll prove
that I was wrong. And

697
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.350
then I'll go, Oh yeah,
I guess you were right.

698
00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.020
And you move on casually,
walk away. Meanwhile, I'm thinking,

699
00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:16.780
wait a minute, complete arguing
for four hours. It was

700
00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.030
a strong opinion, but it
was weakly held. I mean,

701
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:22.700
so I will fight right
up into the point where

702
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.680
it's obvious that I'm wrong
and I'll be like, Oh

703
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.720
wow. Okay. And I am
totally cool for that person

704
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.500
to have the, the win
for the win. Good job.

705
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:33.200
More power to you. It
was a reason to fight

706
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.990
and be mean about it.
And there's no ego involved.

707
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.780
You know, that is the
stupidest idea I've ever, Oh,

708
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.230
I guess you are. Right.
Okay. Let me, but then

709
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.850
we're back to ego. I
mean, I don't know if

710
00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:46.460
I'd agree that there's no
ego involved. I mean, everyone

711
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.040
has it. At some point
I have an ego is

712
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.650
to be able to take
criticism and be okay with

713
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.840
it. But more importantly to
have an ego is to

714
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.850
be able to be a
healthy ego, as opposed to

715
00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.100
just an ego. There's a
difference between having any go

716
00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.810
in having a healthy one,
just to be able to

717
00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:03.800
say, Oh, I am wrong.
I have to down the

718
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.340
first guy to say, I'm
wrong. It's just, it's so

719
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.980
much easier to fall on
your sword than to try

720
00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.780
to lift up the sword
and carry a heavy sword

721
00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.430
all the time. It It's
fall right on top of

722
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:21.080
it. The Japanese model is
served as well in the

723
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.220
past as well. That is
the, my bad kind of

724
00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.000
a philosophy of life. You
know what I mean? There's

725
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.430
nothing wrong with being, you
know, with my bed, having

726
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.440
an opinion and then get
over it, get over yourself.

727
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.990
Very cool. I know you
don't like that. It kind

728
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.880
of takes the heat out
of the argument at that

729
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.730
point. But, Well, the only
thing that I'm looking for

730
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.980
at that point is you
argued for so long, you

731
00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.230
know? And, and, and I
want that I was wrong

732
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.920
to take equally long. You
argued for four hours on

733
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.750
a point, and then you
give me 30 seconds off.

734
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.730
Oops, my bad. And you
walk away and it's like,

735
00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.950
wait a minute. You know,
for every four hours, you're

736
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.350
arguing, there should be six
hours. If I'm sorry, Mira

737
00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.650
Copa Was just like, okay.
My bed is for lunch

738
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:08.390
time. So anyway, speaking of
moving on, just all I

739
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:10.790
do, that's the same way
I went my blog, you

740
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.200
know, I can't with this
kind of piece of code

741
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.310
a couple of weeks ago,
I thought it was really

742
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.880
awesome. I was just, you
know, it's just this thing.

743
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.040
It doesn't matter what it
was, but, and everyone thought

744
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.500
it sucked. And I was
like, Oh, well I guess

745
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.290
that was soundly trounced. You
know? No one thought that

746
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:31.220
was a good idea. You
don't worry about 'em being

747
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.490
maybe not necessarily perceived as
sort of weak and not

748
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.520
sticking to your guns because
there's something to be said.

749
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.010
There's something admirable about a
person who is of strong

750
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.180
conviction who really believes and
gets behind something. I mean,

751
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.920
if, if you believe in
the moment and then you

752
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.060
let it go, the second
is a disagreeing opinion. Some

753
00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.820
stuff that you don't like,
there's some opinions that you

754
00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.690
don't, you don't, what's the
word, not capitulate, but you

755
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:59.820
know, you don't back off
on like, you know, being

756
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.460
nice, opening the door for
people, you know, this is

757
00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.800
the stuff that you teach
three year olds. You know

758
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.150
what I mean? It's not
like you tell the kid.

759
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.270
Yeah. Believe this. And then,
well, you know, if it

760
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:11.610
doesn't work out, you can
pick another thing. There's certain

761
00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.850
basic is a different change,
value and opinions. So yeah,

762
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:19.320
I have values. I won't,
but like whether or not

763
00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.210
a piece of software is
good or not, you know,

764
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:22.770
it may, it may be
good today and it may

765
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:25.620
be looked poorly upon in
10 years. Right. History will

766
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.360
decide if the pattern held
In the history will decide.

767
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:34.620
Very, very true. Okay. Just
one last quick question. Tell

768
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.110
me a little bit about
the book and your excitement

769
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:43.170
about it. Yeah. The book
ESPN, NBC. Weren't you excited

770
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:47.970
when I told you we
were writing another book, I

771
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:53.160
was like, yes, this is
Awesome. Right. And translation. Oh,

772
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.180
but my dead body, you
write another book. This is

773
00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.250
the address that you can
find it That's right. The

774
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.650
boys and I will be.
And you wrote another book

775
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:06.360
anyway. Yeah. So by the
book it's done, I mean,

776
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.390
we're, we're going through edits
now. We're looking for grammar.

777
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.470
We're looking for spellcheck. We're
fixing a couple of code

778
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.080
bugs and little examples, and
we're making sure that as

779
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.960
many eyeballs see it as
possible. So, but what makes

780
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.700
this book so special? I
mean, you know, there's a

781
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.950
lot of books out My
buddies. I did it with

782
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.040
Phil and with Rob and
Rob was over for dinner

783
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.580
a little while back. And
the goo goo helped with

784
00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.690
the first chapter, which was
pretty awesome. That doesn't really

785
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:35.790
make a compelling. I mean,
it's special though. It's special

786
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.100
to you though, but what
makes it special to others?

787
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.660
Well, it's kind of technical,
but we've got this model

788
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:48.390
view controller framework. That is,
it is fresh, clean, supported

789
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.360
by Microsoft. You know, we've
had model view controller frameworks

790
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:56.250
before on the.net framework, but
I don't know, this one

791
00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.800
just is special. It's just,
it's, it's it kind of

792
00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.140
makes programming fun again. I
mean, it's fun to program

793
00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.960
on rails and it's fun
to program in Django, but

794
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.450
I have a kind of
a soft spot for visual

795
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.690
studio and it's fun to
program in visual studio. So

796
00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.170
what have I got here?
100, I got 101 tests.

797
00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.210
You know what I mean?
And I'm like, all right,

798
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.940
I want to write more
tests. You know, when you

799
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.890
really can get off on
writing a crap load of

800
00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:24.990
tests and I'll go, okay,
can I hit 500 tests?

801
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.150
You know, just, I want
to write test for every

802
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.510
possible piece of functionality. That
is really exciting. And I

803
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:34.910
don't expect you to understand
why, but there's a sense

804
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:36.830
of confidence that you get
when you've got a chunk

805
00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:39.350
of tests and a pretty
well factored piece of code

806
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:44.090
versus an application that you
just know is going to

807
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:48.880
kill you later. It's like,
it's a non tested application.

808
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.750
I kind of a standard
web forms app with no

809
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:54.110
test at all is just
a time bomb. That's going

810
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:57.880
to kill you later. So
because this really is not

811
00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.590
my world at all. I'm
not going to be shy

812
00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.310
about asking my questions. And
for, for your listeners that

813
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:05.380
are savvy, well, they can
sort of tune out for

814
00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.490
the next, you know, seven
minutes or whatever. What, what

815
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.340
is it that these applications
is supposed to be doing?

816
00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.930
I mean, walk me, walk
me through this. And in

817
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.130
layman's terms, you know, I
know that this is a

818
00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:22.870
coil Layman's terms like, like
wifely terms. I mean, Oh,

819
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:27.250
come on, give me more
than that. I'm not, I'm

820
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:31.480
just saying, well, who's your,
who's your audience? Well, not

821
00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.880
accomplished programmers, not you, your,
your, your, your level of

822
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.410
programming goes to Excel world.
No, I mean, this is

823
00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:45.100
not, not a qualitative value
judgment. You can write some

824
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.910
basic Excel macros, right? Can
you get, do four loops

825
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.180
probably right. About the edge
of where you can? No.

826
00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:58.510
I used to be able
to do six. We're going

827
00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.190
to have to edit a
whole bunch here, but can,

828
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.610
That's going to be, that's
going to be tweeted now.

829
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.970
Most Scott's wife can do
not just four loops, but

830
00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:13.870
also six loops. Oh, geez.
I'll never know that the

831
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.810
audience is developers, right? I
mean, visual studio for the

832
00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:20.620
Microsoft person is the Microsoft
word. You know, you live

833
00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.990
in word and Excel. We
live in visual studio and

834
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:24.640
you do your work in
there and you make stuff.

835
00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.860
And we do our work
in video studio. This is

836
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.040
a framework that lets people
write websites faster and cleaner

837
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:36.310
in a different way than
the framework was before. So

838
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.650
I understand that, but that's,
that's one way to put

839
00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.090
it, I mean, necessarily faster.
It's not the right way

840
00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:43.060
to put it, but boy,
now the truth comes out.

841
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.510
It's complicated, right? We always
use the example of car

842
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.720
versus motorcycle. The stuff we
have before was a car.

843
00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.690
And now someone has introduced
this concept of the motorcycle.

844
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.390
So some people might go,
Oh wow, this is way

845
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:59.860
better. It's faster. Okay. Well,
that's a value judgment, but

846
00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.720
someone else might say, well,
it's faster, but it's only

847
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.480
got two wheels. You know,
it's less, it's going to

848
00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.750
kill you on the curves.
It turns, can't put groceries

849
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:10.090
in it. So then you
get into this issue where

850
00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.010
there are choices. When there
weren't choices before and with

851
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.840
a car, you could put
lots of groceries in it

852
00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.160
and you can get where
you want to go, but

853
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.650
you can't go very fast
motorcycle. You could kill yourself,

854
00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:24.280
but neither is better than
the other. They are simply

855
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.190
different for what you wanted
to do that day. So

856
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:30.460
here's an example of a
supported framework. Microsoft that lets

857
00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.810
us do stuff differently than
before. We've just introduced a

858
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.840
new kind of car. So
people have choice. Now it

859
00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.390
doesn't mean that there's only
cars and motorcycles. There's still

860
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.440
minivans and Hummers and unicycles,
but we haven't written those

861
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.830
yet. So it's exciting because
it's a new class of

862
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.880
car, new class of applicants.
Is it innovative? No, it's

863
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.910
not particularly innovative in the,
in that the pattern is

864
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.850
a 30 year old, 33
year old pattern model view

865
00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:01.860
controller patterns in 1970s. Is
it creative? The way that

866
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:07.080
it fits in with.net is,
is cool, is creative, but

867
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.930
it builds on the, the
things that came before it,

868
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:12.870
there are, there's the Ruby
on rails, and I've got

869
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.820
all sorts of Ruby on
rails books behind you there

870
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.690
on the bookshelf is a
framework that that did model

871
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.280
you control her and is
one of the better thought

872
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.590
of ones. But model view,
controller frameworks have been around

873
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:26.850
for forever. There's dozens. If
not more, this is just

874
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:32.070
one that smells like.net and
is supported by Microsoft. And

875
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:35.760
is, Oh, it's the one
where it's excited about right

876
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.200
now. It's the woman wrote
the book on literally the

877
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.110
book. Again, I get back
to authorship. Doesn't equal authority.

878
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.960
We wrote a book on
it. There's at least four

879
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.690
or five good books by
smarter people than I that

880
00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.810
are out at the same
time. But we wrote the

881
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:55.260
book that w we could
make five, even six bucks

882
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.770
an hour with all that.
The time that we put

883
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.780
into this book, I think
Scott is going to make

884
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.700
more money on Amazon than
we going to make on

885
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.610
this book. I'm just excited
to have worked with my

886
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:07.980
buddies on it. And I
think it's a, it's a,

887
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.460
it's a, it's a pretty
good book. I am happy

888
00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.450
for you guys. I am.
I mean, I've seen the

889
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.820
effort too, that went into
it. Tell me, is this,

890
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.800
is this a world that
you would want the boys

891
00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.100
to go into? Oh gosh.
As we wrap it up

892
00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.390
and I've been saying, we're
wrapping it up for the

893
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.460
past 10 minutes, but we're
wrapping it up really? Yeah.

894
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.230
Is this the one I
want the boys to go

895
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.320
into this? This is a
good world, because no matter

896
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.470
what programming language you pick,
really, you can always get

897
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.810
a job and you can
work anywhere you want in

898
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.270
the world. So that's a
good thing about being a

899
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:42.380
programmer. It's a, it's a
hard skill, not hard and

900
00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:47.480
difficult, but hard in a
definable and discrete and complete,

901
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.000
Oh, you're a programmer. I
mean, I could probably put

902
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.610
up that cardboard thing and
go stand on the corner

903
00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.610
with like a will code
for food. And I challenge,

904
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.470
I bet you I'd get
some kind of a job

905
00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.040
some day work within a
day. I would say with,

906
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.130
you know, we'll code for
food, it would happen. That

907
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.230
is powerful. Don't test me
now. We're going to have

908
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:10.100
to do this. We should
try it. But the part's

909
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.480
probably been done. So this
is the other thing that's

910
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.190
great about the internet. Anytime
you have an idea, like

911
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.830
we just did, it's on
YouTube. Someone already do it.

912
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:21.500
So that's a good aspect
of things, but you know,

913
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.000
you can still get laid
off, like in any job,

914
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.870
I picked it because I
never understood the soft skills

915
00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.430
and by the soft skills,
I mean, marketing and sales

916
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.360
And that kind of stuff.
Basic people, skills, people, skills,

917
00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:38.000
DQ. Is it emotional quotient?
Yeah. Yeah. That's the thing

918
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:41.730
you have in the thing.
I don't what I want

919
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.090
them to do this only
if they want to do

920
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:47.430
this, you know, I see
our kids, you know, running

921
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.550
the United nations within something
much more important than making

922
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:54.780
the software that will be
replaced in three years. And

923
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.990
on that hopeful, positive note,
I'm going to sign up

924
00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:00.990
folks. This has been Mo
interviewing Scott Hanselman for yet

925
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:04.500
another exciting episode of Hansel
minutes. Take care. Everybody catch

926
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.670
you later, John.
