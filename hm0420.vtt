Oh, weekly discussion with web

9
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.900
number four 23. In this
episode, Scott talks with students

11
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.740
and video game designer, Lauren Scott.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

12
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.870
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes, and I'm talking

13
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.780
with Lauren Scott. She's a game
designer and a student at

14
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.560
the university of California, Santa
Cruz, and also has spoken

15
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.880
at the game developers conference
recently here in San Francisco.

16
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.710
Thanks for chatting with me.
Thanks. Thanks for inviting me.

17
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.950
So you are you're you're
your major is in computer

18
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.550
science, or can you major
in game design? Well, at

19
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.150
UC Santa Cruz, there is
a computer science game design

20
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.200
major, and it focuses a
lot on coding with a

21
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.420
lot of other classes geared
toward giving you that kind

22
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.180
of holistic design education, be
it in ethics or art,

23
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.740
or just general design classes.
But I opted for the

24
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.700
computer science degree because I
also wanted to study economics,

25
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.450
which is actually what my
second major is in. And

26
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.220
so I wanted to kind
of put those two together,

27
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.250
but I've been doing a
lot of game design research.

28
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.340
So that's kind of where
I get my design fix

29
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.450
in at the school. And
when you are in school

30
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.580
and combining two things like
that at the same time,

31
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.820
are you planning to do
like a SIM city type

32
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.610
things and economics games or
is it just literally you're

33
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.960
interested in two things at
the same time? My view

34
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.050
going in was that I
wanted to make sure I

35
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.490
was really, really interested in
coding and computer science, but

36
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.620
I felt like if I
only majored in one thing,

37
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.050
it might be too limiting
for me. I wanted to

38
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.470
have another major to round
out my education to give

39
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.720
me kind of, I felt
like coding was kind of

40
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.120
like a very specialized thing,
but economics can apply to

41
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.450
a broad, broad set of
things. I guess you can

42
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.900
say the same for coding
there. My philosophy is if

43
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.760
there are two things that
are going to stay constant

44
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.780
in our it's technology and
business. So I wanted to

45
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.640
cover both bases and I
figure they're that two, they

46
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.050
were the two most useful
things that would help my,

47
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.310
my career and my goals
helped me do what I

48
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.190
wanted to do. Yeah, it
does seem to be a

49
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.720
challenge. You want to pick
something that's going to be

50
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.390
utilitarian and useful, but at
the same time you have

51
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.220
a dream and a plan
and you want to make

52
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.010
sure that your skills and
your degrees back that up

53
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.890
at the same time. Yeah.
And I definitely feel like

54
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.560
both do. I'm very, very
interested in both. And I

55
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.520
feel like both will aid
me greatly in achieving my

56
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.900
goals. Do you think that
modern game design is, is

57
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.600
very multifaceted? I mean, something
like Mario seems on its

58
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.730
on its face to be
fairly simplistic, but you know,

59
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.610
modern games, I think of
things like mass effect or

60
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.650
modern civilization and age of
empires are really, really deep

61
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.650
and complicated. Yeah. Actually, during
my talk at the game

62
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.890
developers conference, I was talking
about how I felt, I

63
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.830
feel like game designers and
developers are the Renaissance people

64
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.340
of today because in the
past Renaissance man Renaissance men

65
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.360
had to take, you know,
the current technology science and

66
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.790
physics and math, but also
all the art philosophy and

67
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.540
literature and blend it all
into one kind of expression

68
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.720
of humanity. And I feel
like that's kind of what,

69
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.410
what game designers do you
can't create a game without

70
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.610
like a really, really polished
high end game without an

71
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.690
advanced physics system and realistic
looking art and an amazing

72
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.140
musical score and, you know,
complex narrative and all these

73
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.030
things like go into games.
So even something as seemingly

74
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.110
simplistic as Mario or, or,
you know, any game that

75
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.800
may seem simple. It actually,
there, there are huge teams

76
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.360
or small teams, but teams
that encompass all those, those

77
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.700
different aspects. Yeah. I think
I probably inadvertently insulted Mario

78
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.230
lovers there. I didn't mean
to imply it, that it

79
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.950
was simplistic, but just kind
of comparatively simplistic over something

80
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.790
like that's so sweeping. Like
if I think of like

81
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.160
an Assassin's creed where you
just look at it and

82
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.170
you think this is so
much more complicated than a

83
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.150
two hour movie. Yeah. Yeah.
And I mean, it's a

84
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.940
pretty good justification for, you
know, paying the 60 bucks

85
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.730
cause you get, you know,
I know someone who got

86
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.490
over a hundred hours of
gameplay out of Assassin's credence

87
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.850
because they pour in all
of those resources and that

88
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.640
knowledge, you know, Assassin's creed
even delves into like the

89
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.170
history and, you know, making
its best effort to be

90
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.680
as accurate as possible and
weaving that narrative and, you

91
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.520
know, just putting all different
types of things into the

92
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.160
game that in the past
weren't even thought about, you

93
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.670
know, to incorporate into a
game. What was that quote

94
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.270
that Roger Ebert said about
how a game video games

95
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.770
would never be art? Yeah.
I don't know the exact

96
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.190
quote, but I've definitely heard
about that. And I definitely

97
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.050
think games have met and
transcended those, the requirements that

98
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.050
he may have had for
that. I mean, just play,

99
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.260
like you said, like an
Assassin's creed or, you know,

100
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.270
even some of the mobile
games that are coming out

101
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.170
right now, like this game
called monument Valley takes Esther's

102
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.330
paintings and turns them on
their heads to make these

103
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.120
really crazy like puzzles. But
the entire thing is just

104
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.070
very performative and very polished
and beautiful. And you know,

105
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.940
it's it's games have definitely
come very, very far. I

106
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.410
would definitely consider them an
art form. You mentioned a

107
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.900
team size kind of indirectly
there as you talked about.

108
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.390
Well, there's small indie games
that are one or two

109
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.610
person teams, and then I've
seen, you know, teams of

110
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.860
60, a hundred or more
the size of a small

111
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.700
movie. What do you think
about does, you know, the

112
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.160
team size as it relates
to what makes a game

113
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.300
an indie game versus a,
you know, some of the

114
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.340
larger productions where you say,
well, you can't make a

115
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:07.510
game without a $2 million or
$5 million, $10 million budget. Well, as

116
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.970
someone who you know is
still in school and it

117
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.300
hasn't done either the big
budget or the Indy yet,

118
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.110
but has kind of, I've
been exposed to both tangentially.

119
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:23.440
I would say that well
for one, I think that

120
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.650
the smaller, the team size,
if a team of very,

121
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.010
very few people can produce
a game that rivals a

122
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.420
team of, of like, you
know, hundreds and like at

123
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.260
the independent or independent indie
games, or know the game

124
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.440
developers choice awards at GDC,
there was a game that

125
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.950
I believe only one person
made and it was up

126
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.950
against like a rock star
game or something like, and

127
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.160
you know, if someone can
create a game of that

128
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.980
caliber with such a small
team, I think that's, you

129
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.250
know, that's very, very impressive.
But because of that, I

130
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.700
think India is a bit
of a buzzword right now.

131
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.600
A lot of people have
this very, very romanticized vision

132
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.930
of what India is and
what an NDA studio does

133
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.300
because we see those very,
very visible and, you know,

134
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.280
very visible India developers like
in the movie, the indie

135
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.540
game movie with those, those
few developers or at the

136
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.150
independent games festival, we see
them up in lights like

137
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.350
that. It's like there are
at least from, you know,

138
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.290
being in a school that
puts game developers out into

139
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:36.700
the world. There are droves
of us that like droves

140
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.780
of like game design students
who have that dream of

141
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:46.780
being in D. But I,
I would guess that just

142
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.880
to qualify as being in
the, I was actually recently

143
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.340
at a conference that one
of the speakers that the

144
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.930
aesthetic of a game can
heavily like contribute to like,

145
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.860
there's like an indie aesthetic,
like an indie style visual

146
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.420
style. And he was saying
something, I think it was

147
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.430
a Yesper Yule. He was
saying that a lot of

148
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.330
indie games, they, the materials
that they make their games

149
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:24.840
look like they're made out
of are like, like paper

150
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.640
or things that you make
like lovingly and maybe it's

151
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.790
slightly cheaper materials so that
it, it kind of conveys

152
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.230
this kind of like craftsmanship
quality almost like I made

153
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.380
this game lovingly for you.
So the art style and

154
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.730
aesthetic definitely contributes to that.
And the smaller team size

155
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.210
and probably a big one
would be not being funded

156
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.640
or supported in any way
by a big developer like

157
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.880
Sony or, you know, a
big publisher. That's probably a

158
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.610
big part, but I think,
and you can see that

159
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.050
I've gone off on a
lot of different, you know,

160
00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.490
points here. But I think
the reason for that is

161
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.030
because the name, the, the
word India's so amorphous right

162
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.670
now, it's so kind of
fluid and a lot of

163
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.690
people adopted and it's kind
of become, it's become something

164
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.630
that the industry is still
like a lot of people

165
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.530
are using it to define
themselves, but the word itself,

166
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.030
maybe isn't completely defined. Yeah.
I mean, I think India

167
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.670
is one of those things
where you, you know, it

168
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.820
when you see it. And,
but I think that you're

169
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.360
right, there's a texture, there's
a texture, both, no pun

170
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.110
intended in the, in the
textures themselves. But also I

171
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.120
think in the, in the
gameplay, it seems to me

172
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.460
like indie is something that's
not afraid to break gameplay

173
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.670
rules. Like when things like
small games like braid came

174
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.000
out that were just too
funky to be mainstream and

175
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.330
to, they didn't fit into
any kind of a box.

176
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.760
So no one would pay,
you know, no one would

177
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.270
no big agency or no
big publisher would put money

178
00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.980
behind something. So, so crazy.
Yeah. And the big reason

179
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.650
for that is because from
what I have gleaned so

180
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:12.290
far, once you have a
proven concept, it's very, I

181
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.660
mean, when you, when you're
putting millions, millions of dollars

182
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.870
into a game pouring like
so much money into game,

183
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.970
it's, it's kind of hard
to strike out on a

184
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.350
new IP or a new
idea, especially if it's a

185
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.090
risk and indie developers or,
you know, smaller teams are

186
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.600
better able to better equipped
to kind of take on

187
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.800
those risks and try for
things that might cause them

188
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.170
to fail because it's, it,
it's not as catastrophic of

189
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.740
a, like, it would be
three people losing a job

190
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.880
versus, you know, hundreds. Yes.
Which is funny though, because

191
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.300
large game publishers are going
out of business right now.

192
00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:03.630
Yeah. I am definitely not
too. Not too sure. Why,

193
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.050
like the reasons for that,
I mean, you know, a

194
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.920
year ago I did a
presentation on the economics of

195
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:18.060
the games industry and I,
I never really uncovered the

196
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.950
reason or the reasons behind
all these huge studios kind

197
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.970
of going under. I mean,
one reason could be because

198
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.580
the game is kind of
interesting in that a lot

199
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.540
of the money comes after
the product is put out.

200
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.460
And I guess that's kind
of the same as with,

201
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:42.570
you know, movies and film,
but I guess I'm not

202
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.420
sure how much films cost
to make, but games definitely.

203
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.030
You're, you're employing a lot
of very, very highly skilled

204
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.470
coders and 3d artists and
everything, and, you know, pouring

205
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.860
so much money into the
labor and into the creation

206
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.250
of, you know, if you're
creating hardware or things like

207
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.670
that. And so it's kind
of, a lot of it

208
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.550
is very heavily based on
the sales of the software

209
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.780
and the money comes after
you make it, unless, you

210
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.630
know, there's a publishing deal
or things like that. But

211
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.440
yeah, And in this last
few years, we've seen not

212
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.500
just interesting gameplay mechanics and
new styles of games, but

213
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.400
also new economics, like the
walking dead series of games,

214
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.050
which have an indie feel.
And certainly their, their publisher

215
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.060
is more than an indie
publisher now. But the idea

216
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.930
of episodic gameplay that, you
know, we don't know if

217
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.930
this is gonna go well,
but we'll do season one.

218
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.220
And if it, if it
turns out to be a

219
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.040
hit, then we can pay
another $5 for season two.

220
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.860
Yeah. There are definitely tons
and tons of new, you

221
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:53.100
know, strategies for monetizing in
games from episodic, like telltale

222
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.480
to the microtransactions, like a
lot of mobile games and

223
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:03.810
even, you know, consoles are
making use of the online

224
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.050
marketplaces for things like that,
like DLC and things like

225
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.290
that. But I think it's
all just a different way

226
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.540
to try to get at
what is the way I

227
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.500
can maximize, you know, the
money I can make by

228
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.560
giving players as much value
as possible. Like, and kind

229
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.010
of how, how do I
get it that sweet spot

230
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.110
with players feeling like they're
getting the absolute highest. I

231
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.010
mean, as far as the
episodic structure goes, I think

232
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.900
it's actually pretty, pretty smart
because you don't know how

233
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.440
many episodes telltale had planned.
You know, they could've easily

234
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.140
just said two or three
planned at first. And then

235
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.110
when they saw how successful
it was, they could make

236
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.620
more and more, but they
didn't have to pour like

237
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.950
instead of making a game
that was three episodes long.

238
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.650
And then if the first
episode didn't do super well,

239
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.110
well they'd still poured all
that money into three, a

240
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.690
three episode long game. They,
they only had to pour

241
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.420
money into one episode first.
And then if that went

242
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.420
well, they could pour more
money in. So that's a

243
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.790
pretty good strategy. And I've
seen, you know, interesting monetization

244
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.850
strategies. And in fact, I'm
playing league of legends right

245
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.780
now and they, they do
it really well. They've already

246
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.440
extracted a good bit of
money for me. I, I

247
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.930
used to have a friend
who played a game, similar

248
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.300
call heroes of newer than
he would buy these skins

249
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.210
for the characters. And I
was like, that just makes

250
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.210
your character look different. Why
is this really helping you

251
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.970
like, have more fun with
this game? And he insisted

252
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.640
that it did. And I
didn't understand until I started

253
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.190
playing league of legends and
really getting attached to these,

254
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.020
you know, champions and you
know, it, there there's some

255
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.160
magic in there that they've
definitely captured because, you know,

256
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.430
you could theoretically play this
game totally for free if

257
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.650
you wanted to. And I
think that's the beauty of

258
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.040
it. I think that's the
value that's presented to the

259
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.180
players is that, you know,
they're giving me the entire

260
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.910
play experience for free and
I can respect them for

261
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.160
that. And my friends can
play without having to pay

262
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.710
for it. But, you know,
if I, if I like

263
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.420
the game enough, which a
lot of people do, then

264
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.120
I will contribute money to
this because I believe in

265
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.910
it and I'm not being
forced to. And so I

266
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.280
definitely think they have a
good system going on there.

267
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.720
Yeah. I think that that
sense of value is different

268
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.280
for everyone. Of course. I
mean, I hear a lot

269
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.340
of people complaining about, Oh,
I played call of duty

270
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.130
ghost and I got eight
hours of value or eight

271
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.710
hours of play time. And
even now I've noticed that

272
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.430
the Xbox magazine, the official
X-Box magazine, the dead tree

273
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.040
version as now added a
box where they tell you

274
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.960
how many hours of gameplay
you'll get out of it.

275
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.730
But I've played games that
were quite short that gave

276
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.290
me, you know, gave me
three or four hours. I

277
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.000
forgot the name of that
game. We are running in

278
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.130
the sand on a PlayStation
that everyone was talking about

279
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.760
Journey, journey. Yeah. It's like,
I dunno, an hour and

280
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.250
a half, two hours, but
it was extremely emotional and

281
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.380
amazing experience. And I'd like
to do it again. And

282
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.110
I felt like I didn't
measure that in terms of

283
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:09.790
hours of value. It was
just, it was moving. Yeah,

284
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.760
you can. I mean, you
can definitely tell kind of

285
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.720
like as players, we can
tell which studios pour money

286
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.080
into the mechanics, the tried
and true, you know, the

287
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.490
proven concepts and then the
ones that go out on

288
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.900
the limb and try to
deliver the best play experience.

289
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.830
And it, it may, the
reason why there may be

290
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.810
fewer of those types of
games than of the tried

291
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.510
and true proven concept games
is, cause it, it may

292
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.620
take more failures to create
a game like journey to

293
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.890
try to get that field
exactly. Right. I mean, I

294
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.190
heard Robin honey key, the,
the, one of the designers

295
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.520
behind that game, talk about
it, how they, they put

296
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.220
the aesthetics for, instead of
starting with, you know, designing

297
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.310
the mechanics and then hoping
that the mechanics lead to

298
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.520
the aesthetics that they wanted.
They started with the aesthetics

299
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.430
in mind as the main
goal and work backwards to

300
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.280
creating the mechanics. And that,
that probably took a lot

301
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.480
of a failure at first
and for big studios, failure,

302
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.130
repeated failure causes the studio
to close and with all

303
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.520
the closures going around, like
right now, like you just

304
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.360
mentioned, you know, risk is
not something that's really tolerated

305
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.670
too much. So, you know,
it's putting those types of

306
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:34.050
games out there that, you
know, that present that kind

307
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.750
of value to players is
very, very important. But unfortunately

308
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.960
it's a bit rare and
I feel like that's where

309
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.210
the Indies are picking up
a lot of the Slack

310
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.000
they're seeing, if anything else
they're seeing, you know, a

311
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.680
niche that's not being filled
and they're filling it. Yeah,

312
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.640
absolutely. Was there a particular
low point in gaming in

313
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.650
your mind recently? Was there
a time when you were

314
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.170
just like, there's just so
many first person shooters that

315
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:03.140
this is just all crap?
Well, I don't know about

316
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.650
first person shooter. Well, I've
never been like a huge

317
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.980
FPS fan, but that's probably
why I couldn't say much

318
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.010
to that because I, Well,
what, was there a kind

319
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.410
of game where you just
found yourself in the, kind

320
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.850
of in the, in your,
in your history, your own

321
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.040
personal history of gaming, where
you're like, we are at

322
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.290
a low point as an
industry. There's too much of

323
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:29.690
game style X Man. I
was thinking about this one

324
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.960
earlier and I, You know,
I found like, I, for

325
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.250
example, I felt that go
ahead. Oh, I was just

326
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.330
going to say one low
point in the industry. I'm

327
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.730
not sure if it was
developers really, that contributed to

328
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.310
it, but it was when
the flappy bird game came

329
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.900
out and the guy basically
had to take the game

330
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.260
off of the store after
a few days, because the,

331
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.110
I'm not sure if it
was the players or developers

332
00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.190
or who, but people were
just, you know, flaming and

333
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.290
on Twitter so much or
something, something was, well, I

334
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.930
think he was saying that
his basic life like was

335
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.210
being disrupted, so he needed
to take it down. But

336
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.190
what ensued after you said
he had to take it

337
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.700
down, which is crazy people,
people, it seemed like people

338
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.970
had this ownership of this
game that he made, you

339
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.270
know, they were, they were,
you know, saying all this

340
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.700
mean stuff to him that
he was gonna about taking

341
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.460
it down. And it's like,
wow. You know, it's crazy

342
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.580
that something that someone made,
you know, even if it's

343
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.840
something that simple that the
internet and, you know, just

344
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.960
people can so quickly appropriated
as their own thing and

345
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.180
feel so very abashed or
fronted when the creator of

346
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.890
the thing wants to take
it down. So, yeah, that

347
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.780
was definitely A low point.
People were losing their damn

348
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.430
minds. I tell ya, I
actually have a funny, a

349
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.930
side comment. I just saw
a flappy 2048. Did you

350
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.900
see that? Oh yeah, I
saw that one too. I

351
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.660
tried playing it and it,
I don't know if it's

352
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.190
harder than flappy bird, but
it's definitely mind bending for

353
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:13.200
sure. And then sometimes I
think that games we'll jump

354
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.340
on a mechanic. Of course,
you know, 2048 is really

355
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.580
just a clone of threes.
You know, it seemed like

356
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.240
a couple of years ago
everyone was doing Bejeweled. There

357
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.770
seems to be this, this
movement on mass as a,

358
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:33.720
as a, as an industry
towards different kind of memes.

359
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.600
I don't know what the
term is. Mechanics maybe recycling

360
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:44.610
of mechanics. Yeah. Mechanics. I
mean, I think that the

361
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.930
friend, well, for one, one
thing, that's probably aiding this

362
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.360
a lot that you're seeing,
you're seeing a lot of

363
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.880
these copies where you didn't
see him before is because

364
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.180
it's become so, so, so
much easier to develop an

365
00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.380
app independently and release it
yourself. You know, as, I

366
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.130
mean, tools for creating games
are becoming, you know, easier

367
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.260
to use. And there are
so many tutorials out on

368
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.070
the internet about how to
make games and deploy them.

369
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.120
So now since we have
this huge app store, the

370
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:19.110
iOS app store and the
Android app store it, what

371
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.980
usually happens is that someone
comes up with a nugget

372
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.330
of brilliance, like Bejeweled or
flappy bird, and then a

373
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.260
ton of people with this
game creation software will, you

374
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.340
know, create the same thing,
trying to piggyback on the

375
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.130
success of it. Cause if
you, if you can make

376
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.570
something funny enough that, you
know, tangentially related to flappy

377
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.290
bird or something like I've
seen, you know, flappy bird

378
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.950
with every kind of skin
imaginable to try to play

379
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.730
at different audiences. But you
know, if you can even

380
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.700
get a hundred downloads, is
that at 99 cents each well,

381
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.220
that's a free a hundred
dollars just from copying someone's

382
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.020
game. So, you know, taking
credit from someone else, it's

383
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:08.190
definitely bad, but that's probably
where it's coming from. And

384
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.740
I think we're seeing it
more now than we have

385
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:16.620
before is because in the
past there were, I mean,

386
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.420
you couldn't copy an intender
cartridge without considerable effort, you

387
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:26.460
know? So When I'm, when
you're studying this stuff, when

388
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.910
you're thinking about art and
business and technology and science

389
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.340
and sociology, and combining them
all together, as well as

390
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.970
things like game theory, brain
science and mechanics, how much

391
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.330
is, is analytics where you're
literally sitting down and you're

392
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.680
saying this algorithm doesn't work
versus, I don't know why

393
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.910
this game isn't fun, but
just know it's not fun.

394
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.170
I need to think of
a new way to make

395
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:55.540
it fun. I think at
the, so at the beginning

396
00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.410
you have the idea and
then you start fleshing it

397
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:03.940
out and creating the bare
bones, you know, prototype that

398
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.900
encompasses that core mechanic that
you're trying to design around

399
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.140
and develop around. And as
soon as possible, that should

400
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.710
be tested. So with, you
know, players. So at the

401
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.590
beginning, you know, a lot
of it is analyzing the,

402
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.170
the core, like construction of
the game and the development

403
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.170
and the code and stuff.
But then once you put

404
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.760
it in the hands of
a player, that's when you

405
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.580
can really, really get to,
is this fun or not,

406
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.200
because you can play it
as much as you want

407
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.300
to as the developer. And
you may think it's the

408
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.120
best thing in the world,
or what often happens is

409
00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.520
that you are, have been
working on this thing for

410
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.430
so long that you're so
close to it, that you

411
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.820
can't see its pitfalls or
it's, you know, the things

412
00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.400
that make it shine. So
what you definitely have to

413
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.190
do is test early and
test often, you know, with

414
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.760
actual players that are within
the audience that you're trying

415
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.170
to reach. It's funny. I
noticed that there are a

416
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.480
couple of games that you
would think would be not

417
00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.090
really fun and not useful,
but then they would change

418
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.520
one small thing. And then
suddenly it blows up. And

419
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.360
the one game I think
of is, is borderlands, which

420
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.590
on its face was a
pretty basic first person shooter.

421
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.140
And then suddenly they decided
to give it a different

422
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.230
tone, a different kind of
narrative tone. And then they

423
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.250
added cell shading and then
borderlands and borderlands two became

424
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.220
these huge hits. And I
just can't seem to get

425
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.320
my head around how and
why they would do something

426
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.500
like that and why it
worked. That means that they're

427
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.010
basically one decision away from
this game being, you know,

428
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:38.290
in the discount bin. Yeah.
It may, to the player,

429
00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.830
it may seem like, you
know, one decision like, Oh,

430
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.960
you know, there could have
been this one guy in

431
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.210
the cubicle and he just
had this one idea that

432
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.300
changed the entire course of
the game, but usually it's

433
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.800
it it's, they have probably
like an entire art team.

434
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.830
That's devoted to figuring out
the artistic vision of this

435
00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.910
game. And as far as
like the mechanics, you know,

436
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.360
whole design teams and stuff,
and then they rigorously test

437
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.630
these, the ideas that they
have, because if they just

438
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.180
went with what they thought
was right, and then put

439
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.360
out the game, they'd be
designing and developing the game

440
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.840
for themselves. So what they
need to do is take

441
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.420
all of these different facets
of the game and give

442
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.200
them to a player and,
or do internal testing to

443
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.350
see, you know, if it's
hitting the right note and

444
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.670
I'm sure as opposed to
one decision that made it

445
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.200
the way it was, it
was probably a lot of

446
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.910
fine tuning that made that
happen. Yeah. I think that

447
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.210
as an, as an armchair
gamer myself and not someone

448
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.460
who has, has built any
games, it's, it is probably

449
00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.140
easy to like that. It
certainly feels like it's sometimes

450
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.480
where, you know, you just
don't know why this game

451
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.500
feels like that. And I
really admire the, the, the

452
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.410
intangibles that they're able to
take and like, you know,

453
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.400
two games, like games of
gears of war versus Halote

454
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.620
that feel, you know, they're
both first person shooters, but

455
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:07.140
they're completely and utterly and
totally different or braid and

456
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.450
Fez, which you might look
at. And some of those

457
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.190
are really similar. And then
once you get into them,

458
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.130
they're a totally different, totally
different kind of game because

459
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.460
of, like you said, hard
decisions by large groups of

460
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:22.190
people. Yeah. And, you know,
on the flip side of

461
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.220
that, I mean, fizz was
created by Phil fish. And

462
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.320
maybe I forget if he
had a small team or

463
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.820
not, and then John Jonathan
blow, you know, those were

464
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.650
kind of the two different
masterminds and even like, so

465
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.150
the reason for, for their
games being so different is

466
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.690
probably, I mean, it, it
was, it was all them,

467
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:50.210
basically their vision, their ideas
led to kind of the

468
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.410
different aesthetics and the diff
you know, decisions that were

469
00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.800
made. So, I mean, whether
it's a huge team or

470
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.860
just one or two people,
definitely that vision is very

471
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.250
important. Do you, do you
spend any time looking at

472
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.950
board games or studying board
games? Cause there's kind of

473
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.170
a board game Renaissance it's
been going on the last

474
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.030
few years. And I wonder
if you look at those

475
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.190
mechanics and think about them
in the context of video

476
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:23.420
games. Yeah. I've definitely since
I've started studying game design,

477
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.990
any chance that I've had
to play a board game,

478
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:32.510
I've definitely looked at the
analyze the mechanics as best

479
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:37.430
as I could. And I
had the, I had the

480
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:43.280
opportunity to go to an
event called board game or,

481
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.880
well, it was an event
at the UC Santa Cruz

482
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.530
extension where a bunch of
game designers that actually work

483
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.490
in the industry now brought
board games that they had

484
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.780
designed and created themselves and
they brought them there actually

485
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.850
to play test them. So
it's definitely, like you said

486
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.780
something that's still very alive
and well and thriving. I

487
00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.900
haven't been able to play
as many as I would

488
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.840
like, but I have one
in my head that I'm

489
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.870
kind of working on right
now. It's kind of just

490
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.590
sitting on the back burner.
It's still kind of developing,

491
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.630
but yeah. I mean, they're
definitely a very, very important

492
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:31.160
part of game design. In
fact, if you're thinking about

493
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.040
getting into video game design,
one of the best ways

494
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.820
to start practicing is to
make board games because that

495
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.100
forces, you really, really forces
you to think about things

496
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.380
like balance, think about things
like, you know, just really

497
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:51.370
solid mechanics. And it also
enables you to, to prototype

498
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:57.010
very, very rapidly and often
because it's not costly time-wise

499
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.970
or materials wise to, to
redo pieces of a board

500
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.880
game. Whereas if you code
something, it could be hard

501
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.900
to undo that Actually that's
a great point. I didn't

502
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.860
even realize that prototyping a
video game mechanic with paper

503
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.680
and pencil and then, and
then coding it up. Yeah.

504
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.930
That's actually something that game
designers and developers do a

505
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:25.350
lot, especially at school, almost
every game design class I've

506
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.800
taken, we've done paper prototyping
first in order to get

507
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.320
a good sense of what
maybe the core mechanic is.

508
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.910
And then we move on
to the coding. Sometimes you

509
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.700
may have an idea that
you feel like it can

510
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:43.680
only lend itself to digital.
Most of the time, that's

511
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.030
not true. And if you're
really, really insistent about, Oh,

512
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:51.390
this can only be made
digitally, you're probably missing something.

513
00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.460
You're probably not thinking your
game in the most holistic

514
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.250
way that you could be
thinking about it. Hmm. That's

515
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.230
a good point. Well, I
hope that you get that

516
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:00.480
game. That's in the, on
the back burner running around

517
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.860
in your head. I hope
you get it out of

518
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.920
there. Thanks. Well, thanks so
much for chatting with me

519
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.010
today. Lauren Scott game designer at
a university of California, Santa

520
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:11.430
Cruz. No problem. Thank you
for having me. This has

521
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.220
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

522
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:14.700
next week.
