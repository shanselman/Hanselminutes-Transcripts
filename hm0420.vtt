8
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
It's Hansel minutes. Oh, weekly
discussion with web developer and

9
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.840
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number four

10
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.700
20. In this episode, Scott
talks with Denise Jacobs about hacking

11
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.400
the creative mind. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

12
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.520
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'm here in Orlando,

13
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.580
Florida at the angle brackets
conference, and I've just come

14
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.600
out of Denise Jacobs creativity presentation.
What was the title of

15
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.010
your presentation? It was called
the art of disciplined creativity.

16
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.700
I like that because for
me, creative means a little

17
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.180
kind of, and with all
due respect, Kind of woo,

18
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.320
you know, like loosey goosey,
just like waiting for inspiration,

19
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.470
But you said disciplined creativity.
And that's why you got

20
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.980
a room of programmers exactly.
To sit and listen to

21
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.250
a creativity talk and people
kept coming up afterwards and

22
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.100
like, this was, it was
eye opening. It was great.

23
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.670
It was great discipline creativity.
What is that? Well, I

24
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.640
like to think of creativity
as this thing that, you

25
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.890
know, a lot of people
have this concept that it

26
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.300
is this Lucy goosey, you
know, wait for inspiration, very

27
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.040
free flowing, nebulous, tenuous kind
of process. And really, when

28
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.760
you think about it, most
people who are creatives, professional

29
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.760
creatives, most of the time,
what comes to mind are

30
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.460
artists and musicians. And even,
I like to think I

31
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.490
liken people who are athletes
and like martial artists and

32
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.210
things like that. All of
these people have to do

33
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.960
their creative discipline or have
to do their discipline regularly.

34
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.080
Like, that's why it's a
discipline, right? It's not like

35
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.100
a painter, like Picasso, for
example, didn't just paint when

36
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.230
he felt like it, he
painted every day, right? Somebody

37
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.170
like a musician goes into
the studio every day. They

38
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.940
don't just like, Oh, I
just got a song. They

39
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.710
go and they practice. And
if they don't have a

40
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.950
song, then they practice on
things that they, that they

41
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.340
do. Right. But from my
perspective, as a reasonably non-creative

42
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.220
person, I just assume that
like, Rihanna just hangs out

43
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.080
and awesome and spends money.
Right. And then has an

44
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.520
idea and then rushes in.
I just assume that that's

45
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.320
how it works. I would
argue that that's probably not

46
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.630
how it works, right? Like,
or the people who are

47
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.240
in her band, or if
she's writing the music herself

48
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.250
or the songs herself or
the people who are writing

49
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.420
the songs for, they're probably
there with a little tiny,

50
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.480
you know, tidbit of an
idea. And then they're working

51
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.780
the idea they're going in
and they're gathering things and

52
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.810
they're playing with it. And
they're really kind of honing

53
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.120
the idea. So similarly for
people who are programmers, people

54
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.360
who are doing things that
most people would consider more

55
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.890
logical or analytical things like
scientists and whatnot, same thing.

56
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.380
You're sitting down at the
computer, you're trying to work

57
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.020
the problem. You're trying to
find a solution. You're trying

58
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.870
to put, you're putting things
together. Then you do that

59
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.410
regularly. And that's how you
become a really good programmer.

60
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.720
That's how you become a
really good developer is that

61
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.160
you are constantly pulling in
different kinds of modalities, different

62
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.890
kinds of no, you really
understand your language. And then

63
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.100
you can really work the
problem and find solutions through

64
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.660
that. So back to your
original question, then the discipline

65
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.990
is that showing up every
day, that kind of commitment

66
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.820
to it. And that kind
of exercising, basically your kind

67
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.740
of creativity, muscles and exercising
those, those skills so that

68
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.660
you get to a place
where you can be like

69
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.670
the Michael Jordan of, Well, like
I always think of Prince,

70
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.370
right? It's like this legend
that Prince has like a

71
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.150
thousand songs that he's written
that he hasn't given anyone

72
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.520
yet. And it just, he's
just sitting on them Chillin.

73
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.820
Right. And he probably has
a thousand more that come

74
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.690
to him, you know, depending
on who inspires him or

75
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.740
what inspires him at the
time. Like I remember there

76
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.510
was the one I don't
remember which song it was,

77
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.510
but there's one song that
has when he had the

78
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.450
baby. And there was like
the baby's heartbeat in the

79
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.350
background. And I mean, it's
inspired, right? It's inspired. Same

80
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.630
thing. Isn't she lovely by
Stevie wonder, totally inspired by

81
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.770
his daughter when his daughter
was born. I know tons

82
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.320
of people when they become
parents, for example, have those,

83
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.000
those kinds of things. But
I'm hearing you say that

84
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.040
when the inspiration comes, if
you haven't got the muscle

85
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.520
ready to answer that inspiration
and make it happen, then

86
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.890
that's going to be a
problem. Well, I think that

87
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.750
it is it's, it's kind
of the same thing. If

88
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.700
you decide all of a
sudden, you want to like,

89
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.360
you know, run a marathon,
but you, but you've been

90
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.830
sitting on the couch, chilling,
watching scandal or something. What?

91
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.960
I just read your blog.
That's a really, that's a

92
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.900
really good analogy though. Right?
Like may very well have

93
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.360
the inspiration to run a
marathon, right. Or walk a

94
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.820
half marathon. But yeah, if
you're right, if I'm not

95
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.550
exercising, it's not going to
happen. But the thing is

96
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.950
is that you can easily
change that, right? Like, you

97
00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:01.160
know, there's, there's the couch
to five K you know,

98
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.450
a website and everything. I
mean, there's different ways. It's,

99
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.360
it's not like you're going
to get up and you're

100
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.910
going to start running, but
you do start instilling the

101
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.830
practice and you make it
regular and you make it

102
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.040
a habit. And then the
next thing you know, you

103
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.980
are running 5k, you're running
10 K, you're running a

104
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.760
half marathon. You're running a
full marathon. So how do

105
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.710
I couch to five K
the creativity. I love that.

106
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.390
I use that. No, I
love that. So that's my

107
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.760
trademark that just, I know.
Right. And you're like, and

108
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.310
I get kickbacks for that.
Thank you. Make that happen

109
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.140
by the time, by the
time we publish that, I

110
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.330
expect a blog post from
you on catch the five

111
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.120
K to creative mind. I
love that though. That's great.

112
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.780
I'm I'm so going to
use that. So couch to

113
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.790
five K for creativity. So
basically one of the things

114
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.810
that I talk about in
my presentations and also in

115
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.480
my workshop, I have two
workshops that I do. One

116
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.420
called get unblocked and another
one called hacking the creative

117
00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:01.360
brain more for people like
programmers and developers. But one

118
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.130
of the things that I
talk about is like, first,

119
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.710
you have to know what
it is. Be aware of

120
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.900
the things you need to
eliminate. So for example, if

121
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.890
you were couch to five
care, right, the couch five

122
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.830
K to creativity is like,
okay, well, you're not going

123
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.300
to want to sit on
the couch and watch TV

124
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.640
all night. If you want
to start running a marathon,

125
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.030
right? Same thing with cure
creativity. There are things that

126
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.350
you're going to have to
give up. You're probably going

127
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.660
to have to give up
the potato chips. You're probably

128
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.960
going to have to give
up the sodas. So similarly,

129
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.520
what I recommend with people
is to start actually having

130
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.760
some awareness about their habits,
how are they managed spending

131
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.470
their time? How are they
managing, or just being wrapped

132
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:47.200
up in distractions, multitasking, communication,
addiction, things like that, being

133
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.120
aware of that so that
you can start changing your

134
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.750
behaviors around those, around those
things and start eliminating them

135
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.590
so that that's not taking
up your time then to

136
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.500
start replacing those habits with
ways of managing time better

137
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.440
so that you can get
things off of your plate,

138
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.420
kind of get the things
done that need to get

139
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.480
done so that you can
start having more free time.

140
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.950
That will be kind of
devoted towards create creative pursuits

141
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.210
or creative thinking. I actually
have a talk that's called

142
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.660
white space creativity. That talks
about a lot of things

143
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.550
of not doing a lot
of what happens with creativity

144
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.610
is, is not when you're
actually sitting down and concentrating.

145
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.330
But it's the times between
when you're doing stuff, right.

146
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.400
It's when you're taking the
walk, when you're taking the

147
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.640
shower, when you're about to
go to sleep. So it's

148
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.670
quieting the mind. So it's
quieting the mind. And so

149
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.310
a lot of the process
is to start creating the

150
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.420
habit of quieting the mind,
right? And that's, and that

151
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.370
again also is discipline, right?
A lot of practices and

152
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.210
whatnot have to do with,
you know, slowing down, slowing

153
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.630
down thoughts, dismissing thoughts so
that your brain just has

154
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.320
that kind of free space.
Is that a known thing

155
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.150
is a, is there a
science behind the idea that

156
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.700
a quiet mind is one
that is open to inspiration?

157
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.790
Cause absolutely. In my industry,
everyone is when you were

158
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.190
in my industry, when you
were CSS and design and

159
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.260
web programmer, until you moved
into the creativity space. So

160
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.250
you know, this as much
as anyone we're habitually busy,

161
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.480
indiscriminately busy, it's hard for
inspiration to find its way

162
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.520
in when you're pulling to
refresh. Always. Yeah. Yeah. And

163
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.060
when you're being inpatient, when
that, when the refresh takes

164
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.120
too long, like what's wrong
with us, you're pressing the

165
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.510
button and then that gets
you tense and everything. But

166
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.120
there's a lot of, a
lot of studies, a lot

167
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:51.110
of support. And Is there
a science behind this? There's

168
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.490
a lot of science. Thank
you. That's the word I

169
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:57.860
was looking for? Like your
brainwaves Brainwaves, the different brainwave

170
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.050
modes, alpha brainwave mode, which
is kind of the, the

171
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.890
mode that your brain goes
into before you're going to

172
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.200
sleep when you're in the
shower, when you're taking a

173
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.860
nice, relaxed walk, sometimes when
you're like playing with a

174
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.120
pet, you know, that sort
of thing that has actually

175
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.760
been proven to be, I
like to call it the

176
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.150
gateway to creativity, but that's
usually what people refer to

177
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.750
as the creative mind. And
that sort of thing is

178
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.930
that. But it's also been
shown that like actually in

179
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.260
terms of on a neurological
level, like your, your, the

180
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.950
electric electric signals that go
on in your brain actually

181
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.610
flow more freely when you're
in, when your brain is

182
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.240
in alpha brainwave mode, When
your brain is relaxed. So

183
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.030
that, that is relaxation. Is
that what the layman's term

184
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.170
of that and your now
I think it's, I think

185
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.710
it's not so much chill.
It's more of being able

186
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.920
to kind of regulate your
brain, right? Like you can

187
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.180
be deeply immersed in something
and you can still have,

188
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.400
your brain can still be
relaxed, right? Like your brain

189
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.730
can be working and be
processing things, but it can

190
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.000
still be relaxed. I'm thinking
of things like woodworking. I

191
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.330
find to be like more
relaxing than programming. Like I

192
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.850
don't think necessarily think of
programming as being a relaxing.

193
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.940
Right. But for some people
I actually know that some

194
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.850
people do program and it's,
it's kind of relaxing for

195
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.310
them. Their brain gets into
a certain, gets into a

196
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.820
flow state, for example. And
then the ideas and everything

197
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.480
are just really coming to
you easily woodworking happens that

198
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.300
way too, but you're still
problem solving during woodworking, right?

199
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.390
Like even though it's not
the same as, you know,

200
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.850
trying to write a program
or trying to write an

201
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.910
application, you are trying to
accomplish something and you do

202
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.040
have a certain set of
tasks and you do need

203
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.820
to know kind of the
limits and the parameters of

204
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.030
what you're doing within that
Task set. Yup. That's true.

205
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.890
And that's true of anything,
right. But that's kind of

206
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.250
mastery is, is kind of
knowing the kind of range

207
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.470
of all the things that
can happen. And then knowing

208
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.520
kind of having the, the,
the trust or the faith

209
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.490
that you know, how to
deal with anything that comes

210
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.830
up. And I think that's
in a lot of ways,

211
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.290
that's creativity, that's actually creative.
Confidence is one of the

212
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.680
things is knowing that if
you get into a situation,

213
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.470
David Kelly wrote a book, David
and his brother, Tom Kelly

214
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:25.060
wrote a book called creative
confidence. And they basically talk

215
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.030
about this whole process. But
that creative confidence is this

216
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.360
capacity that you know, that
if you come up in

217
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.980
a situation where you need
to come up with a

218
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.680
solution, that you have a
methodology and a set of

219
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.650
tools and a practice that
will enable you to come

220
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.630
up with something that, that
you haven't come up with

221
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.360
before and nobody else has
come up with. I see.

222
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.820
So if you're a beginning
violinist, you're going to be

223
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.150
struggling with the actual movement
of your hands and your

224
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.370
brain. Isn't freed up for
creativity. But if you've been

225
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.400
done, you're done your 10,000
hours, right. That part of

226
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.340
your brain is now freed
up. Exactly. And then you

227
00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.490
can start to play with
the limitations. So you can

228
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.760
play at work within the
constraints, right? Like there's, there's

229
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.060
only, there is a limited
number of ways that your,

230
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.050
your fingers can move. But
within that limit of number

231
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.050
of ways, there's kind of
almost like infinite ways that

232
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.840
the notes can combine and
how they can work together.

233
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.050
And that's when people have
the mastery, that's when they

234
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.790
get into flow, that's when
they feel like they've been

235
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.860
taken over. And they're just
kind of a channel a

236
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.650
lot of times for creativity
and creative ideas. That's interesting.

237
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.560
You know, it makes me
think about the, the movement

238
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.560
towards doing polyglot programming. A
lot of people are saying,

239
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.510
you need to learn more
than one language. You got

240
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.090
to exercise that brain. Like
I'm guilty of really focusing

241
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.670
on C sharp is my
favorite language. But other people

242
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.220
are saying, try to learn
a new language every year.

243
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.920
I tried that for awhile.
Shall that workout for you?

244
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.110
It was hard. Really? What
was hard? What was the

245
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.260
hard part? It was like
writing with your nondominant hand.

246
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.930
You know what I mean?
It's like, I can do

247
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.600
it, but it wasn't. And
it wasn't, and it didn't

248
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.760
flow. Well, it's almost like,
you know, like, Hey, you're

249
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.130
going right. <inaudible> on your
keyboard now. It's just like,

250
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.710
everyone's swears you had to
do it for two weeks.

251
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.810
And then you're going to
be a faster typist, but

252
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.330
you gotta make it for
those two weeks. I assume

253
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.880
that getting my brain in
a creative mode is not

254
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.240
going to happen overnight. Doesn't
happen overnight. But here's the

255
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.880
thing that I often like
to kind of, you know,

256
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.630
I like to encourage people
with around creativity. We're all

257
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:26.130
born creative. We come out
of the box creative, right?

258
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.190
Like if any, look at
any child and you will

259
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.450
see any child doing something
completely innovative, creative, making something

260
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.050
out of nothing, imaginary friends,
playing games that never been

261
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.020
played before, you know, being
able to make use of

262
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.050
the things around them to
make something fun and interesting.

263
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.040
Seeing the world through different
eyes and through, you know,

264
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.610
three different in different ways.
We all are born that

265
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.620
way. We get it taught
out of us. We get,

266
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.010
we become like kind of
already intact and we get

267
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.370
broken. Right. So this is
kind of, I always tell

268
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.280
people, you've already got this.
You're just getting back in

269
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.410
touch with it. Right. So
getting kind of into that,

270
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.640
that mode is, first of
all, I think it's easier

271
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.850
when you realize you've already
been there and you're just

272
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.520
getting back to something that
was already there. The number

273
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.160
one, and then number two,
when you realize that it

274
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.340
also has to do with,
it's not pushing for something

275
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.020
or forcing for something, it's
more of getting rid of

276
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.780
things. It's more of getting
things out of the way.

277
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.480
So that, that this natural
flow process can happen. It's,

278
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.140
it's almost as if, you
know, your creativity has been

279
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.130
damned by like beavers, you
know, like there's a Beaver's

280
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.030
dam in the, in the
path of this free-flowing Creek,

281
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.400
right? And if you get
rid of the dam, then

282
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.080
you can start, you can
start, you can get the

283
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.330
dam on blocked basically. Then
you can start to have

284
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.230
creativity flow. It's a really
interesting way to look at

285
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.200
it. And that kind of
throws a wrench in my

286
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:03.970
violinist analogy, because in that
example, you're trying to learn

287
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.370
skills you do not have,
but what you're describing is

288
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.500
you just need to chip
away at these bad habits

289
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.930
that you've learned and get
back to that childlike state.

290
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.010
The thing is, is that
it's within that, right? It's,

291
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.450
it's kind of within building
these skills, it's kind of

292
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.410
a strange kind of a
paradox in a way, right?

293
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.330
Like a violinist is not
going to just pick up

294
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.470
a violin and just know
how to do all of

295
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.620
the movements and know how
to hold the bow and

296
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.050
how to, you know, stroke
the string in a certain

297
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.060
way. Like you have to
learn all of that. Those

298
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.030
are skills too, but it's
kind of a combination of

299
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:42.220
these skills. Plus this kind
of innate creative ability. Once

300
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.190
the skill level gets to
a certain point, then that

301
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.490
innate creativity can start flowing.
Did you do have to

302
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.710
build up the skills? Like
the same thing? I always,

303
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.410
like I was talking about
Michael Jordan or LeBron James, or,

304
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.950
you know, any, you know,
put in any great basketball

305
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:01.630
player, any great athlete, tiger
woods, whatever. Like these people

306
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.020
had to practice over, started
at a very young age,

307
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.960
every day, practicing and practicing.
But then after a certain

308
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:13.090
point, when it stops being
so conscious, such conscious effort,

309
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:18.760
then that kind of, that
kind of, you know, secondary,

310
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:24.610
not actually, it's kind of
like the subconscious like that

311
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.800
can take over and then
the creativity can start flowing,

312
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.100
right? There's this great book
that I've been reading, I've

313
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.140
been recommending it to everybody.
Cause I just love it.

314
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.010
It's called the inner game
of work and it's by

315
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.740
Timothy Galloway. And he talks about
how, what ends up happening.

316
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.340
A lot of times, he
actually originally was a tennis

317
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.080
instructor. And then he started
applying his inner game of

318
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.470
tennis to work and other
things. And one of the

319
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.940
things that he says is
there. So you kind of

320
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.880
have like a self one,
which is like the critical

321
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.400
self and the teaching self
and everything. And then you

322
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.530
have the self too, which
is like the subconscious, which

323
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.550
sees everything, knows everything, gets
everything all the time. What

324
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.470
happens a lot of times
is when you're trying to

325
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.340
do something, the self one
takes over and starts criticizing

326
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.530
and doing this and stuff
and self too knows exactly

327
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.420
what to do. Right. So
if you can get that

328
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.120
self one to kind of
quiet down and shut up

329
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.040
and you can talk, think
that self one is off

330
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.140
your critical mind, whatever. And
then self too, is this

331
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.400
kind of subconscious kind of
creative place. If you can

332
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.530
get cell phone to shut
up and let self to

333
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.080
do its thing, then you
can actually do awesome things.

334
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:39.050
So self number one in
using his terms is the,

335
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.170
is the one that says
you're an imposter. And everyone's

336
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.240
going to figure out that
you don't belong here. Right.

337
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.340
Then you don't know what
you're doing and you're doing

338
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.170
it wrong. And how could
you, and you made a

339
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.470
mistake and Oh my God.
And she says, Oh, you

340
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.900
know, that's self one right
now. Just do it faster,

341
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.650
harder, the higher With the
idea that somehow we can

342
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.780
just muscle our way through
this stuff. You know, I

343
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.940
talk about this in my
productivity. Talk, the idea that

344
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.690
hope is not a strategy.
Hope is not as strategy,

345
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.420
but practice is right. Showing
up is, and even practicing

346
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.730
shutting that self one up,
you know, practicing, shutting up

347
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.340
that critical mind. And that's
actually another thing that I

348
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.140
really put a lot of
focus on. I wrote a,

349
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.730
an article on a list
of part a couple of

350
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.180
years back called banishing your
inner critic. And I talk

351
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.320
about like some, you know,
give some very good, in

352
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.630
my opinion, of course I'm
biased, right? He wrote it.

353
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.120
What can I say? But
I give some, you know,

354
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.070
some really good solid advice
and suggestions on how you

355
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.650
can actually deal with your
inner critic and deal with

356
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:51.560
those inner critical voices to
kind of shut them up

357
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.650
so that you can create
more into them. Yeah. It's

358
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.570
amazing how many people don't
recognize that this is the

359
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.600
case. That, that is that
exists. Like when I talked,

360
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.360
I did a show with
a very famous programmer named

361
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.110
John skeet, who is number
one on stack overflow, nice.

362
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.440
Number one. And we had
an entire show about how

363
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.370
we both feel like phonemes
and everyone's like, that's insane.

364
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.530
And like, everyone feels like
that. You know what I

365
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.320
mean? Like I hope, I
hope that everyone, the president

366
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.750
should feel like that because
it should be a motivating.

367
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.800
It shouldn't be an oppressive
thing. It should be acknowledge

368
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.830
it, recognize it, store it,
and then use it to

369
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.410
push you forward. But I
think what ends up happening

370
00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.470
is that it becomes paralyzing
right? For a lot of

371
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.960
people. I think for most
people, sometimes it becomes a

372
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.800
motivating factor and other times
it becomes an absolute, absolutely

373
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.000
paralyzing factor. And so, and
for me, like, that's what

374
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.580
I'm most concerned with because
that's what I've experienced in

375
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.300
my life. I have those
moments where I'm like, Oh

376
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.430
my God, somebody is going
to figure it out. I

377
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.620
don't know what I'm doing.
I dunno know, I'm trying

378
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.140
to figure this all out.
And that, that means I

379
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.830
should stop instead of meet
somehow, meaning that means I

380
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.350
should push forward. I should
keep going or should learn

381
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.410
more and ask more. I
have a, I'm a, I'm

382
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:10.810
a, I'm a recovering perfectionist.
And, and the recovery process

383
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.620
is, is being as bumpy.
Well, I assume you're always

384
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.600
a perfectionist. You can't stop
that. You just have to.

385
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.580
Well, but I, but I
think some of it is

386
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.710
it's, it's learned habits. Right.
And so I'm trying to

387
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:23.460
unlearn some of those habits
or most of them. And

388
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.670
one of the things about
being a perfectionist is that,

389
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.310
you know, everything has to,
you, you have to do

390
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.830
everything perfectly the first time.
Like there's no room for

391
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.980
mistakes, there's no room for
like, I didn't do it.

392
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.560
Right. And that's okay. It's
like, how could you have

393
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.830
not known that I did
this when I was in

394
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.900
elementary school? Everyone's like, you
know, well you have to

395
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.300
write a draft and then
you revise the traffic. No,

396
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.220
no. You just write it
right the first time. Right?

397
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.320
Like who writes the first
draft? What's that? What's that

398
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.890
I remember the first time
I found a typo in

399
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.250
a book and I was
mortified. I was like, no,

400
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.310
but books are perfect. I
mean, they're printed and, and

401
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:03.060
they're perfect. I, I, I
couldn't believe that there would

402
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.520
be a book that would
have a typographic error in

403
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.280
it. And after that, I
was just like, wow. I

404
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.300
mean, it really changed how
I perceived the world, you

405
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.720
know, but I mean, you
can take that and apply

406
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.940
it to your own life
and think, I just, I

407
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.580
can't make any mistakes. And,
but then, then you can't

408
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.460
move forward. Right. If you
just think that it's always,

409
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.620
somebody's going to find you
out, if you make mistakes

410
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.920
and he's going to find
you out. And so yeah.

411
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.600
All of those problems for
creativity, right? Cause part of

412
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.400
creativity is the process of
discovery is the process of

413
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.400
finding things out. It's the
process of playing with things

414
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.520
and, and curiosity, and seeing
what happens next and how

415
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.040
does this work together? And
these two things have never

416
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.430
been associated before. What happens
when we do this? And

417
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.640
if you're so concerned with
failure or looking bad, or

418
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.160
having somebody call you out
and as an imposter or

419
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.660
something that you're never going
to be able to get

420
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.600
anything done with that stuff,
That idea of looking bad,

421
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.910
that's a really important, I
try to get people involved

422
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.730
in open source and trying
to plug things together, taking

423
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.460
two things and plugging them
together. And it always seems

424
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.450
like we see projects that,
you know, someone took this

425
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.060
and that had an Nintendo
emulator and a Java script.

426
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.190
And then, and it worked.
It's like, that's amazing, but

427
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.100
we didn't see the 20
failures behind that, that, that

428
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.410
person didn't put out into
the world. We just see

429
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.080
the one amazing thing. And
then we feel inadequate. Right?

430
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:29.040
I think that people should
lean into that public failure.

431
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.890
Right. And I agree with
you. And I was going

432
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.650
to say that another part
of the inner critic and

433
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.800
imposter syndrome and all that
stuff is comparing yourself to

434
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.350
other people, comparing your process
to somebody's finished product and

435
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:48.080
somehow finding yourself, you know,
unworthy or fly, falling short

436
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.340
because you're falling. You're, you're
comparing all, you know, all

437
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.470
of the things that you've
gone through and all the

438
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.710
failures and all of the
things that didn't quite work.

439
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.620
And yet you're looking at
this, the other person had

440
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.430
the whole exact same thing.
Right? One of the things

441
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.290
though that you said at
the beginning, and you mentioned

442
00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.320
also about sports is this
idea of showing up and

443
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.200
discipline. And that reminds me
of the things that I

444
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.800
talk about and productivity that
you're, you need to be

445
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.550
productive by getting the aspects
of your life that are,

446
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.450
that making good use of
time in order to free

447
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:27.090
up time to be, be
creative, Right. Or PR be

448
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.090
productive is like your main
focus. Right. And, but I

449
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.850
would say, and I would,
so yes, to be creative,

450
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.350
I feel like productivity and
creativity actually do go hand

451
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.810
in hand, right? They do
have this relationship with each

452
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:45.130
other. And I like you,
I actually promote a lot

453
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.750
of productivity practices in order
to help people get all

454
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.940
of that stuff off of
their plate. That's been taking

455
00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.290
up mental space, right. In
order for them to be

456
00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.470
able to devote that mental
space towards something, that's going

457
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.200
to be much more fulfilling,
like being creative in some

458
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.900
way, shape or form. Right.
And I don't mean when

459
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.550
I say being creative, I
don't mean that all of

460
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.280
a sudden you're going to
paint a Tableau or, you

461
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.650
know, write in an Uber
or, or, you know, right.

462
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.860
The great next great American
novel. I mean, being creative

463
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.150
could be, it could be
developing an app Or solving

464
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.670
a problem at work, Solving
a problem at work. It

465
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:28.660
could be creating a meetup.
It could be creating a

466
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.590
social environment. It could be
making, it's making, it's creating

467
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.100
something that has never, that
doesn't didn't exist before and

468
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.020
bringing it into existence, whatever
that thing is. Right. So,

469
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.140
yeah, I think it is
really important to be able

470
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.170
to get a handle on
time, to be really cognizant

471
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.110
of the places where you're
spending time so that you

472
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.930
can start making choices on.
Do I want to spend

473
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.580
time on this or do
I want to spend time

474
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.420
on that exactly. Right. And
you can start, the more

475
00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.850
aware you are and the
more you're kind of in

476
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:05.290
control of how that's working,
the more than you can

477
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.690
start spending your time on
the things that actually really

478
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.930
feed a nerd. Yeah. Yeah.
I was, I saw, I

479
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.420
think go on around the
internet recently, which was basically

480
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.210
a clock in the shape
of a pie chart and

481
00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.840
it encouraged you to just
shade in, you know, work

482
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.810
time, personal time, family time,
you just get a sense

483
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.100
of what is the pie
chart of your 24 hour

484
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.810
a day look like? And
if there's things you can

485
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.450
do that are, that are
no fun or rote things

486
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.020
or things you combine like
working out, that could be

487
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.240
a thing that you need
to do and TV something

488
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.390
that you enjoy doing. Can
you work out and watch

489
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.220
TV at the same time
and then free up that

490
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:49.020
pie chart, just downtime scheduled,
doing nothing time meditation. I

491
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.840
know you're really big into
meditation and you know, I'm

492
00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.960
really big into meditation, but
the thing that's, I think

493
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.270
that's the, the irony of
it is that I think

494
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.480
in a lot of ways
people keep themselves occupied because

495
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.950
they're frightened of what will
happen if they don't right.

496
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.370
Brain exploded. Right. Absolutely. Yeah.
Right. And it's what I

497
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.000
do with the downtown, The
downtime. And, and I don't

498
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.690
think a lot of people
actually think about what is

499
00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.210
meaningful in their lives and
how they actually want to

500
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.690
contribute to the world. Right.
It's much easier to think.

501
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.600
Gotta make the donuts, got
to just go to work.

502
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.090
Right? Yeah. That's a great
reference. I don't think that

503
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.850
necessarily everyone who's not from
the States will get that,

504
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.190
but there was this man
in the commercials in the

505
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.230
seventies and eighties who would
wake up every morning and

506
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.630
he'd look at his alarm
and he'd go time to

507
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.810
make the donuts. I think
we all feel like that

508
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:42.470
sometimes our jobs sometimes. But
I feel like when you

509
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.560
start doing, when you start
doing things that are more

510
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.110
meaningful than you don't feel
like it's time to make

511
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.510
the donuts, right. You don't
feel like, okay, I just

512
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:54.110
gotta go and put in
my time. And then later

513
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:59.510
on, you know, there's this
little meme that's been going

514
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:04.610
around Facebook and the web
and everything, and it's really

515
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.940
more focused for the United States,
but that it says, you

516
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.020
know, are you getting up
to go to work, to

517
00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.540
work at the job so
that you can pay for

518
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.360
the house and the drive,
the car that you never

519
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.540
drive, that you're never in
because you're at the job,

520
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.200
you know, et cetera, et
cetera. And when you start

521
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.080
doing things that are Laden
with meaning and, and my,

522
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.980
really my, my main thrust
and my main kind of

523
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.670
goal with getting people focused
and in touch with their

524
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:39.200
creativity again, is because when
you do creative pursuits, when

525
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.910
you express your creativity, that
a lot of times is

526
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.370
when you start to get
in touch with meaning. That's

527
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.740
when you start to get
in touch with joy. That's

528
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.780
when you start to get
in touch with your passion

529
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:56.510
and, and feeling actually really
alive. And that's really what

530
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.220
I'm trying to get people
in touch with. And when

531
00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.310
you're feeling alive and you're
feeling a passion, then you

532
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.520
also, a lot of times
want to make something you

533
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.980
want to make a difference,
right? You want to make

534
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:11.300
something that's meaningful, that that
touches other people and stuff.

535
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.510
And that's really what I'm
working to get people to

536
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.400
do and working people to
get in touch with so

537
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.790
that they have more meaningful
kind of fulfill lives for

538
00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.090
themselves. And that they're probably
making a positive difference in

539
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.480
other people's lives as well.
Definitely. And where can people

540
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.600
learn about you and read
about your articles and see

541
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.740
videos of you online? You
can go to Denise jacobs.com.

542
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.090

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.610

things like that, and talk

549
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.160
do talks at your conferences.
You're going to be at

550
00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.550
in Oslo. Are you not?
I'm going to be At

551
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.510

I actually will be doing

552

workshop on June 3rd. I believe

553
00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.010

557
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.950
going to be a nice
busy year. Cool. Congratulations. This

558
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.230

Hansel minutes, and we'll see

559
