Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.440
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking

9
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.980
with Elvis Ciara. He is
an Android engineer at dot

10
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.160
learn. You can learn about
them@dotlearndotiodotlearn.io. He's an Android engineer

11
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.120
there. How are you, sir?
I'm fine. I'm good. Thanks

12
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.170
for chatting with me. Where
are you calling from Legos.

13
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.460
Oh, okay. So you're from
Legos, Nigeria. And I read

14
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.240
about you on a, a
post that you wrote on

15
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.310
free code camp.org that you
started programming how many years

16
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.040
ago? That was about those
about eight years ago. Yeah,

17
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.710
about eight years ago. And
what was interesting about it

18
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.110
was that you wrote your
first app was not written

19
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.230
on a, on a computer?
Yes. It was only a

20
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.190
small Nokia phone, Like a
little, like when I think

21
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.870
of a Nokia phone, I
think of a little black

22
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.450
and white phone that plays
snake. Yeah. It's a bit

23
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.900
more advanced than that, but
just the feature, phone, little

24
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.520
small phone within numeric keypad
and small screen, not as

25
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.960
smart as the smartphone. Okay.
So this is, this is

26
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.040
the Nokia 26 90, that
came out in 2010. It

27
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.590
doesn't, it didn't have a
hidden keyboard or flip, open

28
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.630
to a keyboard. You basically
had to have the letters

29
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.790
and you have to type
a key several times to

30
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.170
get a particular character. Really.
So you're saying you just

31
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.960
go like one, one, one,
one, two, two, two, five,

32
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.920
five, five, Exactly the best
type of some words on

33
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.730
it. It was crazy. It
was difficult for me. Unfortunately,

34
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.270
I couldn't, I couldn't get
anyone to get me a

35
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.350
computer and there was nobody
around there that had a

36
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.070
computer. So I was very,
I really wanted to do

37
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.550
everything I wanted to get
into programming, which was driven

38
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.670
by my curiosity too. I,
I spent a lot of

39
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.350
time downloading games because relative
gifts, I was given that

40
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.650
phone a few months. I
mean, so most of my

41
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.250
time was spent going online,
searching for the latest game

42
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.530
to download and all that.
So that's the point. I

43
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.410
was like, how does all
this stuff work out? Do

44
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.410
I type XYZ? Those go
home. And it opens up

45
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.320
this page. So I just
went to Google and I

46
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.810
searched for how to build
a website. So it led

47
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.430
me to the w three
schools and tutorial on history

48
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.040
and we to CSS. So
I, so I saw this

49
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.690
funny looking thing, which echo
HTML tags. I was like,

50
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.400
why can't they impute websites
in English? So I, I

51
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.660
started, I started landing that.
So I knew from the,

52
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.970
from the tutorial they say,
and prerequisites was, you have

53
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.550
a laptop, you have to
type your code. I know

54
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.790
that, but I tried looking
for a computer. I couldn't

55
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.750
get anyone. So I just
to substitute a laptop for

56
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.450
my phone, I went online
to do for an app

57
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.420
I could easily use to
type in, could not, not

58
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.600
know exactly cool. Just texted
it to us. I was

59
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.360
typing the HTML tags. There
are Bluetooth if we hosting

60
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320
service and then I'll look
at it through my browser.

61
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.900
I'm looking at this phone.
This is one 28 by

62
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.460
one 60. It's a 100
PPI density. It's basically like

63
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.320
a two inch screen, a
couple of centimeters and it's

64
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.350
color though, which is nice,
but that's basically, it, it

65
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.260
was pretty small screen. How
many lines of code could

66
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.550
you see? I think I
could see about six, six

67
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.770
or five. That's when I
go full screen mood. If

68
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.270
I have, Oh, the, if
I have the program to

69
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.400
bow or tied to a
title, but it's like five

70
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.890
or four, depending on the
font size. Hmm. Did you

71
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.590
have to think about storage
space or memory? Did you

72
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.270
run out of space? I
didn't, because I, I was

73
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.460
able to get a memory
card Sonoma Morica at site,

74
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.760
which I put into the
device that was about two

75
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.940
gigabytes of storage and it
was back then, there were

76
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.120
lots of favorite FI's and
since it's a featured for

77
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.930
they'll have what's some of
the apps on the phone,

78
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.990
we are just about 500
kbps 500 kilobytes, 200 kilobytes,

79
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.060
a hundred kilobytes. So space
wasn't really an issue. So

80
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.580
you had large video files
on your phone. Hmm. So

81
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.240
you started doing HTML. You
found a tutorial at w

82
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.780
three schools and you're using
basically notepad and this free

83
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.280
upload, but then you started
doing J to M E

84
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.450
what is J two M
E. So that's Java to

85
00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.550
my creation. So that that's,
you, you, you could be

86
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.390
beat ups for the featured
phone using that variant of

87
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.920
Java. So it's not all
like the standard edition stripped

88
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.360
down since that are not
fillable. They're mostly the GUI

89
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.000
parts of Java, which like
the swing swing. The rest

90
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.850
is totally different at the
end, but so it's was

91
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.140
beautiful. This low end devices,
the featured phones or other

92
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.850
devices use use it, or
that is in the waving

93
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.440
that is still Java, but
just the variant of it.

94
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.870
And I guess it runs
televisions and, you know, printers,

95
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.050
mobile phones, you can do
like sensors. Like it was

96
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.350
basically internet of things before
internet of things. Yes, I

97
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.210
did see on the book
when I was done learning,

98
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.370
it's being used in PDAs
pagers and a few other

99
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.560
stuff, but I didn't get
to use it on any

100
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.460
of those devices. I was
only programming for a featured

101
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.120
phone because that was the
only tonight. So you just

102
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.990
said PDAs portable digital assistance.
That reminds me of when

103
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.930
I was writing my first
apps, I wrote on a

104
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.840
Palm pilot and the Palm
pilot was a black and

105
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.420
white screen. That was about
one 60 by one 60,

106
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.620
a very similar kind of
a device, except it didn't

107
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.520
have any internet connectivity. I
didn't have any, any phone

108
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.220
to attach to it. So
I really couldn't program on

109
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.430
it. And I programmed for
it. It had about four

110
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.580
K of memory, but how
did you program on a

111
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.910
feature phone? I mean, you
couldn't compile the Java on

112
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.650
the phone itself, right? Yes.
I couldn't. Luckily for me,

113
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:53.530
I found it too, which
was, it was also free.

114
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.600
So I can't remember the
program name. So it was

115
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.830
a Russian, the worm was
I, I had to, I

116
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.840
can't remember how I got
to the, but I remember

117
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:10.240
the sites being in the
Russian language and I, most

118
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.830
of the, most of the
app also was in Russia,

119
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.060
Russia. So I got to
this app that allowed Scott

120
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.850
G to me as the
K mobile, it allows me,

121
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.560
it allows you to write,
do tummy codes, run them

122
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.910
and then Butte an APK,
which sorry, it Jaffa, which

123
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.800
you could easily install, download
and install on any feature

124
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.230
phone. So it's, it's basically
an ID sort of, so

125
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:46.870
it had the texts, it's
the, does the compilation and

126
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.870
all that. And it gives
you a Jaffa, which you

127
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.760
could just upload. So anyway,
so I was lucky to

128
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.140
send the up. That was
how I was able to

129
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:04.640
actually come by my fist
up. It seems like this

130
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.120
is 2010, 2011. It seems
like you were compiling in

131
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:16.720
the cloud before the cloud
exists. I think I must've

132
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.660
J to me that was
around the two, 12 to

133
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.550
13. I started with CSA
JavaScript and I spent like

134
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.400
two, two years before I
moved over to J to

135
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.090
me. So I was using
the app was actually it

136
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.540
wasn't on the cloud per
se. It was running on

137
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.840
the feature phones. So, No,
no, I understand that. I'm

138
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.110
saying that the phone did
not compile it. The cloud

139
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.090
did the Russian website compile
the Java, right? No, it

140
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.530
was actually compiling on your
phone. You don't need to

141
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.220
be online to use the
app. Oh, well what is

142
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.000
the Russian site then too?
That was the, I go

143
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.860
to the app. I don't
have that up from there.

144
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.750
Oh, so the app downloads
and then it does some

145
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.970
magic on the phone. How
long it must have taken

146
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:13.430
forever to complete. It depends
on what's on the app.

147
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.320
So I realized the more
complex my app gets, the,

148
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.660
the time also increases and
it got to a point

149
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.480
where he couldn't even come
by the app anymore. So

150
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.580
I had to start over
with certain features in the

151
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.780
app and just for it
to compile, I know I

152
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.850
was thinking of something that
I was thinking of having

153
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.210
too much because I couldn't
get it together in one

154
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.580
Jeff, I to comply. Wow.
And just to be clear,

155
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.180
you were typing, you know,
public class, hello world, going

156
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.040
like two, two, two to
three, three, three. Did it

157
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.830
auto-complete or did it, you
know, could you copy paste

158
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.890
and doing the, this seems
pretty slow. There was no

159
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.420
auto complete. So you had
to type, you have to

160
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.450
type that is in the
keyboard, which just like you

161
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.930
say was to, to, to,
to circuitry. Fortunately, I got

162
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.200
so good at it that
I knew how to, so

163
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.890
it's smart. It's like this,
when you type, you have

164
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.200
to it for a few
seconds for you to type

165
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.020
the next thing. So why
do those outside? I use

166
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.250
the arrow key to make
that delay faster. I'll move

167
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.860
on to the next thing.
So I got so used

168
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.220
to read. I wasn't, I
wasn't, you can get as

169
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.670
fast as using a composer,
but I was, I made

170
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.650
it somehow easier for myself.
That sounds amazing. So how

171
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.660
long did it take to,
and this was for a

172
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.390
social media site. You were
basically trying to compete with

173
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.630
Facebook. You were writing your
own Facebook. Yes. So my

174
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.030
first book killer. And how
did that work? Are you,

175
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.230
are you a Facebook killer
now? Did you win? No,

176
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:57.370
I don't drive cars that
it opened, like, so it

177
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:03.910
says it was a failure
because I, I, I looked

178
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.680
at products or, or I
looked at product differently back

179
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.960
then. So, and I see
Facebook, I just see this

180
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.560
dollar features that if I'm
able to do the same

181
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.670
thing and create more features
and thrillers, it's probably people

182
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.580
would just, Oh, Facebook doesn't,
how's the sound. He doesn't

183
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.850
have that sound coming back
to the platform. So my

184
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.570
deal was simple for the
social media, just to use

185
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.910
some open source projects and
then build on top of

186
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.810
that. There are two core
features there. One back then

187
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.040
Facebook, the show, your friends
that were online. And they

188
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.430
also the issue that it
was beautiful people you already

189
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.360
knew in real life. So
minus four people in real

190
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.300
life, people, you don't let
strangers and everybody just connect.

191
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:59.050
So I launched that. It
wasn't good. I was basically

192
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.360
begging people to stay on
the side, trying to give

193
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.940
free stuff on the side
for them to stay well,

194
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.770
it didn't work out. So,
But there was value though.

195
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.780
Don't you think in doing
the work? Like, do you,

196
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.080
I hope you don't regret
the experiment. No, I D

197
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.220
I didn't eat. That was,
that was what I was

198
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.320
lending one. I was just
building mini projects on a

199
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.910
book. When I decided to
take on that project, I

200
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.480
was able to go deep
into it. I have this

201
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.670
feature I want to implement,
and I have to lend

202
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.060
this particular level to be
able to implement it. So

203
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.860
that was when I immediately,
it made me realize or

204
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.740
look up differently. Now I
don't see it that same

205
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:46.980
way. It's also helped me
in my programming journey, silence

206
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.560
on the field experiment of
field project. So when, how

207
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.360
many different apps did you
write? Cause I know that

208
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.720
you wrote another app that
actually got written up, like

209
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.750
in the newspaper, you had
like thousands of users and

210
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.270
I think you were only
14 at the time. Yes.

211
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.890
I was 14. I, after
my first and field project,

212
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.340
I decided to do something
else. And this time around,

213
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.370
I wanted to, since my
people would be willing to

214
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.840
pay for, so I, I
looked around and I saw

215
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.640
that I could actually make
SMS cheaper for people in

216
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.920
Nigeria. So the idea was
to make, make SMS cheaper

217
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.130
and also make it easy
for you to send messages

218
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.820
to several people back then.
It wasn't, I think most

219
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.860
phones, you couldn't send messages
to multiple people. So let's

220
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:46.320
say you want to send
any style Christmas message to

221
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.100
all your friends and family
after basically sent to on

222
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.760
send to the second sent
to the third person. So

223
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:58.760
those are the two core
functionalities I plan to, I

224
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.910
wanted to add to that.
So that was when I

225
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.590
stopped. I stopped. That was
when I was still any

226
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:08.900
Java. So I had to
build the app. I couldn't,

227
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.170
I couldn't afford anyone to
work on the website or

228
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.960
the backend for me. So
I do the up, built

229
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.880
the backend, which the Apple
stock into. And I also

230
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.390
viewed the landing page rage.
You get to download the

231
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.890
options. Those know there's basically
no official app store for

232
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.540
the feature phone. So you
must let you most likely

233
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.510
be hosting your up on
your website or something like

234
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:40.400
that. So that was my
second big, big project. And

235
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.840
it went well, but I
couldn't, I guess I didn't

236
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.920
handle it properly back then.
And it's, I think it's

237
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.220
just stayed around for about
a year or two before

238
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.900
I shut it down. Hmm.
At this point, had you

239
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.320
moved over to a laptop?
No, I was, I was

240
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.860
still programming with my phone.
How long did you spend

241
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.380
on the phone doing your
programming in a small world?

242
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:12.580
In a small environment? I
spent all holiday like after

243
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:18.640
school every, every day, like
school holidays. So I was

244
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.260
basically on this phone. I
also was able to convince

245
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.680
a bunch of people to
give me phone batteries, to

246
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:32.500
use instead of backup powers.
And you did this for

247
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.100
a couple of years? Yes,
I did that for about,

248
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:42.940
yes. I think once I,
I think about three or

249
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.570
four years or so. And
you went, when did you

250
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.720
go like and get like
upgrade to a laptop and

251
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.740
did you have to go
to internet cafes or did

252
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.510
you, how did you get
your internet when you moved

253
00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:00.100
off the phone? I got,
I got my laptop. Those

254
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.620
two 14. I had to,
I was, I got a

255
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.410
modem for that. So I
was, I just paid for

256
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:13.130
a subscription and was using
that on the laptop. It

257
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.510
was sort of, I still
remember the experience of a

258
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:22.150
very cool, awesome moment for
me. Hmm. Do, do you

259
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.620
still, I'm just curious, but
do you still have the

260
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:30.400
phone, like in a drawer
somewhere Unfortunately died. I used

261
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.740
it too much. I only
just said, okay dude, this

262
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.330
too much, you're killing me.
I was thinking that if

263
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.310
you're, when you get famous,
you're going to have to

264
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.140
go to the museum and
it'll be on the wall.

265
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.630
And it'll say this here's
where Elvis is the Nokia

266
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:50.100
26 90, I guess it
should be. So at I

267
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:57.890
kept it no longer life.
Yeah. Interesting. So do you,

268
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.480
do you know a lot
of people who are writing

269
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.790
apps this way? Cause it
seems very constrained. And I'm

270
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.370
curious, do you think it
makes you a better programmer

271
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.850
now? Like not everyone learned
this way. Right? Some people

272
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.730
they started on a laptop.
Do you think you're more

273
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.830
parent? Like you're more careful
because you started small. Okay.

274
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:21.170
I want, I don't think
much to people that are

275
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:27.530
this way either didn't have
the perseverance to do it

276
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.560
that much until they were
able to get a laptop.

277
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.930
For me, it was I
think, ignorance or something or

278
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.340
love for the arts. I
ended up spending a lot

279
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.150
of time, hoping out just
beauty, big thing. And all

280
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.630
of a sudden I will
be on movies, something like

281
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.530
that. So I had this
determination to keep using the

282
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:58.760
phone, but currently I, well,
it, it made me like,

283
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.200
I, you could wake me
up in the morning and

284
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.180
I like, I remember most
of the jealous syntax. I

285
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:12.260
know that's mostly for white
whiteboard interviews type of questions

286
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.390
that they ask you for
syntax and stuff like that.

287
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.260
Basically I would prefer like
currently I'm trying to help

288
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.980
a few developers that don't
have access to a laptop

289
00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.930
now to get, to get
laptops for them. That's that's

290
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.480
not going to Smith economic,
but cause I don't really

291
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.990
want people to spend time
doing that as you probably

292
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:38.540
spend time trying to solve
a problem, not taking three

293
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.300
months to Butte on up,
that's probably would have taken

294
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.200
them two weeks or one
month to two. If they

295
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.010
had a laptop or a
computer On your, on your

296
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.730
medium post, you said you're
from the village in the,

297
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.160
in the U S here
we have basically cities. And

298
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.310
then we have like small
towns or farming towns. And

299
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.610
the farther away from the
city, you get the worse

300
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.880
the internet is. And the
less access you have, my

301
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.510
brother lives on a farm
and they don't have, like,

302
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.970
they don't have wired internet.
They don't have, they, they

303
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.390
can't buy internet cause they're
too far away. So I

304
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.490
don't know if that's a
village, but it's pretty far

305
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.710
out, you know, there's, he
can't see his neighbors kind

306
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.160
of thing. How far out
is the village in Nigeria?

307
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.230
And what is the difference
between people who live there

308
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.210
versus people who live in
an apartment in the city?

309
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.300
Okay. I think the definition
of village is basically the

310
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.680
same thing like in the
States. So you have this

311
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:45.590
far faraway placed us disconnected
from a few basic. I

312
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.330
think now technically I refer
to where I was from

313
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:55.810
very, very small town. That
was boom. I moved, I

314
00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.970
moved to Legos and that
was last, last two years,

315
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.020
I was two 16. It's
been totally different. The whole

316
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.130
experience Lego's has been to
Taleo. So Legos I'm in

317
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:15.130
Nigeria is the tech ecosystem.
Yeah, it's the Silicon Valley.

318
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.030
If I'm to relate it
to something, that's just going

319
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.740
to be like the Silicon
Valley of the U S.

320
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.490
So we have this tech
ecosystem here. We have several

321
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:29.650
huge companies working on various
and stuff. We have under

322
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:36.160
large training, future badass developers.
We have eCommerce shopping sites,

323
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.590
conga, Jamia, and a couple
of them. So when I'm

324
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.680
moving, moving from the village
to the city, you get

325
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.070
all these opportunities. You must
let know, get in the

326
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:52.540
village. I mean, you get
access to the internet, steady,

327
00:21:52.900 --> 00:22:00.100
steady parts, apply, and lots
of stuff, basically very different

328
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.620
villages. Very similar description that
you gave is exactly the

329
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:10.680
same thing in nature. But
port Harcourt is a, is

330
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.840
still like a couple million
people, I assume you were

331
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.910
outside port Harcourt. Yes. It's
just a very small place

332
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:24.900
in potako. And I will
say it wasn't really, it

333
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.910
doesn't really developed so developed,
but I think just like

334
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.970
I said, I technically refer
to it as a very,

335
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.140
very small town. So not
poor heart, not port Harcourt

336
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.990
yourself, but the count outside
that you'd stayed in, maybe

337
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:45.810
how many people you think
are there. The estimate of,

338
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:52.560
okay, I'll say about, I'm
not sure I can give

339
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:57.690
an estimate. I think I
didn't really go out much.

340
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.500
Well, you're working you're on
your phone, your phone programming.

341
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.260
How was it? Was it
when you moved to Legos?

342
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.750
Was it something where you
needed to get a job

343
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.690
and you used your app
kind of as the interview

344
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.780
and you said, here's this
app I built When I

345
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:17.010
moved to Legos. So I
was freelancing from potako. What

346
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.090
can you explain? So across
Nigeria. So I eventually worked

347
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.590
with this clients that was
very impressed with what I

348
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:29.670
did for him and invited
me to come over. Like

349
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.870
they had this, they have
this opening for more by

350
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.380
developer position and just invited
me to come for, to

351
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.320
work with them. So that
was when I moved to

352
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.070
Legos. I just had this
call on, I think, Saturday.

353
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.440
And I booked my flights
the next Monday. I didn't

354
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.840
really plan much just so
I, I, I moved over

355
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.870
to Legos for food sign
rule, and it goes out

356
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:02.270
to company code and very
cool technologies then to making

357
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.700
apps and content for tutoring.
So what's and I worked

358
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.520
with, I worked with them
for a few months before

359
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:15.490
moving over to Dr. Lane. So
what does that learn do?

360
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:23.350
Okay. Basically it's an ed
tech startup. So we, we

361
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:29.020
created a technology to MIT
is able to compress them

362
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.050
if we're able to reduce
the fat and the file

363
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:38.770
size of videos to about
depending on what the video

364
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:43.240
content is, it can compression
rates of it could get

365
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.750
a video of one minute
for about 200 kilobytes or

366
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.090
a hundred kilobytes, depending on
the context of the video.

367
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.860
So we developed a stick
that represents videos rather than

368
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.670
frame by frame. We have
this big sales. I know

369
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.810
that you have text instructions
that describe what is on

370
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.530
the screen, how this animate
from point a to point

371
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.580
B. I know that. So
by the end that you

372
00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.720
could represent things like videos,
I mean, Khan Academy or

373
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.600
coding screencasts and the very,
very data lights that the

374
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.290
lights fire. Hm. How many,
so are most people on

375
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.860
Android now in 2018 in
Nigeria? Most people have a

376
00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.590
small Android phones or do
you see J two MES

377
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.650
anymore? And do they, how
do people watch their videos?

378
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:42.070
Yes, <inaudible>, that's, it's the
rapid growth of adoption rate

379
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:46.210
of smartphones share. You still
have. I think when I

380
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.840
checked the numbers, if I'm
not mistaken, I think it's

381
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.870
Starbucks is 70 to 30%.
Hmm. So we have 74

382
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.410
GTM phones and you have
data for smartphones that's if

383
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.800
I'm messing up with the
numbers. So it still represents

384
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:07.450
lots of, lots of easy
to buy both over time.

385
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.870
Like I think by two
twins. So have smartphones went

386
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:15.100
in because we have a
bunch of companies bringing in

387
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.850
Android phones, introducing different Android
phones. And most people I

388
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.290
see when I'm in Africa
and mostly I'm in East

389
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.620
Africa and South Africa, but I
see Huawei and Samsung phones.

390
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:37.480
Techno maybe. Yes. There's no,
probably dealer players very popular.

391
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:45.720
So they partner with lots
of local local guys here

392
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.240
and able to show this
phones here. So you most

393
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.960
likely see it techno or
any of this look, other

394
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.950
players compared to Samsung or
an iPhone or something like

395
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.720
that. And do you, do
you still do any J

396
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.390
QME, are you trying to
get dot learn on these

397
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.030
smaller phones or does what's
the minimum phone for, for

398
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:14.270
dollar? So we have, you
could play the videos using

399
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.410
on the web or you
could, we have libraries for

400
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:23.000
Android and iOS and I,
we haven't posted the library

401
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.970
yet for digital me platform.
That's most likely something that

402
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:32.360
we'll do myself. This has
been long. I did anything

403
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.260
with this data, JT, I
mean books. And I understand

404
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.310
that the library of content
that you have is also

405
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.430
Africa focused. You're an education
company, but also focused on

406
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:50.750
education in Africa. Yes. In
Africa. So we noticed the,

407
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.210
we, we, we did, we
did a test that was

408
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:59.750
saying Ghana. We realized that
most students with locally created

409
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.690
content versus we shouldn't look
at the critic, contents and

410
00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:09.140
content from <inaudible> and there
was strong preference for the

411
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:14.060
locally created content. Very cool.
And have you done much

412
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.580
iOS development or do you
see any iOS over there?

413
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.330
I haven't done much iOS
development I as the, or

414
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:31.040
iPhone, not the majority. So
if you're looking at, in,

415
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.360
in general focus thing, you
most likely be looking at

416
00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.540
either Jamie or Android? Well,
I've seen several iOS developers.

417
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:46.010
Okay. And is that your
plan right now is to

418
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.850
focus mostly on, on Android
apps. And by the way,

419
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.550
I never asked you, did
you do any kind of

420
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.740
a formal education or do
you see a lot of

421
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.460
people going to college for,
for mobile development in Nigeria?

422
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:04.340
Yes. So I've seen several
people and go to college

423
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:09.710
study, computer science, not mobile
development. Specifically, you pick that

424
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.970
up from online. Like most
developers are saying, yeah, I

425
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.360
had a self taught or
they went to bootcamp or

426
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.980
coding program that they use
to kick starts their career

427
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.690
in mobile app development. But
now that you are a

428
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.540
working developer, do you feel
any need to go to

429
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.490
school or do you think
that you pretty much are

430
00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:35.840
on your way? Yes. I
feel very strongly to go

431
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.940
to college. I, I believe
I'm very interested in computer

432
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:45.010
and I believe going to
college, we're very long way

433
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.760
in. I'm going to learn
a lot and be exposed

434
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.480
to lots of migraines to
college. And I don't know,

435
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.090
I just feel I should
get this thing and just

436
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.500
get you to vote rather
than just everybody actually in

437
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.190
my mom, my dad had
seen Elvis was up or

438
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:07.950
something like that. So people
can check you out on

439
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:12.300
Twitter, you're at Elvis and
let her N and then

440
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.210
cetara Chi, D E R
a L as in Shira.

441
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.620
I'll put a link to
your Twitter in the, in

442
00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.970
the show notes and also
a link to your article

443
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:24.360
on medium about how you
went from programming, a Nokia

444
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.090
feature phone to working for
a startup. Thanks for chatting

445
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:31.470
with me today. Yeah. Thanks.
This has been another episode

446
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.200
of Hansel minutes and we'll
see you again next week.
