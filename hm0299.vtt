00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:16.370
<inaudible> From Hanselman it's dot
com. It's Hanselman. It's a

2
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.850
weekly discussion with web developer
and technologists and Scott Hanselman.

3
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.070
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number two 99. Recorded live

4
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.130
Wednesday, December 21st, 2011. Support for Hanselman
is provided by Telerik rad

and asp.net web applications online@wwwdottelerik.com.
In this episode of Hansel

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.900
minutiae, Scott talks with Peter Campbell.
So Scott Hanselman, and this

8
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.080
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. This episode, we end

9
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.120
the year with a whimper
or a bang. I'm not

10
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.360
sure which I was going
to be a handsome Anousha,

11
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.640
which is great for the
people who love them, who

12
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.800
say that there's been a
year, that's gone by since

13
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.710
the last Hanselman issue with
Richard Campbell and then for the

14
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.500
people who hate Hansel, Manisha,
what a great way to

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.710
end the year. Nice. How's
it going, Richard? I'm good,

16
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.080
sir. How are you always
a treat and always treat

17
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.710
her well or, well, Christmas
is lovely, lovely, lovely. You're

18
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.470
at the time in your
life with little kids, that

19
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.430
that Christmas is a huge
deal. It's the thing. It

20
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.850
is the biggest thing ever.
There is no larger event

21
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.300
in the world than Christmas.
I have teenage daughters, so

22
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.460
it's a little mellower, although
they make all the cookies

23
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.950
and they do all the
gift wrapping for me. That

24
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.510
was pretty good. I see.
Gift wrapping is the one

25
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.100
thing I enjoy really. It's
a thing, you know, it's

26
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.880
sort of a giant, it's
also happens to be, we're

27
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.260
recording this on the winter
solstice. So happy solstice. Oh,

28
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.720
that's good too. I guess.
Yeah. Longest night of the

29
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.480
year is, you know, for
us optimists, the days only

30
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.290
get longer for here. That's
a good way to look

31
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.250
at it. It's also Saturnalia
don't forget. Saturnalia okay. And

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.020
what is Saturday Saturnalia was
the ancient Roman week of

33
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.750
festivals for the sort of
end of the year, the

34
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.620
solstice factor, very importantly into
it. They also did gift

35
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
giving towards the end of
that week. Everybody got gifts.

36
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.160
They let candles on the
solstice cause it was the

37
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.980
longest night of the year
and they made up these,

38
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.390
everybody got this little clay
disks with faces on them,

39
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.430
a little circle on it
with a, with a sash

40
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.560
tie to it. And after
a certain ritual, they went

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.910
outside and they hung them
on pine trees. I did

42
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.120
not know that she had
all these weird little, you

43
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.790
ever wonder week. The, the
Western version of Christianity has

44
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.930
all of these influences from
all of these other face

45
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.140
and mythologies and, and sort
of ceremonies that we sort

46
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.720
of picked and choose, I
think to assemble our, our

47
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.510
own ritual. Hmm. My ritual
is typically giving the people.

48
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.320
I love tablets for Christmas.
Nice Kindle fires is that

49
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.590
indeed. It was Actually Kindle
fire in fact is what

50
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.970
my mom just got. Oh.
And honestly, I just don't

51
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.880
see it going well. I
just don't see how the

52
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.140
Kindle fire is a good
idea. And I wanted to

53
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.500
know what you thought about
it. Well, we all love

54
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.960
our Kindles, right? Well, I
mean, I have a Kindle

55
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.240
and I think my Kindle's
fantastic. I get absolutely no

56
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.290
complaints. The Kindle is a
brilliant device, right, Right. Size.

57
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.470
I have not read a
paper book. I swear since

58
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.310
pretty much. It's EV I
read constantly I'm 50 to

59
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.010
70 books a year. Everything's
through the Kindle. If I

60
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.280
can't get it on Kindle,
I can't read it. Well,

61
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.540
I've read more since I
got the Kindle than I

62
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.270
think I've ever read. Totally
agree. Yeah. It's huge thing.

63
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.350
But the fire for me
is an interesting device. A

64
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.550
never, ever ignore Amazon. Jeff Bezos
is a genius. He's relentless.

65
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.390
He is consistent. The original
Kindle, if you recall, was,

66
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.550
was under power too. It
wasn't much of a device,

67
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.220
but they'll keep replacing them.
But he, and he said

68
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.610
an interesting price point at
$200, sort of that for

69
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.240
price, this is the cheapest
tablet device you can sort

70
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.540
of make, I think, but
it also is. I've had

71
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.780
a few folks who said,
underpowered, like just not muscular

72
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.430
enough for what people really
want to do. It is

73
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.420
not an iPad. Well, and
that's the thing. People keep

74
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.690
saying that I'm expecting too
much in that I want

75
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.050
109, $9 iPad, right? Because
I mean, say what you

76
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.290
will about the iOS lock-in
and the app store and

77
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.300
you know, Apple in general
and the way they're taking

78
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.200
over the world. But it
is buttery smooth. Like if,

79
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.600
if there's one word you
can use, it is buttery

80
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.790
smooth to describe the weight
work at night, but it

81
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.330
never skips. It never, you
know, nothing, nothing ever goes

82
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.850
wrong from a frame rate
perspective, but when you touch

83
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.630
it, it works. And that's
the difference. The capacitive screen

84
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.600
is just fantastic. Yeah. And
priced accordingly. It costs a

85
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.340
little more to make it
that way. I'd say the

86
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.780
other thing for me, that's
a big deal about the

87
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.560
fire is that it really
speaks to the destruction of

88
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.280
Android in my mind, you
know, Google's making no money

89
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.970
on Android, which really <inaudible>
in that respect. Android is

90
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.330
sort of a spoiler of
markets rather than a competitor

91
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.360
in the markets. They open
source the whole thing. You

92
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.950
know, they play a little
bit of game with their

93
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.930
own device and so forth,
and there's a sort of

94
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.050
certification process. So then it's
just dribs and drabs of

95
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.820
money. I mean, if you
were to talk about the,

96
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.640
you know, things about 2011,
it says, this is sort

97
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.460
of where Google, Pete, and
now they're clearly aren't able

98
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.980
to make money in other
places and it's getting serious

99
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.370
now, but we're a big
thing with the Kindle fire

100
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.860
is that, you know, Bezos
has made no bones about,

101
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.220
we took Android. We've customized.
It, it's a fork in

102
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.270
the code. We're never coming
back. See ya. And that

103
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.030
I'm now thinking the carriers
have got to look at

104
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.940
that and look at what
I do expect fire to

105
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.300
be successful. Eventually, you know,
Moore's law will fix the

106
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.110
fire, right? Give it another
cycle of hardware and it'll,

107
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.450
you know, things will be
better. But I think that

108
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.100
we're going to start seeing,
I mean, Andrew has already

109
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.040
got problems with fracturing, but
you ain't see nothing yet

110
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.340
because you know, Microsoft had
problems with fracturing with wind

111
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.900
CE just cause they allowed
it to run on all

112
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.230
kinds of devices. Did it
this crazy technique for manufacturing,

113
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.270
a version of the iOS
based on the specs of

114
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.820
a given device. Right? And
it just meant that it

115
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.020
was impossible to program for
and Androids guardian further. They're

116
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.700
just handed out the source
code and said, Hey, go

117
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.430
nuts, go crazy, have a
good time. We'll, we'll keep

118
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.590
updating it. And, and then
they found out nobody will

119
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.860
update and carriers will not
update devices. It's ignored in

120
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.960
their genes. And it's actually
against their business model. They'd

121
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.060
much rather sell you a
new device. Their whole business

122
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.490
is built on giving you
a new device every, every

123
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.260
year ever or every other
year, depending on how much

124
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.840
you want to spend. So
they've got no incentive to

125
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.930
ever upgrade anything. And now
we're going to see it

126
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.220
go even further where it's
just like we, in fact,

127
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.340
we're not only not going
to upgrade. We're not, we're

128
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.020
just going to go our
own path down this OSTP

129
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.750
and do what we want
with it. But does that

130
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.180
leave an opening for someone
to do the opposite? I

131
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.570
mean, sometimes in business when
something sucks and people say

132
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.150
that the business is set
up such that it is

133
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.510
going to suck, like there's
nothing, there's no way other

134
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.210
than sucking that is allowed
within the business model, someone

135
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.540
comes along like jet blue
or someone and says what,

136
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.820
you know, being in an
airplane has to suck a

137
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.950
food has to suck. Let's
turn that on its ear.

138
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.070
Yeah. Let's make manager. And
then Virgin America does kind

139
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.510
of takes that and says,
well, it has to be

140
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.490
cheap and suck, you know?
Well, it can be awesome

141
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.680
and fun and be like
a nightclub in the sky

142
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.410
and then they change it.
So couldn't someone come along

143
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.470
and say, we're going to
take old hardware and give

144
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.380
it new life. And that's
part of our business model.

145
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.270
Well, and you know, the
interesting thing about Android is

146
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.660
you have the cult of
geek that can strip and

147
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.140
route these phones and make
them into quite cool phones

148
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.660
to take those old phones
and sort of recycle them.

149
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.180
So I don't know that
anyone's really latched onto that

150
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.520
yet, but the guys I
know they remind me of

151
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.030
Linux people and people that
were excited to build their

152
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.030
own version of an O
onto their machine. There's a

153
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.100
group of people that are
like that with Android phones,

154
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.680
that they get all the
carrier crap off their phone.

155
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.470
They, they get the latest
build. I, you know, off

156
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.590
of the, the main release
line, they pick and choose

157
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.970
the bits. They want to
put it and they build

158
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.950
out this phone and their
phones come back to life.

159
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.170
You know, like they're, they're
much nicer, so it could

160
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.500
fresh install onto a machine,
same sort of effect. So

161
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.270
there is that element of
it, but that is not

162
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.910
how Android is being sold.
Android is being sold by

163
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.300
the carriers and they want
their devices to be unique.

164
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.910
So every one of them
is customized in some respect

165
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.480
and they are replaced, not
upgraded so that, you know,

166
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.620
I see Android's huge uptake
as the response to the

167
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.020
carriers, to the iPhone eight
T and T deal, where

168
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.140
they needed a smartphone and
they got one they could

169
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.680
control. And then the plethora
of hardware, you know, the

170
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.960
hardware vendors are happy because
they learned how to do

171
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.950
small batch runs that are
profitable. They make 20, 30,

172
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.380
50,000 of a given of
a given phone for a

173
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.820
given carrier, properly logoed. And
then they never make it

174
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.680
again cause they don't need
to they'll now they'll go

175
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.090
to the next ref and
the next draft and the

176
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.870
next draft. So wasteful and
it is, and it's also,

177
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.760
you know, Apple goes the
other way because Apple picks

178
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.580
a particular hardware revenue. They
keep it very tight and

179
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.980
the, in the J changed
a lot slower. So they're

180
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.340
somewhat, they're somewhat behind the
curve, but their manufacturing processes

181
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.520
are different because they're not
designed to change quickly. You

182
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.860
know, the side effect of
when you're constantly making a

183
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.310
new phone every quarter is
that you don't densify too

184
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.280
much because you don't have
time and it's not going

185
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.250
to stay. And you keep
things modular. Your chip sets

186
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.640
stay with little connector plugs
and your antennas are modular.

187
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.650
Like all of those things
stay modular cause they need

188
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.350
to be, cause you, you
end up buying a year

189
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.050
supply worth of antennas. They
need to fit in several

190
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.100
different cases. So they're not
perfectly fitted to the case.

191
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.950
So, you know, generally speaking
Android devices, the way they're

192
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.980
made is designed to be
replaced, you know, frequently and

193
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.620
often where the Apple devices
are designed to be held

194
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.800
onto. And again, never upgraded.
It never replay, you know,

195
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.410
modified any way, just replaced
with new ones, just at

196
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.030
a lower cadence. Yeah, definitely.
And, and I I've been

197
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.240
impressed actually, how Apple has
allowed people to upgrade to

198
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.120
the latest version of the
OS for even at this

199
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.400
point, I think even the
3g can have iOS five.

200
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.790
It doesn't, they just basically
turn off different feeds. Right.

201
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.950
And the reality of course,
is that actually helps sell

202
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.130
newer phones. Speaking. You know,
my girls love their 3g

203
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.640
asses with iOS three on
it, but once I was

204
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.030
forward on it, everything went
slower. The pressure went up

205
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:34.760
on me to replace their
phones. What happens when everyone

206
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.550
has a phone, we just
start piling them and then

207
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.550
building houses on top of
foundations that are based on

208
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.210
trashed phones. Well, yeah, yeah.
You know, the other side

209
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.210
of that is the chemistry
rec recycling phones is incredibly

210
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.840
hard, especially these, these custom
manufactured ones I iPhones, but

211
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.620
they don't disassemble particularly well.
And there really hasn't been

212
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.130
a lot of discussion about
things like the rare earth

213
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.320
minerals that are involved in
building electronics that are getting

214
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.930
harder and harder to get
ahold of. And we're going

215
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.450
to, we're going to hit
a point where, you know,

216
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.070
the value in beryllium is
so high that it's worth

217
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.980
recycling phones just to get
those rare minerals out of

218
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.160
it. Because those right now,
you know, the joke about

219
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.250
rare earth minerals. Yeah. They're
cheap. And then they're really

220
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.910
not all that rare, but
they they're expensive to refine.

221
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.270
And so it's actually a
challenge to keep the flow

222
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.480
off them. We consume all
of these very quick. You

223
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.460
have no idea that nutty
elements that are in these,

224
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.610
these phones and we've got
to deal with them all.

225
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.540
So yeah. As the, as
the phone smartphones start to

226
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.240
push out to the massive
billions, cause they're not there

227
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.210
yet. We're going to have
an interesting problem in dealing

228
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.730
with them, but they do,
they can be recycled downward.

229
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.860
Honestly. I think Android's in
a better position to recycle

230
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.040
down with anybody else's cause
their ability to be modular

231
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.290
and declare off the software
to rebuild. It's a shame

232
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.980
that they don't embrace that.
Cause there's such potential. It's

233
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.010
not Google's focus at all.
Right. I'm not sure. I'm

234
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.490
not sure that Google knows
what Google's focuses. That's right.

235
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.000
It's true. I mean, honestly
I think one could pick

236
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.880
any of the various focuses
that a company could have

237
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.500
and argue that that is
Google's focus. Like I would

238
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.800
have said advertising. Yeah, well
that's their advertising is their

239
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.320
cash cow, right. Which is
really, you know, oriented on

240
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.120
search. And it's the only
thing that's ever made them

241
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.290
any real money. And, and
they've been trying very hard

242
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.660
to start generating revenue and
other places and really not

243
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.820
doing all that well at
it. Like it's, it's, it's

244
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.610
becoming very serious from a,
from a business perspective. It's

245
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.250
like, if you can't diversify
your income, you know, I

246
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.190
noticed the other thing that's
happened is Microsoft after years

247
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.250
of being very worried about
search, you know, set, set

248
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.100
a goal of, we want
to have 30% of the

249
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.160
search market, they made it
this year with the Yahoo

250
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.410
Bing deal is now 30%
of the search market. And

251
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.620
they've started cutting back on
their spending on search. They're

252
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.750
lost. They've never made money
on search with their losses

253
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.350
have gone down and also
notice that, you know, the

254
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.860
senior important people that were
totally focused on being how

255
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.550
now moving into other teams.
So it's like, it almost

256
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.610
seems like Microsoft has achieved
the goal. They set out

257
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.430
to achieve that, that sort
of 30% market penetration, but

258
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.030
we've all I'm used to
Microsoft. You remember Brian, Valentine's

259
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.510
quote about office. We feel
that office should have its

260
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.330
fair share of the marketplace
and its fair shares 100%.

261
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.160
Well. And you know, that,
that I think is the,

262
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.580
the insider's view of Microsoft.
They're a relentless beast that

263
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.460
wants to completely dominate things,
but it doesn't seem that

264
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.250
way in search. It doesn't
mean that they're just failing.

265
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.780
Cause they, you know, they
struggled for a long time,

266
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.300
but they've genuinely gained market
share, but you seeing them

267
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.330
start to cut back on
their search bending, you know,

268
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.280
that, that, you know, near
billion dollar losses at a

269
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.100
30% market place, are they
happy there that's good enough

270
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.770
that makes the difference or
are they also perceiving that

271
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.210
search is becoming less relevant?
Don't spend billions trying to

272
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.940
win a market that ultimately
doesn't matter. That's interesting. You

273
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.550
know, and I also wonder
how they will continue how

274
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.720
companies in general, but Google
specifically will continue to send

275
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.960
free stuff out there into
the world. And we all

276
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.880
count on it. And the
longer we count on it,

277
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.920
the harder it's going to
be for them to get

278
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.490
rid of it. For example,
there, they're sending Google maps

279
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:32.850
tiles around to everyone For
free. Yup. And we just

280
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.650
continue to suck it up
one day. That's not going

281
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.990
to be free, you know,
and already they're starting to

282
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.110
charge for, for services starting
to shut services down. Yeah.

283
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.320
Well and look at how
much money Google has spent

284
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.200
on, I mean, think about
the Google cars running around

285
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.300
with the cameras on them,
all of that data they've

286
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:54.200
gathered like they spend tremendous
of money on these free

287
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.160
services they have to, and
as this tightening comes in,

288
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.710
you know, the Google gear
is always tight technologies. They're

289
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.590
starting to shut down because
they're just costing money and

290
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.730
not succeeding. They they're going
to start the pressure to

291
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.070
start generating other revenue means
it's going to force them

292
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.220
to take things that are
actually popular and successful and

293
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.700
to make them cost. Well,
definitely if you're going to

294
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.850
build a startup and if,
if you, if someone's investing

295
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.740
in it and they're going
to look at your, your

296
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.310
fundamentals and they realize that
the entire system is based

297
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.060
on you using some free
service from, from anyone, from

298
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.090
Google, from Microsoft, from whoever
that's going to be a

299
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.530
problem. Well, I think there's
a fundamental conflict of interest

300
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.590
at the moment. You're generating
revenue off the back of

301
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.020
somebody else's free service. We
need to have a conversation.

302
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.420
Well, so that is actually
an interesting point. It brings

303
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.230
me to the whole Zegna
thing, the Facebook gaming people,

304
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.540
everyone thought that was going
to be like the amazing

305
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.470
hot IPO of the year.
And then it, you know,

306
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.670
it went up and up
and there's like, wait a

307
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.670
second. Every cent of their
revenue is based entirely on

308
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.570
Facebook. Yep. Which is a
free thing that makes money

309
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.570
off of advertising. Yeah. I
mean, they're literally like a

310
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.580
barnacle on like Facebook's butt
and people thought that that

311
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.810
was a valid business. I
would argue this, you know,

312
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.260
one of the things that
Facebook trades on heavily is

313
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.100
their mind space occupation right
there that it, I just

314
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.580
saw a graph come out
where they showed that, that

315
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.260
when it comes to spending
time on social media, Facebook

316
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.290
is, is 10 times the
size of everybody else combined,

317
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.740
compared to LinkedIn or tumbler.
And these other things it's

318
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.610
all Facebook time. And my
automatic thought was that's game-playing

319
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.770
right. That is not quote
unquote social media. What's the

320
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.970
huge time sink in Facebook
is Zynga are the game

321
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.290
players, but those are not
good advertising candidates. Either people

322
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.040
who are farming stuff in
Farmville, aren't looking at your

323
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.990
ads. They've learned to block
them out. I mean, I

324
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.040
think a general computer advertising
isn't working because people's brains

325
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.670
are programmed to not see
them. Right. And to the

326
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.310
point where if you actually
put something important in a

327
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.490
space that people normally think
is an ad space, they

328
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.630
will never find it From
a UX perspective. You're saying

329
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.670
like you design your system
and you accidentally it's like

330
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:16.510
putting something crucial, like the
speedometer in a car right

331
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.760
in the blind spot. Yeah.
If you put, if you

332
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.970
put an incredibly important button
of any kind down the

333
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.950
right side of your webpage,
nobody will see it because

334
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.350
it's where the ads go.
And people have learned to

335
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.840
simply block that out the
right hand edge of my,

336
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.380
my browser window is full
of crap. It's never important.

337
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.990
And I'm Ken and I've
literally had to, we would

338
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.570
experiment with UX designs for
different things. And we put

339
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.990
something important there said, you
know, go find this, can't

340
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.540
see it. Point to it.
I thought that was an

341
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.980
ad. Yes you did. So
did everybody else? It's invisible.

342
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.560
Well, it's advertisement, but advertising
itself as a, as a

343
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.060
strategy is all about consumption.
And you know, I was

344
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.060
thinking the wife and I
are keeping our Christmas pretty

345
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.180
or giving we've kept our
Christmas very low key. I

346
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.460
mean, I think the boys
are getting like four toys

347
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.970
each and they're like action
figures. You know? I mean,

348
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.270
it's, it's very local. I
think I'm getting two things

349
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.270
and she's got two and
the boys get for each

350
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.640
and it's like, you know,
two transformers and two action

351
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.390
figures. So from a consumption
perspective, I think our total

352
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.810
outlay for Christmas was like
$150 this year. Well, and,

353
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.080
and with young boys sleep,
they still rather play with

354
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.170
the box anyway. Right. Well,
there's that, but they also

355
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.930
are kind of, they're wired
to, we know we go

356
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.130
to Goodwill and we get
toys, toys, or just something

357
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.990
that you don't need to
buy. Right. We'll build stuff

358
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.190
out of wood or plastic
or, And you may even

359
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.190
enjoy that more. Right. That's
the process of creation is

360
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.700
far more engaging than, than
hand being handed something that

361
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.160
has a particular play structure
to it. Right. Right. But

362
00:18:55.160 --> 00:19:00.110
I guess my point is
that consumption. We were sitting

363
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.490
around a couple of days
ago. We're like, you know,

364
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.670
we don't need to go
to the mall and get

365
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.770
anything, you know, we've got
to, we're very lucky. We've

366
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.200
got a computer, we've got
a TV, we've got lots

367
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.590
of books. We've got a
bunch of toys and use

368
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.710
toys and hand me down
toys. And we got wood

369
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.870
that we can build toys
with. Yeah. So we don't

370
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.440
really need anything. So I'm
not a very good consumer,

371
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.250
I guess, is the point
that I'm making. And when

372
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.710
advertising is all based on
getting you to rush out

373
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.730
to buy the new widget,
then it's, it, it makes

374
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.390
me question advertising itself as
a, as a business model.

375
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.750
And I've wondered for years,
how, how much longer before

376
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.810
Google ran through all of
the people that were paying

377
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.050
for ad words and not
getting back the sales that

378
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.170
were necessary. Exactly. I mean,
there's always, there's always the

379
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.690
anecdotal cases, the folks that
are really making it, and

380
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.170
they've done a good job
of basically overwhelming any other

381
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:59.530
way to find sites. But
you know, the, the alternative

382
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.730
that is stuff like Etsy
and eBay, and like, if

383
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.370
you want to sell stuff
online, there are mechanisms and

384
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.650
Google search sometimes works for
that, but it's been games

385
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:14.330
so heavily, that's been exploited
so badly that it's becoming

386
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.600
not the way to look
for stuff. That's not how

387
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.460
you try and find things
anymore. Do what do we

388
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:30.560
sell when there's nothing else
to sell? Yeah. We really

389
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.630
don't need a lot, you
know. Alright. For the first

390
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.470
time I've ever seen you
speechless. Yeah. And think about

391
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:41.330
what we sell that it's
amazing how invaluable valuable attention

392
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.710
actually is. Well, it is,
it is. I realized it's

393
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.130
weird. You know, my, my
girls are literally at the

394
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.220
edge of, of moving on,
right. They're turning 20 and

395
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.620
those sorts of things. And
the thing that was most

396
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.900
important that I was observing
their behavior at Christmas, making

397
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.880
cookies, the ritual of making
these, the simple sugar cookies

398
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.130
that they've made since they
were little girls with their

399
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.130
mom and glazing them and
the sort of crafty art

400
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.130
of making pretty snowflakes. I
think that the hip cookie

401
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.080
for them this year was
they made a whole bunch

402
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.860
of link try force cookies
that they made their own

403
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.920
templates for and the younger
daughters into curling. So she

404
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.610
made a whole bunch of
curling rock cookies to, to

405
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.400
give to her curling friends.
But you know, not the,

406
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.610
the favorite ritual of Christmas
is not an expensive ritual.

407
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.570
Yeah. And, and I think
that that's where my wife

408
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.810
and I take our, our,
our hands is we pay

409
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:42.340
for experiences rather than stuff
like, you know, there's, there's

410
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.110
actually a lot of interesting
blogs online about minimalism that,

411
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.300
that, that are like, they
literally are just blogs that

412
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.680
show you how to live
on as little stuff as

413
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.110
possible. And then there's different
people who have these challenges

414
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:56.010
to like, you know, I
own 100 things like, and

415
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.230
he'll list out the 100
things that he owns, like

416
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.770
total, total in his entire
life. And another guy will

417
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.810
come out, Oh, I've got
75 things and here are

418
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.760
the 75 things. And then
they argue about like, whether

419
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.250
they count underwear as a
collective or whether they actually

420
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.360
count each individual underwear, Is
it a pair of socks,

421
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.170
one item or socks and
item. Exactly. But people go

422
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.300
around and around about all
this stuff that they need.

423
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.980
So like, when I was
watching all the black Friday

424
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.320
sales, it's like, you know,
I like my gadgets. There's

425
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.790
not much as the next
guy, but once you have

426
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.860
the basics, I don't see
how the system's going to

427
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.490
work. So taking this back
up to the internet discussion

428
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.780
when eyeballs and consumption are
the biz on the business

429
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.340
model, does, is that how
sustainable is that? Yeah. And

430
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.380
well, and I think it's
because it speaks to an

431
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.220
unsustainable model in the first
place. And, and ultimately, I

432
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.310
think it's losing traction bit
by bit, you know, one

433
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:54.510
of the interests in pushing
Western culture into other parts

434
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.850
of the world is that
Westerners are getting tired of

435
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.360
Western culture and it's not
actually a good sales vehicle

436
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.150
anymore. So let's go sell
in India. There's lots of

437
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.040
people. And they think Western
culture is kind of cool.

438
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.640
Yeah. Which is interesting. So
what is Western culture look

439
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.030
like when it's, when Westerners
are done with it and

440
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.150
everyone else is adopted it.
And so exactly, and it

441
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.730
all more like that. And
looking again at my girls

442
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.480
and that attitude and sort
of viewpoint of their generation,

443
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.060
this, these 20 somethings, you
know, they could S they

444
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.780
are a lot simpler and
a lot less consumptive all

445
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.710
around. I really enjoyed a
book called the third industrial

446
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:37.380
revolution. Hmm. You spoke to
this idea of more of

447
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.630
a paradigm shift in the
way we do things in

448
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.820
the Bay. One of the
accesses on that was not

449
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.940
only reduced consumption, but also
getting away from the widely

450
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.540
distributed model of power degeneration
or the centralized model of

451
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.380
power generation into local power
generation, which the current grid,

452
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.960
you know, over on dotnet
rocks, we've been doing this

453
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.390
series of shows called geek
out shows. And we're building

454
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.640
up to a set of
conversations around clean energy and,

455
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.110
and smart grids and things
like that. We just did

456
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.870
a show specifically on electricity
where just, I wanted to

457
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.060
set some groundwork around them.
Here's what I understand about

458
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.700
the electrical grid and how
the whole thing works. And,

459
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.480
you know, the industrial revolution
was this idea that we

460
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.700
could start harnessing power sources
for mechanical energy. And that

461
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.460
changed things. It made cities
really useful that you needed

462
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.520
the concentration of people in
order to, to operate these

463
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.620
factories. And you could produce
a lot more stuff. And

464
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.860
we've had a sort of
second revolution in the technology

465
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.290
space where, you know, now
we had machines that were

466
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.900
able to communicate faster and
so on. And this third

467
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:44.810
industrial revolution talks more of
getting away from the centralization

468
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.810
of these resources that, you
know, power generation specifically is

469
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.610
the big one. You go
to where the oil is,

470
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.160
where the coal is, where
the natural gas is, where

471
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.670
the uranium is. And that's
a very valuable resource that

472
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.370
you exploit and then bring
out to power plants to

473
00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.390
generate power in these large
power generation facilities, because they're

474
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.200
expensive and complex and then
distribute power long range. And

475
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.870
we know that when you
distribute power long range is

476
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.210
not a particularly efficient and
you can generate power locally

477
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:15.320
with far less impact because
of the technological evolutions. Now

478
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.010
so much better solar cells,
like they've just now got

479
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:23.030
a lab solar cell that
is exceeding a hundred percent

480
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.870
yield because they're actually able
to take a given photon

481
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.490
and have it trip a
number of other electrons in

482
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.130
the past. So, you know,
instead of just getting a

483
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.200
one photons where the energy
you're getting several out of

484
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.740
the given photons, really interesting
technologies, you know, suddenly solar

485
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.840
cells are not this terribly
inefficient thing. They generate an

486
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.220
awful lot of power and
you can put them on

487
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.530
every roof and you can
start consuming all that power

488
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:48.530
locally. And you get into
this smart grid model where

489
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.010
I share my power with
my neighbor, that, that we

490
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.710
don't need the larger grid
in order to feed power

491
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.870
to everybody. There's a lightweight
grid that covers some of

492
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.420
that. And, you know, bit
by bit, the cost of

493
00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.620
consumption goes down of, I
think the post Western society

494
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.080
starts to look like that
we live in these tighter

495
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.190
collective neighborhoods that we like
that are largely self sustaining.

496
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.810
And we trade amongst each
other in a very peer

497
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.130
to peer mindset. And I
feel like as software people,

498
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.500
we understand this better than
just about anybody. I'm talking

499
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.510
to electrical people who are
trying to get to building

500
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.820
a smart grid, a peer
to peer grid, and they're

501
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.430
baffled by it. Cause they've
just never thought peer to

502
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.900
peer. It's a very weird
way to think, but, But

503
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.000
that's where that's where networks
were supposed to go. There

504
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.640
was the whole personal area
network idea and people were

505
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.850
supposed to, and I don't
think that really ever happened.

506
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.440
I mean, too much concern
about security. And, and so

507
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.800
no one ever figured out
a way to have, you

508
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.530
know, kind of self joining
secure networks where you could

509
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.390
talk to someone's computer just
by the fact that you

510
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.570
were near them. Yeah. But
what's something like power that

511
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.780
it's less, less important do
they, they, they set it

512
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.290
up ahead of time. You
mentioned Bluetooth. Cause I think

513
00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.290
Bluetooth is one of those
technologies. You just never got

514
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.890
over its own complexity. That
if we're, I think with

515
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.080
the personal area network, we'll
have a resurgence, but I

516
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.660
think it'll be more wifi.
Like, because as wifi has

517
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.930
evolved, its power consumption levels
have gone down. It speaks

518
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.510
IP, which we have a
very known set of security

519
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.230
models around and we're maturing.
You know, that I wouldn't

520
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.570
surprise me at all. We
see Bluetooth go away and

521
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:28.760
you see a wireless done
with IPV six IP sec

522
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:33.860
style network negotiation, and much
simpler, cleaner patterns of security

523
00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:39.110
for that. And this idea
of this, this, this direction

524
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.360
that the conversation has gone
in the context of power,

525
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:43.790
back to what I was
saying about how my wife

526
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.000
and I pay for experiences.
I think that the, if

527
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.170
you're trying to sell molecules,
it's gonna cost you because

528
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:55.580
it takes energy to push
molecules around the earth. But

529
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.010
if you sell electrons, you
can make those a lot

530
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.440
easier. It's always cheaper to
sell electrons. And it is

531
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.170
molecules. Well, very, very beginning.
You and I were talking

532
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.240
about how we buy a
lot of books on Kindle

533
00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.070
and we watch a lot
of movies on iPads and

534
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.890
things like that. Yeah. It
seems like those are experiences

535
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.580
powered by electrons that require
minimal amounts of molecules to,

536
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.060
to make that seems like
a reasonable business model. Yeah.

537
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.880
Just see Microsoft just made
the announcement that 2012 will

538
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.370
be their last CES. They're
not coming to CES at

539
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.730
2013 and it's maybe a
bit of an extrapolation for

540
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.820
me, but you would get
back to stop moving molecules,

541
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.350
just move electrons because the
ability to do remote presence

542
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:38.330
is getting so good. You
know, the, the Google plus

543
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.850
now talking about, you can
do the eight way video

544
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:44.360
conference and stream it to
everybody. Right. So now this

545
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.360
idea of w w why
exactly are we having to

546
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.730
gather for these things? I
mean, I think we're getting

547
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.160
back to, I think the
look at the code camp

548
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.640
surge that we only let
us gather for the things

549
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.850
that actually matter to gather
for, right. If we were

550
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.790
just doing information exchange, we
can do that online a

551
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.760
lot more efficiently. And finally,
the technology is getting to

552
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.660
a point where it's close
enough to presence that unless

553
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.050
you specifically want the elements
of presence, you could do

554
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.110
it remotely. Well, I was,
I was on a mailing

555
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.880
list recently. I'm not sure
if you're still on it

556
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.740
as well, where someone said,
I think it was a

557
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.530
guy in New Zealand who said
that his company has gotten

558
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.950
tired of the, something like
80 to $100,000 a month.

559
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.450
They're spending flying people all
over the world from, you

560
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.670
know, kind of, kind of
a far away part of

561
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.040
the world. And he's like,
we're going to go and

562
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.680
spend a 10th of that
on really good cameras and

563
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.280
high bandwidth and work on
presence and trying to make

564
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.410
presence happen. See if we
can cut our, our travel

565
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.830
budget in half or do
nothing even better. I mean,

566
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.810
that's where the interesting, the
idea that someone would change

567
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.880
their consulting business and see
if they could come up

568
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.300
with a way, like, would
a business tolerate a virtual

569
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.260
consultant that they could push
around. Yeah. And I think

570
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.220
generally businesses tolerate that, which
is successful, right? Like if

571
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.870
you can actually get the
problem solved mean my challenge

572
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.820
as a guy who does
an awful lot of consulting

573
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.660
is I've come to recognize.
I spent a day in

574
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.930
an all day board, you
know, executive level meeting where

575
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.960
the actual valuable part of
the meeting where the smoke

576
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.940
breaks, right? Two or three
of the most senior guys

577
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.240
in that room, all smoked.
And every two or three

578
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.760
hours, every couple of hours,
they needed a smoke break

579
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:33.210
and I don't smoke, but
I went down, stood up

580
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:36.180
wind of them and had
the most valuable conversations of

581
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.010
the whole. I realized I
come back and I'm like,

582
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.500
I built a whole day
and I do charge a

583
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.960
ton because I don't really
want to fly to Europe

584
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.310
to do this. And I
realized, you know, my total

585
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.810
primary value con contribution could
be K became five, 10

586
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:56.150
minute conversations. That's where we
actually move that company forward

587
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.640
and making decisions. But then
the question is, can you

588
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.570
virtually go to Europe to
get your five, 10 minute

589
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:07.980
conversation? Right. Well, and the
challenge there is the informal

590
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.730
conversation, the conversation around the
cigarette, when there's less noise,

591
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:17.310
less formality, you know, outside,
that's the part that nothing

592
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.950
is recorded on. That's the
part that, you know, that's

593
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.700
not where the hardware is.
It is completely, you know,

594
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.100
what do I actually sell?
Why did that, why was

595
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.330
that effective? That's those points
of trust. Yeah. This, this

596
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.600
sort of intimate moment of
trust. Like you, you you've

597
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.650
heard me do the formal
presentation. You're, you're impressed. We

598
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.790
swayed some folks there and
so forth, but you know,

599
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.740
these are the things, you
know, that you're starting to

600
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.130
trust me, watch for these
things. Right. I know part

601
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.130
of that whole dynamic was
me predicting the next stage

602
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.470
of the conversation. I suspect
we're going to go here

603
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.290
and next watch for these
things, right. And you start

604
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.320
shape helping shape their viewpoint
and what they can see

605
00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.530
of where we're going in
the debate and they get

606
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.800
more comfortable with, okay. You
know, I understand more, I

607
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.630
can move things forward more
and we actually get some

608
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.090
results. I don't know that
you can capture that remotely.

609
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:10.380
I think I've may know
I've counted on the intimate

610
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.290
moments of meals of sort
of side conversations, those sorts

611
00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.120
of things, to get results
for companies for a long

612
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.680
time. Right. I think though
that I'm assuming this, but

613
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.310
maybe 120 years ago when,
before, you know, during the,

614
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.750
the emergence of the telephone
people probably didn't use the

615
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.570
telephone is a very intimate
discussion place. That wasn't a

616
00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.780
place where you connected, but,
but all of us who

617
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.430
grew up in the seventies
or so remember spending hours

618
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:41.510
and hours and hours, the
phone, and, you know, many

619
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.660
people got, you know, deep,
deep into relationships where if

620
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.510
you counted the number of
hours spent in person versus

621
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.430
the number of hours on
the phone, they might realize

622
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.100
that, wow, our whole base
relationships based on talking on

623
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.090
the phone more than it
is being in person, No,

624
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.190
that's not happening with my
kids. And I sure won't

625
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.530
happen with your kids, But
is it happening on texts

626
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.380
and on Skype, They get,
they found another vehicle. Exactly.

627
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.850
Right. And I, of course,
I also am a big

628
00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.670
believer in the idea that
children rise to your and

629
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.280
competence level as a parent.
Right. I was prepared. I

630
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.280
laid extra phone lines. I
was ready for teenage girls

631
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.070
on the phone all the
time did not happen. Right.

632
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.490
But so then the question
is when you're dead, because

633
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:24.040
you're so, so very old
and, and then the new

634
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:29.440
breed of consultant comes out
and do, you know, 20,

635
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.720
30, 40 years from now,
are they going to be

636
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.020
able to have those kinds
of intimate discussions and, and,

637
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:39.880
and connections that we currently
swear would only be possible

638
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.980
in person in person. And
they're going to do them

639
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.990
on Skype, or they're going
to do them on, you

640
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.260
know, in some other way.
And the thing is that

641
00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.480
we really just don't know
yet. We don't know, but

642
00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.960
it is logical progression. Yeah.
Even though it feels completely

643
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.560
counterintuitive. And I think both
you and I, given our

644
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.830
generations would say, you know,
maybe for the young people,

645
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.180
but I'm still going to
have to fly to Europe

646
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.060
three times a year. Talk
about the, I do this

647
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.770
talk when I'm talking to
parents about their kids on

648
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.460
the internet, it says, we
are immigrants. They are natives,

649
00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.590
right. We remember a time
before and they don't, this

650
00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.690
is their normal form of
communication has always been the

651
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.780
normal form of communication. They
know nothing else. We don't

652
00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.660
remember a time before the
telephone. They don't remember a

653
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:27.460
time before the internet. And
so there as natives, they

654
00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.080
simply treat it differently. And
I, and I bring that

655
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.780
description up for parents just
to say, the reason you

656
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.580
see it differently is that
you will always see it

657
00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.430
differently. You need to come
at this as an immigrant.

658
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:38.350
You cannot come at it
as a, as a native.

659
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.840
And that's fine. As I
think we're hitting our, that

660
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.590
same sort of limitation in
our working style that as,

661
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.800
as technologically advanced, as we
might be, we are still

662
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.760
immigrants. And that later generation
will be the natives and

663
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.280
they will be, you know,
it isn't me. That's the

664
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.040
problem. It's the guy I'm
talking to. That's interesting. That

665
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.320
brings up an interesting question.
I think I might explore

666
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.580
in a future, a future
show. I've talked about the

667
00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.710
idea that, that even though
I'm, you know, I've been

668
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.140
a professional engineer for almost
20 years, I still kind

669
00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.110
of feel like an amateur.
Yeah. And I feel like

670
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.990
I don't really understand it.
And well, I've got that

671
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:18.130
kind of classic get off
my lawn attitude towards some

672
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.620
of these young folks, the
20 year olds and 22

673
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:25.510
year olds that seem just
unspeakably talented. And, and my

674
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.570
get off my lawn, young
punk weight, you know, talk

675
00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.610
to me in 20 years
and you've got experience kind

676
00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:34.420
of a attitude is really
based on not just envy,

677
00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.970
but my re my by
rejection of the fact that

678
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.350
they probably are just simply
that much better, because they

679
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.440
were always here. Right. I
mean, I wasn't programming at

680
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.240
six. How could I possibly
possibly compete with someone who

681
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.940
was, Yeah. They also are
only 20 something. So they

682
00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.820
haven't been programming that long.
You know, I wrote my

683
00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.220
first line of code at
10. And so, you know,

684
00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.710
it's been a long time
too. Yeah. Also, there's an

685
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.660
advantage to that depth of
viewpoint, but there's also a

686
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.420
distraction to it. I am
stuck in some old fashioned

687
00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.000
ways. I am prone to
writing stored procedures. You know,

688
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.790
like those are skills that
I have a hard time

689
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:18.710
shaking off because, because I
counted on for so long,

690
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.400
they so deeply related to
my success. And now, you

691
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.460
know, in later life, these
guys aren't hampered by that

692
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.320
baggage. And a lot of
ways it's, you know, comparison

693
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.950
between the iPad and the
windows tablet, right? Because the

694
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.170
iPad was a blank slate.
It had to be all

695
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.120
new, what they built. And
they only focused on the

696
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.830
first things they would need.
And, you know, you get

697
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.960
a little lack of weight
there. And windows has to

698
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.870
take advantage of the depth
of features they've got and

699
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.510
sort of filter them down.
So they're usable so that

700
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.730
it will be ultimately a
useful product. And in some

701
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.250
ways, be able to cover
more things sooner because it's

702
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.370
got that framework behind it.
But it's, it's two different

703
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.370
approaches. The thing, I think
we're seeing the same thing

704
00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.490
in the younger generation of
software developers. They just don't

705
00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.950
come with that same baggage.
And the other hand, we

706
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.020
provide an awful lot of
value with the background. Like

707
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:07.160
I'm very, I was reading
a great piece on the

708
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.880
death of specifications that nobody
cares about the specs on

709
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.140
machines anymore. And they assumption
was, is because there's now

710
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.310
a diversity. That is all
about the experience, right? That,

711
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.580
that now, you know, you
don't care what I O

712
00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.120
S iPad is running. You
don't care how many, what

713
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.460
the CPU speed is. All
those things that, that was

714
00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.220
a construct when there was
only one operating system that

715
00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.110
was part of a great
conspiracy when everybody was running

716
00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.720
XP, the only way you
could market your device was

717
00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.060
to talk about how many
CPU cycles it had. Right.

718
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.690
And I completely reject that
argument because I remember a

719
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:46.700
time before XP as well.
You know, we cared, we

720
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.190
didn't care about certain specifications
in the early days of

721
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.920
computing as well. You know,
nobody knew what your processor

722
00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.260
speed was and your terrorist,
80, you know why there

723
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:59.390
was only one speed. It
was one megahertz right Matter.

724
00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.550
And nothing has changed in
the Intel space. We've been

725
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.010
at three gigahertz for years
now. We're probably going to

726
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.980
be there for awhile. So
different direction. They went through

727
00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.780
when they went to the
P for architecture, they got

728
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.150
close to four gigahertz. And
then the thing started melting

729
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.650
down. It was too hot
and so forth. And they

730
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.950
actually went back to the
P three architecture, right? Like

731
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.130
that we ma Intel is,
want to talk about that,

732
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.100
that whole P four line
got abandoned. It was a

733
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.890
mistake. Right. And it was
part of it, I think

734
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.110
is because Intel had no
competitor for so long. And

735
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:26.690
they got fat and lazy
and built a bad design

736
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.820
that never really went to
where it's supposed to go.

737
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.190
They went back to the
P three that ultimately evolved

738
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:34.250
into the core two. And
this whole line speed is

739
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.370
speed. But I think the
real reason that specs have

740
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.780
died is that stuff's fast
enough that, you know, the

741
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.700
only difference between your machine
and my machine is your

742
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.860
machine computed that in half
a second in mind, computing

743
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.070
in a second. Oh boy.
Right? Like it just doesn't

744
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.970
matter anymore. The hardware sophisticated
enough. Now we care about

745
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.280
experience because we're just trying
to bring up the sophistication

746
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.770
of the software to match
the hardware. We don't think

747
00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.720
about whether or not a
machine. It has the computing

748
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.590
resources to actually do anything
anymore. It does. They all

749
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.590
do. I wrote an editorial,
looking at the specs on

750
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:10.030
my, my focus, my Samsung
focus, wind phone seven. And

751
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.820
it's basically its specs are
the same specs as the

752
00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:17.710
minimum specs for windows eight.
It's a one gigahertz processor.

753
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.280
It needs a minimum of
a gig of Ram over

754
00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.340
the phone's got eight gigs
around and it needs direct

755
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:27.220
X nine GPU. The phone's
got everything that, that windows

756
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.650
eight is specifying. I think
you just blew my mind

757
00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.530
there. That's interesting. I think
there's some certain differences of

758
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.390
course, in arm versus Intel
and all that kind of

759
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.310
stuff. But your point is,
your point is taken though.

760
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.740
There's, there's a ridiculous amount
of power that we're not

761
00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.250
using. Right. Well, and because
the problem here is not

762
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.730
power it's sophistication Dean, right.
It is how we utilize

763
00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:52.080
that software. Well, and how
we, you know, more long

764
00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.080
time, Microsoft counted on Moore's
law to let the hardware

765
00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.880
be fast enough to run
the software. They were going

766
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.310
to ship in 18 months.
Yeah. Right. So whenever you

767
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:00.900
demo, you know, this is
one of the reasons that

768
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.390
Microsoft got the reputation of
stuff being slow, because whenever

769
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.860
they were showing you the
later stuff, they were showing

770
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.500
it on previous generation hardware,
and it wasn't fast enough

771
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.020
for what they're trying to
do. But at, from Vista

772
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.540
onward, they went the other
way. They've been lightening up

773
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.760
the, the, the operating system
over and over and over

774
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.060
again, because the goal no
longer is I need faster

775
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:21.090
hardware to run this well,
it's I need cheaper hardware

776
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.300
to run this the same.
And the other side of

777
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.730
Moore's law is not just
that stuff will be twice

778
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:28.830
as fast in 18 months.
It's that the stuff you're

779
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.780
buying right now will be
half the price in 18

780
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:35.460
months, because it's fast enough.
Now I don't need to

781
00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.630
go faster. I need it
less expensive. You know, the

782
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:42.720
big debate around the only
windows tablets I've seen so

783
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.110
far, 1300 boxes as well
as exact same laptop based

784
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:51.090
on Moore's law is six
99 in a year. Yeah.

785
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:55.620
I wrote that article recently
about an SSD. And I

786
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.170
probably could have read it
with fewer words, but the

787
00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.800
general idea was that before
you go and buy a

788
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.650
new computer, just get an
SSD because chances are the

789
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.040
computer you have that's three
or four years old. Will

790
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.090
you be just fine? Yep.
You just need to get

791
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:12.060
an SST. Although, honestly, I
can't tell you how many

792
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.590
times people said I'm going
to buy a new computer.

793
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:14.820
What should I do with
the old computer? And I'm

794
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.310
like, before go get your
new computer, give me your

795
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.050
old computer. And all I've
done is we've done a

796
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.020
full re-install and say, here's
your old computer again? They're

797
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.010
like, Oh my God, this
is great. Why did I

798
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.340
buy a new one as
is because software is fatty

799
00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.730
food and your computer needed
an angioplasty, right? Like it's

800
00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.710
just a little rotten. And
so we cleaned it up

801
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.470
and off. It goes again,
but you're right. They, you

802
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.510
know, terms of pure bang
for the buck. The only

803
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.300
thing that breaks on computers
anymore really are the hard

804
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.650
drives That those are the
things that move, the things

805
00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.290
that move That's spinning stuff,
right? Fans and hard drives.

806
00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.110
So you swap with an
SSD. That problem goes away.

807
00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.630
You know, you could still
make a slow machine out

808
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.790
of SSD, but in terms
of just a simple win,

809
00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.520
that's a simple win. And
it's very convenient that we

810
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.740
had, you know, two of
the big Western digital factories

811
00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.640
get flooded. And so the
hard drive prices have tripled

812
00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.280
and suddenly SSDs don't look
that expensive and you can

813
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.170
actually buy them. It's hard.
Drives are hard to come

814
00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.710
by, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well,
I think we need, I

815
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.210
think we need to, we
need to leave it here

816
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.590
at the end of the
year, our, our now annual

817
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.390
minutia with Richard Campbell. I know
we could go on and

818
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:21.670
on and on for hours
while we do. We do.

819
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.770
We do all at the
time. I thank you so

820
00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:27.160
much for your time. And
this has been another episode

821
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.800
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
