episode, Scott talks with bare

9
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.000
Tuneday Thurston about his book,
how to be black. Hi,

10
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.740
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

11
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.440
minutes and I'm here today
with bare attuned day. How

12
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.860
are you sir? Hansel minutes.
I love it. Hansel today.

13
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.510
I'm good. Bear tonight. Marijuana.
Tuna does not seem like

14
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.850
that. Hard of a name.
It isn't four syllables. It's

15
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.270
simpler than encyclopedia, but we
were over at another location

16
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.660
earlier. Yes. And you introduced
yourself to a number of

17
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.020
people who immediately, as one
says their name, the other

18
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.760
person repeats their name. Oh,
baritone Scott, Scott bear today.

19
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.710
What, what happened? I ran
into a very lazy person

20
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.360
who assumed that he couldn't
say my name rather than

21
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.540
actually trying to say it.
And, and then made that

22
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.900
true because he already believed
it before it had happened.

23
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.810
So this was a person
with a very simple one

24
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.100
syllable monosyllabic name and, and
it wasn't fun. It wasn't

25
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.200
a nice person as I
kind of shut down in

26
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.900
the moment because I've had
a bunch of people over

27
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.260
the years, you know, try
to assign me different names.

28
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.360
I'm going to call you
Barry. I used to be,

29
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.430
he said he was gonna
call you B, right? Like

30
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.860
I just met you. You
are no longer you, you

31
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.750
are the thing that I
prefer you to be. Yes.

32
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.780
I'm going to own a
piece of you in terms

33
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.580
of at least how you
were addressed, how you might

34
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.400
be referred, prefer to be
referred to. So he was

35
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.130
an annoying person. He was
the worst that I've had

36
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.040
in a while. I've had
people who know, basically, if

37
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.230
you just give a little
patience with people, like, look,

38
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.470
it sounds different. And I
get that difference. It's a

39
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.710
scary thing for some people,
even when it comes to

40
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.070
just saying a name, but
try it, right. It's like,

41
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.670
try the beats. You might
like beats, you know, try

42
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.860
seeing the world from a
different angle. You might actually

43
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.380
like it. And so in
this case he was not

44
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.420
interested. He didn't have an
open mind. And so he

45
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.370
kind of shut down, which
I was like, okay, I'll

46
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.690
shut down. I don't need
you in my life. I'll

47
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.910
be fine. I'll probably be
better for this interaction not

48
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.760
having happened. And I think,
you know, he would be

49
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.560
too, in fact, cause I
think it's probably his, he's

50
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.660
hurting a little bit inside
and all of this within

51
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.430
the scope of like a
32nd interaction and the way

52
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.180
it was, it was, I,
we had captured it. You

53
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.490
know, there'll be a great
little scene. It would have

54
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.560
been like We could have
had like some awkward actor,

55
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.690
like Hugh grant or somebody.
And then the camera would

56
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:18.570
like, And that's what he
did. It's a little microcosm

57
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.300
of a lot of other
larger issues and problems because

58
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.420
it wasn't that he couldn't
do it. He can Era

59
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.330
Tuneday bare bear. Say that
5,000 times a day, tune

60
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.470
iTunes day, it's attached to
every day of the week.

61
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.410
So it is empirically simple,
but it's different. And he

62
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.050
was like different. I got
to go. I don't have

63
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.410
space for difference in my
life. And that fear of

64
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.630
the unexperienced and the unwillingness
to try maybe for fear

65
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.820
that you would fail at
it, maybe because you're just

66
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.940
not interested. Maybe because you're
so comfortable with how and

67
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.310
where you are that you
don't feel like you need

68
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.680
to bother. I feel like
I'm reading a lot into

69
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.110
this dudes unwilling to say
my name, but there are

70
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.020
people like him out there
who never have to say

71
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.440
that name, like everyone in
there, his life is Bob,

72
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.620
Jim, Dan, Steve Frank. And
that becomes the easy thing.

73
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.220
And you meet a baritone
day, you meet a Kwame,

74
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.710
you meet a, I mean,
these are different, not hard

75
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.140
but different. And it's like,
Oh, what do they call

76
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.680
you for short? We just
met dude. And you're already

77
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.110
trying to define me something
other than what I am.

78
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.110
And as I'm out, there's
a level of privilege, much

79
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.740
as well as annoyance embedded
into all that. But the

80
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.920
unwillingness to just walk through
the door, you might like

81
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.260
a process, bro. I liked
what you said about trying

82
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.870
new things because we went
to lunch and I had

83
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.850
a salad. There was a
place I'd never been before,

84
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.980
but honestly I didn't have
the energy or the emotional

85
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.610
wherewithal to like have calamari
or whatever. Yeah. But you

86
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.800
said, if this is my
last meal, what would I

87
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.630
have? Yeah. I had this
squid wrapped in cheese, wrapped

88
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.310
in fried bread and then
a burger with it with

89
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.990
basically brunch on top of
it. It was a burger

90
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.840
with a fried egg and
bacon. And I think a

91
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.650
village of some kind was
squeezed in there wrapped in

92
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.560
expensiveness. So it was, but
it was good. It was

93
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.260
delicious. And what I said
to the bartender, I like

94
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.010
giving people a chance to
like delight me. And especially

95
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.530
people who have an expertise
where I don't and bartenders

96
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.860
are those people. Servers can
be those people. Chefs certainly

97
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.340
are those people. Why do
you have a whole document

98
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.200
here? This menu? I don't
know it. This is my

99
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.170
first time here. Possibly my
last time here. Why do

100
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.500
I defer to your expertise?
At least for a shot

101
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.260
at winning me to something
new. And so I said,

102
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.900
look, I'm in town for
a day. As soon as

103
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.360
my last meal of the
day, what should I have

104
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.460
here? And did you notice
that he thought about it?

105
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.680
Yeah. He didn't just bust
out what they had a

106
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.520
lot of great he's like,
Oh, Oh, Oh. And there's

107
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.670
the cheaper way to do
that Is, you know, what's

108
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.850
popular here. Right. That's actually
what the web does. Right?

109
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.250
Right. It's like, Oh, this
is the leaderboard. These are

110
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.940
the highest ranking apps. These
are the highest ranking sales.

111
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.300
But if you prompt the
system with a little bit

112
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.520
of input, like it's, it's
not helpful. I think as

113
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.950
a server, as a bartender
for somebody like tell me

114
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.720
what I should have. It's
like, I don't know anything

115
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.610
about you. You know? I
don't even know if I

116
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.320
should be shortening your name
or not. We haven't gotten

117
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.780
to that level. But if
I gave you a little

118
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.650
story with bartenders, I give
him some, I here's what

119
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.810
I like. I know I
like whiskey I'm in the

120
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.200
mood for something smokey. Is
there something you'd like to

121
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.290
make that people don't ask
for often? And then they

122
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.570
are part of it. Now
it's less of a demand

123
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.540
than an opportunity. So that's
the high-minded theory of like

124
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.660
the way as that. Cool.
Yeah. I just had an

125
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.970
idea for a startup. Yeah.
As you're, as you're talking,

126
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.790
you walk by a restaurant
and there's like a 40

127
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.030
inch plasma turn sideways with
a leaderboard of like which

128
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.270
meal has the most upvotes
that day. Like in real

129
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.460
time, like, as people are
ordering, you're like seeing the

130
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.370
calamari or the squid move
its way up mule rank

131
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.000
meal, rank.com. We're going to
register that before we publish

132
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.280
this podcast, this is going
to be a thing it's

133
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.920
going to be thing. That's
a great idea. Or it

134
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.240
depends. And here's the hesitation
ranks, you know, have some

135
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.870
problems when they just, they
kind of genericize a bunch

136
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.990
of unique little community flavors.
And there's just like universal

137
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.030
list. But maybe within that
as a micro community, it's

138
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.270
something where it won't show
up or there's politics to

139
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.820
ranks where, you know, there's
some item on the menu

140
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.150
that, that restaurant really wants
to promote because a friend

141
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.520
of the chef helped make
it put up an item

142
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.090
to promoted items. You can
buy a trending topic on

143
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.560
this list. Sweet. From your
rank, you noted meal. I've

144
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.480
always had a problem with
upvotes and downvotes is that

145
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.040
you could go and see
something. This is like zero

146
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.290
points, but you don't know
if there's not a million

147
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.440
upvotes and a million downloads.
Well, you just expose the,

148
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.390
the vote count. Yeah. But
no, one's there. No, one's

149
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.000
done that though. Have you
just seen that anywhere? Trying

150
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.830
to think, let me read.
It has, has a votes.

151
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.320
I don't really have downloads
to. I can't remember. I

152
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.870
think I just have, I
can't remember up and then

153
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.280
slash And then YouTube has,
has like, Has been dumbed

154
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.460
down cause they YouTube shows
the net. Yeah, They do

155
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.770
exactly. They show a chart
and that was nice about

156
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.260
that is that the first
comment on every YouTube video

157
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.180
is like, who are the
three people who didn't like

158
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.710
this? You know what I
mean? It's always like a

159
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.100
baby, you know, Barton. And
then there's like three people

160
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.290
disliked. And then the first
question is like, who did

161
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.820
not like this? Yeah. Who
do you think? Why do

162
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.320
you hate my baby? So
we talked a couple of

163
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.270
years ago, but since then
you have published a book,

164
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.550
would it be fair to
say a bestselling book? It

165
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.930
would be, it would not
only be fair to be

166
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.270
accurate. Is it fair to
say it's a New York times

167
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.060
bestseller. It is also fair
and accurate. Yeah. And it

168
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.370
is called Gotta be black.
That's true. You are just

169
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.220
hitting it with the facts.
It's just the Wikipedia page.

170
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.040
And I haven't touched that,
so I can't verify it.

171
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.040
So you made this book
and the two questions I

172
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.350
have about the book first
I'm am not black. Right?

173
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.880
Although I have people in
my life are Why would

174
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.700
white people care about this
book? Oh, that is a

175
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.820
good question. First of all,
it's a funny book and

176
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.980
it's a good book. It's
a, well, not the Bible.

177
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.790
Good, but it is a,
it's a, it's a story.

178
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.280
The book is a memoir.
It's a memo, mostly it's

179
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.980
my coming of blackness. And
I have this navigation of

180
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.950
my life from childhood through
college punctuated along the way,

181
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.830
are these satirical lessons, how
to be the black, frail,

182
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.020
how to speak for all
black people. And I interview

183
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.570
a panel of expert black
folks, which is to say

184
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.840
black folks about what it
is to be black in

185
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.730
their labs. When did you
realize you were black? Have

186
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.610
you ever wished you weren't?
Can you swim very important

187
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.200
questions? And for the non-black
person, I think they will

188
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.840
be pleasantly surprised at how
much of their own experience

189
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.150
is reflected in this book,
which is in theory, not

190
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.950
about them at all because
black is the hack, right?

191
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.800
How to be is the
book. Black is the variable.

192
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.960
It's my variable. It's the
one I've been wearing for

193
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.420
a while. It's not the
sum of my experience, but

194
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.550
it's a very important part
of it. The how to

195
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.920
be is really where this
is at and the overall

196
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.530
lesson of the book, I'll
just give it away is

197
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.920
to find a way through
your life, to be yourself

198
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.340
and be comfortable and confident
in that and everything else,

199
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.380
not everything, but a lot
of other issues that might

200
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.220
be associated with parts of
your identity and an insecurity

201
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.260
around that fall away. So
it could be how to

202
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.460
be a woman. It could
be how to be gay.

203
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.470
It could be how to
be a dude. I chose

204
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.200
how to be black. That's
that's a really cool way

205
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.000
to put it. It's black
as a variable. Now, why

206
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.250
did you pick that variable?
I think the variable pick

207
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.090
me Scott. No, but I've
always wanted to say something

208
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.270
like I didn't choose the
variable. The variable chose me,

209
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.590
never been said before. It's
never been said, but I'm

210
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.230
thinking about, I could write
how to be. I could

211
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.640
be right. How to be
a guy, how to be

212
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.470
a programmer, how to be
white, how to be a

213
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.510
Northwestern or how to be
a Portlander, how to be

214
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.760
diabetic. Is that the first,
most important variable for you?

215
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.320
It, it is a very
important variable. It is occasionally

216
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.700
the first, depending on the
room I'm in. And, and

217
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.420
it's been a big part
of my definition and my

218
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.440
experiences. And I think not
just for me before the

219
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.890
country, in which it was
written, which is the United States of America,

220
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.650
there are some significant contributions
to that country's identity that

221
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.100
come out of black. Right.
And so, you know, the

222
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.100
book was also an attempt
to update some of the

223
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.240
possible representations of black in
this country, beyond the rank,

224
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.860
beyond those, the top five
black archetypes that might've been

225
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.410
on the LCD outside of
the window of America, right?

226
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.870
Oh, there's the thug, there's
the sassy black woman. There's

227
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.620
the welfare dude or whatever.
And so there's a lot

228
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.690
more to it than that.
My life represents a big

229
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.090
chunk of that lot more.
And so through the personal

230
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.100
and the humor, I thought,
well, let's try to tell

231
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.200
this story because I think
there's a lot of challenge,

232
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.200
struggle. Annoyance wrapped up in
black that doesn't have to

233
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.000
be there. It doesn't have
to be the first thing

234
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.870
on the list. A good
friend of mine on Twitter,

235
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.680
any Vinny made a great,
a great analysis while back

236
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.210
is in response to a
slate article. And she said,

237
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.030
black people are not a
monolith. And, and that, that

238
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.280
kind of sits with me
for a second because if

239
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.410
you meet, like you may,
if you're a white person

240
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.030
in America, depending on where
you live, you might have

241
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.280
like your black friend or
the three or four black

242
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.130
friends. And that might be
your black person, like in

243
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.710
the sense of that's the
archetype. Okay. And then you

244
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.020
find out that they love
star Wars or they're a

245
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.040
total nerd, or they're awkward,
like awkward black, awkward black

246
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.890
girl, ISA Ray. And then,
and then suddenly your perspective

247
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.380
is like, Oh, wait a
second. Black people are people.

248
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.290
Right. And, and, and while
we, and we have stereotypes

249
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.600
about all sorts of people,
like I might meet like

250
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.970
an Indian engineer that works
at Intel. And I might

251
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.740
assume that his wife is
Indian and they came here

252
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.220
and they're very formerly Indian.
And then I discovered that

253
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.010
his wife's black or that,
you know, he grew up

254
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:55.560
in, in Massachusetts or whatever
is, is stereotyping the primary

255
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.290
problem for black folks in
America right now that there

256
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.440
is just a, we got
you all figured out. I

257
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.250
don't, I don't know if
it's the primary problem. It

258
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.050
is the problem with the
root, from which all I

259
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.600
know that that's not like
oppression and frustration is a

260
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.410
problem, but it's the root
essence that you're being pigeonholed.

261
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.080
I think I have to
think more about it. I'm

262
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.140
not because I don't want
to, as I answered, I

263
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.030
may come to a conclusion,
but I don't want to

264
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.150
jump to and say, that's
it. Cause I'm not sure.

265
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.650
I do know that there
are consequences of the stereotypes

266
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.550
which go beyond inconvenience or
annoyance. And they go to

267
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.970
the global expectations of an
entire group of people. They

268
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.230
go to media representation and
thus ideas of self and

269
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.680
self worth and self value.
We internalize what we see

270
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.170
about ourselves in the world.
And if you only see

271
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.660
a certain version of yourself
that says you can do

272
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.200
these things and by implication,
none of these other things

273
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.170
that changes your dreams, that
changes, you know, what your

274
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.990
hopes are, that changes what
you might pursue and the

275
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.700
opposite of all that, which
you choose not to pursue.

276
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.570
And that's important. So having,
you know, the stereotypes are

277
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.670
a problem. Some of them
are based in reality, there

278
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.450
are sometimes just types, but
the oversimplification of what black

279
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.740
can be leads to some
significant challenges that are quite

280
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.650
important, if not the most
important challenges, A lot of

281
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.160
people, particularly white folks say,
well, why do we keep

282
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.890
talking about this? Why is
race an issue? The idea

283
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.520
that I don't see color.
And I, I spoke on

284
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.430
a black panel about a
panel of Blanton. Yeah, of

285
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.630
course. Yeah. Wisdom blisters. Ah,
nice. It's South by Southwest.

286
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.800
And, and one of the
things that I said in

287
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.370
the panel that I felt
good about was that there

288
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.900
is a sense of pie
chart, diversity that you can

289
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.060
put together, this pretty pie
chart, where you have like

290
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.250
the Latin girl and the
black guy and the white

291
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.960
guy with blonde hair and
the white girl with black,

292
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.120
you know, you have this
nice one, that's a statically

293
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.280
pleasing. So United colors of
Benetton ad. And it may

294
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.680
be aesthetically pleasing, but it
doesn't reflect kind of the

295
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.440
reality of what's going on
in the world there. And

296
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.020
then people kept saying, well,
I don't see color. And

297
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.750
I said, if you don't
see color, then you are

298
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.660
not seeing me. Right. I
do. I think the, you

299
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.200
know, the notion of colorblindness,
like the low notion or

300
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.800
the lotion we're talking about
black stuff, so let's change,

301
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.620
Right. You guys are taking
all the butters. Yeah. Yeah.

302
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.380
Coco, especially, but we'll work
with a lot of other

303
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.170
ones. So, you know, the
notion of a post racial

304
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.940
or colorblind society is naive.
And I think useless more

305
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.180
than it is. I don't,
I think it misses the

306
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.280
point. I think you skip
ahead and you skip over

307
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.820
the reality that there are
differences and that, that doesn't

308
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.980
have to be a problem,
but it can be acknowledged.

309
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.840
It can be included. It
can be part of how

310
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.690
you develop your products. I
think that's fine. But thing

311
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.790
I don't see color is
saying, I don't want to

312
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.880
do any work. And it's
saying, well, you know, rather

313
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.210
than I see color and
I disliked that color, no

314
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.470
one wants to be that
person. No one wants to

315
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.240
acknowledge that that person or
the clan doesn't want to

316
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.250
acknowledge that at this point,
there are, they're kind of

317
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.660
a joke. I shouldn't have
brought them other more for

318
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.510
performance. Let's say, let's say,
for example, you see someone

319
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.050
in a wheelchair. Yeah. Oh,
I don't see disabilities Still

320
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.160
just floating on his butt.
That is amazing If you

321
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.100
will. But if you don't
see a blind person as

322
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.890
being blind and you hand
them something and expect them

323
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.110
to take it without being
prompted, or you expect the

324
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.450
wheelchair guy to walk up
a set of stairs, it's

325
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.190
denying their, their experience, which
is not good. Which made

326
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.890
them interesting, like denying my
name is Barrington or giving

327
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.900
or giving me a piece
of cake. Yeah. Cause we

328
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.810
can't have that because it
might have high sugar. When

329
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.710
you were marketing this book,
I was in awe. And

330
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.450
I'm not just kind of
like kissing your butt because

331
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.920
you're here on the show.
But I mean like the

332
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.690
way that you marketed it
and your use of social

333
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.340
media, I thought was really
cool. Cause you ran it.

334
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.040
I felt like a political
campaign. Like you were running

335
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.690
for something, you ran unopposed.
Oh no, the world was

336
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.780
against me. So I wasn't
running against everyone. Can you

337
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.520
talk to me about how
you use some of the

338
00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.770
technology and the social media
in the skills that you

339
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.160
developed while working previously at
the onion and digital and

340
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.050
digital media to promote this
book? Absolutely. One of the

341
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.420
first things I did and
you were right about the

342
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.450
political campaign. First of all,
that was my metaphor. And

343
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.370
it was in part because
of my, I have a

344
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.220
big political background. I grew
up in Washington, DC. I

345
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.550
campaign hard for press now,
president Obama and, and a

346
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.730
lot of facets of the
campaign. And the premise was

347
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.180
a, is fun. You know,
I just, I like applying

348
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.240
a conceit sometimes to the
things I do, some kind

349
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.910
of personality and overarching narrative
and it just made it

350
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.410
more interesting for me. Cause
I have to live this

351
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.420
day in and day out
and just be like, I

352
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.300
want to sell a book
is way less interesting than

353
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.690
a political, Well, I knew
you pissing people off because

354
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.790
you're like, if you don't
buy this book, you're racist

355
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.800
and that's hilarious. I think
some didn't get it. We'll

356
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.660
see it's First of all,
it's science. It's not me.

357
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.760
Okay. It's not, it's not
like I'm judging you for

358
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.130
not by the book. Science
has proven if you don't

359
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.230
buy my book, how to
be black available in all

360
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.170
formats, you are in fact
a racist. Now we can

361
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.300
work with them. You know,
there there's a program, right?

362
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.520
It's like gravity people. It's
just one of those things

363
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.400
that have to buy the
book, don't be racist or

364
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.860
acknowledge that you are, but
still stop living in the

365
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:16.170
shadows. Undocumented racists are, you
know, they're people too. So

366
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.570
I think though the political
thing was, I also wanted

367
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.380
to build something that was
more than just me. And

368
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.910
one of the less, I
took a lot of lessons

369
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:28.110
from politics in general, Obama
in particular, you know, here's

370
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.220
a dude who tapped into
an existing conversation, tapped in

371
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.310
effectively to an existing movement
change. We can do this,

372
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.580
but he didn't create that.
Right. He grabbed it, put

373
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.030
his name on it and
ran with it. Exactly. And

374
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.080
it's not, that's not, that's
not evil either. Like he

375
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.330
was the right person at
the time, right. To kind

376
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.300
of ride and promote that
wave. And similarly, so when

377
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.390
people were, you know, when
you're a successful politician, people

378
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.240
aren't just voting for you,
they see themselves in you,

379
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.930
they put their dreams in
the platform of your campaign.

380
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.270
And it's not just bullet
points. It's like, Oh, this

381
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.860
person, this party, this team
gets me. Right. I want

382
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.450
to ride with them. So
I want it to see

383
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.270
if I can get some
slice of that around this

384
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.580
book. Because if it's just
about me writing a book,

385
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.300
that's friends and family. Yeah.
And existing fans. But if

386
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.540
it's really about identity, if
it's about, let's take the

387
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.090
best seller list in a
new way. If it's about,

388
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.070
I want to be part
of something that changes the

389
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.260
way we talk about race
and identity in this country,

390
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.390
right? That's much more than
an ego boost to a

391
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.890
guy named bear today. This
is really interesting because we,

392
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.750
I have no doubt. We
have a diversity of listeners

393
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.180
and I have a diversity
of political opinions. And some

394
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.880
people who are listening, maybe
50% of them may have

395
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.520
shut down as soon as
you mentioned Obama, right? But

396
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.920
let's not talk about Obama
as a political, whether you

397
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.850
like him or not. The
concept is that he tapped

398
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.550
into an existing narrative as
story and made it his

399
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.850
own and rode that. And
whoever, whether it be Obama

400
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.220
or the next guy who
becomes president next, if they

401
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.950
succeed, they will have to
do the same thing. They

402
00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.010
will have to, to feel
out what's happening on the,

403
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.290
on the streets in America,
what people are talking about

404
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.220
and get on and ride.
So you might that. Yeah.

405
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.920
That's, I mean, that's, that's
politics in general. You have

406
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.930
to understand where people are.
You have to convince them,

407
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.280
you can take them where
they want to be, But

408
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.410
also steer it. You don't
want to just simply ride

409
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.190
popular opinion and take them
the active part, right. Or

410
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:21.740
they want to be, or,
and in some bolder cases,

411
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.560
tell them where they should
be, but convince them that

412
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.860
they want it. So with
the book, one of the

413
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.350
things we did first was
to build a street team.

414
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.320
This is a virtual street
team and there was an

415
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.800
application process. We use Wolf,
oo, as our form building

416
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.530
software to get people in
the system. I wanted people

417
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.830
to feel like this book
was theirs. And I wanted

418
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.040
a core group of people
to really feel passionately about

419
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.420
that. I'm one person I
can get 20, 50, a

420
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.120
hundred around me who feel
and who are not just

421
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.530
black people, people around the
world. In fact, that is

422
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.560
more interesting. And so we
cast the net widely. I

423
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.770
went out on a lot
of digital media. Read-write web

424
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.050
wrote about it. I went
on this week in tech

425
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.510
and talked about it and
went on this weekend, blackness

426
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.940
or blacking it up, Ilan
James, his show and talked

427
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.370
about. So I hit tech
communities. I hit race communities.

428
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.220
I hit comedy blogs and
communities I'm doing this project

429
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.960
would love you to join.
We are trying to make

430
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.500
a bestseller. We were trying
to affect the conversation. And

431
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.420
once we got our crew
in and there was an

432
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.460
application in part, because I
wanted, if you can't fill

433
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.620
out an application, you're not
going to do all this

434
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.320
stuff because you want them
to represent you. This is

435
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.000
the person who's going to
knock on the door. This

436
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.650
is going to vote for
my candidate. This is my

437
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.710
field ops. Right. For every,
you know, we, we broke,

438
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.420
we had field ops was
the street team. We had

439
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.960
bundlers the high value donors,
right. Which are people identified

440
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.970
as like, you're going to
be able to convert a

441
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.980
hundred books, sales, whether you
buy them yourself or do

442
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.200
you get your company to
bring me there by whether

443
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.110
you can put me on
your TV show, you're in

444
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.850
that sort of elite crew.
So with the street team

445
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.790
that we use, we offered
them, you're gonna get the

446
00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.850
book early. You are going
to get access to me.

447
00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.060
Right. I'll do an email
blast just to you guys

448
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.820
every other week. What's going
on behind the scenes. How

449
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.890
are we going? What's happening
with the publisher started without

450
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.860
the Kickstarter. Yeah. We hacked
our own Kickstarter. We rolled

451
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.070
our own kicks in. Exactly.
And you are going to

452
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.490
we'll do video chats. And
so I used a vocal

453
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.060
as a video chat platform.
That's pretty lightweight works from

454
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.200
anywhere, web based fully. And
I would do the sessions

455
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.380
with the street team, just
taking questions. One of the

456
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.670
beauty that the technical beauties
of vocal over say something

457
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.080
more traditional like Ustream or
Skype is when, when people

458
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.660
are interacting with you, like
you producing a show, right?

459
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.420
I take questions. People can
submit a text question. And

460
00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.240
if you type it in
the queue, I see the

461
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.780
backend. I pull in the
text question, split-screen me. And

462
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.870
the question typed up and
who submitted it. So now

463
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.300
you're seeing what question I'm
talking about. Even if you

464
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.520
jumped in, after the question
was asked, nice. I can

465
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.560
bring in people through, I'm
going to do that. And

466
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.640
the other beauty, and this
is the magic of it.

467
00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.310
And I'm, I don't work
for vocal. I get no

468
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.800
money from them probably right.
And other people can do

469
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.190
this. It's not super a
novel, but they did at

470
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:09.820
first, as far as I
knew that whole video session

471
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.020
is bookmarked by the interactions,
by the questions I took.

472
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.650
So I get an indexed
link to each of those

473
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.320
segments. Well, I can shoot
that out later. I can

474
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.930
embed that I can send
it straight to YouTube, generics,

475
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.850
degenerated, realtime FAC. So the
street team, my goal for

476
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.890
the streets, he might have
very quantified goals for this

477
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.440
book. I want it to,
pre-sell a certain amount. I

478
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.710
want the street team to
convert these many. It didn't

479
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.260
work out that way. The
math didn't work in that

480
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.630
sense, but the street team
was valuable because they were

481
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.410
my beta. They were my
early tests. Microsoft, you have

482
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:49.400
a preferred developer network. They
were my MVPs and B.

483
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.100
They gave me more than
sales. They gave me intelligence

484
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.500
from the market. And so
I would do these video

485
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.990
chats every other week. And
they had read the book

486
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:59.510
and they had questions as
a woman in a white

487
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.870
woman in Arizona. And she's
like, well, I'm white. How

488
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.990
do I, how do I
talk about this book? And

489
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.420
we talked about it. And
that moment is on the

490
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.850
website. Now, like I'm a
white person. How do I

491
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.070
talk about this book? And
that's part of the FAQ,

492
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.840
but it's a video FAQ.
And you see it's a

493
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.090
real white person who asked
me about this and I

494
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.640
could go into that. So
that was a ton of

495
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.190
fun to get an early
warning system on what kind

496
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.500
of questions will be happening.
The other thing we did,

497
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.830
the first assignment read the
book, we sent them a

498
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.910
PDF. Talk about it over
Thanksgiving with your family, and

499
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.940
then report back to the
private Facebook group we've created

500
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.160
for the street team. Nice.
Because I wanted people to

501
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.140
talk to each other and
get to know each other

502
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.910
and like, Oh, your grandfather
said that we were thinking,

503
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.940
so did mine. Your kid
thought this, so did mine.

504
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.090
And that's an area I
don't control email list. I

505
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.690
control the video thing. I'm
still choosing, you know, timelines

506
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.670
of when people jump in
and out, the Facebook group

507
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.790
was kind of like, here's
your area talk amongst your,

508
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:59.080
That grandfather example is interesting
because it's like, I'll give

509
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.660
you a little insight into
white folks. Yeah. We don't

510
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.570
usually sit around and talk
about black folks and even

511
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.140
less so with old people.
But if you sit down

512
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.960
with your hundred year old
grandmother, you can get some

513
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:17.230
really interesting stories. My grandmother
is 96. Good for her.

514
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.110
And she, I guess I
discovered this after talking to

515
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.260
her about this topic was
kicked out of school in

516
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.770
1922 for dancing with a
black boy at a dance.

517
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.220
She needs to be on
the website. I had no,

518
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.770
no. Cause why would I
ever have this conversation? It

519
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.080
was just one of those
stories that you have a

520
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.110
million stories that I'm sure
she has where it's like,

521
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.790
Oh wow. I, you were
not only on the right

522
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.330
side of history, but like
40 years before that even

523
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.610
was something people thought about
being on the right side

524
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.640
of history. So that's something
interesting that I never thought

525
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.280
about. Like I'm imagining, like
that would be very strange,

526
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.140
uncomfortable thing for a bunch
of white people to say,

527
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.060
Oh, Hey, you know, it's
Thanksgiving dinner. And I bought

528
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.620
this book how to be
black. Let's talk about it.

529
00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.500
But some really interesting discussions
and narratives will come out

530
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.810
of that. The thing was
to give those folks an

531
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.630
opportunity to bring it up
in their context, in their

532
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.840
voice and from their experience.
So I didn't give them

533
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.380
like, these are the sales
points you make exactly pitching

534
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.930
how to be black to
your network. That's a little

535
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.500
too heavy hand in artificial.
Read the book, whatever you

536
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.260
find in it that resonates
with you. Talk about that.

537
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.330
I just want to know
what that was. So share

538
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.500
the intelligence gathering and non
stovepiping of that was very

539
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.640
important. We also, it's something
I haven't talked much about.

540
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.840
We have all versions of
the book. There's a hard

541
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.230
cover print analog, you know,
version, right? The dead tree

542
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.530
edition of the, the atomic
version and then their various

543
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.000
electronic versions. I have the
audio book. So I interviewed

544
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.600
this panel. I shot that
on a, with a very

545
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.720
expensive two camera rig. It
was an iPhone for us

546
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.750
and my flip minnow HD.
Nice. And I used the

547
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.790
zoom audio recorder that we're
talking about right now. I

548
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.250
had that as my clean
audio source. Nice. And then

549
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.250
I had a video editor
bill Cammack Oh, I know

550
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.410
bill. Yeah. Bill's a great
guy. And be award winning

551
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.310
video editor to help us
chop that up and create

552
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.940
moments out of these hours
of footage, seven people roughly

553
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.950
an hour each I'm not
just gonna throw out seven

554
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.380
hours of video and of
course edit it. So we

555
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.200
splice things together along on
this question of when did

556
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.330
you first realize you were
black? And we pulled some

557
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.520
things from w Kamau bell
and some things from Sheryl

558
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.520
County and some things from
Derrick Ashong and it was

559
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.470
a beautiful thing. And then
we put that out and

560
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.170
ask the public. When did
you first realize you were

561
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.450
whatever you are? We all
say there's a white person

562
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.550
that we interviewed on this
panel, Christian Lander from stuff

563
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.280
I remember. Yeah. I didn't
even think about it. See,

564
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.200
we don't think about that
either. Yeah. Now you just

565
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.880
made me think about when
I realized that I was

566
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.430
white. There you go. Yeah.
So that I remember now.

567
00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.150
So, so there was, but
the technology was key to

568
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.700
promoting and prompting that question.
And even if you didn't

569
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.470
read the book, you can
still come across that on

570
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.660
the website and be a
part of this world that

571
00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.420
we're building this tower that
we're fully building out, that

572
00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.510
we're adding to the world
existed. So that was one

573
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.360
thing. And having the audio
book version, I read myself

574
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.660
then dropped in the audio
of my interview subjects instead

575
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.640
of me reading all their
parts. That to me, that'd

576
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.220
be weird. So when you
listen to the book, you're

577
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.930
hearing me tell the stories
of my life, which is

578
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.460
the best way to hear
it right. And you're hearing

579
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.100
people tell their lives in
their voices, in their homes.

580
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.770
So was it the original
audio when you got the

581
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.710
actual ones from the zoom,
Add that to the engineers

582
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.560
at a, at Harper audio
and they, and they put

583
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.620
it together and it sounds
fantastic. And then we did

584
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.190
this enhanced ebook. And, and
so what that means is

585
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.870
a lot less than what
I'd hoped it would mean.

586
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.270
So enhanced ebook. I'm like,
Oh, cause we can, we

587
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.340
can, obviously you should embed
some videos. We can have

588
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.620
some interactive features. I wanted
to put like a quiz

589
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.170
around the, how black are
you chapter and have people

590
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.410
sort of play around and
you know, ebook platforms are

591
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.680
so diverse. You have to
play to the least common

592
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.930
denominator because you're not gonna
make a custom version for

593
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.820
the iPad and then another
one for color and another

594
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.160
one for the Kindle and
then the other devices out

595
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.830
there, the Sonys, et cetera.
So we could basically put

596
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.310
images in which we did,
we could put audio in.

597
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.770
And so there's a point
where there's a speech that

598
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.800
I delivered as a child
called the U S propaganda

599
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.890
machine. I was a very
young militant kid and I

600
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.450
turned it. It was basically
a speech from me to

601
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.200
all black America explaining how
the white man had oppressed

602
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.140
us through media misrepresentation. How
old are you at this

603
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.700
point in 12? It's brilliant.
But I performed that speech

604
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.890
in front of a live
audience in Boston two years

605
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.190
ago. Got great audio, jot
that in awesome. Some video.

606
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:32.250
And then we hacked the
hyperlinking in the book. So

607
00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.190
you can throw some links
in. And I, what I

608
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:37.430
wanted to do is embed
tweets in the book so

609
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.400
that you could retweet from
within the book, like these

610
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.220
are the things we should
able to do now, cause

611
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.740
we're already doing them. And
the book is a step

612
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.020
backwards in that, on the
analog side. But on the

613
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.720
elect, the electronic side, you
should be able to do

614
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.570
it. So we put links
and built our own site

615
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.860
just to hold these tweets.
And then, so when you

616
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.420
click on those links, you
get to, and then we

617
00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.760
can change it. Sometimes we
throw an image in there.

618
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:03.060
Sometimes, sometimes it's just a
pull quote or something, and

619
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.280
we've been able to play
around with that, that there's

620
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.160
no CMS for that, that
the publishers around or that

621
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.860
Apple gives you access to.
We had to build a

622
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.350
site for it and then
throw in some code. And

623
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.050
I'm not a great coder.
I had my campaign manager

624
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.060
who was overall. I could
read it, build some of

625
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.130
that stuff out, but we
have a lot of fun

626
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.690
with it, with the tech
there. I think those were

627
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.810
some of the more novel
uses of tech in the

628
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.090
book. And then here's the,
here's a, this actually I

629
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.310
think a lot of your
people will have some fun

630
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:34.650
with screen-sharing. There's a site
called join.me, which lets people

631
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.860
view remotely your computer screen.
And it's largely, I think

632
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.750
for tech support and product
demos, I use it all

633
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.790
the time. Yeah. So I
used it to write my

634
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.460
book in public and I
did what I called a

635
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.520
live writing exercise and a
writer friend of mine on,

636
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.280
on Gira us. He gets
credit because he suggested I

637
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.900
do this. Always have to
mention his name when I

638
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.880
bring it up. And I
didn't think it was a

639
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.810
good idea until I argued
against it and then convince

640
00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.820
myself the opposite. All right,
I'll give it a shot.

641
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.300
So I fired up the
software, created the link, put

642
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.360
it out just on Google
plus first I think it

643
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.040
was like the, my newest
community. Let me just test

644
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.750
that. Just hang out. And,
and it worked. It worked

645
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.820
well. Wow. And what happened
is people saw a chapter.

646
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.150
Yeah. You go from zero
to thousands of words. I

647
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.770
wrote it in a couple
of hours and met a

648
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.070
couple of hundred people coming
in. Right. The feature remotely

649
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.610
control. My computer was invoked
quite often by folks who

650
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.130
thought that I was crowdsourcing
the book. Oh, let me

651
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.080
write something about, that was
my question. Like, are you

652
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.540
just alone with people with
a hundred people over your

653
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.330
shoulder? That's that's, that's what
it was no back channel.

654
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.460
So, and then there wasn't,
there was a chat room.

655
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.470
So this is what I
had to learn, how to

656
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.020
manage, you know, one people
thought I was inviting them

657
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.020
to participate actively in writing
the book. I'm still the

658
00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.270
author. It's still my book.
That's not what's happening here,

659
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.900
but you can observe and
talk to each other. And

660
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.670
so in the chat room,
once people realized like I

661
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.390
wasn't engaging because I'm writing,
it's called live writing. Not

662
00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.900
just me talking. Right. People
started talking to each other.

663
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.440
Yeah. How do you feel
better today? I don't know.

664
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.110
What do you think of
this? Oh, this is really

665
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.220
interesting. They're correcting my typos
real time. They're asking me

666
00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.260
to scroll up so they
can see, you know, what

667
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.530
came before and they're commenting
on the novelty of actually

668
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.130
seeing the writing process, which
you never see from someone

669
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.800
one else's perspective. You see
the finished product. You may

670
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.230
see someone in the cafe
on a computer, but you

671
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.780
don't know what's actually happening
on their screen. And because

672
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.840
it's, you're capturing the screen,
not just the writing software,

673
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.870
you see me cut to
Google maps, which I did

674
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.900
often in writing the book
for street view. So I

675
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.540
could re walk the streets
of my neighborhood as I

676
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.370
wrote about those childhood memories
and, or going to Wikipedia.

677
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.740
So I took a trip
to Senegal as a kid

678
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.850
left a deep impression. And
I remember learning about Leopold

679
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.660
singer and a former president.
The first, I think non-French

680
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.900
min to be admitted to
LA Academy Francaise, which is

681
00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.090
the official keeper of the
French language. It was such

682
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.000
a big deal for a
black African man to join

683
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.900
that and credited with creating
Negritude as a philosophy and

684
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.960
way of thinking about what
blackness was. I didn't remember

685
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.980
all that detail Wikipedia has
that. So I'm going in,

686
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.270
I'm educating myself as well
as whoever would read this

687
00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.670
book eventually. And so you
see this bouncing back and

688
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:16.430
forth. There was a story
about my mother. She had

689
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.160
driven one night from DC
to Pittsburgh because she was

690
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.420
mad at my sister who
was in college there. And

691
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.990
I think that drive was
like four hours. That's my

692
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.930
childhood memory. Let's go to
Google maps and like plot

693
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.360
it. The roads haven't changed
that much, right from the

694
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.100
late eighties to now in
terms of the highway system.

695
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.890
And so I could be
like pre fact checking myself,

696
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.770
using the web and using
our, you know, shared knowledge

697
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.860
basis and a cloud hosted
mapping. I wouldn't have been,

698
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.500
I would have to go
back to DC and walk

699
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.670
through my block again. And
this way I could do

700
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.610
it remotely. It was pretty
cool. It's fantastic. Yeah. Do

701
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.740
you think that this is
the, I feel like you're

702
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.020
on the cutting edge of
what people do with books.

703
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.840
Will this become the bare
minimum? Is this going to

704
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.150
be the new bar for
what a book looks like?

705
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:02.270
Partly. So I'm an extreme
case. And I would say,

706
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.600
you know, as any artists
or creator, you gotta have

707
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.410
to have some mind from
marketing it and thinking beyond

708
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:13.220
the raw material itself, how
do you hook in the

709
00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.470
community? It doesn't mean you
give over your voice, but

710
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.030
is there a way to
do that? How do you

711
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.370
push the sales button? How
do you take advantage of

712
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.460
the interactive tools? That's going
to keep people interested because

713
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.830
that's the new bar. So
I wanted to push the

714
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.420
envelope and experiment with that.
I think there will be

715
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.650
people who don't do it,
so I'm not going to

716
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.230
prescribe it for everyone, but
somebody has got to be

717
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.290
thinking about it, even if
it's not the original author,

718
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.480
a Dane stupor band, or
what have you, it's going

719
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.280
to be the new minimum
because we're going to expect

720
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.120
more from our story. Right.
Fantastic. Well, thank you so

721
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.050
much for talking to me
today. Yeah. We'll add links

722
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.560
to all of the stuff
that we talked about and

723
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.200
you can pick up there.
Today's book how to be

724
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.780
black on Amazon as well
as on his website, which

725
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.610
is how as it is.
Cause there's little blackness in

726
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.760
all of us. This has
been another episode of Hanselminutes

727
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.050
and we'll see you again
next week.
