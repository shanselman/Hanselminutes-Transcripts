00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.180
From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
a weekly discussion with web

2
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.220
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

3
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.350
number 547. In this episode,
Scott talks with children's author

4
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.210
and programming instructor, Linda Lucas, about
her book. Hello, Ruby, and

5
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.740
about teaching coding to kids.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

6
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.920
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking

7
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.430
with Linda Lucas from Finland, and
she's here to talk to

8
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.650
me about her children's book
now, media empire. Hello, Ruby.

9
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.820
How are you? I'm teasing
you a little bit about

10
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.210
your empire, but I understand
that your book, hello, Ruby

11
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.600
is now your full time
job. Yes, I'm a full

12
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.710
time children's book, author illustrator,
and still a pretty mediocre

13
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.420
programmer. Well, there's nothing wrong
with that. So how did

14
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.790
you have this idea? And
was it just a side

15
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.890
thing you were going to
do for fun? It was

16
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.710
absolutely a side thing. I,
I lived in New York for

17
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.460
a while and, and work
at programming startup over there.

18
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.860
And then I moved back
to Helsinki, which is my

19
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.300
native city or country where
I come from Finland. And,

20
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.660
and I had this idea
that I wished there was

21
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.060
a book when I was
growing up, that it would

22
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.260
portray technology as something wonderful
and whimsical and colorful and

23
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.710
fun. And I was learning
Ruby programming as my first

24
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.370
language or, and around the
time I started to really

25
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.510
like learn all of these
technical jargon words, like object

26
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.890
oriented programming or garbage collection.
And every time I would

27
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.330
run into word or a
concept that I didn't quite

28
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.120
understand, I would try to
figure out how would a

29
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.030
six year old little girl
explain this thing? And that's

30
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.970
how the character of Ruby
was originally born. But then

31
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.270
something kind of switched into
my, my brain. And I

32
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.820
started to really see that
the world of technology as

33
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.170
stories, like some people see
math as numbers, math as

34
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.380
us colors, our numbers, his
colors. So I want us

35
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.920
to write a book that
would both explain sort of

36
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.640
what is so magical and
exciting about technology teach about

37
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.560
computational thinking about these concepts
that we should understand even

38
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.130
before we learned to program
and do it all for

39
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.980
the eyes of this little
heroin called Ruby. It seems

40
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.630
so heavy. The topic of,
you know, computational thinking. Is

41
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.550
it an, is it a
good thing that they're young

42
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.830
when you try to teach
them this, that their minds

43
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.130
are, they don't realize it's
going to be hard and

44
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.650
complex? Or is it just
not that complex? I think

45
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.060
it's just not that complex.
And also somehow when I

46
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.090
think about the most profound
things that really taught me

47
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.080
about my, like the role
of friendship or family or,

48
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.710
or adventure, they come from
all childhood stories and their

49
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.620
role models we have as
kids really sort of open

50
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.190
up all of the possibilities
for us. And, and I

51
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.380
figured that if we can
change the way a six

52
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.170
year old sees the world,
we can, we can change

53
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.620
the world and coming from
the sort of startup world

54
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.860
of scalable change and, and
Vic ideas. I, I figured

55
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.470
that that, yeah, like if
we can change kids, we

56
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.150
can change the world. What
was your original goal? How

57
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.920
much were you, how much
were you thinking you would

58
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.770
need to go and kick
this off? So I originally

59
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.860
wasn't even thinking about Kickstarter
as a platform. I, I

60
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.190
started to like make these
little drawings, these little doodles

61
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.150
around Ruby and her friends.
And there was the friend

62
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.960
called tox, the penguins or
the Linux programmers in the

63
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.140
audience might know this character
pretty well. It's a ping

64
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.800
when that is really smart
and efficient, but somewhat hard

65
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.980
to understand. And when I
thought about Apple as a

66
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.220
company, I would think about
snoler part. Who's really beautiful,

67
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.830
but doesn't want to play
with the other kids because

68
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.080
they are too messy and
so forth and so forth.

69
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.890
So it was this like
really silly toning. She collect

70
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.960
geeky little drawings that I
made into my tumbler and

71
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.490
then some friends really, they
encouraged me that because I

72
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.350
was very heavily involved in
the Ruby on rails community

73
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.370
day. I met a lot
of Ruby developer, moms and

74
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.530
dads around the world who
said that, Oh, I wish

75
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.500
I could have a way
of talking about my profession

76
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.410
to my kids who only
see me in front of

77
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.920
the computer and who don't
really like, I don't have

78
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.050
the vocabulary and the words
and the stories to talk

79
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.730
about my own profession. So
I figured that, okay, I'm

80
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.690
going to do this book
on in order to make

81
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.950
the self publishing around sign.
I need to gather $10,000.

82
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.120
And that's what I originally
set as my golf, But

83
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.930
it looks like within just
a single day on Kickstarter,

84
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.700
you raised a hundred thousand
and that must've felt unbelievable.

85
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.150
Like maybe people were, it
was couldn't have been real.

86
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.520
Absolutely. Totally. I, I remember
coming home and realizing that,

87
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.730
Oh, wow. Like I actually
became a children's book author

88
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.490
before that it was like
almost a joke, like a,

89
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.040
like a side project thing
that I hadn't fully committed

90
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.650
to. And, and my first
reaction was to panic because

91
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.080
I had absolutely no idea
how to make this thing

92
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.140
happen. And I had never
like actually made a book

93
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.350
before or, or drawn anything
like bigger than the little

94
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.530
sketches and doodles. And it
was a very, very steep

95
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.700
learning curve all the way,
Because now suddenly you have

96
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.390
to produce physical book and
print it and make it

97
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.330
high quality and this so
many more things that have

98
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.790
nothing to do with programming.
Absolutely. And, and also the

99
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.880
audience changed because it wasn't
anymore. The program are dads

100
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.530
and moms. It was all
kinds of adults and parents

101
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.990
who like said that, Oh,
I don't know how to

102
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.570
program that. I, I recognize
that this is something that

103
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.970
I want my kid or
children to be able to

104
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.390
understand. So, so that approach
really needed to change. And

105
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.490
I think I originally said
that, Oh, I'm going to

106
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.570
make like a 32 page
book. And I think there,

107
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.600
the end result ended up
being like 120 pages if

108
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.140
I remember correctly. So, so
the book also grew in

109
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.990
size and it was also
late, which was most like

110
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.220
anxious thing ever coming from
the industry where you deploy

111
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.390
like five times a day
and the publishing industry where

112
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.660
like they told me already,
I think in, in March

113
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.820
that there is no way
that you can like say

114
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.860
that this is going to
be a story in September.

115
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.460
It was like a year
of waiting for me after

116
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.490
I had actually finished the
book. That must have been

117
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.460
very painful. Yeah. I, for
a year I woke up

118
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.370
every night, like two hours
after I would go to

119
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.770
sleep, I would wake up
and just like scream out

120
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.110
a loud in panic figures.
That was, that was the

121
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.390
way I was feeling at
the time. And I also

122
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.370
felt that I had let
down all of the people

123
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.490
like Kickstarter, backers who had
put so much trust and

124
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.370
faith in me. And it
was a lot of anxiety

125
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.810
around that time. I don't
want to talk too much

126
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.970
about this, but it's worth
pointing out though that you

127
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.100
ended up according to Kickstarter
with almost $400,000. But because

128
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.300
you're making physical things that
doesn't necessarily mean that you

129
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.240
become like super rich overnight,
you still have to buy

130
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.670
the money. That money is
not for you to like,

131
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.620
I don't know, sit in
a big pile of money,

132
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.640
that's for you to make
actual hardcover books workbooks. So

133
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.550
how does that work? You,
you bring all this money

134
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.810
in, but now you have
to turn around and find

135
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.540
a book publisher to physically
make the thing. Yeah, that

136
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.580
was a, that was a,
like a new thing to

137
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.100
learn to me also like
coming from the software industry

138
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.120
where things scale and, and
the cost of another piece

139
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.540
of software, doesn't like, it's
not linear in the same

140
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.400
way. As in the real
world, I needed to figure

141
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.390
out how to distribute 10,000
books to different people all

142
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.510
around the world. And, and
yeah, it was a, it

143
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.880
was a pretty heavy thing.
And as I mentioned, I'm

144
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.750
not a media empire yet
because it really costs to

145
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.150
do all of those things.
But in some ways I

146
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.710
always felt that the, the
financial sort of runway, the

147
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.220
Kickstarter audience gave me to,
to make the best possible

148
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.630
book was also something, no,
like in no other time

149
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.400
of the history, I would
have been able to do

150
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.690
this. So it's, it's also
sort of the artistic creativity

151
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.020
and freedom that, that, that
money gave me. And, and

152
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.420
I always saw Ruby as
way more than only a

153
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.930
book. So, so now two
years after the Kickstarter, it's,

154
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.690
it's still money that I
sort of use every single

155
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.790
day. The bedrock. That's a
really good segue because you

156
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.640
say that there's an artistic
component, there's a programming component.

157
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.520
We now know that there
is a large logistical and

158
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.230
business. You're right. It's all,
it's about so much more

159
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.440
than just programming. When you
try to put programming in

160
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.950
kids' brains, you need to
teach them about systems and,

161
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.080
and what else do we
have to have them understand?

162
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.090
So I think the more
I've worked on, on this

163
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.490
whole Heller will be project.
The more I've realized that

164
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.140
I'm actually preparing kids for
a world where everything is

165
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.440
slowly turning into a computer.
And if a problem, to

166
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.410
some extent is starting to
be a computer science problem.

167
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.450
And, and when I say
to this, to people who

168
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.640
are not programmers, they are
like, Whoa, wow, that's a

169
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.520
bold statement. I'm like, Ooh.
Yeah. But when you think

170
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.160
about it, like we used
to have CDs and now

171
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.460
we have Spotify and we
used to have cash money.

172
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.710
And now we have all
sorts of apps to handle

173
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.580
our, our, our money and,
and so forth. Like one

174
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.490
by one, all of these
tangible, physical things are turning

175
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.900
into computers and software and
programming is one important component

176
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.810
of that, for sure. But
sometimes I feel like we're

177
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.950
so focused on the idea
of teaching kids, JavaScript or

178
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.330
Ruby or Python or whatever,
like the grammar of off

179
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.620
coding, and we forgot the
poetry part. And that's really

180
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.610
what matters. You did a
TEDx talk on the poetry

181
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.940
of programming. I'm curious, does
that have to do with

182
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.310
how you felt about Ruby
as being a very poetic

183
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.370
language or is that just
coincidence? It's a coincidence, but

184
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.430
it was also my first
programming, my first real programming

185
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.370
language. I had tried PHP
before when I was younger.

186
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.600
I, I don't know. I
think one of the things,

187
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.860
I mean, with the idea
that if we're teaching programming

188
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.740
as the first foreign language
for our kids, we should

189
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.160
be teaching poetry. Instead of
grammar lessons is the idea

190
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.840
that like code is a
way to express yourself and

191
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.220
solve problems. And, and in
some ways we take a

192
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.980
lot of that creativity out.
If we just teach kids

193
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.400
how to write an EFL
statement and, and rather we

194
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.600
should be teaching them to
bend and join and break

195
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.750
and sort of combined code
in new ways. And it's

196
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.860
as creative at all as
music or drawing or, or

197
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.580
words. Yeah. I like it
when people explain code in

198
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.810
ways that are not analytical
or not computational, like I'm

199
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.100
a big fan of the
word code smell, and you

200
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.640
know, like code smells bad.
And when I'm teaching my

201
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.230
children, I have an eight
year old and a 10

202
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.620
year old when I'm teaching
them words, we'll try to

203
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.530
tell them to think about
how does that word feel

204
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.500
in your mouth? You know
what I mean, does that

205
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.720
cause there's a poetic miss
to the words I was

206
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.210
trained to teach the eight
year old, some word and

207
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.900
the word mendacity came up.
So I had to go

208
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.540
and look up the word
mendacity and figure out what

209
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.460
it meant. It means untruthfulness.
So someone, the definition is

210
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.440
someone could be publicly castigated
for pastor mendacity. That means

211
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.740
you get yelled at for
lying. And now my eight

212
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.070
year old is running around
using these fancy words that

213
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.620
are really bigger than he
is, but he says that

214
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.950
they feel good in his
mouth. And when I think

215
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.220
about the poetry of, of
programming, you want someone to

216
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.680
be able to write a
program and then that program

217
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.260
should feel a certain way
and make the person feel

218
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.330
a certain way. Hmm, absolutely.
And when you think about

219
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.560
it, it's like, there are
very few other professions that

220
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.550
have such a vivid language
as, as programmers. Like we

221
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.460
have Troy and horses and
we have, we have all

222
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.570
of these very like vivid
and expressive and, and like

223
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.930
creative words that we come
up with and, and use

224
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.910
to describe the very abstract
world we live in. Hm,

225
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.950
absolutely. So you, you, your
project went big and then

226
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:50.100
now you have to deal
with parents, probably even nontechnical

227
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.760
parents. Did the, did the
direction that you thought this

228
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.950
was going to go change
or did the book end

229
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.380
up with what you did?
You write the book, you

230
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.930
thought you were going to
write? I think I wrote

231
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.300
the book. I was ready
to write at the time.

232
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.200
I remember asking a lot
of people, like when do

233
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.340
I know a book is
ready, except that the deadline

234
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.340
went already, like for you
months ago, four months ago,

235
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.600
someone told me that like
a book is, is who

236
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.570
you are at that given
time in your life. And,

237
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.270
and at that given moment,
I'm still really proud of

238
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.610
the book. I would probably
do a few things differently

239
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.610
nowadays, but I said it
before, like, I feel like

240
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.600
Hillary was always, for me
something way bigger than only

241
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.450
a book. I, I started
with the first book because

242
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.620
a book for me is
a campfire. It's our era,

243
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.530
where there is more computers
and tablets and many different

244
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.730
forms of distributing information like
podcasts. I still felt that

245
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.330
there's something very relevant with
a book, especially when you're

246
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.850
talking about kids who already
have a lot of screen

247
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.060
time in their lives, sort
of trying to explain these

248
00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:00.120
concepts with, with the old
fashioned world of books, but

249
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.330
already two years ago, I
had a pretty good idea

250
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.790
of what I'm going to
do next. And, and the

251
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.750
second book actually, which came
out this fall in, in

252
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.970
Finland. And I think next
year in, in U S

253
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.750
talks about computers and how
computers work. And then the

254
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.060
third book I think that
I'm working on right now

255
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.220
is, is about how internet
works. And I think I'm

256
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.310
going to do one on
how artificial intelligence works. It's

257
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:28.260
going to have Siri and,
and what's, and, and all

258
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.320
of those guys as characters
there. So I think the

259
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.860
book series has evolved further
as I'm, I'm seeing more

260
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.860
and more needs and things
that parents want to be

261
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.100
able to explain to their
kids At, at your website

262
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:46.560
at hello, ruby.com. You've also
got like online activities, but

263
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.650
is it still important to
have that physical hardcover children's

264
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.240
book that's on a shelf
somewhere? No, I Think so.

265
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.790
I'm of course like a
product of all of the

266
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.870
open source movement and, and
things that are like I've

267
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.450
grown up with on online
and, and all of the

268
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.570
activities on Heller, ruby.com are,
are things that you can

269
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.930
do without actually purchasing the
books. So I'm really happy

270
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.450
if someone just goes in
there and, and does them,

271
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.750
one of my favorites is
this activity where you can

272
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.480
build a computer out of
paper, and it's this very

273
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.750
sort of Japanese style, fun
looking, little computer. And you

274
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.990
put in your little CPU
and GPU and the REM

275
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.720
and the Roman, the hard
drive and, and so forth.

276
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.480
And you learn how, how
your little computer works. So,

277
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.210
so those kinds of arts
and crafts, kids, and parents,

278
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.820
or teachers can do together
or something that is very

279
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.720
important for me. So there's,
there's a, there's a, a

280
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.790
kinesthetic or a physical way
for this to, to be

281
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.610
in someone's life. You're not
necessarily in a flash game

282
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.040
online. You can go and
make your computer, your little

283
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.530
laptop out of paper, and
kids could do this in

284
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.230
a, in a kindergarten. Absolutely.
And, and one of my

285
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.140
big dreams is one day
to make like an art

286
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.110
exhibition where you could crawl
inside of a computer. And

287
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.550
instead of learn through tangible
play, how computers work from

288
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.490
sort of the, the electricity,
how it turns into bits

289
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.820
and the bits turn into
logic, Gates, and logic Gates

290
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.690
into components and hardware and
software and how it all

291
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.330
sort of fits together. And
I think that's what we're

292
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.800
talking about when we're talking
about teaching computer science for

293
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.490
everyone, because kids are very
different as learners. And, and

294
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.870
if we're serious about making
computer science, approachable and, and

295
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.570
accessible for different kinds of
kids, we need to teach

296
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.440
kids who best learned from
moving their bodies or who

297
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.700
best learned by singing out
loud things and, and so

298
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.930
forth and so forth so
that the methods need to

299
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:46.600
also arrive not only like
books or, or interactive online

300
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:52.150
exercises. Did you have experience
working with schools before you

301
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.000
started writing this book A
little bit? I used to

302
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.210
work at a company called
code Academy and, and we

303
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.210
would run a few pilots
with schools, but it would

304
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.930
be for kids were older.
And while I was working

305
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.990
on the first book, I,
I had this big infrastructures

306
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.270
in room for the longest
of times, like, who am

307
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.180
I to make this folk
end? I'm still learning to

308
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.670
program myself. And I don't
have a degree in early

309
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.710
childhood education, but something that
really calmed my thinking was

310
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.440
to, to bring kids to
the office every week. So,

311
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.170
so we would bring kids
to the office and do

312
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.420
sort of play testing with
them and ask them for

313
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.450
feedback and see how they
reacted with the books, with

314
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.620
the exercises. And, and, and
it's interesting to see how

315
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.430
similarly kids think throughout the
world. So the book has

316
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.210
been translated into 19 different
languages, and I think that

317
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.540
it's been most popular in,
in us and in, in

318
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.830
Japan, out of all places.
And I've been lucky enough

319
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.110
to visit Japan quite a
few times in the last

320
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.250
years and really see like
Japanese kids work on these

321
00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.180
exercises that I originally kind
of designed for Finnish or,

322
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.150
or like Western kids. And
it's really fun to see

323
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:08.600
how, how, how similarly kids
in the end think. Yeah,

324
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.430
that's interesting. That's what I
was going to ask. Cause

325
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.060
now you are translating this
into multiple languages and you'll

326
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.220
have a half dozen or
maybe a dozen languages at

327
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.880
some point, our, our kids,
just kids. Did we, did

328
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.030
you confirm that To some
extent kids are just kids.

329
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.480
I think the vocabulary of
computer science, especially for, for

330
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.610
English speaking countries, it's hard
to understand that the expressiveness

331
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.480
and the approachability of, of
the vocabulary in English is

332
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.770
like para, like it's amazing
in Japanese, my translator, who

333
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.650
was a part of the,
the Ruby community, she needed

334
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.560
to come up with new
ways of, of like on

335
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.440
your terms that didn't really
exist in the Japanese language

336
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.250
for the book and in
finish, like the word sequence

337
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.910
or the, the word decomposition.
Those are monster words that

338
00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.140
sound like very scary and
very frightening. So, so I'm,

339
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.350
I'm almost thinking that maybe
I shouldn't be translating the

340
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.090
vocabulary into other languages because
in the end, like English

341
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.410
is kind of a lingua
franca programming. Yeah. It is

342
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.080
interesting how English has that
has that role. I actually

343
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.380
wrote a blog post a
while back about how unfortunately

344
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.550
English is really almost required
for, to be a program

345
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.210
or at least to absorb
programming information online. I always

346
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.670
try to ask from Yuki
Hera Matsumoto, who is like

347
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.510
them, the father of Ruby.
Does he think that like

348
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.740
him being like Japanese and,
and talking Japanese influences a

349
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.860
lot of his language design
or influenced the design of

350
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.560
Ruby and, and maybe that's
why I found it so

351
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:47.120
approachable because it's, it's a
very like that, that he's

352
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.390
approached would be like a
non English approach. But he

353
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.190
said that he doesn't think
about that a lot of,

354
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.910
so, so probably not, I
don't know, but it's also

355
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.690
curious too, to see how
much culture affects programming languages

356
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:04.070
and coming from a small
Scandinavian country that is also

357
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.380
the home of Linux, get
my SQL S H IRC,

358
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.280
like all of these technologies
and Finland is 5 million people.

359
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.840
I can sort of help,
but wonder whether it's, it's

360
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:21.050
sort of our, it looks
very like social democratic mentality

361
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.480
of the society and the
idea that we do things

362
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.350
to help one another and
push like equity over excellence

363
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.500
and all of those ideas
that, that helped shape this

364
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.630
weird, like open source world.
It's interesting that you're saying

365
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.840
that it being Japanese didn't
affect his design that much.

366
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.350
Because when I think of
Ruby, I think of when,

367
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:47.620
when fluent API APIs and
APIs that looked like, look,

368
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.880
look like sentences started to
develop, perhaps that was DHHS.

369
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.560
Yeah. But yeah, I'm just
thinking that, like who, who

370
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.020
started that? Like let's string
it together. So it's a

371
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.700
big, long sentence, but maybe,
maybe, yeah. Oh, that's it.

372
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.990
That is interesting. So what
is next for, for Ruby?

373
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.290
You have, you're doing this
full time now, but it's

374
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.500
more than just, there's one
book there's books coming, you

375
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.390
said. Hmm. So there's, it's
definitely a trial at least.

376
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.240
And we're thinking a little
bit about classroom content and

377
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.080
how to create exercises for
teachers to just sort of

378
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.770
taking to the classroom and
teach these things unplugged. There's

379
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.370
this wonderful resource by teachers
all over the world. I

380
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.090
believe it's run by New Zealand
and Australia and teachers originally

381
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:41.100
called CS unplugged.org, which has
a lot of different games

382
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.820
and activities where you can
teach binary search for kids

383
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.820
for like a tag you're
it activity, or are all

384
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.970
of these like fun unplugged
physical activities that teach you

385
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.910
the basics of computer science.
But sometimes they are a

386
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.750
little bit hard for like
a non CS person to

387
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.710
get into or a noncompeting
person. And I'm trying to

388
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.310
design really for the total
beginner, like the kindergarten teacher

389
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.730
who actually fears computers a
little bit, or the element

390
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.380
elementary school teacher who is,
who thinks that coding is

391
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.710
scary. So, so trying to
think about how those teachers

392
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:22.320
could teach, prepare kids for
a world full of computers.

393
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.460
How far do you think
you can take this? Is

394
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.470
this, is this your life
for the next 20 years?

395
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.240
I definitely wish so I
have no rush out of

396
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.580
doing this. And I think
the more I do this,

397
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.960
the more I discover new
opportunities and things to work

398
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.170
on, I think eventually I
want to start my own

399
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.930
school. That would be like
a big dream for mine.

400
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.860
And really, like, I don't
even think I dare to

401
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.830
dream anymore because so many
of the things that I've

402
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.490
wished for have come true
in some form or another.

403
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.140
Yeah. Have you learned anything
from any of the children

404
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.140
who've read the book that
will influence the future for

405
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.900
you Every single day? I
feel like the kids are

406
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.490
the best teachers. I, I
have, they guide my product

407
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.450
development process and they give
me ideas of where to

408
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.750
take Ruby. Next. One of
my favorite stories is this

409
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.950
little girl who I asked
the kids at the English

410
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.670
school here in Helsinki to
define what technology is and

411
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.970
who uses technology. And what
is it used for? And

412
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.150
this little six year, nine
year old kid came to

413
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.070
me and she said, or
she wrote down on a

414
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:40.200
piece of paper, that technology
is electricity, that loves. So

415
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.340
technology is electricity that loves
and is used for play.

416
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.180
And I use it with
mom and we have a

417
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.640
conversation with WhatsApp application. And
then finally she said, people

418
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.240
use these technology. And I
think that was like one

419
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.690
of the most charming and
the most poetic ways of

420
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.470
defining technology that I've ever
heard. And just the fact

421
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.950
that she, she could understand
that people use this technology

422
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.520
is like the most profound
statement about technology made me

423
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.860
really happy about the future
generations. Well, it definitely says

424
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.070
that if the children learn
how to program, then you

425
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.120
know, human centered design is
really at the forefront because

426
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.630
I feel like sometimes the,
when the, when the really,

427
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.350
really technical techies get ahold
of technology, we, we get

428
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.980
software. That's not fun and
not human focused, but if

429
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.410
we can get more six
year olds doing it, there'll

430
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.470
be thinking about people and
they won't be, they won't

431
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.800
be jaded like we are
as old people. That's the

432
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.770
funny thing. I think everyone
starts their career in technology

433
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.910
with this sort of childlike
enthusiasm and, and the magic

434
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.980
that, that the amount of
magic you feel when you

435
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.640
get the computer to Aveo
will, it's just something that

436
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.030
I feel like everyone who
is being excited about technology

437
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.480
and computers remembers, but then
somehow we all lose it

438
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.120
at some point. And, and
we really need the kids

439
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.790
to remind us about how,
how exciting a field this

440
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.310
is and how much there
is still to do and

441
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:13.450
discover In schools right now,
in the, at least in

442
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.900
the U S we have
this phrase, reading, writing, and

443
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.960
arithmetic, like it's the three
RS, I don't know how

444
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.670
programming is going to fit
into that, but do you

445
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.130
think that programming needs to
be something that we start

446
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.410
teaching in kindergarten? And we
put it up there with

447
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.430
reading and writing and thinking
about computers To some extent.

448
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.370
Yeah, I think so. So
in Finland, what we did

449
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.000
just this fall is we
put programming as a mandatory

450
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.020
like school subject, but instead
of making it into a

451
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.880
school subject, we actually implemented
across, across the curriculum, meaning

452
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.510
that kids learn programming while
they are learning about English

453
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.940
or, or arts or social
sciences or biology. And, and

454
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.710
I think that's really the
way we should be teaching

455
00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:01.150
programming more as a problem
solving tool less as a,

456
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.680
as a discipline alone, because
after all programming is just

457
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.650
one tool for a computer
scientist or like any citizen

458
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:13.060
to solve problems, much like,
like, I dunno, like physicists

459
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.920
use a prism or, or
the biologist use a pipette,

460
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.240
like a programmer uses programming
as one tool of problem

461
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.920
solving. So I don't see
anything very interesting in that

462
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.560
the notion of just putting
programming into the core car,

463
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.160
where you can learn more
like the cross disciplinary approach

464
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.520
and, and sort of raising
kids who have like this

465
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:41.560
whole variety of different tools
that therapy be use. Yeah.

466
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.850
I, I had a woman
on the show a while

467
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.240
back named Kisho, who said
that we shouldn't teach kids

468
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.660
how to code. We should
teach them how systems work.

469
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.880
And I thought that was
really powerful. Like w when

470
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.020
something doesn't work, how does
your brain solve that problem?

471
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.090
Like, you know, even for
something like, you know, I

472
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.030
plugged a TV into a
DVD player and then something

473
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.730
didn't work and you have
to break down that system

474
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.330
into pieces and then figure
out where this thing fell

475
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.520
down. And some people find
that very intuitive and they

476
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.190
say, okay, is it the
cable? It's not the cable

477
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.890
is the power on, well,
is there power to the

478
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.620
house? Is there a switch
that controls the power? You

479
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.870
know, all of those things
that I think that techies

480
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.610
think are intuitive, regular people
don't know how do we

481
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.180
make sure that everyone can
be a techie? Yeah. And

482
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.430
it's, it's, it's kind of
like a broader set of

483
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.820
skills, like decomposing a problem,
or being able to spot

484
00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.440
patterns or like debug problems,
like, as you said, and,

485
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.670
and it really drives me
crazy when I have this

486
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.890
little girls who come to
me and say, Oh, Linda,

487
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.310
I'm not good at programming.
I, I forgot to send

488
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.200
me a call on from
this code. I'm like, yeah.

489
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.570
But like, even the best
programmers in the world, they

490
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:57.170
make mistakes every single day.
I promise you it's part

491
00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:01.920
of the persistency and side
of the Tenicity to, to

492
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:07.100
overgrow those come those problems.
So, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. There's

493
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.250
a, there's always every program
or every old programmer has

494
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:15.470
that joke about the a
million dollar. Semi-colon the one

495
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.170
that you have to just,
you know, you all stared

496
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.030
at it, then you've got
more and more and more

497
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.870
senior programmers to look for
the million dollar summer call.

498
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.400
And so, yeah. I don't
think that anyone should feel

499
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.580
bad about that at all.
That's so funny that people

500
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.310
would, you know, people get
it in their minds that

501
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.680
they're not good at something.
And it just takes a

502
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.690
moment and it's a virus
and we have to keep

503
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:41.230
that virus from getting root
inside them. Yeah. My, you

504
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.550
know, in the old days,
in the eighties, there was

505
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.910
a, a Barbie doll that
you would pull the string

506
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:53.360
and she would say math
is hard. Oh yeah. That's

507
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.150
so bad. And I think
the craziest thing is, is

508
00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.340
little girls. They don't know
that they are not supposed

509
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.040
to like programming. It's only
around, I think the age

510
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.470
of 10 to tell that
they really start to define

511
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.220
themselves. And before that little
girls, they are really inquisitive

512
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.450
and they ask questions and
they can concentrate well, and

513
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.100
they have all of the
skills to become a programmer.

514
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.330
Exactly. Exactly. And even my,
in my eight year old

515
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:21.920
boy is already starting to
get the sense that maybe

516
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.440
math is hard and math
isn't for him. And he,

517
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.870
they just, they self select.
And I don't like that.

518
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.820
I don't like, Oh, I
can't do this. It's too

519
00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.360
hard because he thinks he
should know it out of

520
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.350
the box. Like, like he
should come knowing this. I'm

521
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.090
like, well, no, you're going
to get it wrong. So

522
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.270
when did we, when did
we make it? So mistakes

523
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.820
turned people away. And then
they only went to their

524
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:51.280
strengths as opposed to working
on their weaknesses. How do

525
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.160
you, how did you write
the book such that was

526
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.140
it just for girls or
boys can read this book

527
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.910
and it's gender nonspecific. It's
ginger nonspecific. I wrote the

528
00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.490
book with the idea that
I wish there was a

529
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.730
book like this when I
was growing up. So, but

530
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.300
it doesn't exclude boys. And
rather, like one of the

531
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.450
most exciting things for me
has been to say in

532
00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.610
Japan, like little voice, come
to me and say that

533
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.760
their favorite character is Ruby.
And that makes me really

534
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.070
happy and proud because I
think that's the future of

535
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.190
the world where little six
year old boys can say

536
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.280
that their hero hero is,
is like a little girl

537
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.340
who codes or programs or
solves problems. And that's what

538
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.000
star Wars is doing with
Ray and, and other characters.

539
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.360
But I, I think it's
almost more important that little

540
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.180
boys can see girls as
role models, then that girls

541
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:43.800
have Gayle role models, but
both are important. And then

542
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.710
hopefully in a few years
when these little boys and

543
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.400
girls are grown up and
become programmers, they'll put together

544
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.330
great, great looking groups of
people from all walks of

545
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.380
life and they'll make software
for everybody. Well, thank you

546
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.200
so much, Linda Lucas for chatting
with me today about hello,

547
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.800
Ruby and people can find
that at hello, ruby.com. It's

548
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.170
been so nice to talk
to you. Thank you for

549
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.560
having me. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

550
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.820
we'll see you again next
week.
