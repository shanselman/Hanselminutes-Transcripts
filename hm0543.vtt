weekly discussion with web developer

9
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.720
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan mounting show number

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.450
543. In this episode, Scott
talks with Daphne Chong about

11
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.020
becoming a more social developer.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

12
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.750
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. We're talking

13
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.630
with Daphne Chung. She is
a longtime tech lead and

14
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.360
developer. How are you? I'm
great. Thank you, Scott. How

15
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.600
are you? I'm lovely. And
you're calling me from Australia

16
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.970
and I appreciate you dealing
with all the time zones.

17
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.440
It is a bit tricky
with the West coast. Yeah.

18
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.420
It's like 17 hours in
the past or something. I

19
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.950
don't know where you are
for the future or the

20
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.080
past right now, but I
appreciate your time When I

21
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330
know what's going to happen
tomorrow. Just give me a

22
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.120
call. So we met at
NDC this conference in Sydney

23
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.420
a while back, and we
had a really great chat

24
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.690
and like really good chats.
It felt like the kind

25
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.380
of thing that you wanted
to record. So, you know,

26
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.570
I wish I could just,
you know, have a great

27
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.340
chat and go, Oh, I'm
going to suddenly make that

28
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.480
chat a podcast, but I
can't always, but I am

29
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.480
fortunate enough to talk to
you again. And the topic

30
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.620
that we were thinking about
was this idea of personal

31
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.330
development, but not just personal
development, kind of continuous personal

32
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.320
development, always thinking about how
to improve yourself, particularly in

33
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.190
the, in the space of
being a better developer. Yeah.

34
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.430
I, it's something that I
really like to kind of

35
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.490
do set goals for myself
and try to think about

36
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.890
what I'm going to learn
next. And I think as

37
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.360
developers, you've kind of got
to always be constantly learning

38
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.020
something because what you're working
on now will probably not

39
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.030
be the same in another,
you know, three or five

40
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.340
years. And I always just
think it's really good to

41
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.490
think about what's next you
actually want to do and

42
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.800
give it a go. Is
it something that you have

43
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.500
to do consciously? Or is
this something that's innate? Is

44
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.780
it built in, I mean,
are we always improving without

45
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.670
doing anything about it? I
don't feel that way. I

46
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.380
always to put in some
conscious effort, I think when

47
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.080
you look around at other
people, it always feels like

48
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.190
there's, everyone's smarter than you.
You know, it looks like

49
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.150
there's always people achieving all
these great things. And I

50
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.790
think if you are willing
to invest sort of small

51
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.620
steps to improve or change
your skills or what you

52
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.380
do, you can kind of
get to the same places

53
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.250
where they are. And that's
not something that's really obvious,

54
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.470
you know, it's not, it's
not obvious. You've got to

55
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.470
think about specifically, I'm taking
conscious steps to kind of

56
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.810
do things like that. Why
does it feel though, like

57
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.570
not to get to imposter
syndrome, but it feels like

58
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.360
everyone around me is smarter,
you know? And it's just

59
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.330
like, I'm just making it
up as I go along.

60
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.290
You know, I don't, I
feel like I'm constantly having

61
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.420
to learn just to catch
up. Yeah. I think everybody

62
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.610
is going to be skillset.
Everybody is good at and

63
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.890
skillset that everybody needs to
improve on. And it's always

64
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.380
kind of daunting to start
wherever it is that you,

65
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.500
you go and you kind
of need to think about

66
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.290
what, what do you do?
Well, there's going to be

67
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.630
things that you help you
are really good at at

68
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.780
doing. So you might be
really good at explaining things

69
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.410
to people, or you might
be really good at, you

70
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.720
know, taking a framework and
deeply kind of digging into

71
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.340
it and understanding how it
works and the ways that

72
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.830
you're going to learn different
skills are going to depend

73
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.640
how, how well you do
things currently. So if you're

74
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.640
really good at details, you
know, you, you might need

75
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.550
a really solid block of
time to just sit down

76
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.370
with a new technology or
a new thing and, you

77
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.560
know, dive deeply into how
it works. But if you're

78
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.590
much more good at kind
of working with things on

79
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.500
the fly, you know, you
could hear an explanation about

80
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.930
some new tech from somebody,
go read a blog post

81
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.000
and you're like, Oh cool.
I understand how that's gonna

82
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.450
work. And I think that's
just gonna be different for

83
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.250
everybody. And so, you know,
me personally, I don't, I

84
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.940
don't read things off blogs
and then go, yeah, cool.

85
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.130
I understand how that works.
You know, I need to

86
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.890
actually sort of sit down
and play with something we're

87
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.550
actually go through probably a
more structured kind of seeing

88
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.250
like a tutorial or a,
some kind of book that

89
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.000
explains it, really aspects of
these things are. And that's

90
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.130
how I feel like I
learn best. So I try

91
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.440
to make sure that when
I'm picking up something new,

92
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.830
I'm doing it that way
rather than trying to learn

93
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.290
a different way, which won't
be as successful for me.

94
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.140
And that will mean that
I will not feel like

95
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.450
I'm, you know, I'll feel
like a little bit, like

96
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.480
I have not learned this
well or failed at learning

97
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.580
this well, when in fact
I just didn't set myself

98
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.910
up to try and learn
in the best way that

99
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.300
I can. Right. And it
seems like it's also important

100
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.920
to remember that everyone in
tech is always learning like

101
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.400
five years ago, I was
doing, you know, dot net

102
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.640
2.0 or whatever in five
years before that it was

103
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.980
common D common C plus
plus, and five years before

104
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.460
that it was Pascal. So
what I learned in school

105
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.900
from a language and computers
perspective is completely obsolete at

106
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.420
this point. So like you
said, what am I good

107
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:23.410
at? Right. Yeah, totally. Right.
You know, there's, there's going

108
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.220
to be, what what's important
is that you learn how

109
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.900
you learn or learn how
to learn. And that's going

110
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.270
to set you up for
the next sort of 10,

111
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.540
20, 30 years of your
career, because people are going

112
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.230
to your skills on how
to, how to learn, how

113
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.350
to pick up things are
valued, not what, you know,

114
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.560
specifically what you currently know,
cause that won't be applicable

115
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.070
when yeah. Five years. It
seems like there's, there's, there's

116
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.860
different levels at which people
kind of interview. At two,

117
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.780
I had a friend who
is a long time, she's

118
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.300
sharp developer. And they went
and interviewed at a big

119
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.670
Ruby on rails shop. And
I was like, what are

120
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.190
you, how is that even
like possible? Let's just like,

121
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.500
you know, you speak French.
Why are you interfering in

122
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.830
Spain? And they were like,
well, no, they just wanted

123
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.840
to know how, you know,
my thoughts on architecture, my

124
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.560
thoughts on debugging and whether
I could explain things and

125
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.640
you know, how I think,
and they weren't worried about

126
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.370
the language. And I thought
to myself, you don't really

127
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.830
hear that a lot. People
feel that they need to

128
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.710
be experts before they go
and apply for they go

129
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.680
and get a, get a
job. Yeah. I think that's

130
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.650
great, you know, employees that
interview like that are fantastic

131
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.610
because they're kind of looking
more at what's your, your

132
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.710
experience where, you know, what
are your opinions that have

133
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.380
led you to kind of
hear so much more kind

134
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.540
of a general overview about
you then? Yeah. Okay. Specifically,

135
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.760
do you know what this
framework does when you put

136
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.920
it under these conditions? And
if you don't fail, we

137
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.120
don't want to, you know,
don't want to talk to

138
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.320
you. So I, you know,
it's great. It's great. When

139
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.480
people kind of look a
bit more at the wider

140
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.530
picture about you and your
skills. Right, right. Don't this

141
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.780
isn't jeopardy. I don't want
to be, I don't want

142
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.380
you asking me trivia questions
about Python. You know, I

143
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.180
want to know if you
want to, if you care

144
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.750
about how I learn and
you have to learn how

145
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.270
you learn, like, are you
a kinesthetic learner or are

146
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.320
you an auditory learner? Yeah.
Yes, actually. That's great. That

147
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.880
is, yeah. That's a great
point because I always like,

148
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.860
if I can hear somebody
saying something to me, I'll

149
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.970
recall that much better than,
you know, other people who

150
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.150
might have to yeah. Do
it. I actually wasn't sure.

151
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.620
What was the first term
you used Kinesthetic, you know,

152
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.850
like kinetic and how do
you know, can you touch

153
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.750
things and can you feel
things? Oh, that's great. Yeah.

154
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:59.310
Yeah. Kinesthetic learning is like
carrying out physical activities rather

155
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.270
than doing lectures and watching
demonstrations. Like today I was

156
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.450
putting together something with my
nephew, an eight or fruit

157
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.590
electronics project. And I had
to keep catching myself too.

158
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.140
I was doing the, like
screwing in the screws and

159
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.030
you know, doing the soldering
and I would, I would

160
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.030
just have to stop and
say, he may not be

161
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.610
learning because I'm doing it.
So I had to, like,

162
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.020
I would do one screw
and then I would hand

163
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.480
it to him. You know
what I mean? Cause I

164
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.680
don't know how he learns.
Yeah. Yeah. And the same

165
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.180
thing in development. I think
you, you always remember gotchas

166
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.030
in software or languages when
you've had to go and

167
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.420
fix the bug that, you
know, was there, if someone

168
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.910
else told you yeah, I
fixed it by changing this,

169
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.510
you know, like, Oh cool.
But you know, you always

170
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.850
remember that boat like 10
years ago that, that you

171
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.820
fixed. Cause I spent three
days hunting it down. Yeah,

172
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.920
yeah. Yeah. So you have
to you're you're telling me

173
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.240
that you have to figure
out what it is that

174
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.090
you know how to do
well. And that sometimes means

175
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.220
you're just sit down and
think about that. Like you

176
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.220
should almost schedule time to
think about how you learn.

177
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.030
You can't just come up
with this spontaneously. Yeah, yeah.

178
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.990
Or, you know, kind of
experiment and say, all right,

179
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.130
I'd like to learn Ruby.
Maybe this week, I'll try

180
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.530
reading a book about Ruby
or, and next week I'll

181
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.380
try doing a tutorial about
Ruby and the week after,

182
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.080
maybe I'll go to a
user group and hear somebody

183
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.580
talk about, you know, Ruby
and whichever one of those

184
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.180
sort of works more for
you. You can go, okay,

185
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.480
this is a way that
I seem to be picking

186
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.660
up things or, you know,
you, you, you just try

187
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.210
bashing it out and going
to stack overflow. And whenever

188
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.780
you get stuck on a
problem. And I think all

189
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.190
of those things sort of
tell you a little bit

190
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.950
about what's gonna work best
for you. And you can

191
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.280
just apply that to things
in future that you'll want

192
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.980
to pick up as well.
So Python next month or

193
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.840
next year or whatever. Yeah.
Doesn't that require maybe a

194
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.500
level of confidence to say,
I don't know something like

195
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.260
you and I have been
doing this for many years.

196
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.410
Right. We have many decades
between us, but I suspect

197
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.030
that both of us could
say like we could show

198
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.470
up at a user group
and say, I don't know

199
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.230
anything about Ruby. I know
nothing like, and we would

200
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.650
be okay with that, but
it, beginner might be nervous

201
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.610
that by doing that, they're
going to expose themselves. That

202
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.780
is extremely true. And I
think, you know, there's a

203
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:32.480
line where people kind of
have to just take a

204
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.400
bit of a leap of
faith. And I know, you

205
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.970
know, me personally for many
years, I never really felt

206
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.200
like I wanted to participate
in things like that because

207
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.080
I felt like, you know,
I don't know enough. I

208
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.270
don't, I'm not on the
same level as these people,

209
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.740
I would go to user
groups and I would be

210
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.290
really quiet. I would just
observe what was going on.

211
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.630
And I really felt brave
enough to want to contribute

212
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:02.050
to anything there. I still
do not have a stack

213
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.020
of a flow profile where
I've answered, you know, questions.

214
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.570
Cause that's still something that
I feel like I can

215
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:13.300
improve on. But I think
if you find a way

216
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.090
that works for you in
terms of learning and it

217
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.370
w you know, you can
see progress. I think that's

218
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.100
a really great sort of
feedback loop for you. You

219
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.810
can feel like you're improving
on something. And for me,

220
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.450
the kind of way I,
I felt like I started

221
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.250
to learn or started to
kind of open up to

222
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:37.630
things was actually about blogging.
So I started writing a

223
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.850
few posts about different things
that I was just working

224
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.300
on and experimenting with. And
I didn't do that until

225
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.760
I was 30. And so
there's, there's like a whole,

226
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.090
like five, 10 years of
development work that I had

227
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.570
done previously that I had
no public voice or record

228
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.980
on. And even in it
sort of a few years

229
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.070
since then, I feel like
I've made quite a lot

230
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.160
of change in how I
approach and how, how open

231
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.450
I am. And that's actually
given me a lot more

232
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.970
opportunities in future to kind
of deal with things. For

233
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.140
example, being on a podcast,
talking to you, which is

234
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.080
not something that I would
have done if I had

235
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:22.390
just continued to be not
open to taking chances and

236
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:28.410
learning. Yeah, yeah. Somewhat insular.
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. I'm

237
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.230
happy that I can look
back on 15 years plus

238
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.290
of blogging and say, gosh,
even more than that and

239
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.080
say, look, this is, I
can Google myself, you know,

240
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.820
and I can find someone
like a diner and I

241
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.770
can say, Oh wow, I
can't pull it out. But

242
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.360
Google myself, not myself, like
in an ego way, but

243
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.270
Google myself, like, wow, what
was I doing in 1998?

244
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.120
What was I doing in
2002 from a technical perspective?

245
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.890
You know, so, okay. So
you, you started to force

246
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.290
yourself to learn. You started
to go out there and

247
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.630
be open to new things.
So for you, the first

248
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.780
step was going from being
kind of a, a regular

249
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.600
day job programmer to a
day job programmer with a

250
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:12.960
blog. Where'd you go from
there? I think actually the

251
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.090
big driver for me was
I wanted to, well, it's

252
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.650
always kind of about this,
but I wanted to be

253
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.390
able to get jobs easier.
I want it to yeah.

254
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.570
Get the next job more
easily than I had because

255
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.460
I, you know, I knew
I was, I was a

256
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.990
good developer. I had enough
skills on my CV to

257
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.220
be qualified for interviews, but
sometimes I would submit, and

258
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.560
I wouldn't hear back from
companies that actually wanted to

259
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.310
work for. And I thought,
okay, you know, there's more

260
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.040
to me than these two
pages that are on my

261
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.790
CV or my resume that
people are getting. So what

262
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.140
can I do to actually
sort of get my authentic

263
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.830
voice out there? And so
the blog was one thing.

264
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.660
And then I started actually
going to more meetup groups

265
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.790
just to kind of get
exposed to different sort of

266
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.250
tech, but actually sort of
talking to people there, you

267
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:12.140
know, making a few connections
with people, learning a bit

268
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:17.120
about what they were working
on and I'm going to

269
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.850
hackathons as well, which I
always find really fun. And

270
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.000
it's a really, you know,
a weekend and you kind

271
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.190
of build something and you
learn a new piece of

272
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.980
tech that you never would
have before. And it's always

273
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.020
great to see what people
can achieve in that time.

274
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:36.020
So I found them really
inspiring, but the kind of

275
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.240
doing these and then actually
blogging about them as well,

276
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.640
gave me a bit more
surface area, You know, that's,

277
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.530
I liked that. You said
that because a lot of

278
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.000
times I'll talk to people
and they'll say, how do

279
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.910
you find topics? I don't
have anything to say. And

280
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.070
I keep thinking to myself,
well, it's not about you

281
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.220
making a declarative statement about
a technology all the time.

282
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.880
It's about your experiences. And
if you go to a

283
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.450
hackathon and you build something,
then you have the right

284
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.270
to talk about it. And
that's your opinion and your

285
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.850
viewpoint and your experience in
the, your experience is valid.

286
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.000
Therefore it can, there's a
potential talk or a YouTube

287
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.700
video or a podcast or
whatever. Like there's so much

288
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.240
quote, unquote content being created
by you just waking up

289
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.090
in the morning and billing
stuff. Absolutely. That's a really

290
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.380
important point that you've made,
you know, it's no one

291
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.140
can challenge you on, on
your experience. It's kind of

292
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:32.500
experience versus expertise. You know,
that, that was my massive

293
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.940
realization. I think that I,
I had a voice, you

294
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.180
know, I could contribute something
that, that was my experience

295
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.670
that someone else might find
useful because there's always going

296
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.470
to be people who are
going to find what you've

297
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.860
done. They will be in
the same boat, but at

298
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.990
some point, you know, there
may be like, Oh, Hey,

299
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.660
I'm trying to learn Ruby
as well. Oh, look, someone's

300
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.150
written a blog post about
how they got on board

301
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.890
with doing something in Ruby
and someone will find your

302
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.820
fat, your outfit valuable. And
I think you just need

303
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:12.790
to assume that you put
your voice out there. Even

304
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.520
if that, that owned, there
was only one other person

305
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.560
who might find that valuable.
If that one other person

306
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.640
who is actually your future
employer, that's a win for

307
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:29.020
you. And that's, I think
particularly for me, after doing

308
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.350
a bit more sort of
involvement in community and in

309
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.250
hackathons and things like that,
I actually started to help

310
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.130
run a user group in
Sydney called women who code.

311
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.910
And that's been a really
fantastic thing for me for

312
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.360
the last couple of years.
There's a group of sort

313
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.360
of now five of us
who were running different, different

314
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.910
workshops every sort of month.
In fact, we're now probably

315
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.940
up to two a month
on different technologies, but it's

316
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.160
just fun to be able
to have a regular way

317
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.950
to meet up with people
who are in industry, who

318
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.830
are similar to you, you
know, who are like you,

319
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.610
I mean, for you, obviously
there aren't that many women

320
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.590
in tech in a lot
of different places and we

321
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.460
can improve those numbers, but
it gave me so much

322
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.100
confidence to actually feel like
I belonged to a group,

323
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.090
you know, and that's not
necessarily going to be for

324
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.030
everyone else. Your group might
be a really group or

325
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.270
Python group or a, you
know, kind of data kind

326
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.370
of thing. But if you
find your group, if you

327
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.100
find a group of people
who are doing similar things

328
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.280
to you and keen to
learn similar things to you,

329
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:39.960
that's going to be so
helpful and feedback, you know,

330
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.450
and even just like, Oh
yeah. You know, tell me

331
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.400
about what you just learned,
because that sounds really interesting.

332
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.810
And I might go and
want to do that too.

333
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.940
So, you know, the network
and the support is great

334
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.920
And w and the group
can be whatever aspect of

335
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.520
your life you find the
most important or whatever tribe

336
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.820
that you're looking for, that
you find those welcoming, right?

337
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.330
It could be data scientists,
or it could be people

338
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.720
of color, or it could
be diabetics, right? Like I

339
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.030
have a tribe of people
that are diabetics that are

340
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.750
always working on, on a
hardware to solve diabetes problems.

341
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.720
I met a really interesting
person who is working on,

342
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.760
I actually had him on
the show. He was, he

343
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.240
had a brother who had
a neuro disorder, so he

344
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.030
could only move the computer
with his eyes. So he,

345
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.310
he made a whole system
to do that. And there's

346
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.260
a tribe of people out
there that are interested in

347
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.250
what you have to say.
So whether it's indigenous people

348
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.580
or whether it's big data,
like pick your tribe and

349
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.490
be welcomed. And if you,
if you initially go out

350
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.980
and find a group and
you are welcomed, well, darn

351
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.140
it, there's a group out
there that will Wilson, you

352
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:49.760
know, I mean, it's kind
of a part of learning

353
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.920
as well, and that not
everything you try is going

354
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.220
to be successful the first
time. And you need to,

355
00:19:54.830 --> 00:20:00.170
yeah. You just need to
remember that people like John

356
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.180
skeet, who, who are there,
you know, he's the number

357
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.880
one contributor on stack overflow.
He had to start somewhere.

358
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.820
Everybody starts from somewhere and
persistence is just as important

359
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:15.260
as kind of execution. So
you started with the blog

360
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.170
and then doing meetup groups,
how did you then start

361
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.850
your own group? That seems
like another leap. I actually

362
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.560
helped to take it over
from a couple of other

363
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.340
women who had started up
the group a few months

364
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.800
before we actually took it
over. Cause they both went

365
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.720
to America, which was fantastic.
So there was kind of

366
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.580
already a bit of a
framework there for us to

367
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.790
just sort of step in
and, and, and run with.

368
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.380
But in terms of, you
know, that was great for

369
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.150
me. Cause I went a
whole bunch of other things

370
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.090
I hadn't before, like how
to organize meetups on a

371
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:57.220
monthly basis, what kind of
things we need. And just

372
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.090
even really rewarding, kind of
seeing people getting stuck into

373
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.020
coding who may not have
done it before. And that

374
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.970
kind of made me realize
that I was actually quite

375
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.950
interested in education and learning
how people learn. Cause if

376
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.590
you run sort of tutorials
for different things, you can

377
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.500
see what works and what
doesn't and how we can

378
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.130
optimize things to make it
really good for those people,

379
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:28.150
different people. And that actually
I ran a few groups

380
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.530
tutorials there in, in women
who code and that actually

381
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.520
sort of woke up a
bit of a different bug

382
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.360
in me, which was actually
public speaking. Cause you know,

383
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.520
there's a lot of other,
a lot of other people

384
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.220
who are out there who
like to talk about their

385
00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.280
work. And I never envisaged
myself as being someone who

386
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.110
would want to go up
on stage in front of

387
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.190
everybody to talk about something
I would work on. But

388
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.950
I actually got a really
good opportunity through a group

389
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.120
called Yow in Australia. They
run conferences in many different

390
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.940
cities throughout the year and
they noticed the diversity of

391
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.150
their speakers. Wasn't great. And
they really wanted more female

392
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:16.750
speakers. So they ran a
competition to help train or

393
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:22.720
find and train 10 people,
10 women to come in

394
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:27.100
for a one day speaking
training course with someone who,

395
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.890
who with Damien Conway, she
is a, a big person

396
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.730
in the poker community, but
he also runs workshops on

397
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.260
how to give technical presentations.
And that was hugely valuable.

398
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.080
I found that really great.
I learned so much from

399
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.570
that day because you had
to prepare a short talk

400
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.910
and actually present it and
you've got to watch everybody

401
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:55.030
else do the same thing.
And that, that was a

402
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.580
sort of a turning point
for me going okay, you

403
00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.080
know, or you can see
where everybody else is kind

404
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.140
of starting from and where
they're trying to get to

405
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.830
all that sort of costs
or all that's required from

406
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.350
this point. It's kind of
like effort and practicing and

407
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:12.070
kind of getting there. He,
he actually, sorry, just to

408
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.710
point out, he's got a
YouTube video of that presentation

409
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.520
called instantly better presentations. And
I highly recommend if you're

410
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.800
a technical person, then you're
looking to work out how

411
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.840
to present things. That's really
valuable video to watch. That's

412
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.310
cool. I'll find that out.
I'll put that in the

413
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.870
show notes. Tiny, tiny side
question was that I think

414
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.670
that's really cool though. Not
just to say, Hey, we

415
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.460
need more, you know, women's
speakers, we need more, you

416
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.680
know, different kinds of different
folks, you know, different folks

417
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.200
with different voices, but to
say, and we'll give you

418
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.400
training. And I think that's
pretty cool. Was that comfortable

419
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.220
though? Or was that okay
to have just coincidentally for

420
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.070
whatever, I mean, Damien's a
legend, but to have a

421
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.070
guy presenting on how to
present to a bunch of

422
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.720
women, would it have been
helpful to have a woman

423
00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.280
helping or did that matter?
Oh, I, it didn't matter

424
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.850
to me personally, you know,
the industry of grades. Yeah.

425
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.110
As long as it is,
you know, it's someone, who's

426
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.510
got something to say and
something to contribute and to

427
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.960
be open and willing to
actually help male or female.

428
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.030
It just happened to be
that they were running this

429
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:21.550
workshop for female speakers. And
I think it's great that

430
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.930
they did it in the
first place. Anyway. I mean

431
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.500
they covered, covered costs. It
was brilliant gesture to kind

432
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.320
of make. So I was
really grateful to y'all and

433
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.000
what they did as a
result of that was say,

434
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.760
Hey, cool, we're now going
to give you a series

435
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.570
of three talks in Sydney,
Melbourne and Brisbane, as well

436
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:43.000
as presentations. So, so could
you please, you know, come

437
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.680
up with something and I
ended up presenting on a

438
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.420
system I had been working
on at work, which is

439
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:54.760
a new video transcoding system
for the ABC Australian broadcasting

440
00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.080
corporation. And that was, that
was really great. I really

441
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.590
enjoyed kind of doing that
series. And I also enjoyed

442
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.210
kind of working on that
system. So it was a

443
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.410
big confluence of all things
that tied up together. So

444
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.540
at that point, then you've
got the bug, right? You've

445
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:15.010
given presentations in three different
cities and now you go

446
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:19.540
and submit your name to
other conferences. You've got a

447
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.390
CD that not only has
lots of experience, but also

448
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.180
user group running and a
blog. And now you've spoken.

449
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.900
So now you're on the
speaker circuit basically. Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.130
And to me, international speaker.
No, I see. It's so

451
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.320
funny because out of your
mouth, the way you say

452
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.290
that, that sounds way more
impressive than to me where

453
00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.450
I'm like, all these people
had to give me all

454
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:46.490
these opportunities to stop speaking
up because for, yeah. It's,

455
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.810
it's so true. I think
even just this conversation has

456
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.900
just totally clarified that for
me. Yeah. Because you know,

457
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.370
the way you, the way
you say that, the way

458
00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.720
that sounds, it's just, yeah,
it is not how I

459
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.230
would describe it. And for
NDC, where I met you

460
00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:06.190
last week, you know, someone
had to encourage me to

461
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:11.770
actually submit that, talk to
the agenda. And I tell

462
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:16.450
you though, there's, there's a
big difference though, between like

463
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:21.190
giving someone something like here
is a talk, everything is

464
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.310
handled. You just need to
show up versus giving someone

465
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.410
an opportunity, which is like,
Hey, there's a door over

466
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.410
there. I've stuck my foot
in it. Would you go

467
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.940
and kick it open for
me? You know what I

468
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.940
mean? Yeah. As a friend
of mine who I've known

469
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:38.980
for freaking 20 years, and
she's just a brilliant developer

470
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.950
and I've worked with her
many, many years and she

471
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.330
now works for the government.
And then when I was

472
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.290
the chair of Oz con
she, her name, Kathy Lee,

473
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.110
she does some really amazing
work for the government. And

474
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.020
I said, you should do
a talk at OSCON. And

475
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.820
she was like, Oh no,
you know, there's just no

476
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.330
way. And I was like,
no, you should do this.

477
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.600
You're, you're awesome. You're amazing.
And you should do this

478
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.590
talk. And from my perspective
that, that right there, that

479
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.920
was the extent of my
involvement. Right. And she gave

480
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.590
that talk and she kicked
that talks, but it was

481
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.140
awesome. It was fantastic. You
know what I mean? And

482
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.360
she came back, she came
back later, very appreciative, but

483
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.520
I did nothing. Like, I've
just told you what I

484
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.470
did. You know what I
mean? You can do it,

485
00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.580
head that direction. People should
give themselves more credit. Yes,

486
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.200
Absolutely. And even what you
did though, is just give

487
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.590
her a little bit of
confidence, just a little shove

488
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:41.900
off the cliff. I think
I have found, you know,

489
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.790
doing a lot of things
in, in groups has been

490
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.770
really helpful for, for that,
you know, kind of like

491
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.580
building up confidence because if
you don't feel like you're

492
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.430
alone, then you know, so
much easier to kind of,

493
00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.100
or even admit that you
don't know something or that

494
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.300
you need help for something
like one thing that I've

495
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.640
actually found as well with
this, this whole learning thing

496
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.600
is I've done been in
a few study groups where

497
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.060
we as a group, there's
a bunch of people who

498
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.840
decide they want to learn
something. And they're great because

499
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.240
no one's saying, Hey, I
am the expert. You know,

500
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.730
I will teach you. It's
all these people saying, all

501
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.770
right, we don't know what
we don't know this, but

502
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.750
we, we all want to
learn how to do it.

503
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.010
And we set aside time
every week to meet up

504
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.670
and do a bunch of
exercises or, you know, an

505
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.550
assignment if you like, it's
a little bit like a

506
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.480
self arranged class, but at
the end of the course,

507
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.170
you have looked back and
realized, Hey, I learned know

508
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.290
I just learned JavaScript. Or
I just learned a bunch

509
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.530
of data structures and algorithms
that I didn't know very

510
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.050
well before. And those are
both study groups that I've

511
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.850
participated in or run. And
that's been hugely valuable because

512
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.300
people, people are coming here
admitting that they, they want

513
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.850
to learn and they don't
know. And that's totally okay.

514
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.700
There is no expert there
and that's been really good

515
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.480
for support as well, generally,
You know, and calling it

516
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.090
back to the beginning where
you were talking about the

517
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.870
different ways that people learn.
I think that developers think

518
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.190
that there's user groups and
there's conferences, you know, and

519
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.370
you pointed out that there's
study groups and there's pair

520
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.880
programming and there's, you know,
Skyping with friends in another

521
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.540
country and sharing your screen.
And paraprogramming, and I recently

522
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.400
learned that there's a thing
called mob programming, having like

523
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.620
10 people in a room,
all programming on the same

524
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.140
thing. And you take turns
on the keyboard. Like, I

525
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.930
didn't know that was a
thing, but then someone someone's

526
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.880
going to discover that not
only is it a thing,

527
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.530
but it's the thing that
absolutely like turn the light

528
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.440
on for them. So there's,
there's other opportunities out there

529
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.570
than just going to user
groups and listening to people

530
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:55.050
talk. Yes, always, always. I
think that that's a very

531
00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.860
excellent point that, you know,
it's not just conferences and

532
00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.650
meetups. There's so many other
ways to kind of learn

533
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.710
even stack overflow, I think
is great. If you, if

534
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.170
you know a little bit
about a particular piece of

535
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:11.790
technology or framework or something,
you can answer questions from

536
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:17.130
people who are looking for
help and that's going to

537
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.230
help you feel, Hey, cool.
You know, I do know

538
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.520
a little bit about this
or if you don't know,

539
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.920
Hey, you, you might go
and research about what it

540
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.710
is so you can help
them answer the question. And

541
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.530
now you suddenly learn more
than you knew before they're

542
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.390
doing a talk or something
like that takes a lot

543
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.660
of prep, but answering a
stack overflow question might only

544
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.360
be like 10 minutes of
your time, half an hour

545
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.780
of your time, But it's,
so it takes a lot

546
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.050
of prep, but it sounds
like you particularly to accomplish

547
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.500
these things kind of committed
to a goal and basically

548
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.950
assigned yourself some deadlines. Yes.
I've got this phrase I

549
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.760
love, which is called deadline
driven development. And I think

550
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.010
a lot of people probably
suffer from this as well.

551
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.730
If you just say, yeah,
cool. I would really like

552
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.330
to learn Ruby. I'll just
get around to reading that

553
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.660
book or that blog post
later, you know, you're not

554
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.060
going to get there. Whereas
if you set yourself a

555
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.560
goal and be like, all
right, I am going to

556
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.050
go and give a talk
at my local user group

557
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:17.790
about Ruby in two months.
That means I have to

558
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.610
go and learn how to
do it, work out what

559
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.740
I want to put in
the talk, you know, so

560
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.080
I'm ready to actually give
that talk. And I think

561
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.510
the study groups were actually
fantastic for that because you've

562
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:31.800
got a weekly thing that
you can't can't shift, that's

563
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.450
it, that's the time and
date that you're meeting up

564
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.990
every week. And so if
you haven't done your work

565
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.300
by then, then you, you
miss out, it's kind of

566
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.570
an opportunity that, that you
are missing out on rather

567
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:46.860
than someone judging you on.
So yeah, I, I deadlines.

568
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.970
I try to set myself
goals personally. I kind of

569
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.910
try and do one sort
of every year. So 2016

570
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.730
is my year of public
speaking. 2015 was my year

571
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.980
of, of kind of working
out more about algorithms and

572
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:04.410
data structures. 2014 was JavaScript.
So yeah, not sure what

573
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:07.830
2017 will be, but we'll
get around to it. That's

574
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:10.350
really cool. It sounds like
you have found your voice

575
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.350
and you're starting to put
it out there in a

576
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.930
lot of different ways. Yeah.
I'm really excited by that.

577
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.070
I'm really excited by the
kind of things that have

578
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:24.540
changed in my less compared
to five years ago, from

579
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.780
a career perspective, it just
feels really different. So it's

580
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.810
all about sort of starting
small and doing what you

581
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:35.730
think you you can do
now. And you'll find that

582
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.490
helps you get bigger things
on, on, in future. And

583
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.800
yeah, I would not have
predicted to you that I

584
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.220
would be talking to you
in a podcast. Yeah, You

585
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.440
do it. You've done these
things and they didn't just

586
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.470
happen. They happened because you
were conscious and you it's

587
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:58.330
continuous personal development. Yeah, exactly.
Very cool. Well, thanks so

588
00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.640
much for chatting with me
today. Thank you, Scott. I

589
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.610
had a blast. This has
been another episode of Hanselminutes

590
00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.140
and we'll see you again
next week.
