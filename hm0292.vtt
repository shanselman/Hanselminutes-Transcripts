<inaudible> Scott Hanselman Thursday, November
10, 2011, most comprehensive suite

2
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:46.370
of components in this episode
about the history of HTTP

3
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.290
and the world wide web.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman,

4
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.080
and this is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

5
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.750
we're sitting down with a
pretty interesting person, Henrik Nielsen.

6
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.330
He is a data engineer
and computer scientist, and he

7
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.760
did some really interesting work
early on, on the worldwide

8
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.980
web. How are you, sir?
So we, you and I

9
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.390
are within five years of
each other's age, but I

10
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.360
think while I was fooling
around in high school, you

11
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.350
were getting your master's degree
in, in engineering, in, in

12
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.780
Denmark. And then you met
an interesting person when you

13
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.490
went to work at CERN.
Can you tell us a

14
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.470
little bit about that? Yes,
I, I, a long, long

15
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.450
time ago when I was
a student, I figured out

16
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.110
that it is very convenient
to travel out and do

17
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.090
things as a student because
you can sort of just

18
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.310
drop into place and then
be there for a little

19
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.870
while and leave again and
have some great experiences. And

20
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.090
so I looked around actually
to where to do my

21
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.700
masters while I was at
Danish university. And I talked

22
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.920
to somebody who talked to
somebody who knew a guy

23
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.010
who was sitting at the
turn and say, well, this

24
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.100
guy is doing some interesting
stuff. We don't know exactly

25
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.810
what it is. He's calling
it, something, something, something web,

26
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.990
but it's very interesting. So
you should go talk to

27
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.000
him. So I went down
and, and certainly in, in

28
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.150
the, on the Swiss French
border, just outside Geneva. And

29
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.290
so I went down there
and visited and I met

30
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.530
Tim Bonusly who would buy
that, that was back in

31
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.210
93. He had formally proposed
the web as a concept

32
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.410
in 89, I believe, and
was working with, there were

33
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.140
two or three students sort
of associated roughly with his,

34
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.840
with his group, plus a
couple of, of, of certain

35
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.530
people plus plus 10. But
that was about it. There

36
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.130
were about five people on
and off. And so he

37
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.590
was very off your chest.
He said, yes, great, come

38
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.370
on in and sit down.
And, and that's how I

39
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.850
effectively started working on the
web that was in. So

40
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.040
I had to go back
and pack my, my, my

41
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.760
stuff and all that kind
of stuff. But I came

42
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.310
down in, in basically January
94, moved to CERN as

43
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.460
a what's it called a
technical students, and then started

44
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.230
working on, on, on web
technology as it was being

45
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.800
developed. And very specifically what
it is by working on

46
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.360
some library code library called
zip www that has the,

47
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.250
the old sort of Unix
naming style that had the

48
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.580
first 18 mil brow. So
it has some HDP implementation.

49
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.110
Most of it was actually
done by Tim himself, plus

50
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.650
another guy that helped doing
some of this stuff. And

51
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.570
I helped and continue developing
this together with another student

52
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.810
from Finland. And that's how
the, the, the certain server

53
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.660
sort of came to be,
there was something called the

54
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.360
Lima browse and other kinds
of things. And then after

55
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.980
a little while, I think
he was in March where

56
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.070
the first March of 94,
where the first web conference

57
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.820
ever was held and it
was held at CERN and

58
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.730
they were about 300 people.
And that was the entire

59
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.850
community who knew about the
web in the world effectively.

60
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.150
So Marc Andreesen was the,
a few other people from

61
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.730
around the world we've been
looking at. There was some

62
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.850
other browsers at that time,
there were people who have

63
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.640
been putting off websites, Slack
physics labs has also put

64
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.760
up, put up a website.
And so that was the

65
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.640
entire, it was very exciting,
sort of be part of

66
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.020
that, that gang of 300.
So people basically with everybody

67
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.540
who had been either putting
on a web server or

68
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.950
starting writing browsers or working
on servers and those kinds

69
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.210
of stuff, and that's how
it pretty much does. So

70
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.670
at that time you said
there's about 300 people in

71
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.890
the room, and that's basically
everyone on the planet that

72
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.190
knows everything about the web.
Are there less than 300

73
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.600
websites at this point? Oh,
yes, there was. At that

74
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.220
time, Tim basically had a
little webpage where he wrote

75
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.690
the, there was the first
index of webpages and it

76
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.170
could stay on the single
page. So there were not

77
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.600
a lot. So it was
just a page that was

78
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.100
like a list of all
the other pages on the

79
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:31.110
internet. So, And that, that
website was called info.ch, which

80
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.760
was the place where the
initial specs, where the, this

81
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.540
page off of, of websites
and a bunch of other

82
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.250
information was posted for a
long time. When, when, when

83
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.630
you first heard about this
idea of the web, had

84
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.850
I assumed you were using
Telnet? I mean, I remember

85
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.370
at that time I was
probably using something like CompuServe

86
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.880
and I was, you know,
dialing into universities and Tel

87
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.380
netting. And even before that
I was using bulletin board

88
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.350
systems. Was there, was there
a sense, or did you,

89
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.740
were you already drawn to
the idea of an interconnected

90
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:15.030
group of computers? I didn't
quite realize the power of,

91
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.040
of the interconnectedness in a
global scale because it's, it's

92
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.130
hard to, to, to get
a grasp until you sort

93
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:28.060
of see it. I was
immediately taken by the, the,

94
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.500
the idea of this information
space that everybody can participate

95
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.300
to produce information and to
consume information and to exchange

96
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.150
information and to have a
common place for talking about

97
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.700
things. I think there was
there, wasn't a very exciting

98
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:50.470
idea. I think one of
the, one of the times

99
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.670
where it kind of clicked
sort of personally was really

100
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.760
when you started was both
on the West side, but

101
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.530
also just with using email
on things that you could

102
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.520
send emails, for example, one
of the times, and now

103
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.830
it sounds of course naive
is that there was a,

104
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.090
a Unix girl called Stevens
who wrote some very good

105
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.270
Unix books for networking and
for the TTP stack and

106
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.350
whatnot. And I was reading
that because it was programming

107
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.440
some of the stuff in
this library. And there were

108
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.870
a piece of DNS that
I couldn't understand what he

109
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.470
was doing. And so he
had his email on, on

110
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.390
one of his books. And
so I sent him an

111
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.900
email, which was kind of
like, I might as well

112
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.780
send off a probe to
Mars because I had no

113
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.660
idea sort of what the
person was and where, where

114
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.800
it was. And he answered.
And that was kind of

115
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.860
saying, Oh my goodness, this
is, this is really powerful.

116
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.610
This being able to communicate,
obviously by this was an

117
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.560
email that the web sort
of took that to another

118
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.190
level was something that I
think many, many people sort

119
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.770
of have to, they have
an internal realization saying, Oh,

120
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.230
my, this is really powerful.
And then you get on

121
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.480
board and then it's just,
then there's just no going

122
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.810
back. So that was one
of those, those, those moments

123
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.490
where you realize that this
is going to be a

124
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:21.580
thing. Yes, absolutely. So you
worked with, with Tim Berners-Lee

125
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.820
and the, the W3C, the
worldwide web consortium. And now

126
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.550
when I think of the
worldwide web consortium, I think

127
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.380
of it rarely. I think
of it when I have

128
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.470
to go and dig deep
into a specification to find

129
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.590
out whether or not something
works the way that it's

130
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.720
supposed to work. And I
often find myself poking around

131
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.520
inside of the, the HTTP
specification and saying, was this

132
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.280
intended to do this? And
you were one of the

133
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.550
primary authors of that. How
does that work? You just

134
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.920
sit in a room and
think it up, or is

135
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.640
it a series of meetings
when you're off inventing Something

136
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.430
like HTP and writing it
down to the detail, where

137
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.990
are you and what are
you doing when this is

138
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:10.630
happening? Well, the way I
say it is that it's,

139
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.920
it's understanding very early on
that this is a collective

140
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.160
effort by a lot of
people. And that is not

141
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:27.170
very much somebody sitting and,
and dreaming up the, the

142
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.770
idea idea. I would say,
obviously Tim dreamed up the

143
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.770
initial idea and, and, and
how the protocol can work,

144
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.690
but that's a lot of
details for whether they should

145
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.820
using, what language would you
use to describe how, what

146
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.220
is the format, whether it's
a syntax, what the semantics

147
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.910
around it. And there there's
a lot of choices and

148
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:57.770
effectively, they are always engineering.
Compromises takes early on sort

149
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:04.760
of email style hit us.
It's called RCA 22 has

150
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.950
sort of name, call and
value as being the language

151
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:12.020
of HTTP that was introduced
in HTTP 1.0, before that

152
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.570
it was actually just a
one line, which said yet.

153
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.520
And then the UI that
you want to get, there

154
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.370
was no metadata around it.
So all those kinds of

155
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.600
things I'd say evolved. It
was not somebody sitting locked

156
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:29.120
in a room thinking about
it. It was writing code,

157
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.960
interacting with people, seeing what
the scenarios were very much

158
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.280
being part of a vibrant
community where people wanted to

159
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.970
do. Then for example, HTML
forms came about. So post

160
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:46.880
was, was, was, well, I
remember one detail for Sam

161
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.060
of doing put, you can
obviously do put content off

162
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.180
to a web server. And
in, in one point, Oh,

163
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.690
what we had was that
you just send the document

164
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.740
with, with, with right, with
the put up front. I

165
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.080
mean, and I was doing
some experiments where I was

166
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.300
sitting at that time. It
was, I was sitting moved

167
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.340
to, to MIT with a
web consortium, but we were

168
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.950
still playing around with a
server back at CERN. So

169
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:21.920
I did put cross advantage.
And we realized that sometimes

170
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.290
if you do an authentication
and you go sort of

171
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.050
back, you said, you're not
allowed to post a document

172
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.820
over here. You could actually
lose the response the way

173
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.520
that ACP was formulated. So
we had to add something

174
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.070
called a second little, this
is what these one-on-one temporary,

175
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.130
or 100 continued messages was
introduced. History should be in

176
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.580
order to get around those
kinds of things. So many

177
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.290
of those things were really,
obviously there was some fundamental,

178
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.890
the way I say is
that you come up with

179
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.190
some basic principles that you
would like to adhere to.

180
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.550
Some of them was that
is document oriented. That is

181
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.350
hyper, hyper driven. That is
based on your eyes. And

182
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.110
that is stateless. That means
that is you have no,

183
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.090
you don't have sessions. You
don't have anything like that.

184
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.910
I want you to solve,
pick your, your set of

185
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.640
principles up front. Then the
rest of it is about

186
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.680
filling in the gaps and
figuring out how does this

187
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.390
work? How does this work
and how does that work

188
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.870
and build code? And one
of the things that I

189
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.570
think has always been at,
at, at hot of both

190
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.800
ITF and also WPC, obviously
see, it's sort of inherited

191
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.960
from my TF is the
internet engineering task force for

192
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:43.260
folks exactly that that's where
the typical sort of RSC

193
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.530
acronym comes from. That those
are documents that are published

194
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.600
by that organization. And both
them both. They also have

195
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.550
published a TCP and IP
and DNS and effectively. They

196
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:01.130
are the, they are to
the internet, to what, what,

197
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.970
what consortium has been to
the, to the web in

198
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.530
terms of sort of driving
the core specifically. And the

199
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.530
key piece there has always
been, what's called rough consensus

200
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.990
and running code. That means
that you get into a

201
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.240
room. You don't agree on
everything, but you have rough

202
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.360
consensus for saying this is
roughly the right thing. And

203
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.360
then you basically have two
or more implementations that work

204
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.870
together. So you have to
demonstrate the things work. And

205
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.980
that is a great way
for getting beyond my thing

206
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.670
is prettier than your thing
kind of discussions where you

207
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.040
can discuss that till the
cows come home at the

208
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.070
end of the day is
really, the focus has always

209
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.160
been, yes, that's great, but
we need to have running

210
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.280
code. You need to demonstrate
that it runs not just

211
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.330
in your lab or between
two machines can run globally.

212
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:57.540
And that's where you, you
can, you can't sit down

213
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.750
and think that through it,
that's too many variables and

214
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.050
too many unknowns and too
many quirks that you have

215
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.600
to work with. And so
it really takes a community

216
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.200
to come up with a
spec. And it was very

217
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.140
much develop as a, as
a community. There was a

218
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.960
basic principles that they started
out with what, what, what

219
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.850
Tim had in terms of
the basic things that we

220
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.980
just talked about. But on
top of that, it's really

221
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.820
about the community pitching in
saying, this is, this is

222
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.310
great, but why don't we
add this? Why don't we

223
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.540
add that? And, and then
it rolls from them. And

224
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:41.760
so effectively the most productive
and most successful specifically <inaudible>

225
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.850
work that I've been part
of have always been where

226
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:52.730
the, the working group has
been working in tandem with

227
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.090
it developed implementations. So it's
not that the working group

228
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.720
goes out and dreams about
something often. Then the implementation

229
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.510
has come later. It's really
the implementations and the specification

230
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.470
go hand in hand. That's
really, that's a really a

231
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.390
fascinating idea, cause it's a,
it's, it should be a

232
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.150
guiding concept for everything that
went with that we design.

233
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.610
I think that there's a
lot of times when people

234
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:17.080
spend hours and hours in
front of a whiteboard brainstorming

235
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.770
things and, and then being
very congratulatory once the white

236
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.830
boarding is done, but you're
right. Once you have an

237
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.280
implementation you're only half done,
but you know, to complete

238
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.460
working implementations, presumably written by
different people, talking to each

239
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.430
other is a really great
way to confirm that things

240
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:37.150
are, are working as you
specify them. And as you

241
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.330
imagine them, and certainly no
better way than to find

242
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.430
the bugs and the specification
than to actually try to

243
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.930
implement it. Yes. Yes. And,
and, and in fact, the

244
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:53.290
HTTP specification work has actually
just recently undergone right now,

245
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:58.810
as we speak undergoing a
big editorial revision, it's called

246
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:03.280
the, the HTTP vis work,
which is updating HTTP spec

247
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.610
with a lot of clarification
about how things work by

248
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.870
deploying reputations already. There might
be places where the spec

249
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.030
is on clear. There's a
lot of things that's been

250
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.450
cleared up, but in a
sense, the, the, the critical

251
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:25.330
aspect of it is that
the spec becomes more of

252
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:31.120
a historic documents then that,
because it kind of captures

253
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.220
what is, what is working,
but it's out there. What

254
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.480
is, what is available today?
And that's, I think is

255
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.770
the critical aspect of what
a, what a spec it

256
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.550
should be. It's kind of
it documents, what is out,

257
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.340
what is working, that's what
it should be doing if

258
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.590
it is, if it defines
and say, every time you

259
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.960
do something, you have to
go to that document to

260
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.570
figure out what the idea
was. Then you don't have

261
00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:04.300
this interaction between deployed implementations
and, and the specifications. This

262
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.760
episode of Hansel minutes is
brought to you by careers.

263
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.510
2.0 careers, 2.0 is a
new service by our friends

264
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.050
at stack overflow. You're probably
all familiar with stack overflow.

265
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.760
The online QA resource dedicated
specifically to programmers and programming

266
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.870
related topics. Well, the team
at stack overflow created careers

267
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.170
2.0 to provide you with
access to great jobs and

268
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.880
introduce you to a bunch
of great companies that you

269
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.730
might consider working for, even
if you're not currently looking

270
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.970
for a job, think of
careers. 2.0 is a programmer

271
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.360
profile, gives you a platform
to show that you're awesome

272
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.280
by featuring your proudest contributions
to stack overflow, GitHub SourceForge

273
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.880
Bitbucket, anything programming related, you
can even add your favorite

274
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.520
programming books from amazon.com profiles
on careers. 2.0 are free.

275
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.670
They're easy to get started,
especially by importing your LinkedIn

276
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.980
profile. However, there's one catch
profiles on career 2.0 or

277
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.370
invite only they did this
to keep out the spam

278
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.390
and have a high quality
environment. Fortunately, for you as

279
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.570
a Hansel minutes listener, I've
got your back head on

280
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:15.240
over to careers dot stack
overflow.com/h M to accept your

281
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:22.110
invitation today, once again, that's
careers dot stack, overflow.com/m. I

282
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:28.970
hope you like it. How,
how many times now, some,

283
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.120
you probably know that specification
backwards and forwards because even

284
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.360
though, well, it was a
huge community effort. You're kind

285
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.140
of the note taker and
the facilitator, and you're actually

286
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.360
typing up, you know, one
of the principal authors for

287
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.450
typing it up. How many
times have you discovered that

288
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.750
you thought you had it
completely solid and you thought

289
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.670
the spec was clear, and
there's a section of the

290
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.550
spec that is completely and
totally unclear, and then is

291
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:58.610
being fixed, you know, 10,
12, 15 years later. I'd

292
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:04.310
say that actually is by
far the most common, the

293
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:09.650
it's so happens that what
somebody feels is, is clear,

294
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.160
turns out always to be
unclear to somebody else. And

295
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.530
in fact, one of the,
one of the key pieces,

296
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.370
and this is one thing
that, that is rarely appreciated

297
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:23.510
as part of a working
group, is that as part

298
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.460
of going through a working
group and the ACP working

299
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.330
group was, was big. At
some point, I think probably

300
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.600
a hundred, 200 people, not
all participating, but sort of

301
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.860
reading and sometimes just pitching
in and doing, but sort

302
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.440
of having good suggestions and
all that kind of things.

303
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.870
One of the key aspects
is that it's a collective

304
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.430
education of that group of
people for getting shared context

305
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.490
for what this document actually
is supposed to mean, because

306
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.660
you can only write it
up to certain point in,

307
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.030
in English, always be questions
about, well, how does this

308
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.890
work if you do this?
And the face of the

309
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.740
moon is exactly that and
those kinds of things. And

310
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.380
what happens is that the
group of people off of

311
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:12.050
hundred or so through this
process have solved part of

312
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.360
the specification. And then they
go out and implement it

313
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.720
also. And it kind of
grows from there. So it's

314
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.240
not, we try cost to
capture a lot of that

315
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.790
in, in, in the document,
but there's also a tremendous

316
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.650
set of knowledge in the
email aliases. And just in

317
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.710
how people get a better
understanding of what's going on.

318
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.390
This might be an, an
ignorant question on my part

319
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.850
and forgive me. But do
you ever feel like you're

320
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.840
surprised that it works Okay.
Well, the way I'd say

321
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.120
it is that I think
some of the design in

322
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.970
sense, I was, I was
very lucky because I did

323
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.300
not have any internet experience.
I did not have any

324
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.410
distributed computing experience when I
started working on, on, on

325
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.890
the web. So I really
didn't come in with a

326
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.140
preconceived notion of saying well,
but this is not a

327
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.380
distributed Apia system, or this
is not a distributed file

328
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.350
system, or this is not
transactional, or I didn't have

329
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.620
any of those sort of
preconceived notions about what would

330
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.620
work or not. And I
don't think that was any

331
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:23.100
question that it would work.
It was clear that there

332
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:28.290
were a lot of discussion
about whether the protocol was

333
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.590
what's clunky and whether it
was wasteful. And we have,

334
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.220
I had lots of discussions
with others, people who had

335
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:42.060
developed other solutions that were
very technically, you can say

336
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.350
more elegant in certain ways,
they were separated better out.

337
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.530
They had, for example, one
of the things we never

338
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:54.570
did, if he is, we
didn't, you cannot have sex

339
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.450
response is out of order.
So when you send a

340
00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.940
request on a single TCP
connection, the response has to

341
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.290
come back before you can
send another request. And we

342
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.030
never sort of say, well,
I can send two requests

343
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.400
and then I can get
the last request, the response

344
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.440
first. And so I can
get them out order, which

345
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.520
has some can have some
significant performance optimizations. We never

346
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.570
did that because that will
break existing ACP and limitations.

347
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.850
But there were other solutions
that went down this route.

348
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.780
And when, when that way,
and you could say from

349
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.900
a network optimization from a
usability point, it's sort of

350
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.540
from a network usage point
of view, they were, they

351
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.320
were better in certain ways.
What I learned though, is

352
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:40.200
that that's not really what
matters most, what matter most

353
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.750
is that you provide value
to what people want to

354
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.020
do. And this idea that
you could just stop a

355
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.040
web server, pointed it out,
they share, and now serve

356
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.240
those documents, whether those were
HTML documents or PDF documents

357
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.390
or whatever else, images you
could just serve them was

358
00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.990
a tremendous value to, to,
to the community and to

359
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.720
people who wanted to expose
information and to create information.

360
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.510
And so this idea that
you could build things that

361
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:12.420
were more elegant, more efficient,
all those kinds of things

362
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.950
is true. But what I
learned is that never, never

363
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:22.920
try and sit in front
off of this efficiency argument.

364
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.770
If the solution is just
to put in another server,

365
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.380
if you still, if you're
sitting in front of the

366
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.480
brute force and saying, well,
if I just put in

367
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.920
another server, I'm fine is
a very hot argument to

368
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.860
say, well, but if you
change your infrastructure completely, you

369
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.770
don't have to do that.
That is a very hard

370
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.580
argument often to do because
the, the, the, the value

371
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.500
of the network is, goes
up exponentially with the number

372
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.710
of nodes participating in it.
And as soon as one

373
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:57.200
combination takes off, the value
of the network becomes huge.

374
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.130
And so changing out from
that, that way of communicating

375
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:06.440
is, is almost insurmountable. So
in a sense, you can

376
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.810
say, well, there'll be, it
is funny because I was

377
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:17.840
at many conferences where I
heard, especially from, from TCP

378
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.150
transport, people who were objecting
to how, especially SEP 1.0

379
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.970
use TCP, which was kind
of wasteful in many ways.

380
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.200
And they say that I
had many arguments saying, well,

381
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.250
if this is a stupid
protocol, because it does use

382
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.680
TCP in the right way,
and it doesn't do this.

383
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.890
And it has speak request
headers of many, many hundreds

384
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:45.320
of fights for, for requests
and responses also wasteful and

385
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.160
those kinds of things. And
while that's all true, the

386
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:54.470
alternatives were not able to,
to break the momentum of

387
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.340
HTTP simply because the value
was too high. And that's

388
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.610
the, that I think a
very useful lesson that you

389
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:09.140
can engineering. It's a practical
way of building stuff. And,

390
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.930
and, and sometimes you have
the luxury of doing things

391
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.570
multiple times, but often when
you come up with something,

392
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.570
it really is a balance
between that the level of

393
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.420
entry, how complicated is to
get up and running your

394
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.610
system is a, a, a
huge factor in the system

395
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.370
taking off. And if it
has the right properties, then

396
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:33.100
performance is something that can
come down the line. That

397
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.490
is a powerful concept. And
the idea that people want

398
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.250
to be agile and people
talk about agile methods, but

399
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.940
sometimes doing a big spec
upfront and really thinking deeply

400
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.030
about it and doing small
prototypes is a very valuable

401
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.550
way to get something done.
It may come out looking

402
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.100
like a big design up
front, but it was actually

403
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.070
a number of small iterative
things. Like you said, you

404
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.320
can do, you can do
a performance a little bit

405
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.380
later, but I wouldn't S
would you say that these

406
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.540
kinds of specifications and the
internet itself was done in

407
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.340
an agile way? Because if
you look at something like

408
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.760
HTTP, it hasn't really changed
in a while. I mean,

409
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.090
things sit on top of
it, but the essence is

410
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:14.410
still there, you know, 14.
Yes. The essence is absolutely.

411
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.490
They are still, and also
all the quirks of their,

412
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.610
for example, even today, they
are five or six ways

413
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.730
that you can, in fact,
the limit an HTP message,

414
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.240
how long it is, which
in, from a sort of

415
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.480
a pure protocol point of
view seems excessive. Normally you

416
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.250
would say, well, what can
I just have a bite

417
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.100
count that I, I need
to read in one place?

418
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.080
And then I can understand
what the message is. One

419
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.750
message ends and the other
one's sauce, but SEP doesn't

420
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.560
have, it has five ways.
And the, for that is

421
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.920
because, well, it started out
not having any way whatsoever.

422
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.230
And then we had to
add ways to it. And

423
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.790
there were different ways of
adding it and some were

424
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.870
successful and some were sort
of successful. And so, but

425
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.610
they all stuck. And so
now we have this, this

426
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.570
aggregation of various teachers, and,
and you can come up

427
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.600
with something that, from a
clean slate, that is a

428
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.880
much more efficient in many
ways, from that perspective, but

429
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.120
it's, it's gonna be a
uphill battle to convince everybody

430
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.860
to change You. So you
went to work for Microsoft

431
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.910
in 99 after you left
the W3C. And what have

432
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:29.360
you been working on lately?
Well, the web has stayed

433
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.520
with me, or I stayed
with the web throughout my

434
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.930
career in one way or
the other, because I've, I've,

435
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.730
I'm fascinated by the potential
and the oval idea and,

436
00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.700
and the ability for people
to communicate and exchange information,

437
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:49.340
I think is, is extraordinary.
What I'm, what I'm doing

438
00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.690
at different times has been
tying kind of expanding where

439
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:58.340
you can use the web
technologies. One aspect that I

440
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.820
was working on a couple
of years ago was building

441
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:07.100
robotics, robotics frameworks, where you
can say, well, what has

442
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.160
robots to do with web
technology? But it turns out

443
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.290
that they actually, you can
use a lot of web

444
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:17.780
technology, a lot of, of,
of ideas behind how document

445
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:23.870
oriented using your eyes, being
able to, to inspect by

446
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.440
putting a browse on looking
at what's going on matches

447
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.380
very, very well with something
like robotics. And so I've

448
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.340
been trying to push web
technology into new areas where

449
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:39.170
traditionally it hasn't been, been
part of it. Robots were,

450
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.220
were great, fun. They, they
are just the idea to,

451
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.640
to, to my heart because
they, it just, the fact

452
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.360
that they move around is
your laptop look so, so

453
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.350
much less interesting things that
move around. That's just interesting,

454
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:59.510
more interesting. And they also,
that they taught me a

455
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:04.340
bunch of interesting things about
other aspects that Microsoft has

456
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.510
been looking into a lot
like enterprise computing with reliable

457
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.750
messaging and transactions and those
kinds of things. And some

458
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.700
of the things we can
learn is that, well, if

459
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.480
a robot rolls off a
cliff, no amount of transactions

460
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.460
over reliable messaging or any
of those kinds of things

461
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.420
that typically have been deployed
in enterprises work because the

462
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.640
robot is gone and you
have to figure out what

463
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.310
are you going to do
now that actually works great

464
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.410
with web technology because the
web technology has always say,

465
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.150
well, we're going to do
the best effort. We'll be

466
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.610
not going to just stop
working. If a server is

467
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.250
down, we going to try
and do something else. What

468
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.220
I'm doing now is, is
trying to take the same,

469
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:46.270
same ideas for, for building
web platforms and merchandise into

470
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.470
a cloud scenarios where we
can provide a much easier

471
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:55.060
way for you to build
web API in particular. W

472
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.460
one of the things we'll
be focusing on is, is

473
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:04.030
that the initial sets of
web servers where ILO file

474
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:09.790
servers, or they were HTML,
they w wrapping HTML around

475
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.780
back in processes. They could
either use CGI, which was

476
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.900
like this, or a way
of communicating with the packing

477
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.380
process or some of the
backend process drain. It generated

478
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:26.020
some data. And now the
web servers responsibility was to

479
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.220
put HTML, anchor brackets around
that data and the presented

480
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.320
through it so that it
could be consumed with browser

481
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:39.190
HTML five and, and, and
JavaScript has changed that in

482
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.770
the sense that what happens
now is that a lot

483
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.230
of the rendering can happen
on the browser side. So

484
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.440
the server doesn't have to
put eight HTML around the

485
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.960
data. It just exposes that
data as what we call

486
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.980
web APIs, where you can
now program directly against these,

487
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.880
these APIs that give you,
and then build all the

488
00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.140
rendering as part of your
HTML five application. And so

489
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.860
that means that there's a
big push to, towards building

490
00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.320
these kinds of new applications,
because they could be consumed

491
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.610
both by, by browsers, by
mobile devices and across the

492
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.430
board, across, across a set
of devices that might render

493
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.800
things differently. But now they
can do the rendering locally

494
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.100
rather than having the data
coming at ND and the

495
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.590
presentation coming straight from the
server being tailored to that

496
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.960
device. And so what I'm
working on now is to

497
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:32.450
provide a new framework, which
hopefully will be available in

498
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.800
the not too distant future,
where we can show some

499
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.870
of the ways that you
can build very lightweight, very

500
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:43.990
efficient web APIs using the
full force of SDP, where

501
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.140
you have sort of great
access to, to hit us

502
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.090
and to mess up. So
you can, you can set

503
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.420
caching semantics. You can, you
can set whatever you want

504
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.850
to set all around and
has just an old great

505
00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.360
experience for you to build
a, these API and deploy

506
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.010
them into the cloud. One
last question I always wanted

507
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.590
to ask someone who works
so closely on the internet

508
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.230
is if, if you could
explain to myself and to

509
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:14.340
our listeners, what HTTP status
code four 18 is. Hi,

510
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:20.340
<inaudible> Familiar with it as
a, is related to RFC

511
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:25.860
2324, the hypertext coffee pot.
Oh, yes, yes, indeed. Yes.

512
00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.260
So Larry messenger, who was
the working group chair followed

513
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.190
up on a, on a
proud tradition in ITF for,

514
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:39.710
for writing what is called
April fools specifications. I think

515
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.350
it goes all the way
back to the seventies, 75

516
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.950
or 76 of where the
first of those were published.

517
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.630
And they had along over
the years, they actually had

518
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.430
great sense of humor. One
was to, one of the

519
00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:00.170
ones I remember is to
send electricity over IP, which

520
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.680
of course is a inherently
impossible thing to do, but

521
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.200
it was all about sort
of doing things that at

522
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:11.120
the, at the front actually
look plausible, but this is

523
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.040
something that ultimately didn't make
sense. The message. I had

524
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.940
this great idea of writing
the coffee pot control protocol

525
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.260
as an HTTP protocol. And
he published it as an

526
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.470
April 1st, April fools joke. And
I think there was a

527
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.740
actually a great, and I
believe it is at least

528
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.170
in our C 26 16.
It is one of the

529
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.140
formal references. If you look
very carefully at the back

530
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.600
of the document, it actually
referenced as a form of

531
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:45.810
document supporting the SGP 1.1
specification And the, and the

532
00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.650
form of a four 18
status code is in the

533
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.870
spec right now, as you
search, Oh, wait, it's in

534
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:54.510
the spec right now. Great.
Perfect. I love it. Yeah.

535
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.210
People can check those out
April fool's day RFC. Yeah.

536
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.890
And the thing was that
actually was so that you

537
00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:05.230
could in fact build it
as a protocol. It was

538
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:08.530
not just a thought experiment.
You could actually do it.

539
00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.670
And I believe somebody has
done it. I, I seem

540
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.240
to remember somebody posting that
they actually implemented it. I

541
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.670
had little webcam. So you
could show the state of

542
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.640
the, of the coffee pot.
Yeah. It's much more fun

543
00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.200
if you're going to do
something like this, you need

544
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.670
to actually implement it. Someone
in 2009 proposed doing IPV

545
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:33.100
six over a social network.
So someone ended up implementing

546
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.720
it. There's no reason not
to. So they ended up

547
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:39.640
implementing IPV six over Facebook
itself. Yes. Yes. And you

548
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:47.710
could, all those things are
absolutely Okay. On one hand,

549
00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:52.870
they are a great front
because they poke sort of

550
00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.030
poke fun at the layering
and, and, and the, the

551
00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:02.650
modulation using modules for, for
thinking about the protocol stack.

552
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.160
Because of course you can
always take somebody, something that

553
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.410
sits at the bottom, see
it, and then put it

554
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.480
at the top at the
very top of the stack.

555
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.820
But it actually is a
Testament that you think about

556
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:17.910
it to how the layering
kind of works because the,

557
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.500
it works because you can
take something that sits at

558
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.530
the bottom and it's independent
of what is both below

559
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.900
and above. And you can
then put it in another,

560
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.580
you can reach off the
stack and put it in

561
00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.590
another spot in the sec
and still make it work

562
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.560
from a practical point of
view and performance point of

563
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.240
view. It doesn't work good.
It's A good lesson in

564
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.840
that. It kind of tells
indirectly that the layering works.

565
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.010
It does. And that really
is a Testament to the

566
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.830
web itself. It, it works
and, and we appreciate your

567
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.580
role in helping make that
Henrik Nielsen. Thanks so much

568
00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.160
for chatting with us today.
Thank you so much. It

569
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.060
was great fun. This has
been another episode of Hanselminutes

570
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.040
and we'll see you again
next week.
