Hey folks, Intel is a
sponsor this week and I

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.840
welcome them because they're bringing
some high performance developer tools

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.740
for all of us. Check
out Intel's parallel studio X,

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.860
E I've talked about parallelism
before on the show and

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.460
the importance of using the
complete instruction set, unlocking the

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.530
power of the process or
that your code is running

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.260
on. Now, you all might
be writing C or C

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.740
plus plus Python or even
Fortran, but is your code

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.750
building in such a way
and written in such a

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.610
way that it uses the
latest techniques for vectorization multithreading

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.250
multi-node parallelization or memory optimization?

<inaudible>. This is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

19
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.880
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with Gary Nissenbaum from GDN

20
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.370
law.com GDN law.com. You may
remember Gary from show six

21
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.220
Oh one, where we talked
about terms of service for

22
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.220
developers. How are you sharing
your fast becoming our favorite

23
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.620
lawyer on the show? I
am thrilled to be back.

24
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.550
I had a terrific time
being interviewed by you last

25
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.860
time, and I'm really looking
forward to this one because

26
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.370
I think it's a very
topical and important subject. Yeah.

27
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.580
Well, we're going to talk
about GDPR, the general data

28
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.470
protection regulations. I was literally
trying to work on this

29
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.310
a little bit late on
my own podcast site. I

30
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.060
am a small business, you
know, a micro business. Even

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.470
I put my cookie consent
pop up there and looked

32
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.170
at all the different places
where I store data. And

33
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.590
I, I think I'm okay,
but you know, I'm not

34
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.080
a big company. I don't
have the time where the

35
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.800
lawyers, frankly, to read all
the paperwork, it seemed kind

36
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.960
of weird that this is
even affecting me over here

37
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.960
in America. Not only that,
but when you say you

38
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.020
don't have the lawyers to
do this, my question would

39
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.470
be, are you talking about
American lawyers or are you

40
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.430
referring to European lawyers? And
if you're not talking, if

41
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.260
you're not referring to European
lawyers, then how do you

42
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.800
know you're complying with the
European law? And that's part

43
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.070
of what I want to
discuss today, which is a

44
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.650
terrific, very important principle, which
is maintaining privacy of data.

45
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.850
I believe in it, 100%,
I'm a big civil libertarian,

46
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.570
but the implementation is lacking
The forethought of how to

47
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.640
do it without unintended consequences
seems to have been lacking.

48
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.910
Oh, there's a lot to
be. There's a lot to

49
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.490
dig into here, but let's
start at the beginning. You

50
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.040
know, what is it, what
is the general data protection

51
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.630
regulations and how does it
affect what America does? Well,

52
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.430
the re the general, the
data protection regulations that we're

53
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.840
talking about is the culmination
of a series of proposals

54
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.580
and directives and regulations that
have gone on since around

55
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.780
2002. And they all STEM
from the basic thrust that

56
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.330
Europeans want to protect the
collection of data, the storage

57
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.980
of data, and the use
of data. And they want

58
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.030
to do that for the
people that the European union

59
00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.660
protects. And that is citizens
of those countries. The issue

60
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.760
that we're going to discuss
today is that European users

61
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.460
don't just access websites in
those countries. So to the

62
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.690
extent that they are accessing
an American website, and to

63
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.800
the extent that the American
website is not compliant, there

64
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.970
is a strong argument that
the American website is a,

65
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.190
is a in violation with
all the attendant implications that

66
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.370
that brings in terms of
fines and other sorts of

67
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.510
things. Doesn't that imply that
we can't win. I mean,

68
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.180
there's 200 and something plus
countries in the world. And

69
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.480
if any European decides to
swing by, you know, a

70
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.020
website in Djibouti, now they're
going to be subject to

71
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.610
laws of Europe. Let's, I'll
double down on that. It

72
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.490
implies that any country that
has users of the internet

73
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.560
can create a more stringent
law than even the Europeans.

74
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.410
And then on the basis
of that become the preeminent

75
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.600
regulatory body of the world,
because it's a race to

76
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.140
who can be the most
restrictive, because the most restrictive

77
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.860
is whatever one needs to
comply with. So if Tanzania

78
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.100
decides that it is going
to be the most restrictive

79
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.100
country in terms of the
laws, the privacy regulations, and

80
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.570
frankly, other regulations that, that,
that relate to internet use

81
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.810
of their citizens, theoretically, all
websites around the world have

82
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.460
to be concerned about that
because there are users they

83
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.220
could, that could be accessing
their website from Tanzania. They

84
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.380
wouldn't even know it. Right.
Let me see if I

85
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.950
can parse that though. So
you're saying that the idea

86
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.630
that Europe, as an entity
could create a thing as

87
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.670
broad reaching. And as you
know, let's just say broad

88
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.820
reaching as a GDPR that,
that opens up a precedent

89
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.850
that anyone else could go
and do the same thing

90
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.840
that then it would affect
all of us. That's right.

91
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.510
And when you borders to
something that doesn't have borders

92
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.440
and the reason that's exactly
right. And the reason that

93
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.920
that is so critical is
that the entire Canon of

94
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.400
American law going all the
way back to the founding

95
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.070
of the country is that
our courts are the prime,

96
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.730
the prime movers on statements
of law, that if you

97
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.150
have a lawsuit and you
litigate it in a trial

98
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.460
level court, and you don't
like the result, you can

99
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.980
take your appeal. But at
the, at the, in the

100
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.550
final analysis, when you've exhausted
your appeals, that is the

101
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.970
law. That is what has
to be complied with. But

102
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.020
what we're seeing here is
a sea change in how

103
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.090
laws are enforced and the
primacy of law, because you

104
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.710
could theoretically have a situation
where a digital company is

105
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.350
in a lawsuit. The lawsuit
goes all the way up

106
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.590
to the United States Supreme court,
the United States Supreme court finds

107
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.950
in favor of one party
or the other, but that's

108
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.460
not the final answer that,
that even though the Supreme

109
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.960
court has said that the
activity is allowed, that privacy

110
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.210
of American citizens is not
being infringed upon based upon

111
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.710
first amendment protections and other
sorts of, of statutory protections.

112
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.690
You could still have a
whole regime of laws from

113
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.740
outside the borders of the
United States that would still apply

114
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.470
to the same activity that
the Supreme court has just

115
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.590
said. You could, you could
engage in, Okay. So not

116
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.090
to put too fine a
point on it, but then

117
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.690
what legal basis does the
EU have to levy fines

118
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.480
or sanctions against a us
company that doesn't have any

119
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.530
jurisdictional presence or nexus in
the EU? The company is

120
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:05.110
entering into the jurisdiction of
that European country by virtue

121
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.110
of providing services to its
citizens. So if I let's

122
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.430
say for example, and this
is a real, a real

123
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.380
example, that this is a
municipality in America that is

124
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:22.000
letting citizens pay their water
bill completely, utterly, legitimately, U

125
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.870
S only. Now a us
person is in Europe, on

126
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.930
vacation. They can't pay their
water bill. It's more along

127
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.660
the lines of the example
I would give similar to

128
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:38.260
where you're going is someone
in the EU owns American

129
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.830
property. And so they need
to pay their water bill,

130
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.140
but they're a citizen of
that country. They're an investor.

131
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.610
They have a vacation home
here. The fact is that

132
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.180
they are accessing this website
that normally you would think

133
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.970
Americans would be accessing, but
this is a very legitimate

134
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.380
why someone from Europe would
be accessing that website. I

135
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.720
would argue that you could
say that the GDPR does

136
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.260
apply to it. You just
turned that on its head

137
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.680
very nicely. That was a
very, that was a judo

138
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.580
flip. It's my job. That
was an excellent doodle flip

139
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.490
because you're like, I'm like,
wow, you're absolutely right. Well

140
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.220
then it's like, well, private,
we all agree. Privacy is

141
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.290
good, but you know, this
seems very heavy handed way

142
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.750
to do things. And I'm
afraid, I don't know what

143
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.420
I'm storing now, you know,
on a blog comment or

144
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.190
something like that. Something what
I think of as being

145
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.310
harmless. Well, I mean, let's,
you know, let's talk about

146
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.560
this. You're, you're, you're forcing
companies that don't have the

147
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.520
capital to really go into
this kind of depth about

148
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.990
European law to comply with
the European law. So essentially

149
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.150
people are flying blind. Let
me, let me bring this

150
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:52.190
down to the practical in
terms of my clients and

151
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.340
in terms of people that
I've seen in other situations

152
00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.040
that are not my clients,
very few businesses are actually

153
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:07.160
having the opt in, pop
up on that homepage. And

154
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.280
there's a reason it's not
just that it's difficult to

155
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.490
implement because frankly, you know,
in WordPress, it's not, not

156
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.120
that difficult to implement. It's
more that when you have

157
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.140
that opt in, nobody goes
to your website that you

158
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.070
will have a tremendous drop
in visitors. People don't want

159
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.290
to deal with you. They
don't, they want to go

160
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.510
to the next website where
there's no opt in because

161
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.960
they don't know what they're
opting into. So the interesting

162
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.900
part, another interesting part of
this is that the very

163
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.770
thing that the European union
is trying to say, which

164
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:44.210
is we don't realize what
we are sharing and how

165
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.630
our information is being shared
and where, how it's being

166
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.390
stored. And, and the fact
that it's not being stored

167
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.540
with complete security, therefore there
would need to be an

168
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.290
opt in. That's the very
reason that people are not

169
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.200
staying on that website and
moving on because they don't

170
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.650
want to deal with the
issue. So in essence, it's

171
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.160
our limited attention span. The
fact that we're not digging

172
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.800
down as consumers, and I'm
probably as guilty of this

173
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.170
as anybody, when I go
on a website and I

174
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.440
just am viewing things casually,
why am I opting into

175
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.010
anything? It always gives me
a sense of somehow agreeing

176
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.740
to something that I don't
understand. And I don't know

177
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.110
why, why they're asking me
and I have a lot

178
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.730
of questions. So the consumer
who's using the internet is

179
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.960
not really on the same
wavelengths as the regulators in

180
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.610
the EU. Yeah. Additionally, I'm
noticing more and more. There

181
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.010
was the move towards an
active opt in, which is

182
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.920
simply the act of pushing,
okay. Versus hitting the back

183
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.120
button. Now I'm hearing interpretations
where I have arrived at

184
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.150
a website. I've received no
cookies, but if I click

185
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.830
any link, I have implicitly
opted in by simply moving

186
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.470
forward. Right. That's something that
I don't think I could

187
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.720
explain to nontechnical parent Cambridge
Analytica. Look what happened in

188
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.990
2016, the idea that you
would go on Facebook and

189
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.390
you're the friends of your
friends, their information is now

190
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.970
available because you completed a
survey that did not disclose

191
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.120
that it was actually not
so much a survey as

192
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.110
a means into your private
data. So the point I'm

193
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:30.360
making is we have two
irreconcilable principles and they're both

194
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.520
good principles. The privacy of
this data is really, really

195
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.940
important. People have to know
that no one's opening their

196
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.750
mail, essentially, you know, but,
but on the other hand,

197
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.720
the sophistication and the frankly,
the attention span of the

198
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:55.110
casual user is just not
correlated. It's not in proportion

199
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.830
to the complex nature of
what you're giving up when

200
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:02.610
you're on the internet. So
there is this disconnect between

201
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.510
the something, an activity that
you're doing that seems to

202
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:10.140
be innocuous and innocent and
that you're in control of.

203
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.810
And then whether you actually
are in control of it,

204
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.290
and then how you reconcile
those two things without becoming

205
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.970
overly regulatory and overly complex.
Right? And if you think

206
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.240
about just simply the act
of being on the internet

207
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.320
is enough to give your
IP address away, which is

208
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.440
enough to get very likely
to hear municipality, if not

209
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.070
your neighborhood, without even using
any JavaScript at all. So

210
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.600
simply visiting a site is
giving information, logging an IP

211
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.420
address, I assume is a
problem. If I am a,

212
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.780
a site owner, if I'm
logging IP addresses, I'm indirectly

213
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.190
logging where you are. Is
that allowed if I don't

214
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.030
keep track of who you
are? Well, yeah, that's that,

215
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.210
that's the whole point is
that all those sorts of

216
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:02.160
activities are impacted by these
regulations. And then let me

217
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.080
just take it to another
level because the States of

218
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:13.530
the United States are passing their
own privacy laws and regulations

219
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:21.840
that are in parallel to
the GDPR. Meaning California just

220
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:28.290
passed a digital privacy law.
And it was fascinating to

221
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.280
look at how that all
went down. The state legislature

222
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:38.910
in California really was in
opposition to this at first,

223
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.390
but then what came out
was that there was going

224
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.950
to be a referendum on
it. And what the legislators

225
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.010
realized was that if the
referendum passed, there'd be no

226
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:57.020
way to hone this and
correct any unintended consequences and

227
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.230
amend it and sort of
make it do what they

228
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.230
wanted it to do. So
they felt they were boxed

229
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.380
in politically and they passed
it. And it's not going

230
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.570
to go into effect for
a couple of years until

231
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.890
2020. I understand that. But
the larger point is that

232
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.220
they're going to need to
look at this law, which,

233
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.510
which has been passed in
relation to European law, which

234
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.960
is regulating some of the
same things, but not all

235
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.230
the same things. So there
are differences. And then look

236
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.070
at that in relation to
other States that are similarly

237
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.260
passing privacy regulations related to
internet use. So now you

238
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.830
have a patchwork of not
just countries, but States in

239
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.610
the United States, all sorts of
doing the same thing. And

240
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:48.920
it becomes so chaotic that
an eCommerce website much less

241
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.030
a, a developer who is
working under a master services

242
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.310
agreement and all the rest
of that doesn't know what

243
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.930
to do. They don't know
where to turn. They don't

244
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.360
know how to comply. Yeah,
I'm, I'm hearing questions online

245
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.960
that are difficult for anyone
to parse. An example was

246
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.750
we talked about opting in,
but certainly a big part

247
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.960
of the GDPR is the
right to be forgotten, right?

248
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.620
The explicit opt out. So
let's say for example, I'm

249
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.320
encrypting all the data that's
being kept of my users.

250
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.090
And then you've decided to
opt out, you've invoked your

251
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.920
right to be forgotten if
I delete the, the, the

252
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.310
encryption key, but your data
exists on disc in some

253
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.880
format, but it cannot be
accessed. Have I deleted you

254
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.940
Or not? That's a good
sort of technical architecture, The

255
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.910
questions that how could anyone
know that it would really

256
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.090
just be your as a
lawyers interpretation of the law?

257
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.090
Wouldn't it. Let me, let
me give you my take

258
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.760
on that. In my experience
with that, you know, I,

259
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.730
I, our firm, we do
a huge amount of e-commerce

260
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.640
work and work with digital
clients. And one of the

261
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.380
things that comes up a
great deal is newspapers in

262
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:07.960
the United States, major publications that
are refusing to take down

263
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.070
articles that are incorrect about
my clients. So I get

264
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.910
people contacting me, asking me
to as a last resort,

265
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.400
cause they've tried for years
to get this stuff down.

266
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.730
They can't, they can't get
a job. They go on

267
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.340
job interviews. Somebody goes on,
Google puts their name in

268
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.590
and finds out that they
did these horrible things. They

269
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.140
assaulted somebody, they were involved
in summer, but none of

270
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.110
it's true. It was just
erroneous reporting in the heat

271
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.590
of a confrontation of some
type. They didn't do anything.

272
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.510
And the newspaper literally refuses
to take it down, even

273
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.740
if it's incorrect. So you
have a situation where the

274
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.610
newspaper is asserting its first
amendment, right? First amendment to

275
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:53.670
the United States constitution. The Supreme
court will normally back that

276
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.720
up. And then that newspaper
now has to decide not

277
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.020
so much whether they want
to take it down because

278
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.390
this person has a right
to be forgotten because it's

279
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.450
an erroneous article. That's not
the issue. The issue is

280
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.850
they want to keep it
up, but now they're being

281
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.950
forced to take it down
by a law of another

282
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:16.110
country. So it becomes highly
complicated and, and it's just

283
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.570
not the way these decisions
should be made. They should

284
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.700
be made on the merits
of somebody deserves to be

285
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.540
forgotten. You should have a
dialogue with the newspaper and

286
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.580
the newspaper should be reasonable.
And there should be some

287
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.360
kind of compromise on some
level, even, even just a

288
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.680
second article or something or
correction, but that's not what's

289
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.870
going on. What's going on
is what you're talking about,

290
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.110
which is at a digital
level, they may delete the

291
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:47.070
article. Well, deleting the article
comes very close to modifying

292
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.720
the historical record. You know,
it, it gets very close

293
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.330
to exactly what, what you
don't want to have in

294
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:59.250
a, in a democracy that,
that, that prizes, civil liberties.

295
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.920
So how do you balance
all of that? And that's

296
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.350
really the question And definitely
an unintended consequence and that

297
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.600
echo is going to echo
through for, for many years.

298
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.510
Hey friends, this is Scott.
You know, listening to podcasts

299
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.220
is a great way to
keep up to date on

300
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.670
technology. Since we're always learning
as software people. And you

301
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.460
can also find a job
by listening to a podcast.

302
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.610
If you check out our
new sponsor, hired.com, that's H

303
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:27.950
I R E d.com/hansel minutes
on hire.com. Software engineers can

304
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.920
get interview requests from companies
that want to hire you.

305
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.290
Each offer will have the
salary and the equity up

306
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.470
front. You can view those
interview requests and, you know,

307
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.810
except project change the offer
before even talking to a

308
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.790
company. It's a great way
to find out what's out

309
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.430
there and maybe make a
move they're working with over

310
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.810
6,000 companies from startups to
large companies from 14 major

311
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.960
tech hubs throughout North America
and Europe. What's great about

312
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.020
this is it's totally free
for software engineers. And if

313
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.260
you get a job to
hire.com, that'll ordinarily give you

314

at <inaudible> dot com slash

321
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.810
Hanselman. Let's talk about the
size of companies like in

322
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.020
my day job, I work
at Microsoft and it's big

323
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.350
enough that it has a
whole GDPR department, you know,

324
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.930
and it's not a temporary
thing anymore. Like it's full

325
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.650
time making sure that people
don't do the wrong thing,

326
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.620
which is good from a
privacy perspective. And in my

327
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.160
side job, I have a
podcast and a blog, and

328
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.940
there are a million or
millions of little small developers

329
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.490
that have no idea. If
they're going to get nailed.

330
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.060
Am I going to lose
my house? If someone comes

331
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.030
and says, I want to
be forgotten off of your

332
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.240
blog and I don't have
a way to solve that.

333
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.700
Well, you're absolutely right. The
first day that the GDPR

334
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.710
was enforced, there were complaints
filed against a bunch of

335
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:16.830
these very large companies. Facebook
is an obvious example, $664,000

336
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:21.480
was the equivalent of that
fine and dollars based upon

337
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.500
what they, what happened with
Cambridge Analytica. You know, you're

338
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.100
talking about Google being found
fine for abusing its mobile

339
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.810
software monopoly five point $1 billion.
They got a two point

340
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:38.430
$7 billion fine for a prior
year for abusing a search

341
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.580
monopoly. So my point is,
all these big companies are

342
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.450
getting fined, enormous amounts of
money, but they're not missing

343
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.320
a beat. The fines are
not destroying them. The fines

344
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.010
are not putting them out
of business. Whereas someone like

345
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.940
you're describing someone such as
yourself operating something on your

346
00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.840
own, you know, if you
even get a modest, fine,

347
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.130
that can shut you down.
So there was a, there

348
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.870
was a disproportionality of impact.
The fact that, that these

349
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.840
fines are large is not
the issue. The issue is

350
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.560
the proportionality of the fine
to the ability to pay.

351
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.390
And one of the wonderful
things about the, the internet

352
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.290
about, about the web is
that anybody can just throw

353
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:30.210
up a website with very
little capital and just go,

354
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.720
it's not the same kind
of infrastructure that has to

355
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.310
be paid for when you
have a brick and mortar

356
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.920
business, the way it used
to be. But, but if

357
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.550
by going, you're going right
into a sand trap and

358
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.790
you're going to be bankrupted
by some kind of crazy

359
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:49.950
fine that you never anticipated.
That's a problem. And it's

360
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.540
an unintended consequence of all
this. And I also want

361
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.240
to, if I may just
sort of get to another

362
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.620
level on this issue, because
when you think about it,

363
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.600
the other countries are getting
involved in this regulation of

364
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.590
privacy on the internet, various
States, such as California and

365
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:15.690
others are getting involved, but
someone's missing that. Someone's missing

366
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:21.450
from the discussion. Well, the
United States government, the federal government.

367
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.380
And I will tell you
that my view is that

368
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.980
to some extent, one extent
or another, and I guess

369
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.100
historians looking back on this
period of history will, will

370
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.170
give us the answer. We
don't know a completely right

371
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.990
now to one extent. I
know that the reason for

372
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.200
all this chaos and the
reason for all these questions

373
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:45.090
is that our federal government
meaning our Congress has not

374
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.040
taken up the issue of
digital privacy in a robust

375
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.560
way. Congress de-funded its own
office of technology years and

376
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.440
years ago, that would have
been the place to get

377
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.390
the kind of advice they
need to deal with this.

378
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.950
They, they had Mark Zuckerberg
testifying, but the questions they

379
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.740
were, they were really showing
a lack of understanding of

380
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:11.660
what Facebook does. So my
point is that in past,

381
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.620
in the past, these issues
that, that were broad, that

382
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.910
related to the entire United States
that were States were disagreeing

383
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.930
with one another. The idea
was that each state was

384
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.630
sort of a laboratory of
democracy. That's what it was

385
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.960
called. And then together, they
would all go up to

386
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.260
the Supreme court. There would
be a decision that it

387
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.840
would, they would go to
their, to their congressmen and

388
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.390
congresswomen, and they would ask
them to pass a law.

389
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.480
And there would be a
national consensus that would be

390
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:47.780
created through preemption of state
law, federal law, primacy over

391
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.010
state law. That's not happening.
That's not even on the

392
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.940
radar right now. So far
as I know. And because

393
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.660
of that, we're all left
to our own devices there

394
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.470
to, to, to sort of
sum it up. My opinion

395
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:09.020
is there should have been
much more robust negotiations between

396
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.110
the American government and the
European union, so that the

397
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.500
implementation of this was not
going to be this disruptive

398
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.040
and raise this many questions.
Number two, there should, the

399
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.270
federal government should have been
helping small businesses and medium

400
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.170
sized businesses to understand their
obligations and make it reasonable

401
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.920
and assist. I'm not talking
about handouts. I'm talking about

402
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.430
information, places to call right
now. We're all on our

403
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.640
own. And number three, I
do believe States should be

404
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.300
able to put in place
privacy regulations and laws. Of

405
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.220
course, that that is something
the state should be able

406
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.430
to do, but there should
also be an overarching way

407
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.550
that the federal government is
organizing this. So that business

408
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.860
has predictability and simplicity because
if you don't have that,

409
00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:00.760
the very unknown becomes a
drag on commerce. And just

410
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.860
to give a little bit
of context for folks who

411
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.340
might not have it in
1972, the office of technology

412
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.680
assessment was created. It was
defunded in 1995. And interestingly

413
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:16.000
enough, in June of 2018,
it was at attempted to

414
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.990
put in an amendment to
reinstate that long defunct office.

415
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.140
And that was voted down
a long party. And that

416
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.460
office of technology, you are
totally right about that. And

417
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:31.420
that office of technology assessment
was meant to deal with

418
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.960
the future. It was, it
was put in place decades

419
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.870
ago with the understanding that
they knew this is where

420
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.850
things were headed, but they
didn't know exactly how it

421
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.220
was going to go. But
the one thing they did

422
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:47.310
know was that Congress would
need to have objective advice

423
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.550
from its own body, that
they would, they would need

424
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.110
their own people to look
at this, not lobbyists, not

425
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.960
people with an agenda, but
their own people sort of

426
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.750
like the office of management
and budget and things like

427
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:05.310
that, where the government advises
itself and they defunded it.

428
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.050
So I've got two questions
here. The first one is

429
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.500
what, what can I, what
can a small or medium

430
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.860
sized business do about this?
And should they do what

431
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.160
major us news sites are
doing? Thousands of us news

432
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.920
sites have simply punted. I
know that we think of

433
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.520
news sites as being large
businesses, but they're surprisingly small

434
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.220
businesses. And a number of
them have just said, forget

435
00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.070
it. We don't really want
to serve the European community.

436
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.530
And if you come in,
we'll just, we won't even

437
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.130
do anything with GDPR. We'll
simply ignore the problem and

438
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:42.260
block you entirely. Right? And,
and that, that is a

439
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.430
major problem. And I would
argue that that those news

440
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:51.410
sites are really doing a
disservice to their readers. Let's

441
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.960
start with what shouldn't be
happening and then talk about

442
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.210
what should the businesses from,
from what I can tell

443
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.150
from, from people I see
from clients, I see from

444
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.590
people who are just in
this area, I will tell

445
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.760
you that there is a
patchwork of solutions. And the

446
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:17.240
patchwork generally is inadequate. You
have people with consent banners

447
00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.940
and opt out, as well
as opt ins and not

448
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.150
making a distinction between them.
They have something called a

449
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:32.690
nuke button to let you
reject everything, you know, basically.

450
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.240
And then, and then all
sorts of banners and other

451
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.930
things that you do. So
essentially it's such a panoply

452
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.560
of, of, of cause I'll
call it solutions. That's, that's

453
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.310
really solving nothing. So that's
so, so number one is

454
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.160
you shouldn't, you know, there's
an old saying you don't

455
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.760
want to react. What you
want to do is respond.

456
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.200
So the first thing is
don't just do something to

457
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.150
do something. Number two, I
think that there should be

458
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:09.500
collaboration with the developers, with
the outside vendors, with, with

459
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.860
people who are putting up
the content, you know, the

460
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.640
idea of just assessing liability
and figuring that there'll be

461
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.370
a lawsuit someday, if there's
a problem and let the

462
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.620
judge or jury figure it
out is not really a

463
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.500
solution. I think that there
has to be a collaborative

464
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.310
approach within the company with
its own vendors, with its

465
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.370
own developers, where everyone's talking
to one another, that may

466
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.060
sound pretty straight forward, but
I will tell you that

467
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:39.020
the CEO of the company
is getting advice from the

468
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.090
accounting firm, from the internal
marketing people and from the

469
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:47.350
developer. And it's all disjointed.
There should be a collaboration

470
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.930
among all of them. They
should all be talking together

471
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.940
and coming up with something
that works for the company

472
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.370
and complies with the law,
which then leads me to

473
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.750
the final point, which is,
I think that you need

474
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.840
a lawyer that is sort
of in this world and

475
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.820
understands it because the decision
on what to do is

476
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.440
going to be fairly nuanced.
And you know, that that

477
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.400
is a problem. And certainly
it is another layer of

478
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.820
responsibility and other way of
expense. And I'm not minimizing

479
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.910
that. I understand the problem,
but if you, if you

480
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.930
aren't bringing all the players
together and having them collaborate

481
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.290
to come up with some
kind of unifying solution, which

482
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.870
I'll, I'll be, it will
be an inadequate one because

483
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:35.680
we don't know all the
answers yet. You're making a

484
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.010
situation worse by just reacting
and just doing something to

485
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.540
do it. So it sounds
like those of us that

486
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.840
have small businesses, we can,
you know, do the popups,

487
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.320
do the privacy policy, make
sure that people have the

488
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.890
right to withdraw the water,
the right, to have their

489
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.740
data removed. All of the
things that you know, the

490
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.340
basics, but that really should
be looked at by someone

491
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.520
who has experienced in the
space. I think it has

492
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.670
to be. And at the
end of the day, we

493
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.390
have to have a commercial
maturity about this. And what

494
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.530
I mean by that is
it's not about setting people

495
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:18.120
up to blame later on.
If it goes wrong, that's

496
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.200
a simplistic and frankly not
constructive way of doing business.

497
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.900
In my opinion, you know,
the clients I work with

498
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.160
generally, don't do that. You
know, we, we tell our

499
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.840
clients that, that we know
this area. We know what

500
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.550
we think you should be
doing. We're aware of the

501
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:40.110
laws, but at a certain
level, there is always going

502
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.060
to be a leap of
faith as to how a

503
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:46.050
regulator or how law enforcement
in this country or any

504
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:50.010
other country would see something.
Especially if the complaint comes

505
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.650
not, not this month, but
comes, you know, two years

506
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.410
from now. And there just
has to be an understanding

507
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.730
that ultimately the client needs
to make the decision, but

508
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.370
it has to be based
upon facts. They have to

509
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:06.630
understand the situation, which means
that, you know, business, people

510
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.950
need to immerse themselves in
an understanding of, of the

511
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.560
law and the regulations they're
dealing with. And they can't

512
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:17.040
just abdicate that to their
professionals. One of the, one

513
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.610
of the things we try
to do is, is bring

514
00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.340
our clients in and not,
not talk down to them,

515
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.190
not just say, look, we're
the lawyers. We know the

516
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.110
law, just do it our
way. And if you don't

517
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.300
want to do it our
way, well, good luck. That's

518
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.820
not how we do it.
We explain all these things.

519
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.610
And to some extent, we
give them a level of

520
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.470
a, of instruction that you
wouldn't even see in a

521
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.310
law school in terms of
the specifics of the law

522
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.070
and the regulations so that
they, but the important thing

523
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.370
is they need the tools
to make the decisions because

524
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.560
ultimately they're the ones that
are going to be dealing

525
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.330
with the consequences to their
business. And so the, the

526
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.390
real answer here is that
if, if you, if anyone

527
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.180
assumes that there is a
simple way of handling this,

528
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.220
they're probably wrong. It is
complicated and you just have

529
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.800
to live with that because
that's the world we're in.

530
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.800
