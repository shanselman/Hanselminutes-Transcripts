<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

14
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.420
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hanselminutes today. I'm talking

15
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.120
with Heather Terenzio, she's the
co founder and CEO of

16
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.560
tectonic group. How are you?
I'm great. Thanks. Scott tectonic

17
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.710
group has a great web
presence. That explains what you

18
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.320
do, but I dug into
the Academy part of it.

19
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.600
Can you explain the difference
between the group and the

20
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.940
Academy? Sure. About five years
ago, we were having problems

21
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.230
finding our own talent, and
we decided we wanted to

22
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.530
find talent in all different
kinds of places and train

23
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.800
them ourselves to write code
the way that we thought

24
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.030
was best. And what we
did was we created tectonic

25
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.600
Academy and what we do
is we go out and

26
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
we look for talent and
all kinds of unexpected places

27
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.830
like baristas bus boys, you
name it. They've, we've actually

28
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.130
had folks out of the
foster care system, the jail

29
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.060
system, and then all the
way up to people who

30
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.080
have graduated from college with
mechanical engineering degrees. But now

31
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.120
these are people who just
are passionate and really want

32
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.610
to get into software development.
And so we bring them

33
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.480
into our Academy. It's actually
really selective to get into

34
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.450
and through the Academy, we
train them in about a

35
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.930
12 week program. And after
the program, they start pair

36
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.610
programming with our software developers
and eventually start working on

37
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.060
real life projects. And actually
the way our model works

38
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.280
now is that a client
can hire us to write

39
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.290
their software. And we'll do
that with our real senior

40
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.830
level development team, but we'll
also be training up apprentices

41
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.890
at the same time and
our clients can actually hire

42
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.220
those apprentices as full time
employees after working with us

43
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.430
for about six months. Oh,
interesting. I worked as a

44
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.370
consultant for many years and
we always had a situation

45
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.950
where the client would really
enjoy working with someone and

46
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.620
then they try to hire
them and we discourage that.

47
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.040
But in fact, you're doing
the opposite. Yeah. You know,

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.680
it's been an interesting pivot
for us in terms of

49
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.520
our business model, because what
we're finding is actually millennials

50
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.270
change jobs about every two
years anyway, and our clients

51
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.640
are looking for talent. And
so we figured we would

52
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.970
find a way to kind
of smooth that transition from

53
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.430
working for us and getting
them trained up on client

54
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.100
projects and then working for
our clients. So we've now

55
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.860
become this company that writes
software, but also creates a

56
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.080
talent pipeline for our clients,
Not to put too fine

57
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.590
a point on it, but
your, you have an advanced

58
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.770
degree. You went to Cornell,
you have civil engineering degree,

59
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.260
you have an environmental engineering
degree, but now you're talking

60
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.010
about creating software engineers from,
and again, no disrespect to

61
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.000
hard work from baristas. Where
does someone with a formal

62
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.670
engineering background, where do you
fall on whether or not

63
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.060
college is necessary to be
an engineer? Well, what's really

64
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.630
interesting. It's because of my
background that, and I actually

65
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.670
didn't learn how to code
until I was on the

66
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.840
job. And so, and everybody
in, in technology has a

67
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.410
story around the best software
that developer that they ever

68
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.620
met didn't necessarily have a
college degree. We've if you're

69
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.020
been in this industry long
enough, you know, some English

70
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.700
major or self-taught coder, who's
been teaching themselves to code.

71
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.280
And so as a part
of my degree, I took

72
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.430
some software development classes, but
I didn't actually learn how

73
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.770
to code until I was
on the job. And it

74
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.400
was that experience that gave
me the aha idea that,

75
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.070
you know, Hey, this isn't
stuff I learned in college,

76
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.020
this is stuff I learned
actually on the job. And

77
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.910
there's probably a lot of
people out there who can

78
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.930
do the same without a
college degree. That's interesting now,

79
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.870
but your degrees are in
civil engineering and environmental engineering.

80
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.610
Does that mean that someone
could go and become one

81
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.920
of those kinds of engineers,
not a software engineer, but

82
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.610
one of those without a
degree, I would say not

83
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.720
necessarily, because there's a lot
more that goes into it.

84
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.530
And there's actually accreditations that
have to happen to be

85
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.200
a civil engineer. And I
think that would be hard

86
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.690
to get on your own,
but with software development, it

87
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.950
truly is a skill that
can be learned. And, you

88
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.180
know, with a foundation, a
little ambition and desire, you

89
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.730
can actually teach yourself how
to be a software developer.

90
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.190
Whereas, you know, there's a
lot, obviously there's a lot

91
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.250
more at stake with civil
engineering, right? You're building bridges

92
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.420
and roads. And you know,
there's a long history of

93
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.810
academics that come into being
good civil engineers and mechanical

94
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.680
engineers. But with software development,
it's, you know, it's something

95
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.260
that can be taught and
it's something you mostly learn

96
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.990
on the job. And I
think most college grads in

97
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.960
computer science would tell you
that they got a great

98
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.720
foundation in college, but they
didn't really learn how to

99
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.050
do software engineering until they
were on the job. Yeah.

100
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.480
We talk a lot about
that foundation on the show

101
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.560
here. And sometimes I use
the term historical context about

102
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.460
whether or not someone needs
to understand the historical context

103
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.560
of the internet in order
to write good HTML or

104
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.220
good JavaScript and people seem
to be split on the,

105
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.880
on that subject. Well, I
think there's, there's always going

106
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.000
to be different levels of
engineers and there's people who

107
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.090
we need to write code.
And then there's people who

108
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.150
need to take a much,
you know, the 50,000 foot

109
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.550
view of what you're building
and how the product's going

110
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.490
to be built and see
the bigger picture. And so

111
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.920
there's, you know, there's definitely
a need for both, right?

112
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.110
There's need for people who
can write code and get

113
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.750
the application to do exactly
what you want it to

114
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.370
do. And then there's people
who have to look at

115
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.430
the big picture and understand
from a business standpoint, an

116
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.810
engineering standpoint and architectural standpoint,
what this application is going

117
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.180
to look like. And so
both those people can work

118
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.560
very closely together to build
great software products. Yeah. Yeah.

119
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.840
That's a good point. I
think that it's really easy

120
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.610
to say, Oh, I'm a
coder or, Oh, I'm a

121
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.840
programmer, but there are there's
intersectionality within programming. There's not

122
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.580
just junior, senior architect, et
cetera, but there's, there's testing,

123
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.850
there's automation, there's build engineers.
There's all kinds of flavors

124
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.340
of engineer that one could
be and they don't all

125
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.500
need formal education. Absolutely. So
this is very exclusive. I

126
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.560
understand that there was one,
one time you had 400

127
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.330
folks show up for five
spots. Yeah, it is. Well,

128
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.850
the great thing about what
we do is we pay

129
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.400
people on day one to
be a member of our

130
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.880
apprenticeship program. And that's because
we're a department of labor

131
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.140
approved apprenticeship program as part
of the DOL regulations are

132
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.870
that you pay people on
day one. So think about

133
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.840
your options in terms of
choosing a bootcamp or choosing

134
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.600
us at a bootcamp, you'll
have to take six months

135
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.160
off of work and pay
20, sometimes $30,000. And with

136
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.000
us, you're actually getting paid
on day one. So it's

137
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.770
become very competitive to get
in. And we've actually had

138
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.240
to modify our entrance criteria
and the work it takes

139
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.730
to actually get in. But
we really feel like we're

140
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.210
producing an amazing software developer
at the end of our

141
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.910
program. Can you talk a
little bit about what that

142
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.610
means to be an a
department of labor approved apprenticeship

143
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.220
program? Because you've mentioned that
before in interviews, and I

144
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.710
wonder, is that a hard
thing? Is that more paperwork?

145
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.380
What does that, what does
that stamp of approval? It's

146
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.590
hard paperwork. So it takes
a lot of paperwork to

147
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.740
get through it, but when
we actually, well, the story

148
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.710
behind it is that we
started calling ourselves an apprenticeship

149
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.770
program fairly early on because
that's what we were doing.

150
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.720
We were bringing people in
and we were training them

151
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.870
side by side with more
senior level folks, exactly like

152
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.890
a plumber or an electrician
might learn their trade. And

153
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.730
we soon learned that it
was an actual federal designation

154
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.220
to be an apprenticeship program.
And so kind of tongue

155
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.430
in cheek, we thought we
were being clever and we

156
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.930
applied to become an official
apprenticeship program. And it was

157
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.690
a lot of paperwork, but
actually no software development company

158
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.870
had ever applied for this
before. So it was actually

159
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.290
written for plumbers and electricians,
and we had to rewrite

160
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:59.100
the entire documentation to a
software development career. And we

161
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.560
did all that. We worked
very closely with the DOL.

162
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.840
It took us about 18
months to get through the

163
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.980
whole process. And we were
the first DOL approved software

164
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.240
development apprenticeship program in the
country. There's a couple today.

165
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.480
There's a handful out there
and it's actually, I believe

166
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.540
it's much easier today because
we laid a lot of

167
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.150
that groundwork early on How
long is a registered apprentice

168
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.540
program. I understand that a
plumber might spend 32 months

169
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.300
learning to be a plumber
before they move on. Ours

170
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:34.070
is a purely competency-based and,
and skills based. So it's

171
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.580
not time restricted. And with
plumbers and electricians, I believe

172
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.650
most of them are time
restricted. And it does take

173
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.270
a certain amount of time
that you have to put

174
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.390
in. But with us, it's
a minimum of six months,

175
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.880
but it's actually taken people
longer just to get all

176
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.990
their competencies signed off on.
So at a minimum six

177
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.070
months, but sometimes a little
bit longer. And then there's

178
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.890
usually a competency model or
a way to go and

179
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.000
determine someone's competency. How do
you determine that someone is,

180
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.430
is ready to be a
junior engineer and move? Do

181
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.030
they move from intern to,
or rather apprentice to journeyman

182
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.910
or journey person to junior
engineer? Yeah. Which approximates the

183
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.900
progress. We've moved from apprentice
to a full time junior

184
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.220
engineer. And that's a, that's
part of our process And

185
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.770
it does someone need to
have a GED or a

186
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.080
high school, you know, what's
the, what's the spread of

187
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.360
education that people come into
this with. Yeah. We've had

188
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.690
folks with GDS and you
know, who just had been

189
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.590
teaching themselves to code for
years. And then we've had

190
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.340
people with advanced degrees in
other fields who now decided

191
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.770
they want to get into
software development. And I think

192
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.670
actually we've been really successful
in attracting women to these

193
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.760
fields. I think a lot
of women go into college

194
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.330
and start out as English
majors or philosophy sociology, kind

195
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.110
of the softer sciences, and
then decide they want to

196
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.750
get into a tech career,
but can't necessarily afford to

197
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.420
start from the beginning again.
But we give them an

198
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.700
opportunity to cost-effectively launch their
careers in tech. And so

199
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.840
are actually, our next class
was over 50% women. And

200
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.510
a lot of them have
those kinds of backgrounds who,

201
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.020
you know, have a college
degree, but in something else

202
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.950
and now want to get
into technology. Yeah. It really

203
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.050
resonated with me when you
said that everyone has that

204
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.020
story of that person with
a non tech degree, who

205
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.000
is the best program where
they ever met the best

206
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.700
one I ever met had
a masters in music. Yeah.

207
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.770
Actually music majors are really
great software developers. There's something

208
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.020
with the mindset of a
music major that makes you

209
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.600
a really great software developer.
And we've had actually several

210
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.520
really talented musicians come into
our program. You mentioned also

211
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.790
that you're pulling from kind
of nontraditional places. You said

212
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.640
millennials, but you also mentioned
the foster care system. But

213
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.970
I understand also that you
have had a convicted felons,

214
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.260
which are folks who very
often feel like construction or

215
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.810
food service is all that
they're able to define from

216
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.520
a jobs perspective. Yeah. I
mean, you know, companies are

217
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.870
much more open to, you
know, look overlooking people's backgrounds.

218
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.140
But the story we have
with a felon was that

219
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.050
we were in our office
one day and this young

220
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.930
man walked in and said,
I read an article about

221
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.140
Heather and Forbes when I
was in jail. And I've

222
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.540
been teaching myself to code
for the past 10 years.

223
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.150
And I'd love to work
here. And we said, great,

224
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.800
you know, leave us a
resume. We'll take a look

225
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.540
at it. And he said,
I don't want to put

226
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.670
my resume on a stack
of resumes. I want to,

227
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.950
I really want to work
here. And so we asked

228
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.080
them to volunteer for a
couple of weeks, for two

229
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.630
weeks to see what he
had. And it turned out

230
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.960
he was a very, very
talented developer and he'd spent

231
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.630
a lot of time learning
to code and he made

232
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.540
some mistakes early. He was
a fairly young guy. He

233
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.880
was only 20 years old,
but when he was 18,

234
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.420
he was selling drugs and
you know, wasn't a bad

235
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.050
guy. He wasn't violent and
he needed a second chance

236
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.360
and we gave that to
him. And she's now a

237
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.770
really successful software developer. Does
that seem like something that

238
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.160
could be scalable? I wonder
with 400 folks for five

239
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.860
spots, how do you scale
something like this? Well, our

240
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.310
next class is actually 20
people and we're working with

241
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:16.230
some really large national companies
to create a larger talent

242
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.100
strategy for them. So kind
of having them leverage our

243
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.360
apprenticeship program to streamline people
who are specifically trained in

244
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.750
their technologies to go work
for their companies. And so

245
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.960
we'd see, 'em, we'd probably
be in three different cities

246
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.930
in the next couple of
years. And, you know, I

247
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.570
could see us building out
our Boulder Denver presence quite

248
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.360
a bit in the next
few years as well. I've

249
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.020
heard interns at big companies,
the Microsofts and the Googles

250
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.960
and the Facebooks say that
they felt that the pace

251
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.240
was too much and that
the engineers that were working

252
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.910
there, I didn't have time
to sit with them. And

253
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.400
to really spend that time.
How do you build that

254
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.880
into something as, as, as
competitive as, as you know,

255
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.640
software for hire? Yeah. Well,
it's interesting in our field

256
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.820
too, is when people like
Microsoft or Google talk about

257
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.520
an entry level software developer,
they're really talking about somebody

258
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.430
with three to five years
of experience and you can't

259
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.920
get three to five years
of experience. If nobody will

260
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.710
take a junior level person
with less than that. So

261
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.710
it was kind of this
interesting catch 22, but that's

262
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.050
really where we come in
to bridge that gap. And

263
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:23.340
we are taking people and
giving them that initial entree

264
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.430
into this field. I mean,
if you think about somebody

265
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.670
coming through a bootcamp and
you look on their resume

266
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.240
and it says Starbucks bootcamp,
and now I want a

267
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.290
job as opposed to somebody
who comes from Starbucks, then

268
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.670
apprenticeship program. Then I was
an employee at tectonic, and

269
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.770
now I'm looking for a
job. That second person is

270
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.110
going to be a lot
more attractive because they have

271
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.070
on the job experience and
much higher percentage of getting

272
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.540
placed at a great company.
So it's that bootcamp doesn't

273
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.840
necessarily give you the launch.
You need, you really need

274
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.990
that job experience. And that's
the stop gap that we

275
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.420
provide. How much context do
you think people need in

276
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.630
just using a computer I've
met? Well, we were joking

277
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:12.760
about something recently on Twitter.
Jack Ryan is on Amazon right

278
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.580
now and he has a
PhD in economics and he

279
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.140
made a comment about using
SQL queries, you know, and

280
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.810
everyone's talking about that. And
one of the people, someone

281
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.730
from academia came in and
said, well, he has a

282
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.760
PhD in economics. Like don't
expect him to talk like

283
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.010
a software engineer. And I
thought that was a really

284
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.010
interesting comment because just because
someone has an advanced degree

285
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.490
in anything engineering or otherwise,
it doesn't mean that they're

286
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.540
an expert computer user, which
brings me to the question

287
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.850
I'm noticing as I teach
my 10 and 12 year

288
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.120
olds that they get lost
in the computer a lot,

289
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.790
they can browse, but if
they could lose a file,

290
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.700
it might end up on
C colon temp instead of

291
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.610
their desktop. And then they
go hunting for it. I

292
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.830
could see the same things
happening with someone starting out

293
00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.310
as an engineer, getting confused
as they move around the

294
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.100
machine itself. Well, most of
the people that come to

295
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.740
us kind of already know
they want to get into

296
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.670
this career and have really
started dabbling in, you know,

297
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.480
computers and building code and
writing applications. And most of

298
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.360
them have written something on
their own or at least

299
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.720
gone onto code Academy and
taken a few classes. But

300
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.060
you know, in this day
and age, like everybody should

301
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.270
know what SQL Curry is,
right. Everybody should have some

302
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.330
kind of foundation in what
it takes to make a

303
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.840
computer are, do what you
want it to do. And,

304
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.200
you know, maybe instead of
teaching Shakespeare going forward, you

305
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.290
know, we should be teaching,
you know, the basics of

306
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:43.180
software development. And so that,
yeah, absolutely not nothing against

307
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.720
Shakespeare. Yeah, of course. My
10 year old recently took

308
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.660
a class that was called
tech skills for middle school

309
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.020
success. And it was literally,
you know, copying files from

310
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.150
here to there opening word
and doing those kinds of

311
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.710
things. I think a lot
of stuff that people take

312
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.370
to people take for granted
a big thank you to

313
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.860
our sponsors because they make
this show possible. And I

314
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.440
hope that you support them
the way they support us

315
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.160
progress. Software is the creator
of the most comprehensive developer

when people come into your,

329
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.040
your program, now they are
given that the title apprentice,

330
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.190
then junior engineer, what kind
of money can they can

331
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.400
someone make? And if they
started as a junior engineer,

332
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.760
do, does it help or
hinder their long term earning

333
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.000
potential? Well, when we, when
you first come into our

334
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.660
apprenticeship program, you'll make $15
an hour to start. And

335
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.560
that actually starts stepping up
and junior engineers really, depending

336
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.480
on the level that you
finish up at and the

337
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.450
kinds of responsibility that you're
taking on, I mean, you

338
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.810
can make anywhere from 50
to 75,000 a year, and

339
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.740
we've had people start all
within those ranges. And then,

340
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.580
you know, as it actually
scales up very quickly from

341
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.050
there. So within three years
you can be making $90,000

342
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:50.190
a year. It's a, it's
a really fast career path.

343
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.980
And the unemployment rate in
at least in Colorado is

344
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.040
less than 2% for software
developers. So you can really,

345
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.270
you know, bounce around and
look for higher and higher

346
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.460
salaries, or you can look
for more and more meaningful

347
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.240
work whatever's important to you.
But yeah, the pay is

348
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.850
definitely there. And I mean,
really what we're doing is

349
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.610
we're providing a great pathway
to a middle class career

350
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.850
without having to incur any
of that college debt. If

351
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.030
that's the route you're taking
with us. And I shop

352
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.000
somewhere, if I, if I'm,
if I remember correctly that

353
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.570
you had something like a
95% placement rate. Yeah. Because

354
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.430
I mean, if you make
it, our, first of all,

355
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.920
our selection process is really
hard to get through. And

356
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.440
then once you get through
the class and then you're

357
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.450
on the floor with us
for awhile. So there's a

358
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.080
lot of hoops to get
through. And, you know, if

359
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.850
you can make it through
all that, you will be

360
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.570
successful in this field. And
really the people, the 5%

361
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.140
who are not included, or
just decided to, you know,

362
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.860
go back to school or
stay at home with kids

363
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.850
kind of things. But yeah,
it's, it's a great career

364
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.930
path. I understand that inclusion
is a big part of

365
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.180
this. You're bringing in women,
you're bringing in people of

366
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.410
color veterans at risk youth.
Everyone has a different communication

367
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:10.200
style and you're describing a
very, very, you know, intense

368
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.470
onboarding process and vetting process.
How do you make sure

369
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.160
that you're not losing a
potential talent because you might

370
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.180
be thinking culture fit and
how people communicate everyone's different.

371
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.430
You know, actually something I
write about quite a bit

372
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.220
is that I, I can't
stand the term culture fit.

373
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.080
I apologize. I think too
many companies have grabbed onto

374
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.710
that. And it, to me
it's become code for, you

375
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.930
know, we hire people who
look like us, act like

376
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.210
us at the same background
as us and cause that's

377
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.300
our culture. And so what
we have said is, you

378
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.820
know, we don't hire for
cultural fit. What we hire

379
00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.950
for is skills. And we
hire for people who can

380
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.100
communicate effectively with us. And
we actually like that people

381
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.530
are all different kinds of
backgrounds and all different kinds

382
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.070
of cultures and say, we,
you know, we write better

383
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.140
software because of it. Because
when we come at a

384
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.440
problem, we have six people
sitting around the table who

385
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.920
are coming at it from
very different backgrounds and viewpoints.

386
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.240
And ultimately we're able to
build better software because of

387
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.940
it because we have people
who aren't all of the

388
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.670
same, you know, culture. Right.
I appreciate that. And I

389
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.890
think people who are listening
will appreciate that as well.

390
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.190
I understand also that you
received a grant from the

391
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.040
Colorado department of labor too,
to grow this forward. How

392
00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.870
do you get visibility at
the government level on an

393
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.530
apprenticeship? Well, because we're a
DOL certified apprenticeship program. It

394
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.370
actually qualifies us for grants.
You know, most people think

395
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.630
of grants going to only
nonprofits, but apprenticeship programs also

396
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.440
do qualify for grants. And
there's not a ton of

397
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.020
them. There's a few each
year, but Colorado has been

398
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.110
an amazing state to grow
this program because they are

399
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:54.000
very interested in this apprenticeship
concept and creating talent and

400
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.430
helping to solve the skills
gap that we have here

401
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.000
in Colorado. And so we
work really closely with our

402
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.040
local workforce centers, with CDLE
con Colorado department of labor

403
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.640
and employment to, to help
grow this. And they've really

404
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.350
been instrumental partners in this
entire process for us. And

405
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.540
you've been appointed to a
board by the governor to

406
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.580
work on things like that.
Yeah. I'm on the Colorado

407
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.050
workforce development board. And actually
I'm just getting started. I've

408
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.810
only attended two meetings thus
far, but it's actually been

409
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:30.060
really interesting digging in from
policy level into these workforce

410
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.690
solutions because you know, if
companies can't find the right

411
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.410
talent, they can't grow. And
you know, obviously in Colorado,

412
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:42.450
the politicians are very interested
in keeping us growing Last

413
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:45.930
year about December-ish the U
S rate unemployment rate was

414
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:50.550
about four, 4.1, but Colorado
has a, almost 3% or

415
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.110
a little bit less than
3%. So you've got a

416
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.600
really low unemployment rate, but
then you commented that there

417
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.020
was a skills gap. So
you've got low unemployment, but

418
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.090
maybe you can't find the
people you with the skills

419
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.450
you need. Yeah. And that's,
that's why our, The program

420
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.360
has been getting so much
attention as because we're able

421
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:13.110
to convert retail workers, baristas
into software developers. So even

422
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.560
though the Colorado economy is
doing amazing and lots of

423
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.990
people are doing really well.
There's a lot of people

424
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.960
who are left behind and
they're in these minimum wage

425
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:24.150
jobs and they can't afford
to go to a bootcamp

426
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.310
and they can't afford to
get into these kinds of

427
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.130
careers. And what this has
really done for those kinds

428
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:33.330
of people is provided that
bridge from barista to software

429
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.070
developer or even English major
into software developer. Interesting. I'm

430
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.500
curious why you use <inaudible>
seems to be like a

431
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.320
good go-to kind of archetype
though, but I think we

432
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.070
all, we all know that
person that's on way somewhere.

433
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.570
If they haven't chosen barista
as their final destination, We've

434
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.920
had amazing luck with baristas
because they know that the

435
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:59.410
customer service side they're good
communicators, good multitaskers. We also

436
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.080
had amazing luck with folks
from the Verizon store and

437
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.600
the Apple store, again, personable,
outgoing, but like technology and

438
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.760
our, you know, kind of
looking for the next step

439
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.030
in their career. My wife
and I were trying to

440
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.910
teach the boys about that
idea of that person that

441
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.580
you meet behind the counter,
where, you know, they're going

442
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.370
somewhere. Cause they just have
that, that spark a personality,

443
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.610
whether it's the person that
puts the guacamole on your

444
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.310
food at Chipotle, you just
go, Hey, this person's going

445
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.400
to be running this place
within a year. And those

446
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.660
are the kinds of people
you want sounds like you

447
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.300
want to hire. Yes, exactly.
And like I said, we've

448
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.180
had many, many of them
come through and they've been

449
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.840
very successful with us. Why
do you think that apprenticeships

450
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.360
kind of fell out of
Vogue after the, you know,

451
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.880
the eighties and nineties and
why are we rediscovering them

452
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:49.030
and almost 2020, well, you
know, for better or worse,

453
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.220
there's been this huge push
for people to go to

454
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.030
college. And I come from
an immigrant family and I

455
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.280
was the first generation among
my family to go to

456
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.470
college. And there was really
never any question that I

457
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.500
wasn't going to go to
college. And that was the

458
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.130
road from, you know, my
grandfather came from Italy as

459
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.060
you know, Mason and you
know, then his son went

460
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.040
to community college and then
I was able to go

461
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.930
to an Ivy league college
and that's kind of the

462
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.490
immigrant American dream. And everybody
has this mindset. That college

463
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.980
is the way, you know,
to get into these white

464
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.000
collar jobs. But you know,
now with everybody going to

465
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.290
college and you know, and
incurring so much student debt,

466
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.600
it really isn't making as
much sense as it did

467
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.600
in the past. And so
I, I heard a statistic

468
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.070
that used to be that
you could work through the

469
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.170
summer and be able to
afford a year of college.

470
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.960
And today you'd need to
work for an entire year

471
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.180
full time in order to
be able to afford a

472
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:47.260
year of college. And so
everybody encouraging that kind of

473
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.380
debt to be an English
major or something, that's not

474
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.050
going to get them an
immediate payback in terms of

475
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.260
a career. It's not making
as much sense as it

476
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.770
did in the past. And
so apprenticeships fell out of

477
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.850
favor because you know, the
trades, weren't a great pathway

478
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.580
to a middle class career,
but at least in Colorado,

479
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.090
there's a huge need for
the trades and they pay

480
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.910
really well. And with you
can get into the trades

481
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.910
without actually any college debt.
Would you think it's fair

482
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.520
to say then that software
engineering is now part of

483
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.350
the trades. Would you put
it up there with a

484
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.740
skilled electrician? I think it
could be a it's again,

485
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.260
it's something you can learn.
It's something you don't need

486
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.780
a full on college degree
to be really good at.

487
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.070
And I don't see why
not? Yeah. Let me ask

488
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:37.030
you this though. We see
people doing HTML and CSS.

489
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.790
Could you bring someone in
doing IOT or hardware or

490
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.490
cloud development? Is it just
about front end web development

491
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.980
or is it software engineering
of all flavors? It's all

492
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.010
flavors. I mean, it can
be taught, right? You don't

493
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.700
and you know, in college
probably, you know, how much

494
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.220
of those credits are within
your actual major and how

495
00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.710
much of that is all
the stuff to make you

496
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.400
a really well rounded individual.
And so if you kind

497
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.130
of scrape away all the
other stuff and unbundle the

498
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.920
college experience so that you're
just learning the pieces you

499
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.700
need for your actual job,
you know, you can be

500
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.970
a great software developer. You
might not be great at

501
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.020
cocktail parties talking about other
things, but you'll know software

502
00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.250
development. And you know, most
colleges pride themselves on not

503
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.730
being trade schools, but you
know, there is a need

504
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.060
for this trade of software
developer. And we need to

505
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.970
kind of fast track people
into these careers just to

506
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.930
support the businesses that we
have in the country Back.

507
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.040
I've been in software now
for 25 years, but 15

508
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.110
years ago, I went back
to school to finish my

509
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.590
degree. So the first 10
years of my software experience,

510
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.790
I was not a degreed
software engineer. I went back

511
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.340
for myself. I didn't go
back because I necessarily felt

512
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.020
pressure. I just felt like
it was a thing that

513
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:59.990
was not completed, but a
number of people in underrepresented

514
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.630
minorities expressed to me that
there's a certain amount of

515
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.200
privilege involved in being able
to be 10, 15, 20

516
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.660
years into the business and
not think about your degree

517
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.950
anymore. Well, some folks still,
even with a decade plus

518
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.770
get asked, what school did
you go to? And as

519
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.230
such, like you said, the
immigrant dream is to go

520
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.000
to like an Ivy league
school or a top tier

521
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.400
school, as opposed to a
state school. Do you think

522
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.390
that that interns or pardon
me rather apprentices who have

523
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.540
become engineers and then grown
up to senior will have

524
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.540
any kind of, for lack
of a better word, prejudice

525
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:35.180
against them saying, well, you
came up in a nontraditional

526
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.370
way and then they would
have to go back to

527
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.890
school. You know, I think
in the past that may

528
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.650
have been the case. I'm
actually still surprised at how

529
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.170
much my education comes up
and you know, it was

530
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.070
20 years ago or longer
in it. But, you know,

531
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.940
especially in software development, once
you've proven your chops, people

532
00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.410
want you on board and
it really doesn't matter as

533
00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.560
much anymore. It's really matters
what you can do. And,

534
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.590
you know, even with our
industry credentials kind of come

535
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.920
in and out of Vogue
because, you know, you can

536
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.350
have all the credentials you
need, but you could still

537
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.130
not be a great software
developer, right? So we just

538
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:16.130
need people who can work
well with, within a team

539
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.280
and write good code and
think critically about what they're

540
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.000
doing. And, you know, the
school stuff doesn't matter as

541
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.360
much, but I should actually
mention though that as being

542
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.080
a DOL apprenticeship program, when
you get through our program,

543
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.970
you qualify for 39 credits
college credits. Oh Wow. So

544
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.030
you could jumpstart your college
career as an athlete. I

545
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.860
mean, we were accredited for
39 credits. It depends on

546
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.130
whether that college will take
all 39 of those, but

547
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:49.060
it's a great start to
a college degree and getting

548
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.160
what you need. And we're
actually really proud of that

549
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.260
fact because, you know, we're
recognized as an educational facility

550
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.260
here because we're teaching, you
know, all the basics of

551
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.690
software development and learning it
on the job. And we're

552
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.800
glad that, you know, other
colleges recognize that no, no

553
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.380
disrespect to boot camps, but
there are some that are

554
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.440
saying that kind of the
shine is off of the

555
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.900
enthusiasm around boot camps. And
I was one of the

556
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.300
biggest events that would remain
a large fan of bootcamps,

557
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.100
but when bootcamps became as
expensive as my belief, you

558
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.020
know, a year and I
would make school 25 grand

559
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.600
people were, you know, could,
could have used the system.

560
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.840
Do you think that the
apprenticeship program is superior to

561
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.090
bootcamps and the shine might
be off boot camps? I

562
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:34.630
really do. I mean, you
know, I built this program

563
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.240
from the ground up. We
built it out of a

564
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.860
need to be more inclusive.
I think bootcamps, the face

565
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.620
of the bootcamp is still
reflective of, you know, the

566
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:49.450
typical tech employee, which is
predominantly white male, but really

567
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.360
because we pay people on
day one, it's really opened

568
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.520
the doors to all different
kinds of people. And actually

569
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.970
without even really trying, we,
we are incredibly diverse as

570
00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:02.530
a company where 75% women
minorities and veterans. And that's

571
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:06.940
just because we've paved the
way for somebody who might

572
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.310
have a minimum wage job
right now to actually get

573
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.470
into this kind of a
career. And it really shows

574
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.830
that once you strip away
that level of privilege, that

575
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.320
all different kinds of people
are really interested in getting

576
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.370
involved in software. It really
feels like if you cast

577
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.370
a wide net, if you
cast a really wide net,

578
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.130
you will pull in a
representative group of people and,

579
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:31.390
and, and you get kind
of diversity and inclusion, I

580
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.820
wouldn't say for free, but
because of that wide net,

581
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.840
you're getting what America looks
like as opposed to our

582
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.530
slide, a small slice of
it. Yes, exactly. Fantastic. Well,

583
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.390
thank you so much for
chatting with me today. Yeah.

584
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.130
Thank you. This has been
fun. I'm going to put

585
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.560
links to everything that the
tectonic group is doing in

586
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.510
the show notes, and you
can be sure to connect

587
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.000
with them and learn all
about the great work that

588
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.460
they're doing out there in
Boulder. Thanks so much. Thank

589
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.550
you, Scott. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

590
00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:19.440
we'll see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
