8
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.820
Ilana Finegold about the Plex
software ecosystem. Hi, this is

9
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.160
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes and

10
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.820
I'm on the phone with
Elon Finegold from Hawaii. That's

11
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.010
awesome. Thanks. Great to be
here. Thanks for having me

12
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.480
on. So you're the lead
developer on the Plex project

13
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.020
on the Plex, which parts
of Plex do you are

14
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.570
the lead on? Well, that's
a good question. I I've

15
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.750
worked on a lot of
things over the years. Pretty

16
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.390
much a lot of the
clients, the service software, the

17
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.020
cloud software pretty much anywhere
I've needed. So I'm kind

18
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.420
of all over the place
depending on where I'm needed.

19
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.930
So I got introduced to
Plex a couple of years

20
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.270
ago when I was trying
to find the thing, you

21
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.850
know, the, the, the great
media center, like this has

22
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.790
been the, the quest of
my life to find a

23
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.800
media. I did windows media
center and I've tried to

24
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.110
ex NBC and I'm trying
as BMC and all the,

25
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.320
just, all I want to
do is watch my movies

26
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.790
wherever and whenever on everything.
And I'm like, is that

27
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.980
so hard? But it has
always been a challenge. What

28
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.600
is Plex do? That's different.
It turns out to be

29
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.480
hard. Yeah, you're, you're absolutely
right. And, and it was

30
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.780
actually scratching that media itch
that, that kind of brought

31
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.510
me to the project in
the first place. But, but

32
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.950
you've, you've essentially stated your,
your desire is essentially exactly

33
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.020
what we set out to
provide, which is your media

34
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.130
anywhere you are, and at
any time. So we sort

35
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.890
of try to, you know,
there's, there's obviously a few

36
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.930
different ways to consume media.
If you're inside your house,

37
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.270
you're on a local network,
you generally have some sort

38
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.160
of thing hooked up to
a big screen TV. So

39
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.670
that's kinda like one, one
way to consume media. Then

40
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.860
people have mobile devices. So
they might be walking around

41
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.050
the house with an iPhone
or an iPad. And then

42
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.690
they also might be outside
of the house, you know,

43
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.110
in a car during a
commute and even further and

44
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.480
more difficult is like on
a submarine with no internet

45
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.050
access. So what we strive
to do is give you

46
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.540
access to all of your
media in all of those

47
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.990
different situations and keep it
on. Not only that, because

48
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.470
that might not be that
hard, just, just that part.

49
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.230
But we also strive to
give you sort of a

50
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.800
centralized view and history and
all of your media. So

51
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.440
whether you're watching on the
submarine and coming back later,

52
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.680
or on an airplane or
streaming live, everything's kind of

53
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.150
cohesive and coherent and every
year view history and stuff

54
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.990
like that is kept in
one centralized area. Yeah. When

55
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.170
I started with my quest
to watch anything, whenever I

56
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.720
wanted to, I basically just,
I throw it up on

57
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.540
a share on my, my
NAS on my network attached

58
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.660
storage. I happened to have
a Synology and then I

59
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.540
tried to use different clients
to pull from that share.

60
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.030
And I kind of figured,
well, there's the windows sharing

61
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.730
protocol and, you know, SMB
standard, you know, simple message

62
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.170
block. And it's on whack
whack server, whack movies. And

63
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.690
I would use my PlayStation
over here in this room.

64
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.750
I use my windows machine
in this room. I use

65
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.000
some weird app that I
found on the iPad, and

66
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.170
I was attempting to pull
these things to the devices

67
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.660
I wanted to watch them
on. And then trust that

68
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.990
each of these very diverse
devices and very diverse pieces

69
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.140
of software would know how
to read the MP4 container

70
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.840
that I was with. And
I would inevitably find myself

71
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.350
where some things played some
places and they were very

72
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.780
unreliable. It was very frustrating.
Why is this such a

73
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.900
problem with MP4? I thought
that this was a solved

74
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.760
problem. Well, going with MP4
is actually definitely if you're

75
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.340
looking for a universal compatibility
is definitely one of the

76
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.120
best container formats to go
with. It's probably the best.

77
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.650
There are some nuances to
MP4, like for example, depends

78
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.410
the, the metadata for the
file, the, the move Adam,

79
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.150
so to speak can be
at the beginning of the

80
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.970
file, the end of the
file. Some players only play

81
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.000
if it's at the beginning
of the file, but not

82
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.860
all software generates that at
the beginning of the file.

83
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.170
So that's a difficulty there's
also codex involved. Generally MP4

84
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.580
is have HT six, four,
which works fine for video,

85
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.240
but for the audio, you
could have a C you

86
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.990
could have AC three, some
people even crazily MCSE DTS

87
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.690
into their MP four files.
So there's just a lot

88
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.430
of different, you know, and
then don't get me started

89
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.830
with subtitles. It was my
next problem. I went and

90
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.840
I got a, a, a,
I was looking at captain

91
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.600
Phillips and I was trying
to watch captain Phillips and

92
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.670
I'm watching this thing and
I'm on Plex and I'm

93
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.680
on the plane. And it
gets to the part where

94
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.650
the Somali pirates start talking.
And I have no idea

95
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.470
what these guys are talking
about. So apparently the subtitles

96
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.610
didn't make it over. Yeah.
And that, that's actually where

97
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.130
you're saying where there is
a fascinating case because in

98
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.830
that case, so we try
to do a bunch of

99
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.530
cover things to determine whether
or not the subtitles should

100
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.750
show up. Cause first of
all, we, you know, we

101
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.090
know in your preferences, what
language you prefer to see

102
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.850
subtitles in. We in theory,
know the language of the

103
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.920
audio stream and we in
theory, know the language of

104
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.010
the subtitle stream. So by
default, why would we put

105
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.880
English subtitles on an English
movie? But just recently we

106
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.110
added support for forced subtitled
detection. And for subtitles basically

107
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.480
say, you know, like an
alien speaking district nine, or

108
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.750
your Somali pirates in captain
Phillips, they say, you know,

109
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.700
okay, it is English, but
force this to be on.

110
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.790
Cause you're going to want
to see these subs. And

111
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.490
we do some detection of
that. Now. I'm not completely

112
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.780
sure if the force subtitle
a bit is allowable in

113
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.590
the MP4 container. I'm not
entirely sure on that. Even

114
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.690
know if I made the
MP4 correctly in that case,

115
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.900
you know, Like it's, it's
crazy. I mean, if the,

116
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.740
if you take codecs and
formats and containers and all

117
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.420
the kinds of it's crazy,
that kind of stuff that

118
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.630
we see in the wild,
I mean, you are amazing

119
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.340
cause you've gotten all your
stuff in MP4. So we

120
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.810
love you. Cause you make,
you make our lives a

121
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.270
lot easier to get all
your media everywhere. But I

122
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.870
mean, people come with Avi
is generated from like broken

123
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.900
cameras from 10 years ago
That I do have home

124
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.280
movies from like flip cams.
Right. Exactly. You know, what

125
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.050
are you going to do?
But, you know, I said,

126
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.640
I have everything in <inaudible>,
but I'm looking at my

127
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.830
folders here. And some of
them are M for V

128
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.410
and I don't know what
the difference is and why,

129
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.770
and for V looks smaller
sometimes, but I don't even

130
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.290
know why, how they got
that way. Yeah. As far

131
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.540
as I know, it's been
a question we've asked ourselves

132
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.790
over the years, as far
as I know, they're almost

133
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.440
entirely identical except for one
or two atoms of metadata,

134
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.650
but otherwise they're, you know,
same file structure and generally

135
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.710
same codex inside. Okay. So
let's, let's back up a

136
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.300
step cause we've been geeking
out for a few minutes

137
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.740
here, but we haven't actually
explained to people who aren't

138
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.290
familiar with Plex, how it
works and why it's different.

139
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.110
So in that first scenario
I described, I was counting

140
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.460
on smart clients to pull
from a dumb file share.

141
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.330
Right. But I have this
NAS, I have this machine

142
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.130
that is the, you know,
smart, it's more than just

143
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.920
a dumb system. Cause it's
got an Intel processor. It's

144
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.250
a, Synology 15, 11. So
it's got some good memory

145
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.610
and it's got some good
processors and I install Plex

146
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.820
on the NAS itself on
the, either the windows machine

147
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.920
of the Mac or in
this case on the Synology

148
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.550
Linux box, what is Plex
doing there and why is

149
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.960
it, why is a client
service solution needed? Yeah. And

150
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.310
upon the key thing there
with, with the dumb clients

151
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.320
or the dumb server in
the smart clients or vice

152
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.980
versa, we want your media
to be everywhere. And that

153
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.950
can be, you know, from
a range of automatic mini

154
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.900
connected to your TV, which
is obviously very smart and

155
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.380
very powerful to, you know,
an HTML five app, which

156
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.120
is obviously very dumb. And
if it's running on a

157
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.370
lightweight system, not very powerful.
So in order to do

158
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.360
that, we put the smarts
on the server and the

159
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.190
server basically has a super
smart transcoder that can on

160
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.690
the fly convert media from
one format to another. And

161
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.180
then there's all this sort
of talking that goes on

162
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.100
where the client says the
server, I want this, I

163
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.870
can handle that. And the
server does all the conversion

164
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.180
on the fly. So that's,
that's kind of the key

165
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.600
point of our client server
architecture is to centralize the

166
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.600
smarts about the, and do
all the conversions on the

167
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.670
fly on the server side.
Yeah, that right there. So

168
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.880
well said, because that changed
everything for me, it went

169
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.660
from a mess of files
in a folder to an

170
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.590
attractive catalog of information with
screencaps and metadata and all

171
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.830
album and director's information and
all this stuff that just

172
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.380
wasn't well-organized before. And the
idea that I could be

173
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.500
watching it on my laptop,
pause it, go into the

174
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.720
workout room and then pick
it up where I left

175
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.590
off on the tablet, all
because the server knows more

176
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.030
than the client does. Right.
Exactly. And you've hit upon

177
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.610
the other key point of,
of the centralized solution, which

178
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.920
has the metadata. You know,
we, we have a really

179
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.170
smart conversion engine on the
fly, so you can actually

180
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.080
play your videos back anywhere
you are, but we also

181
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.080
have a super rich metadata.
So we basically build this

182
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.630
great big database of all
of your, of all your,

183
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.660
you know, movies and music
and photos. And so you

184
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.330
can do a lot of
browsing based on genres or

185
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.930
directors or actors or stuff
like that. And like you

186
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.360
said, we can also keep
centralized state so that you

187
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.900
can do that kind of
view progress and resuming. And

188
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.900
we also have rich multi-user
functionality if you have a

189
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.360
Plex pass, which means you
can have multiple people in

190
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.310
your house and outside of
your house, all with their

191
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.350
own view into the server.
So they all have their,

192
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.870
all their own view of
the on deck. You know,

193
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.970
what TV shows they're watching
and stuff like that. So

194
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.610
it's super powerful. We should
circle back and talk about

195
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.990
the Plex pass in a
little bit, but the, the,

196
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.160
the server is running on
my NAS and then I

197
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.760
can load up my iPad
or my windows surface. And

198
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.310
I can see what I've
been watching. I usually sort

199
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.190
sort by recently added, although
you can sort it and

200
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.810
filter it, you know, in
any way that you want.

201
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.060
One of the things that
I noticed though, is that

202
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.060
when I'm at a hotel,
if I stream from home,

203
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.650
cause I punched a hole
in the firewall and I

204
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.570
set it all up the
way Plex said to set

205
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.070
it up, it's smart about
the speed on crappy hotel

206
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.790
wifi or on LTE. You're
actually squishing. Cause you know,

207
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.710
I'm on a, on a
phone, you know, I'm far

208
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.680
away from home. Yeah. There's
a, there are some quality

209
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.960
settings you can make to
tweak it. But by default,

210
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.890
when you're accessing over, let's
say a mobile connection or

211
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.390
remote connection, we default to
doing lower quality streams, basically

212
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.610
lower bandwidth streams, that's account
for that. And you can,

213
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.170
you know, if you're on
a train or something with

214
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.080
LT or whatever, you can
bump that quality down even

215
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.780
further, depending on what's needed
in the future. We'll do

216
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.910
that a lot more intelligently
and kind of on the

217
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.850
fly. But yeah, there's a
giant volume knob on the

218
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.940
quality that you can set
depending on where you are.

219
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.460
So at home you can
get a full HD file.

220
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.700
And if you're on a
train with pretty crappy 3g

221
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.040
service, you can still watch
your video. It just won't

222
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.700
look as pretty. And are
you re you know, transcoding

223
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.590
those and putting them in
temp files or is this

224
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.350
entirely in memory on the
fly or are P processors

225
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.990
fast enough to do that
now? So what we do,

226
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.140
the transporter is actually super
smart. It, it, the, the

227
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.380
format that we convert to
is generally called HTTP live

228
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.980
streaming HLS, which is something
that Apple kind of invented.

229
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.950
And now pretty much everyone
supports. We do support a

230
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.390
few other formats too. Like
Silverlight smooth streaming for the

231
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.970
devices, older Microsoft devices and
stuff like that. But in

232
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.030
general, it's, it's HTTP live
streaming. It's a segmented format.

233
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.040
So the transcoder will write
the segments to disk and

234
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.650
the server will, you know,
serve them out as needed.

235
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.050
We don't keep it a
memory just because that, that

236
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.730
would, you know, my grow
and we kind of want

237
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.310
to leave a bigger buffer,
but the transcoder is smart

238
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.370
enough to know how far
ahead it is. So depending

239
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.530
on, you know, what you're
playing and stuff like that,

240
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.610
it'll transcode, let's say 30
seconds ahead and throw those

241
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.850
segments onto the disc and
then throttle out idle. So

242
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.250
it's actually really cool, like
that doesn't sound like a

243
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.770
serious thing to be doing,
but with that, with that

244
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.170
change where the transcoder is
pretty much idle on demand,

245
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.560
you can get, you know,
like 10 to 15 streams

246
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.230
off of a single server
without that much power. We've

247
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.050
had people that have like
gotten streams going on all

248
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.720
their devices, iOS devices, laptops,
and just loaded up the

249
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.330
entire house streaming at once.
And it was totally fine.

250
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.200
Yeah. I, I have heard
discussion though, that some of

251
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.440
the lower power systems, like
an atom processor can't pull

252
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.080
this off, but any decent
Intel NAS can do this

253
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.020
without a problem. Yeah. And
the key to that, and

254
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.900
we actually were actually on
the <inaudible>, which is an

255
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.220
arm it's like a quad
core arm processor. And the

256
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.530
key really on those lower
powered systems is if at

257
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:03.450
all possible remarks don't transcode,
cause remixing is essentially just

258
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.410
re repackaging your MP4 and
your example over to HLS

259
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.890
segments. So we're not actually
generating, or we're not actually

260
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.130
decoding or encoding. <inaudible>, we're
just repackaging it. And that's

261
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.610
incredibly fast. Even an ad,
even an arm processor can

262
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.460
do that. If I'm watching,
if I've got it in

263
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.930
an end before already, and
I'm going to watch it

264
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.150
on an iPad, you might
have to do minimal work

265
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.950
if I'm inside my house
to get that across the

266
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.310
wire. Exactly minimal work and
absolutely no loss, no loss

267
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.040
of quality. Generally, if anything,
we have to transcode the

268
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.470
audio. If you say, if
you have like AC three

269
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.810
inside there, the iPad doesn't
do that. So we'll convert

270
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.500
the audio over to AAC
and that's, you know, obviously

271
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.310
orders of magnitude cheaper than,
than doing HD six for

272
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.210
conversion. One of the features
that's like the killer feature

273
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.640
on the iPad. Although I
have both a surface and

274
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.070
an iPad is the ability
to sync it down locally.

275
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.380
And I was actually talking
to a buddy of mine

276
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.470
who works, who we worked
for Pixar, who was really

277
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.320
frustrated that he's got a
bunch of, you know, valid

278
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.140
and legal MP4 is that
he, he, he paid for

279
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.000
and he should be able
to watch. And he has

280
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
no good way to get
them onto his iPad. He's

281
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.950
like, I can't really Mount
it as a disc. I

282
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.860
can't, They make it super
hard. Yeah. And when I

283
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.220
put it in iTunes, iTunes
says, no, I don't really

284
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.340
like that one. And there's
no explanation for why and

285
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.650
not to pick on iTunes.
Although iTunes is a big

286
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.940
target, it's just a steaming
pile of crap. And when

287
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.950
you drop a file in
that, it doesn't like, it's

288
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:37.170
just like, nah, but with
Plex, your doing the transcoding

289
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.330
all at once on the
server and saying, I'm going

290
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.070
to get this all ready
for you, package it to

291
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.390
you and bring it over.
And it's going to be

292
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.050
stored if I understand correctly
in the Plex application container

293
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.850
it's it's personal storage, Correct?
Yeah. I mean, we already

294
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.840
all the smarts for the
live conversions. So we basically

295
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.450
just use those same smarts
to convert over to a,

296
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.760
to an MP four file
in this case. But one

297
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.820
that's, you know, in theory
compatible with just about any

298
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.210
of your client devices. So
it'll do any transcoding that

299
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.670
needs to be done. And
then you'll end up with

300
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.650
an MP four file that's
then sinked over to the

301
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.570
device for playback on the
go Has been the easiest

302
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.820
way for me to get
a file. Like I have

303
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.870
a couple of movies I
want to watch on the

304
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.760
plane and I go, boom,
boom, boom. I let it

305
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.680
sink. It takes a couple
hours. If the file hasn't

306
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.720
already been squished and I'm
on my way. And I

307
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.810
honestly haven't plugged my iPad
into iTunes in a year

308
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.210
since I got That's. Cool.
Yeah. It's nice to be

309
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.010
able to do it without
plugging it into being able

310
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.800
to do it over wifi
and stuff like that. Wifi

311
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.690
sync on the iPad seemed
like a great idea, but

312
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.780
it never works works consistently.
It never works for me

313
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.390
either. It can't find iTunes
right. At Cannes iTunes. Can't

314
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.580
find the device. I don't
understand it. Yeah. It doesn't

315
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.080
seem like rocket science. Now
I've tried to use this

316
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.470
DNL D L N can
you explain what <inaudible> is

317
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.890
and why that is? Yeah,
that's a great question. I

318
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.100
always get those confused. The
LNA idea and LA it's

319
00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.080
like the worst acronym on
the planet and try to

320
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.850
explain that to your parents.
Like no dad, you, you

321
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.880
should be using DNA. What?
Well, yeah. Is there, is

322
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.630
there, there's a DNA that's
this whole, so Lana, there's

323
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.260
no way to say it.
Digital living room network Alliance,

324
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.930
right? The only acronym of
the were living room in

325
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.800
it, I guess, but it's
meant to make your eyes

326
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.140
you're you're you're a smart
set top box. Be able

327
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.900
to pull content from a
reliable server. I guess we

328
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.990
used to call these UPNP
server. Yeah. DLNR is an

329
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:31.540
extension of UPNP. I mean,
essentially DNA is it's a

330
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.060
client server solution. So that's
great. You know, you have

331
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.800
a deal on any server
and deal on a clients.

332
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.940
And in theory, you know,
there's hundreds of millions of

333
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.980
deal in a clients. Pretty
much any TV you have

334
00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.010
is DNA compatible it. Receivers
will be dealing a compatible

335
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.700
and Plex is actually a
deal on a server. You

336
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.650
probably already knew that, but
that's the reason why you

337
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.690
can play with Plex. Let's
say on an Xbox three

338
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.460
60, where we don't have
an app, but you can

339
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.820
play via DNA. But, but
so the promise of DNA

340
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.250
was huge, right? I mean,
same kind of thing. Client

341
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.060
server media, get your media
streamed anywhere. But the problem

342
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.770
with Elna is it's a
massively complex protocol and everyone

343
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.130
implements it differently and there's
no real standardized file format.

344
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.040
So for example, one TV
might play MTVs and other

345
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.490
might only play on befores.
So it's, it's a really

346
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.850
mucky protocol. It's not rich
in terms of metadata. So

347
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.610
you don't get all the,
you know, it's just basic

348
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:29.260
heart hierarchical browsing with no
real semantic value to it.

349
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.860
And in general, the, the
implementations on the client are

350
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.090
buggy and complicated and work
in very different ways. Yeah.

351
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.380
I've had pretty spotty. Has
that been, it's been a

352
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.740
spotty experience with Dale DNA.
I, I like the way

353
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.530
that a good deal, any
servers, Plex being, one of

354
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.990
them make a, a fake
folder hierarchy. So you've got

355
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.930
like recently added or by
year or by genre, which

356
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.690
isn't a real folder, but
it looks like a folder.

357
00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.080
It's like a view on
the data. Exactly. But I'm

358
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.420
finding that I have both
an Xbox three 60 and

359
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.370
I have a PlayStation PlayStation
seems more reliably be able

360
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.210
to play video than the,
than the three 60, even

361
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.880
though I think you're do
you detect which one is

362
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.040
going to talk to you
and try to do the

363
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.610
right thing? Yeah, we absolutely.
We have a deal on

364
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.490
a profiles so we can
detect who's coming in and

365
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.860
what they want. Like for
example, a PSV tends to

366
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.580
be slightly better because it
can actually understand H two,

367
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.290
six, four. So a lot
of times we can just

368
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.450
remix it over. So it's
fast and the quality super

369
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.390
great for the Xbox three
60, I believe we transcode

370
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.380
over to WMV, which is
just not something that the

371
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.050
transcoder is super great at.
And of course it's very

372
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.180
expensive. Cause you have to
convert from HD six, four

373
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.990
over to WMV. Yup. I
found that I'll be halfway

374
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.770
through a three 60 movie
and then it'll just drop

375
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.570
and it'll give me some
obscure error and I'm not

376
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.660
really sure what happened. So
that, that has been a

377
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.750
problem. Do you think, and
I apologize for putting on

378
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.370
the spot here, but you
know that everyone on the

379
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.790
planet wants an Xbox and
or Xbox one app. Like

380
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.010
that's the great, that would
be, that would make our

381
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.230
lives just complete. It would
be over at that point

382
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.310
we could all die because
we'd have plants everywhere. I've

383
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.450
yeah. I've definitely seen people
on Twitter requesting it. I

384
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.100
think it would be great
if flex were on those

385
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.280
devices. All right. I'll I
guess that The wink, wink,

386
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.170
nudge, nudge. There's not much
you can say about that,

387
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.910
but I can say that
when you go to <inaudible>

388
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.300
dot TV, there's a row
of logos at the bottom

389
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.480
windows, Apple, Android, Google TV,
Chromecast. It sounds like you

390
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.760
definitely are trying to put
it everywhere that you are

391
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.790
allowed or able to do.
Is that correct? That's correct.

392
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.410
Yeah. I mean, obviously we
look at where it makes

393
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.800
sense to me, but generally
we just, we just don't

394
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.050
want, we want it to
be universally available. So if

395
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.330
you get a, if you
get a TV, you have

396
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.830
a way to get Plex
on there really easily. If

397
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.600
you have a mobile device,
you can run a Plex

398
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.380
app on it. Definitely the,
I noticed you just had

399
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.570
a Chrome cast and I
am a huge fan of

400
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.980
the Chrome cast. I think
of it as almost like

401
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.360
wireless HTMI, although it's Google
branded wireless, right? Yeah. I

402
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.120
agree. I mean the, the,
the demand for it at

403
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.370
right after it came out,
we were seeing so much

404
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.490
demand for it, for Plex
being on there. And we

405
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.770
are super thrilled to work
with Google on it and

406
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.270
be one of the, you
know, one of the first

407
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.180
apps on it and the,
the first, one of the

408
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.410
first personal media apps and
it's, it's great people, people

409
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.970
have a good experience with
it at the cost. People

410
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.770
are getting like four of
them, you know, putting one

411
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.830
on each TV, just throwing
them out there. And I,

412
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.380
and I will say that
if you're enjoying Plex on

413
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.350
your Chromecast is going to
get better. Really we're, we're

414
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.260
doing, we're doing, yeah, we're
going to be enhancing the

415
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.010
support for it and just
making the video playback more

416
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.720
reliable. And also as you'd
expect, we're going to be

417
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.230
adding support for music and
photos. Cause right now we

418
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.580
only support video. So yeah,
that, that device is going

419
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.620
to get to be a
really nice Plex. Really? Yeah.

420
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.230
It's, it's pretty, it's pretty
amazing. Like if you have

421
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.360
a, there's your main living
room, but if you have

422
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.730
other rooms in the house
where everyone's got like them,

423
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.890
the guest room, and there's
really not a good set

424
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.720
top box up there, and
there's really no solution, that's

425
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.520
maybe got the cable plugged
directly into it and you've

426
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.010
forgotten about it, right? When
you plug a Chrome cast

427
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.310
into that thing. And suddenly
that becomes a really interesting

428
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.860
thing. We have a guest
come over and they've got

429
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.990
an iPad. And I said,
Hey, I was a Chromecast

430
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.110
in here and suddenly they're
playing their media on the,

431
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.470
on the Chrome cast. Now
help me understand the, the

432
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.830
handshake with the relationship between
the Plex server, the Chrome

433
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.640
cast, and then the device
that initiated this, this relationship.

434
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.390
Sure. It's, it's actually pretty
cool. And it, it sort

435
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.730
of speaks to one of
the limitations of the Chrome

436
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.550
cast cause essentially what the
Chrome cast is. It's a

437
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.330
tiny little Linux computer and
they run the Chrome browser

438
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.390
on it. So essentially it's
like Chrome dot exe running

439
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:49.410
on Linux and displaying a
webpage. And so when you

440
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.280
try to fling media to
it with your device to

441
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.710
the Chromecast, what it does
is it says, okay, you're

442
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.190
the Plex app. And it
loads our receiver app it's

443
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.050
called the receiver app, but
essentially it's just an HTML

444
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.350
webpage, just HTML and JavaScript
off the internet, down to

445
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.540
the Chromecast. So you need
internet connection for it to

446
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.100
work. So then once it
loads, the receiver is basically

447
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.740
again, just the page. We
display the Plex, waiting for

448
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.750
casts, you know, waiting for
you to play your media.

449
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.590
And then the sender app,
which is the mobile app

450
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.990
and your hand sends a
message over to it. And

451
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.480
it talks directly to the
server. So you can, at

452
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.400
that point, you know, throw
your phone in the garbage

453
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.190
and the media will keep
streaming directly from the server

454
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.960
to the Chrome cast. You've
negotiated a, a handshake you've

455
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.010
said, Hey, Chromecast, it's over
there. And here's the token.

456
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.480
Then everything that you need
to go and make it

457
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.940
happen. Exactly. Yeah. We pass
the URL over. Here's a

458
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.940
URL, here's a server, go
get the media over there.

459
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.090
And then the Chrome cast,
which actually shares a lot

460
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.370
of code with our web
app, as you might imagine,

461
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.220
goes and negotiates with the
server and sets up a

462
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.850
stream. And does the, do
you have to do anything

463
00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.590
other than you've already had
all the pieces there? I

464
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.400
guess you did, didn't you?
Well, at the time we

465
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.850
needed to add a support
for dash the dash format

466
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.640
dash is yet another there's.
So there's HLS HTTP, live

467
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.270
streaming there's silver, light, smooth
streaming. And then dash is

468
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.570
kind of a new one
that there's some companies behind.

469
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.090
And at the time when
the Chromecast first came out,

470
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.630
that was the only sort
of high level segmented format

471
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.030
they supported. So we had
the, we had to add

472
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.600
support for that. But other
than that, you know, most

473
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.130
of the pieces were already
there. We already had the

474
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.020
web code. We already had
the server. We already had

475
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.100
the adding the SDK into
the clients was super easy.

476
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.240
Right, right. Dashes is dynamic,
adaptive, streaming over HTTP. It's

477
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.870
also called MPEG dash. And
that's basically a, an alternative

478
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.280
to HLS HTTP live streaming.
So it's, it's like apples,

479
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.160
except it's not Apple. Yeah.
And unlike HLS, it's also,

480
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.410
I think very much consortium
driven. So if you look

481
00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.920
at the spec, it's kind
of a common editorial explosion

482
00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.870
of the things you can
do with it. So I'm

483
00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.260
not, I like HLS cause
it's super simple. I understand

484
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.460
that there are some nice
advantages to Silverlight smooth streaming,

485
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.960
where they put the audio
and video in different fragments

486
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.190
streams. So you can switch
qualities on one and not

487
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.700
the other, but I don't
necessarily see the, the value

488
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.800
out of dash over say
like, so really as soon

489
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.730
as streaming or in a
practical real end user HLS

490
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.810
works great. Yeah. Just everything
MPEG related involves multiple codecs,

491
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.270
multiple choices, multiple containers and
lots and lots of choice.

492
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.240
But HLS is pretty much,
Hey, it's Apple, it just

493
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.220
works. Do this. And we
promise everything will be fine.

494
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.520
And it does work exactly
as they advertised. Exactly. So

495
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.290
we were super happy when
Android added that in the,

496
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:42.460
in the 3.0 timeframe, they
added support for HLS. One

497
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.410
of the, this is again
asking for a feature, but

498
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.810
I've got windows eight, I've
got the, the surface. Is

499
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.970
there any talk about maybe
doing some of the offline

500
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.990
sinking support on the windows
client? Let's just say that,

501
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.410
you know, we like the
universal picture. We like to

502
00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.120
say, you can do this
anywhere you want. And so

503
00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.340
for us to have two
mobile apps, Android and iOS,

504
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.310
where you can sync to
and windows where you can't,

505
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.920
it looks a little bit
strange. So we don't like

506
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.850
things that look strange. I
paid for a Plex pass.

507
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.280
You can get Plex play
with Plex, use it, sign

508
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.800
up and do pretty much
lots of stuff without paying

509
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.110
you guys a what do
I get when I pay?

510
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.690
And thank you for your
support. We really appreciate it.

511
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.160
Honestly, this is true story.
And again, I have, I

512
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.020
have no relationship with Plex
other than I'm a huge

513
00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.830
fan. I gave you money
without knowing what I was

514
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.190
going to get. Just because
I said to myself, Holy

515
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.560
crap, I'm getting value here.
It was literally a matter

516
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.780
of I'm getting so much
value and I'm a PA

517
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.240
I'm effectively stealing because I
felt like I was, you

518
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.350
know, I felt like I
was stealing. And I was

519
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.990
like, wow, this is really,
I'm getting way more value

520
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:45.550
than this. And I was
like, Oh wow. 30 bucks

521
00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:49.060
a year. Yeah. Okay. I
would've just pay it. If

522
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.380
it was an open source
project, I want to just

523
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.350
pay out the developer 50
bucks because like, wow, you've

524
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.000
changed my life. You know
what I mean? Just being

525
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.670
able to get on an
airplane and watch my movies

526
00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.700
without having to do a
whole iTunes sync dance for

527
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.300
hours was $30 of value.
So yeah, I happily gave

528
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.470
you my money, but I
don't really know what I

529
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:09.040
got. No, tell me what
I really, we really appreciate

530
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.220
it. So the, the essence
of a Plex pass is

531
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.160
it gives you a few
different things. It gives you,

532
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.620
first of all, it gives
you premium features of which

533
00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.860
Plex sync is one of
'em. And there is also

534
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.140
cloud sync where you can,
instead of sinking into your

535
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.660
device, you can actually sync
up to say Dropbox or,

536
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:30.160
or a bit Casa. It
also gives you access to

537
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.590
a multi-user control, which I
spoke about earlier. So if

538
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.140
you have, if you're sharing
your media with anyone or

539
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.670
you have multiple people inside
the house, you have a

540
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.890
profile for your kid's profile
for your wife, that kind

541
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:43.090
of thing. You get multi-user
access. You also get early

542
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.390
to new features. So for
example, the Chrome cast feature

543
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.390
right now is an in
a Plex pass preview. So

544
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.780
the people who are flex
pass holders got access to

545
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.670
it and they will for
a period of time and

546
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.400
then it'll become free for
everyone. So you get early

547
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.830
access to new features. You
have, you know, the set

548
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.680
of premium features that I
talked about. You also have

549
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.340
access to private forums on
our, on our site so

550
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.560
that you can get a
little bit extra support and

551
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.870
stuff like that. You, we
also make a lot of

552
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.690
preview releases for things. So
if we're doing new stuff

553
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.370
in the server and we,
you know, we want a

554
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.220
group of people to check
it out, this brand new

555
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.650
feature that came out, you
know, we throw that into

556
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.020
Plex pass. So it's, it's
basically, it's like, if you,

557
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.360
if you love Plex, it's
a great way to get

558
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.820
kind of the best possible
experience with plaques. You get

559
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.220
access to all the new
stuff earlier than everyone else.

560
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.190
You get access to some
features, some really cool features

561
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.500
before everyone else gets access
to them. And you get,

562
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.290
you know, obviously permanent access
to features like Plex sync

563
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.510
and cloud sync and multi-user
and stuff like that. And

564
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.320
they'll definitely be more features
over time. That'll that we'll

565
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.220
be adding to The server,
just like the client runs

566
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.580
everywhere. The server runs everywhere
to basically like when I

567
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.830
go to downloads, there's a
million choices about how I

568
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.940
can run this. What is
it written in? Great question.

569
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:04.130
The service written in C
plus plus primarily it's uses

570
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.770
the, probably the biggest, if
you want to get into

571
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:10.460
details. The biggest third party
library uses is boost. Boost

572
00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.390
is a, is a great
C plus plus library that

573
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.080
full of extensive functionality. And
it just makes coding a

574
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.840
lot easier. But in, in
essence Plex at its core

575
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.190
is a highly multithreaded HTTP
server. Now what's significant about

576
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.080
boost For people who aren't
familiar with it is that

577
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.970
it is advertised as a
portable series of libraries. This

578
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.190
is not just some, Hey,
there's some people's plus when

579
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.290
we use that, it's, it's,
it's about being portable cause

580
00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.260
it needs to work basically
everywhere. Exactly. Yeah. And so,

581
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.790
I mean, I, it's hard
to even count the number

582
00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.520
of architectures that we've had
the server running on. We,

583
00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.360
you know, obviously Intel obviously
arm we've had it running

584
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.100
on MIPS. We've had it
running, gosh, a lot of,

585
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.370
a lot of different places
and, and sort of scale

586
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.730
from scale down really highly
embedded stuff up to more,

587
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.330
more powerful stuff. But we,
we, we generally, we love

588
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.490
working with the NAS guys.
We've got a good relationship

589
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.920
with 'em and all the
top news providers. And cause

590
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.130
if you think about it,
it's a really perfect match

591
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.290
for an AZ device. Right?
You have this device with

592
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.540
a bunch of drives, you
just threw a ton of

593
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.580
media onto it. Now what,
how do you get that

594
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.160
media out everywhere? Like you're
saying, and you know, Plex

595
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.530
is the, is the, can
help you with that Right

596
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.140
on my Synology it was
actually in the Synology kind

597
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.840
of quote unquote app store.
So I was worried I'd

598
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.610
have to go and shush
into the thing and do

599
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.200
a whole bunch of command
line, but I really just,

600
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.330
Oh, there's Plex right there.
The Plex that I already

601
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.180
was running on my windows
machine. So for me, I

602
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.040
literally went from running it
on windows and it's living

603
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.100
in the tray to buying
an AZ, noticing it was

604
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.720
available saying install. And then,
I don't know, 15 minutes

605
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.270
later with some configuration, with
a web interface it was

606
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.520
done. And it was just,
and everything moved over there.

607
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.830
Yup, absolutely. Yeah. And we'd
like to get to that

608
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.260
point where you unpacking your
NAS box, plug it in,

609
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.540
turn it on and is
somewhere there waiting for you

610
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.910
to click on it right
out of the box. And

611
00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.860
for people who already either
have a NAS or maybe

612
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.960
you have, I mean, everyone
who's listening probably has a

613
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.090
windows machine they're not using
or a Linux machine. It

614
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.240
runs on fedora or Boone
to Santo as free BSD

615
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.630
and certainly, you know, Mac
and windows. So that's, that's

616
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.520
pretty fabulous. Yeah. We try
to, we try to be

617
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.120
everywhere. Well, yeah, you definitely
succeed. And then of course,

618
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.370
you know, robo and tonology
and QA and all that

619
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.740
kind of stuff as well.
Well, cool. Well thank you

620
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.630
so much for letting me
be a fan boy and

621
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.540
talk to you today. I
want to continue to support

622
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.760
Plex. I think you guys
are great. Thank you so

623
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.980
much. I really appreciate you
having me on and great

624
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.250
talking with you. This has
been another episode of Hanselminutes

625
00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.780
and we'll see you again
next week.
