<inaudible> From Hansel minutes. Dot
com is Hansel minutes, a

2
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.230
weekly discussion with web developer
and technologists. Scott Hanselman hosted

3
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.910
by Carl Franklin. This is Lawrence Ryan
announcing show number one 72

4
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.610
recorded live Thursday, July 16th, 2009. Support
for Hanselman it's as provided

5
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.720
by. Tellerik already controls the
most comprehensive suite of components

6
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:45.650
for windows forms and asp.net
web applications online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this

7
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:53.030
episode, Scott talks technology with
Dan Bricklin, Scott Hanselman. And

8
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.220
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

9
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.770
sitting down with Dan Bricklin.
He's just written a new

10
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.410
book called Brooklyn on technology,
and you probably know him

11
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.590
as the creator of VisiCalc
can use that software pioneer

12
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.060
and an old guy with
a beard. And I'm just

13
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.180
thrilled as punch to talk
to you today. Dan, thanks

14
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.980
for taking the time. I'm
really glad to be here,

15
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.890
Scott. You're actually a podcast
to yourself. I understand. And

16
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.710
I didn't realize until I
started poking around on your

17
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.960
site, you've got a lot
of content up there. Yeah,

18
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.200
I've been, I've been dabbling
in it in various ways.

19
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.840
I, since I was blogger
for like 10 years or

20
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.680
more, I realized that sometimes
writing things up was to

21
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.600
so much work and doing
it with podcasting was a

22
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.940
lot easier. It gives you
everything. So I, I start

23
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.920
doing that for some events
that I go to and

24
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.630
then I got roped in.
Cause I had all this

25
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.890
equipment. Yeah know, it's just
like being on NPR. We've

26
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.130
got you a recording on
your side and the audio

27
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.560
is going to sound great.
But I noticed that you

28
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.450
still do a lot of
writing and you recently just

29
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.610
wrote a, an article that
I've actually read twice and

30
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.830
I'm still trying to get
my head around a that's

31
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.940
really quite long. It looks
like it's about, I mean

32
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.140
it scrolls forever. It's probably
10 pages of text here

33
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.070
and you're talking about new
modes of interaction. You're basically

34
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.240
bringing together all of the
different kind of big things

35
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.120
that are happening right now
from Google wave to Microsoft

36
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.880
natal. Can you talk a
little bit about that, that

37
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.970
chronology of adoption? Yeah. What
I realized is that there

38
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.760
are a lot of things
that were happening that looked

39
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.900
like they might be very
popular in some area and

40
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.310
that can cause, cause a
change in other areas. I

41
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.300
mean a lot of people
are using a mouse. Suddenly

42
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.910
everybody has to change their
applications to use a mouse

43
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.420
that happened way back when
things that used to not

44
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.940
be on PCs that moved
to PCs. Once the first

45
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.810
things move that became very
popular others did. And I

46
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.820
realized that we're at a
point now where we may

47
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.180
have to do the same
thing of change, change, how

48
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.390
we build things from a
user interface viewpoint, from an

49
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.200
interaction viewpoint we're gooey. We
knew it is. And the

50
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.620
modes of interaction with applications
like we used to have

51
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.250
with plain old Excel and
Adobe illustrator and stuff like

52
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.700
that as if you view
them as the prototypical gooey

53
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.800
applications, the graphical user interface
that we actually are moving,

54
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.050
where we may have to
switch to a new one

55
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.370
that from a programming viewpoint
requires changes just like when

56
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.260
we moved from character to
gooey, we had to make

57
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.020
changes in how we did
our programming And moving from,

58
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.430
from characters, from, you know,
from the 80 by 20

59
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.420
screens or 40 by 22,
gooey seems very clear in

60
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.270
my mind because I was
around when that happened and

61
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.210
it's a very obvious change,
but you know, we've been

62
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.930
pushing windows around for a
very long time. Mice are

63
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.330
pretty much, you know, we're
in the, we're definitely in

64
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.830
the fat part of the
bell curve when it comes

65
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.000
to mice and keyboard. I
I'm having trouble maybe because

66
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.700
I'm not a futurist getting
my head around what could

67
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.210
possibly be next other than
maybe, you know, waving my

68
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.760
hands around. Okay. Well, well
I'm not a futurist in

69
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.950
terms of, I mean, I'm
much more into, I love

70
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.350
to implement. So I look
at it from that viewpoint.

71
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.870
And what does it mean
going to mean to us

72
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.310
as people who are implementing?
And I just remember when

73
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.570
we went from character, well,
when you went to character

74
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.570
based interactive from like punch
cards and stuff like that

75
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.070
from batch to interactive, you
had a program differently and

76
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.860
you structured things differently. And
cause you had to respond

77
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.710
instantly to what was being
typed. You had to be

78
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.080
able to deal back and
forth. You don't just get

79
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.180
all your inputs together, do
a lot of processing and

80
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.680
produce output, but you're, you're,
you're actually watching some input

81
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.700
device. In the case of
moving to gooey, you're working

82
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.060
much more events driven. It's
not just one input stream,

83
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.730
but there are multiple input
streams, different events at different

84
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.360
times. And because it was
very, what you see is

85
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.970
what you get having undo
became very important. That was

86
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.610
the classic way of doing
things so that you could,

87
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.310
you could make mistakes and
stuff. Cause you, you often

88
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.850
did, you, you weren't doing
commands that you knew exactly

89
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.270
what would happen. You're dragging
and dropping and stuff and

90
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.030
you could make mistakes. So
undo came in and you

91
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.680
had to structure your programs
differently because of undo and

92
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.710
frameworks came in to help
us deal with all the

93
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.440
work you had to do
to create windows and, and

94
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.150
to keep track of the,
the housekeeping. I've done a

95
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.080
lot of work in the,
the gestural base, the pen

96
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.400
computing world from way back
when, back in the it's

97
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.810
an old industry, but there
was a good size blip

98
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.430
in the early nineties when
go computer go was making

99
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.720
the pinpoint operating system and
the early pin windows or

100
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.840
windows for pen computing came
in and I've done programming

101
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.700
there and realized that a
lot of the stuff there,

102
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.320
it's not like the mouse
where you can just click

103
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.880
on something and follow a
hierarchy of hierarchy of windows

104
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.070
to figure out what was
meant and where it is.

105
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.990
But there's a lot of
ambiguity and, and figuring out

106
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.560
what gesture was actually made,
et cetera. And the, when

107
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.960
I saw Microsoft natal, what
they were demonstrating as potential

108
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.870
changes in how user interface
would be done to the

109
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.820
game machines. And when I
saw what happened with what

110
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.390
Google is showing with Google
wave and looked and saw

111
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.890
that these are not isolated
things, the technologies that they're

112
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.040
based on are technology, things
that are used elsewhere and

113
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.160
will come about of having
multiple users doing input much

114
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.410
more, much richer gestures, either
touching the screen or not

115
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.010
even touching the screen, but
making motions in front of

116
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.660
the screen, that the, where
the computer watches you and

117
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:11.210
multiple interactions affecting the program
like with wave and other,

118
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.620
you know, Adobe buzzword and
Microsoft, I think says, they're

119
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.930
going to have it in
the new office, online office

120
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.570
that they're, they're going to
be coming out with where

121
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.300
there's simultaneous editing or two
people might edit even offline.

122
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.880
This is what you had
in Lotus notes years ago.

123
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.840
And then you have to
reconcile with that, that there

124
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.340
is, instead of having one
computer, one file, one user,

125
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.600
we now have an essence,
one file, multiple users on

126
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.700
multiple computers and that's a
different programming paradigm and how

127
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.900
we have to deal with
that and recording everything that

128
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.510
goes on so that I
can play it back. This

129
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:59.720
Google wave has and letting
you know this, keeping that

130
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.080
whole list. So you can
reconcile and you can know

131
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.480
like what wikis do, where
you can say, who did

132
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.520
this? When you have a
whole history of what happened,

133
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.060
those things are all coming
in and they will change

134
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.130
the way we have to
build some of our applications.

135
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.400
And to me it may
be just as big a

136
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.530
jump as it was when
we went from character base

137
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:24.040
to gooey based. Are we
just rewriting things or porting

138
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.430
things that have been done
before? I mean, is there

139
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.160
anything actually unique or new?
I mean, you, you've got

140
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.390
a, a historical perspective here,
you know, with each of

141
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.000
these technologies, you said, boy,
you know, we were doing

142
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.740
that before, but you know,
maybe it wasn't time. It

143
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.030
wasn't ready. It seems like,
let me give you one

144
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.590
example. I watched the iPhone
announcement. So for the three

145
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.850
operating system onstage, and they
had some, some health people

146
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.380
up for, I think it
was Johnson and Johnson and

147
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.400
they plugged in a glucose
meter into the, into the

148
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.770
iPhone and they kind of
said, look, I can check

149
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.500
my blood sugar. And this
is amazing. Isn't that isn't

150
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.800
that innovated. And of course,
you know, sitting back at

151
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.250
my home in Oregon with
sour grapes watching this same

152
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.310
man, I was doing that
in 1995. And it was

153
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.630
that the world wasn't ready
for my brilliance is all

154
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.730
of this. Just a matter
of porting things over like,

155
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.070
like you're talking about simultaneous
editing here, we are putting

156
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.360
it into HTTP and moving
it into, into a world

157
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.060
that is now suddenly ready
for that kind of kind

158
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.980
of brilliance. Well, many of
the ideas of what you

159
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.050
might want to do have
been there. I mean, we

160
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.790
would have wanted to do
them a hundred years ago

161
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.760
and you know, and we
keep trying it with computers.

162
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.310
You know, they would try
those things with whatever we

163
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.080
have today. But, you know,
I mean, some of the

164
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.380
things are like, well, let
us take advantage of simultaneous

165
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.810
editing on a word processor
screen, which goes back to

166
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.350
word processing, which goes back
to, you know, whatever. And

167
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.270
we won't even get into
the history of word processing

168
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.790
that I've been involved with
for, Oh, I don't know

169
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.510
many, many years before I
did spreadsheets. I was involved

170
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:11.630
in word processing and you
know, but that's just saying,

171
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.090
well, the things we used
to do, we should do

172
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.920
in the new path, we
have to apply the new

173
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.190
paradigms to them, but it
often opens up things that

174
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.580
we couldn't do before. In
that let's say with the

175
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.330
glucose meter, we're talking about
being able to have the

176
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.610
device that you use for
so many other things that

177
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.150
is radio connected, that's in
your pocket and that you

178
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.980
use, you know, that has
enormous amount of storage. Now

179
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:42.530
you can connect a glucose
monitor to it. And it's,

180
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.140
that's just a demo of
what you could do, but

181
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.870
you realize that in the
future, there may be something

182
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.840
even better of how it's
maybe communicating with something that

183
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.850
you've ingested. And which is
interesting that the guy, one

184
00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.630
of the guys involved with
the natal soft, the natal

185
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.750
hardware comes from originally was
a company that actually makes

186
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.720
a camera that you can
swallow and is used for

187
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.350
endoscopy that transmits as it
goes down to a belt

188
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.600
that you wear. So that's
not so far fetched that

189
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.820
we could see these things,
but it's that, it's the

190
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.340
mashing up of things that
we didn't match up before.

191
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.710
And the big thing is
it's the volume, you know,

192
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.640
waving at the computer and
saying, put that there was

193
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.950
demonstrated back. I don't know,
around 1980 at the, what

194
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.740
was, what is now called
the media lab at MIT

195
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.270
and their videos, you can
watch of it. And, you

196
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.140
know, and that was on
a huge screen that, you

197
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.120
know, they had to put
this big ground glass in

198
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.750
the building, which customed thousands
and thousands of dollars. And

199
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.250
now we're talking about that
in a video game console

200
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.210
that you buy, you know,
at best buy and that

201
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.360
are used, you know, for
the most mundane of things,

202
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.840
that's a big change that
we went from. Something that

203
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.250
only the richest lit research
lab could do a simple

204
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.720
demo of that versus something
that is robust enough to

205
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.760
be used, you know, by
people who were busy partying

206
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.560
and not paying much attention
and expect extremely good response

207
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.370
from it at price points
that are throwaway price points.

208
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.510
Is that, is that maybe
you've really kind of nailed

209
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.550
it right there is it,
is it, is that the

210
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.120
distance between when someone conceives
of something, you know, starts

211
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.180
formally researching it and then
sells it at Walmart, is

212
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.830
that, is that time a
fixed time? Does it need

213
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.520
to be a decade two
decades now it's a Fixed

214
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.490
time, but it often go,
I mean, you often can

215
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.130
find it being like 20
years. I mean, sometimes it's

216
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.550
10 or 20 years until
the first commercial one. I

217
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.280
mean, think about the mouse
phone. The mouse was first

218
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.200
invented and other pointing devices,
maybe a little bit before

219
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.890
that, until it first was
in a, a normal office

220
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.140
device. I mean, you, you
had, you know, the Xerox

221
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.130
star and then, you know,
you had the, the Lisa

222
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.390
and then a can almost
consumer level at Mo marketed

223
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.600
as such with the, the
Macintosh, but then into it

224
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.420
being accepted generally in business
and in the home as

225
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.810
the dominant way was yet
another, I don't know what

226
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:39.420
eight years or something like
that. So some of the

227
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.720
things that we're seeing much
faster, you know, in terms

228
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.330
of like self certain things
with cell phone and things

229
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.220
like that, adoption, you know,
the adoption of digital cameras,

230
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.680
I don't know. It depends,
you can always go back

231
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.590
and find something that goes
way back. You know, that's

232
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.610
even more primitive that somebody
tried, but as I point

233
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.530
out in the essay, I
realized that there were these,

234
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.660
you know, when you, when
you hear from a marketing

235
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:07.350
viewpoint and business viewpoint, they
talk about early adopters and,

236
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.250
and, you know, and then
the, the, the early majority

237
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.440
and, you know, the late
majority and stuff, but that's

238
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.280
a purchase I was looking
in terms of wins, is

239
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.670
it become the way that
everything is done is the

240
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.750
platform accepted, right? Even if
it was well accepted in

241
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.700
a narrow area, when does
it become accepted for even

242
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.650
glucose meters now connect to
your cell phone as opposed

243
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.920
to being a standalone device?
Well, then you start getting

244
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.760
into things like standardization. So,
you know, for example, as

245
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.420
a diabetic 12, let me
see here 2015 years ago,

246
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.060
they would cost me a
hundred dollars for a glucose

247
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.030
meter. I'd have to, you
know, get a prescription or

248
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.030
go hunting for one. And
it would take a minute

249
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.100
from the time I gave
it my blood until it

250
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.380
gave me a number. Now
I can go to Walmart

251
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.570
and I can buy one
for five bucks. They've changed

252
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.750
the model. It's like Gillette,
where they sell the blades

253
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.880
and give away the razor.
I can get a glucose

254
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.700
meter for virtually nothing. And
it takes five seconds to

255
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.340
check my check, my numbers.
And that took, you know,

256
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.410
10, 15 years, how long
until we have standardization though,

257
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.230
because right now every glucose
meter is different. Every test

258
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.810
strip is different. You'd like
to be able to show

259
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.380
up and, and say, Oh,
here's the glucose meter for

260
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.820
my Nokia phone. But, but
ultimately it would be better

261
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.340
than that, right? Because they're
just now talking about standardizing

262
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.060
cell phone, power, adapters. When
is it going to be

263
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:41.260
that everybody basically gets, you
know, you know, basically blood

264
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.140
tests that they do periodically
or can do as frequently

265
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.680
as they want for check
and other health things that

266
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.010
are just as a matter
of course, they're, tri-quarter basically

267
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.940
everybody has their mini tri-quarter
as part of what they

268
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.850
do. Just like all sorts
of things now are so

269
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.140
cheap. And so widespread that,
you know, we put them

270
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.630
in the middle of other
things who would believe that

271
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.150
GPS would be something you
would throw into a cell

272
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.590
phone as a sort of
a side effect thing. That's

273
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.240
interesting if you just say
it because it became so

274
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.850
small, it was like, well,
there's one more device that

275
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.250
we're carrying around that has
batteries and buttons and a

276
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.800
screen. Yeah. You know, I
mean, I remember there was

277
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.270
a time in the mid
nineties where I think I

278
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.030
had six or seven devices
that I was charging simultaneously.

279
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.600
I was just wishing that
whatever the core, the essence

280
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.950
of that device would become
standardized. Yep. The core rather

281
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.610
would, would sit inside of
a host. I always expected

282
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:41.380
that a company would start
up a screen input battery,

283
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.380
you know, shell. And then
we would plug in these

284
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.470
modules. I thought it might
be the, the handspring visor,

285
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.110
which was the first Palm
pilot that had that, that

286
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.540
slot in the back. Right.
I never would have guessed

287
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.850
that it would have been
a phone that would become

288
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.610
that thing. Whether it be,
you know, any smartphone, Blackberry,

289
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.210
iPhone, or a windows, mobile,
whoever, whoever standardizes that faster

290
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.120
is gonna is gonna win.
Yeah. I mean, there's, it's,

291
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.930
it's wind is the thing
that the minor use that

292
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.900
you need it for anyway,
like cell phones needed it

293
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.380
to do positioning for nine
one, one, okay. Per emergency

294
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.880
positioning that once you need
it for that, it's also

295
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.550
available for so many other
things. And the cost then

296
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.270
the incremental cost is nil
or nothing. And of course

297
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:33.430
this becomes very disruptive to
other devices or businesses that

298
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.550
are based upon the scarcity
of that type of thing.

299
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.850
And that you want a
specialized one. This has happened

300
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:44.590
of course, with voice where
a voice over IP basically

301
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.810
cost nothing compared to other
things you want to do

302
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.430
over the internet. So that,
that used to be extremely

303
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:56.790
dear and costly. And you
could charge for now as

304
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.040
a matter of fact comes
for free when you do

305
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.490
other things that you're willing
to pay for. And the

306
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.200
thing about the cell phone
is I point out, you

307
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.570
know, in the book, in
that early chapter on what

308
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:11.400
will people pay for communicating
with loved ones is a

309
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.120
very, a social aspect. Is
there a very compelling thing

310
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:20.610
and often will drive why
you will buy a device

311
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.370
and pay for things. And
once you have that, then

312
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.610
other things come for free.
That the reason that we

313
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.820
carry a cell phone, I
believe is very social. You

314
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.490
sort of hold on to
the cell phone. Many people,

315
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.460
you know, it's a comforting
thing because it's a wormhole

316
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.920
that on the other ha
the other side is all

317
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.610
of your spacetime warped all
of your friends and relatives,

318
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.550
people that matter to you,
especially the cell phone, that

319
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.870
your personal one let's ignore
the business. So many, you

320
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:51.060
can turn off business stuff,
but, and you see people

321
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.450
clutching it with and bringing
it as a, a feeling

322
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.140
of security holding it. Like
they would a, a railing

323
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.540
when going up and down
steps. Yeah. Is it, is

324
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.730
it the emotional connection? I
mean, in your essay, on

325
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.470
what people will pay for
it, you say that no

326
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.440
people will, will pay for
that interaction with people they

327
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.530
care about, but I'm starting
to wonder if, if how

328
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.830
much of technology is driven
by that emotional connection versus

329
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.180
by fear. I mean, don't,
we carry cell phones out

330
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.310
of fear. I mean, I
remember I have told my

331
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.470
wife a number of times
when she's left without her

332
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.550
cell phone, I've had kind
of irrational discussions where it's

333
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.050
like, you didn't have your
cell phone. I couldn't get

334
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.630
ahold of you. Right. Well,
just, it was just a

335
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.280
hundred years ago, we would
say, all right, I'm going

336
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.350
to go over that Hill
there, if I'm not backed

337
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:41.000
by August, you know? Yeah.
Well, it's, I mean, originally

338
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.800
a lot of people would
get them because, Oh, well,

339
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.140
my car might break down
in a deserted area and

340
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.670
I need to be able
to, you know, in the

341
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.850
snowstorm, I want to be
able to call. And, but

342
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.070
they found out that the
reason they liked it and

343
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.060
the reason they'll pay for
more minutes is completely, I

344
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.310
mean, otherwise you just need
what you're talking about. You

345
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:03.020
just need a, an emergency
call, but people pay for

346
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.320
unlimited minutes and, you know,
and love the unlimited nights

347
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.470
and weekends and stuff like
that. And the text messaging

348
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.840
and stuff, a lot of
which is, as I point

349
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.840
out is very much like
primates sitting there next to

350
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.420
each other, pulling nits off
of each other. You know,

351
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:22.820
it's a, it's a social
thing. And social things are

352
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.910
very important. The social aspect
of things are very important.

353
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.150
We think of them as
important to us, but we

354
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.510
often ignore the fact that
it's important to others and

355
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.510
don't take that into account.
And that's one of the

356
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.060
things I point out. I
mean, I try to show

357
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.690
a lot of things throughout
the book about how it,

358
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.020
isn't always what you might
think it is. Unless if

359
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.630
you look carefully and about
what's really going on, it's

360
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.750
worth looking to see what's
really going on. And a

361
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.260
lot of the early decisions,
like, well, this blogging stuff,

362
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.240
I mean, it's just people
in pajamas who don't know

363
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.110
what they're talking about and
how can they make money

364
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.200
where the real question was,
how are newspapers going to

365
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.210
stay in business? And if
you look back on what

366
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:15.460
bloggers wrote back, for example,
the democratic national convention in

367
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.990
2004, some of what they
wrote was pretty good in

368
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.520
hindsight. I mean, pretty amazing
stuff. And only, I mean,

369
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.370
as I was putting this
stuff together to show some

370
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.300
history, some examples of what
happened throughout blogging, the history

371
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.310
of blogging. And I was
looking at what was written

372
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.290
back then, and in perspective,
they were pretty good, even

373
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.720
though people were making fun
of them and people were

374
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.090
making fun of them about
how blogging will never make

375
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.330
it compared to national media.
And now of course the

376
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.470
blogs and personal media are
now major sources of information

377
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.650
and drive politics in many
ways. Yeah. So just the

378
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.410
democratization of technology, the idea,
like what you said about

379
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.860
before that there was a
time when, when no one

380
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.540
had this, I mean, you
could go and you could

381
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.430
go back even farther. We've
talked before on the show

382
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.040
about the idea that, you
know, no one could read

383
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.930
and there, there was a
time when no one saw

384
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.720
pieces of paper or parchment
only the monks had those

385
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.930
pieces of parchment. And now
I probably wouldn't step down

386
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.760
to pick up an old
Nokia phone that I found

387
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.510
in the gutter. Hmm. Is
it just the leveling of

388
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.870
the playing field? Yeah. Well,
I mean, personal computers, that

389
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.050
was the beauty of watching
personal computers come in. What

390
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.120
it did is it took
something that only big companies

391
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.170
could afford, you know, graphic
arts departments and, you know,

392
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.890
for, I mean, you know,
newsletters, you know, suddenly the,

393
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:46.500
the, the, the smallest nonprofit
or club could have, you

394
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.890
know, produce newsletters that were
as good looking as the

395
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.600
best things produced by corporations
before that, in terms of

396
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.670
keeping track of information with
a database and know, and

397
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.300
transaction processing, you could run
it on a personal computer

398
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.090
with DBAs and stuff like
that, and have just as

399
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.110
good information as the big
corporations had. And so the

400
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:15.390
personal computer and computing, the
dropping in price of computing

401
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.800
technology is leveling the playing
field for many things and

402
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.800
is bringing to more people
abilities that didn't exist before.

403
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:30.000
It was interesting at the,
the hearing on the, the

404
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.440
Supreme court justice yesterday, where
Senator the new Senator Franken

405
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:40.020
asked a question about isn't
the internet, something where first

406
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.270
amendment, we have to think
about it because it is

407
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:46.640
a dominant way in which
we communicate and express ourselves

408
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.020
in speech, which is a
very interesting that this is

409
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.030
who could believe that, that,
and knowledgeably on both sides,

410
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:01.940
the questioner and the, the
justice being questioned that at

411
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.350
Supreme court hearings, justices would
ask about their TV shows

412
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:10.520
or their iPods that, you
know, that level of technology

413
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.250
acceptance just blows the mind
of us from the old

414
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.640
days when people would make
fun of these, these toy

415
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.540
computers and how it's now
become something that has given

416
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.370
great power to all sorts
of people, but disrupting business

417
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.760
models and things the same
way, the automobile disrupted all

418
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.200
sorts of problems with buggy
whips and, and horse feed

419
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.760
and stuff. Hey, everybody, this
is Scott coming at you

420
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.520
from another place in time.
Summer is peaking, and our

421
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.950
friends at Tellerik are working
at full steam. They've just

422
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.280
released the Q2 volume of
the Telerik premium collection for.net.

423
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.340
The biggest release yet it's
packed with new things, that'll

424
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.290
excite anyone. Who's got to
do anything with that net

425
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.930
development, starting with several light
and the introduction of the

426
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.660
first commercial 3d chart in
the market. It's developed as

427
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.210
a true vector 3d, which
gives you a nice performance

428
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:02.140
and rich capabilities with rotation
and animations. Also the Silverlight

429
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.690
scheduler, which is packed with
even more features in the

430
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:09.820
first version. Telerx flagship rad
controls for asp.net. Ajax grows

431
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.160
in this release, not only
with four new controls, but

432
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.120
also with new productivity tools.
There's the new visual style

433
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.030
builder, an online application that
allows you to visually modify

434
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.100
skins or even design new
ones with just point and

435
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.980
click. If that's not enough,
they've added a completely new

436
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.400
product, a free testing framework
powered by art of test

437
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.170
for automating Ajax. And Silverlight
rich internet applications. I'm short

438
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.610
on time. So I can't
give you all the new

439
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.940
features and enhancements until our
reporting open-access RM or wind

440
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.580
forms, but I encourage you
to check out all of

441
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:45.710
these products@tellerik.com. Thanks. Have we
seen the, you know, the

442
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.390
complete set of the class
of electronic devices that have

443
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.530
become that pervasive? I mean,
are we, you've got, you

444
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.690
know, before we had radios
and TVs, and that was

445
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.570
pretty much it, right there
was, that was the extent

446
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.850
of electronics. And then there
were, you know, there were

447
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.950
certainly cars and things like
that, but as far as

448
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:06.580
like the electronics, the average
Joe interacted with on a

449
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.340
regular basis, it was pretty
much a maybe a calculator.

450
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.290
If there was an accountant
around some kind of a

451
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:15.730
paper, you know, a calculator
produces paper, but now we're

452
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.180
looking at time shifting digital
video, digital video in your

453
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:24.310
pocket, cell phones, personal computers.
Is there some other class

454
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.280
of device? I mean, I
remember when the Sony Walkman

455
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.170
came out and everyone said,
no, one's gonna use that.

456
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.120
It looks silly. Who's going
to walk around with headphones

457
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.520
on their head. It's never
gonna have. Right. And then

458
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.660
the same thing with, with,
you know, cell phone health

459
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.590
headphones. Right. And now, yeah.
And I, I, you know,

460
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.030
I don't think that one
is, I'm going to have

461
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.090
say, I don't think that
one's going to change. I

462
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.450
cannot think of anything more
irritating than what I say.

463
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.050
I watched a guy have
dinner with his family recently

464
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.540
at a restaurant. And he
had that stupid thing plugged

465
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.730
into his head the whole
time he wasn't talking to

466
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.400
anybody, but it just gave
that impression that at any

467
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.520
moment, I could receive a
call more important than my

468
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.250
family and I, and I
need to take it. And

469
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.650
the act of lifting the
phone to my ear is

470
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.110
so, so much effort that
I'm going to just go

471
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.120
ahead and keep it plugged
in. Like <inaudible> from star

472
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.610
Trek because, you know, I'm
just, that's how I roll

473
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.710
Suppose instead, that what that
was doing is augmenting their

474
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:23.240
conversation with you being used
as that, or as those

475
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.460
of us who are getting
older and are hearing, you

476
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.460
know, too many rock concerts
and stuff hearing is going

477
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.620
that if it's acceptable to
have big things on your

478
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:39.260
ears and assistive devices like
that, then maybe we don't

479
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.400
have to make these tiny
little, you know, hearing AIDS

480
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.370
that have to be invisible,
but we can go with,

481
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.130
we can do things that
maybe technically could be much

482
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:53.000
more powerful by being able
to use bigger ones, because

483
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.790
it's now socially acceptable to
have something big on your

484
00:27:55.790 --> 00:28:00.080
head. I mean, yeah. And
that's something I've been looking

485
00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.560
and hoping would happen, but
we'll see The augment, the

486
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.700
augmented reality thing is very
interesting. I was at a

487
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.450
Microsoft conference recently and a
guy showed me a, and

488
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.760
I think we're all into
star Trek metaphors in this

489
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.680
talk. I'm not sure if
that's bringing the talk in

490
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.750
a good direction or bad
direction, but kind of a

491
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:24.080
Jordy Lefarge style, you know,
sunglasses that had, I think

492
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.140
it was an 800 by
600 screen. I could see.

493
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.160
And basically they were taking
advantage of the way that

494
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.710
the eye worked such that
you, it wasn't actually blocking

495
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.990
your vision, but it looked
like it was overlaid over

496
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.290
your vision. And it was
entirely voice-based. So you could

497
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.200
be walking around and say
something like, you know, navigate

498
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.300
to cnn.com and it would,
it would come up. It

499
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.400
was kind of like, like
you just described in the

500
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.060
background. Right. And then recently
there was a smartphone application

501
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.630
that said that too many
people were bumping into poles.

502
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.930
Well, texting. Right. So what
it ended up doing was

503
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.270
it takes the camera on
the phone and it makes

504
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:03.440
the background of your email.
What's behind the, Oh, that's

505
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.640
very one. When, like, you
remember You're walking forward with

506
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.900
your head down, but you're
actually looking forward by virtue

507
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.660
of the fact that the
camera works that way. I

508
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.810
thought that was a very
strange way to kind of

509
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.580
augment reality. Yeah. Well, I
mean The, the original Walkman

510
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.740
had a microphone on it
so that when, and to

511
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.900
ear phones, to earphone plugs,
so you could be walking

512
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.080
with a friend, but you
could hear the sounds of

513
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.210
walking, you know, of, of
cars going by if you

514
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.400
wanted to, they eventually dropped
that. I guess that's a

515
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.010
great idea. It's, it's cool
to have that idea, but

516
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.580
I'm thinking in terms of
augmentation, well, first of all,

517
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.380
when you think this natal
ability to gesture and stuff,

518
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.450
so you don't even have
to be seen what you're

519
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.880
doing in essence, you're signing
to the computer in a

520
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.720
way, or, you know, or,
or it's not just waving

521
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.680
as much as you could
at the same time that

522
00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.040
you're talking, you can be
controlling and the other person

523
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.520
can see you doing it
and understanding it so that,

524
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.740
and of course, they may
have one too. So I

525
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.360
could say, Oh, it was
a really cool thing. I

526
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.550
saw look at this, you
know, I mean, and we

527
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.800
bring it up on both
our screens, which is kind

528
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.290
of an interesting thing to
do, and that still hasn't

529
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.600
happened. Yeah. I mean, we're
going to have that stuff.

530
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.400
I think that we have
the device with the cell

531
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.680
phone, the, the thing that
basically the small thing that

532
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.480
you carry in your pocket,
the Palm pilot was one

533
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.590
of those, the cell phone,
the, the digital camera. And

534
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.590
we're merging a lot of
those things together. Some uses

535
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:37.540
of computing, such as simple,
you know, the equivalent of

536
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.940
text messaging or whatever, sending
a message asynchronously that people

537
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.270
can look at when they
want that doesn't bother. Doesn't

538
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.870
require them to give their
whole attention and stop everything

539
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:54.820
they're doing instantly synchronously with
you to communicate. But I

540
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.060
think we're going to see
more wall sized devices and

541
00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.910
we can communicate, we can
control them much better now

542
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.420
that we have, if we
have gestural interfaces, like we're

543
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.220
seeing with CNN and CNN
frequently uses that, that magic

544
00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:13.480
wall with multiple people, as
they discuss and look at

545
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.990
things, there's one, person's talking
to another and saying, see

546
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:21.280
this, and it's augmenting the
conversation. And the control of

547
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:27.370
it is much more, more
transparent to both people watching

548
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.190
it. And I also think
it's really something that means

549
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.040
training is better because I
watch you use it. I

550
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.910
learned things that I didn't
know, I could do A

551
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.490
really good point. And I
think that people definitely want

552
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.700
that kind of interaction because
I think that the listeners

553
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.850
would probably agree that often
we'll find ourselves watching a

554
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.660
TV show or a movie
with, with the spouse or

555
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.820
in a, in a group.
And someone says, Hey, is

556
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.630
that, that actor from that
thing, whoever has the tiniest

557
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:58.380
laptop definitely pulls up the
internet movie database to look

558
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.840
at that. And then the
laptop is passed around, right?

559
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.570
That interaction could happen on
a giant, giant table in

560
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.300
front of you, right. Or
an, on an overlay somewhere

561
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.120
on the screen itself that
everyone's already looking at. It's

562
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.790
kind of ironic that we
want that interaction so much

563
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.270
that we would drag the
laptop along with us. Right.

564
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.180
And it may be so
much more socially acceptable to

565
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.980
be doing the search while
they watch you doing it,

566
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.910
rather than have you turn
your head down and lose

567
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.760
the co from the conversation
that we were both sort

568
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.940
of checking at the same
time. I mean, there's, there's

569
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.420
all this fine tuning of
it. And, you know, I,

570
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.970
I try to, you know,
in the book, I try

571
00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.580
to provide lots of background
for a lot of this

572
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.660
thinking, learning to think that
way I wrote the essay

573
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.940
because I was in a
certain mindset having worked on

574
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.700
this book in essence, this
is like a last chapter

575
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.040
that was written based on
stuff that happened after the

576
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.230
book was done, that I
got used to looking at

577
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.940
these, putting a lot of
things together, looking at some

578
00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.740
trends, the sensitivity like professor
Arielli that I talk about

579
00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:08.260
in a chapter about cooperation.
We're about how about the

580
00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.520
difference between free versus not
free. And there are a

581
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.220
whole lot of social aspects
of what I'll do for

582
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.600
a group. And what I'll
do only when I'm here

583
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:23.140
paid and the aspect of
that back to star Trek.

584
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.230
Yeah. The interview that I
did, which was available first

585
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.630
as a podcast, but it's
a transcript in the book

586
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:33.880
with a, a person who
was the commander of the

587
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.390
USS enterprise. Okay. Not the
star ship enterprise, but the

588
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:41.650
USS enterprise. And he was
a commander of that fleet

589
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:46.660
on September 11th, 2001 as, as an
aircraft carrier. Yeah. It's an

590
00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.240
aircraft carrier, actually. It's a
battle group that included an

591
00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.860
aircraft carrier and they, and
after they got to watch

592
00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.440
of course on CNN or
whatever, you know, what was

593
00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.700
happening in New York and the
Pentagon and stuff and horrified,

594
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.930
but then they, they zipped
it over to near Pakistan,

595
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.600
I think, and starch and
shot the first cruise missiles

596
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.730
that were sent to, to
Afghanistan. Okay. When this captain

597
00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.640
was controlling and the people
were controlling the cruise missiles,

598
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:21.140
they did it using chat
rooms. Okay. And w w

599
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.800
with maybe hundreds of people
in a variety of chat

600
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:31.270
rooms, controlling military, real military
equipment, where the commander, the,

601
00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.600
the, you know, the head,
the, the head Admiral or

602
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.710
whatever was able to, and
watch what was going on,

603
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.640
and maybe see a comment
from somebody multiple levels down

604
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.760
and use their background to
say, Oh, you know, this

605
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.820
means such and such. And
it's all quiet. It's very

606
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:51.340
eerily, quiet and nice and
calm because a lot of

607
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:55.810
it's not people yelling squawking
into microphone and radios, and

608
00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.970
this is completely different than
the image you got in

609
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:02.470
star Trek, which is so
1950s command and control. You

610
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.900
know, that the, the, the
top person talks to the

611
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.030
next level, who talks to
the next level, talks to

612
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.600
the next level. And there's
a big conference call in

613
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.080
essence, it's a big conference
call, but it's done, it's

614
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.090
it. But conference calls, you
have to be careful of

615
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.700
who's speaking, when you have
a lot of multiple chat

616
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.240
rooms, all, you know, you're
looking at multiple ones on

617
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.480
the screen. I mean, this
is how they really work

618
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.260
today. If you can't do
multiple chats, you can't be

619
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.440
a Navy seal. That kind
of weird, not just, you

620
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:33.850
have to be able to
see well and shoot well,

621
00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:38.520
and, you know, certain things
like that, two to, to

622
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.580
be, you know, really good
in the military, you have

623
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.680
to be able to deal
with multiple chat conversations, which

624
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.100
I found out that wasn't
the image we had in

625
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.760
the old days and this
technology driven that makes this

626
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.300
possible. Cause that wasn't possible.
I mean, they used to

627
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.730
have many people would be
on a telephone call, right.

628
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.980
But how many telephone calls
can you be on at

629
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.560
once? You can only sit
in on one and what

630
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.140
happened during nine 11? Well,
some people didn't have them

631
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.610
to be listening to the
right call at the right

632
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:15.030
time. You know, I mean
with certain things and, and

633
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:18.360
we, we had point to
point communications. And if you

634
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.530
look at than other chapter,
I talk about a lot

635
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.470
what happened in during nine
11 and stuff with communications

636
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:29.880
and what we learned from
that, and the fact that

637
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.350
we could have multiple conversations
simultaneously is a technology thing.

638
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.380
We didn't have radios don't
make that easy. Cause we

639
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.690
attention. We can only listen
to one at a time.

640
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.680
Well, and ultimately we can
only look at a chat

641
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.810
one at a time, but
we can read faster than

642
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:47.600
we can here. We can
roll back. This gets back

643
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.140
to, to, you know, Google
wave and stuff. The fact

644
00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.680
that you can roll back
and, and say, Ooh, wait,

645
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.320
what was this? What did
I miss? You know, when

646
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.900
they say, Dan, what do
you think? You know, you

647
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.790
can quick, quick, quick roll
back and see what the

648
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:07.310
conversation was to be able
to, you know, which, you

649
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:11.420
know, depending on how much
is happening, how fast, but,

650
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.140
you know, younger people I'm
assuming have been, this is

651
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.000
where there is a difference
in age. A lot of

652
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.660
younger people are much more
used to having doing multiple

653
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.770
things. They're paying attention to
being, doing homework at the

654
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.080
same time that you're chatting
with multiple people or whatever

655
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.140
that, you know, to older
people. We just can't imagine

656
00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.420
such a thing, you know,
and aren't skilled at it,

657
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.580
but that is a skill
that many people do have

658
00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.880
now. Right. You know, one
of the things that is

659
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.460
that is significant about all
the things we've talked about

660
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.010
is that the, you know,
in a lot of instances,

661
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:49.130
the language and the application
architecture are not there for

662
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:53.090
us to, to do these
things. That's right. To the,

663
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.230
the appropriate level of abstraction.
Isn't quite there yet. There's

664
00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.470
too much asynchrony for the
average programmer to handle right

665
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:03.920
now systems as they are,
or these kinds of systems

666
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.010
would be very difficult to
write. Okay, we need frameworks

667
00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.500
just like windowing to, I
mean, just think what it

668
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.450
was like, Oh, we have
graphics. Well, you know what?

669
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.790
It's like to build an
entire windowing system. If you

670
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.580
had to do it yourself,
you know, and to make

671
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.010
the scroll bars work right.
And all those things. And,

672
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.030
and, you know, so you
really like to have the,

673
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.850
the library is the API
APIs, the, the frameworks for,

674
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.750
for dealing with all of
those things, the tools that

675
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:33.560
let you do that. And
in these new paradigms that

676
00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.770
we're seeing the, that we're
expecting computing to work because

677
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.100
we use it in other
parts of our lives so

678
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.990
much, that's going to drive
changes. And that's why I

679
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:51.160
raised the flag and suddenly
realized, Oh, we gotta, as

680
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.520
programmers, we have to realize
that we're going to have

681
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.950
to deal with this over
time, and then not too

682
00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:00.880
distant future. And even in
corporate, eventually you have to

683
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.570
switch. It may not be
10 years from now, but

684
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.310
you may have to start
learning some of this and

685
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.850
to know when it's appropriate.
No, at the beginning of

686
00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.830
the interview, I kind of
tongue in cheek introduced you

687
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.110
as an old guy with
a beard. I think that,

688
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.780
you know, guys like myself
that are, you know, I

689
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.360
mean, I'm in my mid
thirties, kind of have this,

690
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.850
this archetype of the old
Unix guy with a beard

691
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:26.040
when, and I'm surprised, it
feels like there's, there's fewer

692
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.700
older folks. And I don't
necessarily mean old guys, ladies,

693
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.090
as well as fewer older
folks than, than I would

694
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:36.240
have expected by now. How
come you're not tired of

695
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.930
computers? Why didn't you burn
out and start fishing? Well,

696
00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.680
I love it. I mean,
I actually changed my life

697
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.380
from being a, you know,
a CTO who was, wasn't

698
00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.720
doing much to going back
to programming and I've been

699
00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:53.130
doing a lot of programming
most of in JavaScript recently

700
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.450
before that's in Pearl and
stuff. Cause well, I'm frequently

701
00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:00.540
asked questions and I like
to, and I do consulting

702
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.900
of various sorts, et cetera.
And I need to know

703
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.880
what's what's happening today. And
I love programming. I love

704
00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.390
it when, you know, I
mean, if, you know, if

705
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.340
you're a programmer, you know,
the joy of the craft

706
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:13.980
and I happen to like
that a lot. I mean,

707
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.560
I, I, wouldn't talking to
bill Gates. I've had him,

708
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:18.900
I've been talking, I've talked
to him in times when

709
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.420
he, you know, wistfully, you
can see a look on

710
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.850
his face. All I remember
when I shipped code, you

711
00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.120
know, the last time on
the TRS 80 model 100

712
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:33.330
or something. And the, that
was, you know, it's a

713
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:37.830
thing that I love and
I need to stay up

714
00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:40.890
to date to be able
to comment upon it. But

715
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:42.930
so often I hear about
people who've only been doing

716
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:45.270
this five years, 10 years.
They're like, Oh, I'm burned

717
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.580
out. It's coming too fast.
How, how do you keep

718
00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.360
from getting burned down with
the, which Typically I go

719
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.800
back and do the other
thing and I'll do a

720
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.770
startup or something I'm involved
in business and stuff like

721
00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:59.340
that. Or I do expert
witness work. I get to

722
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.380
look in the, go back
to the past, looking at

723
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:06.090
old patent stuff or things.
Yeah. It's been, there's lots

724
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.750
of, but I happen to,
I mean, I like it.

725
00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.510
I mean, and maybe those
that burn out quick, weren't

726
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:16.500
meant for it. You know,
a, you know, I mean,

727
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.940
there are a lot of
people who made it through

728
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:21.420
the, that horrible time after
2000, you know, when you

729
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.760
couldn't, there was no money
for tech and stuff like

730
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.130
that. And those that stayed
in it, not for the

731
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.230
money, they stayed in it
for the love of the

732
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:31.950
technology, but there are many
ways of going, maybe what

733
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.850
you're doing, you should like,
I'm starting to do more

734
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.180
programming. I think I'll be
doing more programming for the,

735
00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:42.380
the handheld for the mobile
phone. You know, I have

736
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.360
a Oh and iPod touch
and I have a, an

737
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.370
Android, you know, G one
and I just got a

738
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:53.090
Palm pre. And since I'm
a JavaScript programmer, I'm very

739
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:57.500
excited about the Palm pre.
And I'm excited that, you

740
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.860
know, when I see how
Google is pushing, what you

741
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.300
can do with HTML five
and things, and Microsoft acknowledging

742
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.100
that you can do a
lot with the stuff they're

743
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.540
showing with the latest, you
know, incarnations of their tools

744
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:17.210
they're doing using the browser.
It's, you know, there's cool

745
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:21.470
stuff there. And there's always
new things you can get

746
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.470
into. You know, I got
into Penn computing a while

747
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:28.340
back, I got into blogging
and podcasting. I'm having the

748
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.810
fun of working with all
this cool electronic audio equipment.

749
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.500
I got to, I tried
writing a book, which, which

750
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.640
was an interesting experience in
terms of that they'll being

751
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.490
the son of and grandson
of a printer. I had

752
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.580
been in the, you know,
the print world in various

753
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.600
ways, way back when and
type C type setting and

754
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.820
computerized type setting and word
processing. So there are always

755
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.490
new things you can keep
fresh with. You don't have

756
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:03.050
to be, you know, implementing
the, the 504th trend compiler,

757
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.050
which in our days, that's
what I, that was the,

758
00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:08.900
the thing I was taught
to be in college, you

759
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.330
know, is to be a
developer of Fortran compilers or

760
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.820
something like that. There's always
something new you can do

761
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.480
with computing to keep it
fresh. Yeah. I it's, it's

762
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.590
interesting is that, that, that
is the question that comes

763
00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.750
to that. People ask me
the most, is that, how

764
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:24.100
do you keep it fresh?
How do you keep from

765
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.380
getting bored and how do
you keep from getting overwhelmed

766
00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.510
at the same time? It's
just the idea that there

767
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.730
are, there are those. And
I was this guy too.

768
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:33.880
I always, I have this
archetype that I refer to

769
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:38.170
of the, the chief architect
of the Nebraska department of

770
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.900
forestry. You know, he's got
some kind of an important

771
00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.060
job and he's in charge
of something important, but his,

772
00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.870
his, his, his job betrays
him. And it's, it's difficult

773
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.480
to, you know, be an
access programmer for, for 10

774
00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.460
years and not eventually just
completely get burned out and

775
00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.380
say, gosh, I wish I
could work on this. And

776
00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.580
then life and everything prevents
one from tinkering around in

777
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.440
the garage, but it sounds
like you just have to

778
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.570
just do it. You just
jump in, you know, you

779
00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:07.630
jumped into podcasting, you got
your equipment, you're doing videos

780
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:11.530
on YouTube. Now you just
have to keep pounding forward.

781
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:13.750
It sounds like, Yeah, you,
you have to figure out,

782
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.690
I mean, video I got
into, because I was getting

783
00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.210
into open source and licensing
and legal stuff. And I

784
00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:23.170
wanted to do a training
video about to train programmers

785
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.610
about the, you know, some
legal things. Cause I figured

786
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.390
a program or talking to
a programmer would be a

787
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:32.190
good thing. And it was
either pay somebody to videotape

788
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.340
me or teach somebody to
blog who set up my

789
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.800
in return, set up a
studio for me so that

790
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.470
I could buy the equipment
for the same amount of

791
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.660
money I could have paid,
hired a crew for and

792
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.630
do it myself. And then
suddenly I was into video

793
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.830
and had learned to edit
and stuff like that. But

794
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.740
you know, that's why you
have to look at what

795
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.070
changes that are occurring. That
even if you're at, you

796
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.850
know, a department of something
or other, maybe the technology

797
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:03.540
has moved where it is
in the interest, not just

798
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.840
for fun, but in the
real interest of your institution,

799
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.140
that there'd be a step.
The next thing you do,

800
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.980
you can build in a
way that you can take

801
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.070
advantage of some of the
new things. And on the

802
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:18.870
side you may just have
to, you have to stay

803
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.080
fresh, but you have to
carefully choose what it is

804
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.720
you're going to do. I
mean, Microsoft makes it that

805
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.450
you, you have to relearn
how, what it means to

806
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:31.770
be a Microsoft programmer every
certain number of years, you

807
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.480
know? And if you get
off the track of doing

808
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.850
that, you fall behind. I
mean, the stuff I know

809
00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.220
how to do, you know,
with the old MFC and

810
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.740
stuff like that, probably doesn't
help me today in.net the

811
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.040
same way that, you know,
I'd have to go back

812
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.650
and get a new person
coming in is necessarily going

813
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.720
to jump. Maybe just as
fast as I would be.

814
00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.370
Right. Right. I mean, windows
itself, fundamentally hasn't changed. So

815
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.560
if you jumped into wind
farms, now the constructs are

816
00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.930
there, but you're right. All
the patterns are, all the

817
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.940
patterns are different. I mean,
the JavaScript that I learned,

818
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:04.940
isn't the JavaScript that there
is today. Yep. And so

819
00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.400
you you're, you're constantly being
forced. That's one of the

820
00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.410
things about being a programmer
that I've seen over the

821
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:13.460
years is that you do
have to constantly reeducate yourself

822
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.320
every once in a while,
you basically are going to

823
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.230
spend three to six months
of not being very productive

824
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.270
while you start, you know,
learning some new, new type

825
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.610
of technology that you're going
to use. A lot of

826
00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.860
programmers are real good that
I know basically choose the

827
00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.680
jobs they are getting by.
Whether it's going to keep

828
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.500
them fresh or not, and
willing to take ones that

829
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.470
may not pay as well
specifically so that they can

830
00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:40.940
become fresh and get into
the latest. But you have

831
00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.700
to choose. There's always so
many of them choosing which

832
00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.120
one is the one to
learn, which will teach you

833
00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.790
a generic skill. That could
be helpful in many others.

834
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.340
That's kind of tough. That's
why it helps to look

835
00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.400
back and see how things
have moved over time. And

836
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.340
when does something resonate that
this is one to jump

837
00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.440
to this, isn't going to
be a dead end for

838
00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.640
me that I've always see
you. You would view me

839
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.740
as a gray beard though
on the cover of the

840
00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.630
book, they have the picture
that I used in my

841
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:12.440
early blogging. So I wasn't
great yet. The inside you'll

842
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.840
see pictures of me with
gray beer. Now my beard

843
00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.800
is quite correct, but when
I was, Oh, when I

844
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.860
first started working at one
of the times that digital

845
00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.790
early in my career at
digital equipment corporation and I

846
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:29.530
was 25, I was working
for somebody who I was

847
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.100
born the year I was
born. He was in college

848
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.100
working on the whirlwind project
and you can actually see

849
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.820
pictures of him. What Edward
R Murrow, when he interviewed

850
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:43.960
Jay Forrester showing early computers
in 1951, the year I

851
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.260
was born and I was
working for somebody who was

852
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.960
my age at the time
I was working with him

853
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:53.020
when I was born. And
this is a guy who

854
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:57.130
I think helped invent the
index register or something like

855
00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:02.010
that or something that was
used in, in, in, in

856
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.140
macro assemblers or something like
that. Something we just did.

857
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.410
So take for granted. And
he was involved in that

858
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.600
in the fifties. And then
I was involved in things

859
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:16.270
you would take for granted
in the seventies. And, and

860
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.580
now, you know, it's the
same type of thing that

861
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.780
there's always people who go
way back and you, you

862
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:23.920
want to go see this
as what can I learn

863
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.440
from what happened? I listened
very carefully to what Jack

864
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.350
would say, what Jack Gilmore would
say about the good old

865
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:33.400
days and you know, stories
from, they were pulling all

866
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.970
nighters for the demo they
were doing for TV. The

867
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.750
same way we do them
today. It's just really weird.

868
00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.090
Some of the same stuff
just keeps coming back. And

869
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:46.150
it's just part of the
part of the craft. It

870
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.540
does all come back. Well,
people can read your, your

871
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.880
new book. They can go
to brooklyn.com and you've got

872
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.040
a link right there on
the home page. And you're

873
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.120
on Twitter now as a
and V. So twitter.com/dan being,

874
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:59.980
I'll put all the links
for all of this stuff

875
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.770
up on the, the show
site so that folks can

876
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.560
connect with you online. I'm
good. I appreciate it. I'm

877
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.930
glad that you like it.
Well. Yeah. Well, thanks so

878
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:09.460
much for sitting down to
chat with me and giving

879
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.830
me as much time as
you did. I really appreciate

880
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:16.480
it. Take care. This has
been another episode of Hansel

881
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.430
minutes and I'll see you
again next week.
