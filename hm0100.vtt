From Hansel minutes.com it's Hansel
minutes or weekly discussion with

2
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.000
web developer and technologists. Scott
Hanselman hosted by Carl Franklin. There's

3
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.160
this Lawrence Ryan announcing show number
100 recorded live Tuesday, February 12th, 2008.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.230
Support for Hanselman it's just
provided by. Tellerik already controls

asp.net web applications. online@wwwdottelerik.com. In
this episode, Scott talks with

7
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.620
Microsoft CTO, norm Juda. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman and

8
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.420
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. This is in

9
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.940
fact our 100th show, and
I am lucky enough to

10
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.670
be sitting here at Microsoft
tech ready, six in Seattle,

11
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.180
Washington with norm Juda, the
CTO of Microsoft services. Thank

12
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.800
you, sir, for taking time
out of your busy schedule

13
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.660
to talk to me. Hey
Scott. Nice to be here.

14
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.680
So you're the CTO, chief
technology officer of a very,

15
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.530
very, very large section of
Microsoft. If not, I mean,

16
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.780
we have more than one
CTO, Not inside of the

17
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.330
services organization in the field.
I'm the only one right

18
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.280
now. Okay. So how many
people do you have underneath

19
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.750
you? So Microsoft services is
a worldwide organization spread across

20
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.320
all the geographies from consumer
support all the way through

21
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.520
enterprise support and consulting and
all up mess about 16,000

22
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.280
people. Wow. And that's a
nontrivial number and we're talking

23
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.080
about people in all over
the world. So like your

24
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.570
point is that you might
have MCs, Poland and MCs,

25
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.260
South Africa and MCs, whatever, And
MCs Vietnam. That's just opening

26
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.290
up and Thailand and Latin
America. So it's both big

27
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.620
and small And they have
local MCs people. So if

28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.840
you're an MTS Thailand, you
might very well be tire.

29
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.090
You could be from anywhere
in the world. Yep. And

30
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.910
as we, as Microsoft opens
up offices around the world,

31
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.250
one of the first part
of the office is we've

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.110
got to provide support. If
we're going to sell product,

33
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.600
how do we provide support
and consulting? So very early

34
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.830
in the incubation of new
countries services. Yeah. And these

35
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.630
are people who have their
own culture and their own

36
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.610
style, but at the same
time, the company has to

37
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.280
have its certain culture and
certain style. I mean, when,

38
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.040
when I got hired at
Microsoft, they were asking the

39
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.260
question, I didn't realize this
until after the interview, but

40
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.450
is this a Microsoft hire?
Will he fit in with

41
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.390
the culture we hire for
the, for the, the company,

42
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.730
not for the position. How
do you make sure you

43
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.600
have consistently consistency of talent
of culture across 16,000 people?

44
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.930
Is there actually three dimensions
to the hiring problem? One

45
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.140
is the Microsoft culture, which
is how do we, you

46
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.720
know, the Microsoft type a
personality and Microsoft is not

47
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.820
right for everybody. And so
do you fit into the

48
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.030
company? The second one is,
do you fit into the

49
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.510
local culture? And that is
very different. As we expand

50
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.880
through new geographies in Eastern
Europe, Latin America, the local

51
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.350
culture is also very important,
but some work that did

52
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.470
about three years ago inside
of services is to layer

53
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.310
on top of that technical
communities. In other words, if

54
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.980
you're a database guy and
you're in Malaysia, how do

55
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.590
you connect with the database
guy who's in Brazil or

56
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.700
who's in Chicago, who's in
Paris. And so we've led

57
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.240
in this big matrix organization,
both the geography and then

58
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.540
the technical community. So we
provide the connection across those

59
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.020
multiple dimensions. And then we
add industry on top of

60
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.840
that. So any individual, for
example, sits at an intersection

61
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.020
in a multidimensional space of
country, geography, technology industry, maybe

62
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.440
vertical, maybe horizontal. That really
starts to define who you

63
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.720
are as an individual and
how you contribute into the

64
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.680
overall company. That's really interesting.
Now, as someone who builds

65
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.260
a, has built a small
online community, one of the

66
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.670
things that I've tried to
foster is a sense of

67
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.760
positivity, of welcoming, a sense
of if you don't know

68
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.890
the answer it's okay. Is
it that it needs to

69
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.220
be a safe place to
ask questions? Not every culture

70
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.670
in the world values for
lack of better word values

71
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.880
and competence much like, you
know, like the U S

72
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.700
does like some countries do,
do you have any trouble

73
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.970
with people being so good?
And so type a, that,

74
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.730
that aspect of the culture
is, you know what I'm

75
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.390
saying? So We see interesting
behaviors inside of the communities.

76
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.050
We do see a lot
of that. We see those

77
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.830
who contribute into the communities,
those who ask questions, those

78
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.190
who give good answers. We
actually also see the people

79
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.660
who come in and say,
no, no, no, no, no.

80
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.700
This has been answered a
long time ago. Go look

81
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.800
at the fact you can
find to do your homework.

82
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.000
And so communities have to
be self managing. And it

83
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.690
turns out that in the
Microsoft culture, there's enough self

84
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.480
management to spank the people
when they're ill behaved and

85
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.000
to instruct the people when
they need help. Interesting. And

86
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.300
so our communities are about
a thousand people. Each, some

87
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.630
are smaller, some are larger.
And the interesting fact is

88
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.930
how long it took us
to get the communities running.

89
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.630
And we, when we started
it, we went out to

90
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.180
quite a lot of research
on the open source communities

91
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.310
and some of the other
consultant companies, but nobody had

92
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.020
really done what we were
trying to do. We couldn't

93
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.780
find anybody. And so we
did it bottoms up. We

94
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.270
looked at the MVP process,
that's in place sort of

95
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.660
the Microsoft outreach to folks
out in our customer and

96
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.420
partner base. And then we
sort of implemented our own

97
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.940
version of that. And what
we figured out is it

98
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.210
took us about two years
to get it, to be

99
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.600
self sustaining and self feeding.
You have to get to

100
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.670
that critical mass of activity.
And there are a couple

101
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.200
of key things that we
did along the way to

102
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.990
drive that. But once you
get there, you can't stop

103
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.350
it. Once you get over
the edge over the chasm

104
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.780
it become, but you've got
to care and feed for

105
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.200
it. So I have, for
example, reporting to me, community

106
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.600
directors, whose job it is
to care and feed for

107
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.660
those communities and that works.
So you have to have

108
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.230
that self sustaining communities always
have to have some notion

109
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.710
of somebody who's causing it
to happen, not necessarily leading

110
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.250
it, right? Yeah. Kind of
the, the eternal watchmaker, you

111
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.160
know, you build that watch
and you let it work

112
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.390
and you may have to
tune it up a little

113
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.250
bit pointing in a certain
direction, but for the most

114
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.940
part it'll handle itself. So
now as someone who has

115
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.060
a number of years of
history in the business, I

116
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.560
always find it really interesting
to talk to people who've

117
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.030
been in the job in
the business a lot longer

118
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.950
than I have. I've been
doing this about 15 years

119
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.170
and the, the speed at
which things have happened, even

120
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.940
in just my 15 years
from, I mean, I ran

121
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.770
a bulletin board and I
had, you know, if I

122
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.170
had three people dialed into
my bulletin board at once

123
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.010
that level of concurrency and,
you know, multiple chat was

124
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.810
amazing. So I had built
a little community of a

125
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.360
couple of hundred people. And
now you can throw up

126
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.150
a forum board and put
together a community, a couple

127
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.160
hundred people and a couple
thousand spammers within a few

128
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.120
seconds. What is your sense
of history as far as

129
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.030
how community builds over this
last 30 years? I mean,

130
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.990
was it communities where labs
in colleges before in today?

131
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.910
The cultural aspect of communities
is me has just turned

132
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.370
out to be one of
the interesting social engineering problems

133
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.930
that we've tackled deeply. In
this case, the historical perspective

134
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.870
has always been the community
was very local because you

135
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.180
weren't connected, right? So it
was a bunch of guys

136
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.150
who got together for beer
and pizza on Friday. But

137
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.910
what you miss with that
is the diversity of the

138
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.310
community, because the guys who
are getting together for beer

139
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.650
and pizza are all the
people who are in the

140
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.200
same office, in the same
space, in the same geography,

141
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.490
right? The value of community
is the diversity. And, you

142
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.830
know, there are many folks
who look around it's systems

143
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.820
and applications produced in this
country. And I'll typically an

144
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.820
integrity. I do this all
the time, give stereotypical examples

145
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.070
of applications that are not
here. I'll give you a

146
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.800
quick example. We have a
great application that we're writing

147
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.470
in China with one of
the mobile operators in Beijing,

148
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.410
and it's around creating an
instant messaging system, driven off

149
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.460
an SMS backbone. Okay, they're
going to pilot the system

150
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.470
just to test it out.
And the pilot's going to

151
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.210
be with 7 million users. And
if the posit works, then

152
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.180
they'll scale it to about
200 million. And if that works,

153
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.940
they'll then roll it out
to billions. And so the

154
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.940
magnitude of the problem set
is so different that the

155
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.740
diversity of the community is
really important. And you know,

156
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.190
there's always, there's another guy
who's somewhere else who actually

157
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.900
has another interesting aspect on
it. So historically the span

158
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.160
of contact has been the
thing that has changed. What

159
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.110
are the tools that we've
got to be able to

160
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.170
do that? So beyond the
guys, having beer and pizza,

161
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.570
you might've held me vet
that was a North American

162
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.090
event or a European event.
So you would have started

163
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.510
to get some people together
there. So your geographic span

164
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.290
has expanded because of air
travel. And maybe you are

165
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.800
running a dial up bulletin
board, as you say, but

166
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.620
generally the people in the
bulletin board are pretty dedicated.

167
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.380
What you have to do
is make it a natural

168
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.220
way of people's lives for
the community to work. It

169
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.870
has to be, they have
to have a place where

170
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.290
they can go. When they're
in a customer situation, don't

171
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.950
have access to your private
networks. They can get to

172
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.730
that information and get to
it immediately. So the, the

173
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.980
change of the internet and
the immediacy of information, you

174
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.710
have to replicate that in
your community. Because if, if

175
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.790
I can find it quickly,
I'm fine. We had had

176
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.800
a discussion on my blog
a couple of months ago

177
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.930
about the concept of the
third place and the idea

178
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.170
that in the, in social
and sociology, someone needs home

179
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.410
work and elsewhere where elsewhere
is either a bar or

180
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.190
a church or whatever. And
people were saying that for

181
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.930
a lot of people, that
the internet has become that

182
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.270
third place or a blog
or forum and whether or

183
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.390
not that was a healthy
thing. And it's interesting to

184
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.210
see other cultures find that
third place. It's interesting, like

185
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.600
in Africa, in my wife's
from, from Southern Africa and

186
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.450
we've been to Tanzania in
Zimbabwe and South Africa, and the

187
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:47.300
third place is SMS. It's
Chad and that's amongst people

188
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.150
who don't necessarily have computers,
but that, that sense of

189
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.930
mobile information has been getting
me thinking about that, that

190
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.930
gap between the laptop and
the phone that seems to

191
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.520
need to be failed. And
people keep trying to shove

192
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.150
devices in their Microsoft origami
and different tablets and things

193
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.400
like that. I keep on
keeping I'm kind of rambling,

194
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.750
but I keep wondering if
we're going to have some

195
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.540
kind of a roll up
tablet device, that's going to

196
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.680
give us that four by
six card. Well, I think

197
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.330
the, the interesting thing about
mobile devices across the generations

198
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.840
that you have described is
that the half life of

199
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.390
the device and the rate
of change in the device

200
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.550
far exceeds the laptops that
we've seen. And that the

201
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.340
good thing is that phones
are kind of disposable. It's

202
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.630
a good thing and a
bad thing, cause we not

203
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.060
sure, sure what to do
with these disposable phones and

204
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.670
how we treat the garbage
that we create with that.

205
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.200
But the recycling of the
phones and the generational movements

206
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.760
about the movement that we've
gone from barely connected telephones

207
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.040
into three G phones today,
and then three and a

208
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.830
half and four G phones
and your ability, it's this

209
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.300
immediacy of inflammation contact and
how that is going to

210
00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.260
provide access. Either through voice,
you'll talk to your phone

211
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.540
and somebody will come back
to you. And actually it

212
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.940
might be a touring machine.
On the other side, it's

213
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.370
going to come back and
give you this information, but

214
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.810
as people travel around and
as you're not always in

215
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.380
your first place at home,
you actually are still connected.

216
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.750
You'll always be in your
third place. You always have

217
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.170
this notion of partially connected
and connected when I really

218
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.720
need them. Yeah. We've been
watching this community called Twitter

219
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.690
development. And Twitter is, I
mean, other than the fact

220
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.580
that you have to use
your thumb keyboard to get

221
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.660
your 140 characters out, it's
basically a whatever thought is

222
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.490
in your head at the
time somebody goes out on

223
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.710
the wire and the scary
part is that it's archived

224
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.340
for all eternity. Right? Well,
the thing I find fascinating

225
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.070
about this is we've done
a lot of work looking

226
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.930
at the generational aspects of
user experience and the user

227
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.560
experience that we might have
an expectations that we'd might

228
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.100
have a very different to
those of my kids. I

229
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.410
have two kids who are
just in college. Okay. One's

230
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.230
a junior and one's a
freshmen and their ability to

231
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:04.750
deal with multiple streams of
information concurrently across multiple modalities,

232
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.990
the phone I am music,
and God knows what else

233
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.880
going on. And some of
it's about work, but some

234
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.340
of it is not their
ability to do that as

235
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.360
one thing. And the second
thing is the anonymity of

236
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.010
information that they will publish.
And it's, it's both frightening

237
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.980
and fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. But
the thing I find, the

238
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.800
part that we're interested in
looking at is, so when

239
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.950
that generation, in five years
time, it starts to be

240
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.860
the strength of the workforce.
What are they going to

241
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.820
expect from business applications, from
CRM applications, from it? How

242
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.950
are they going to apply
for a mortgage? It's not

243
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.190
going to be on 11
by 14 pages with 17

244
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.850
signatures on it. It's going
to be different. And so

245
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.650
that's the part that images
I want to come full

246
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.480
circle. Cause you sort of
alluded to this a little

247
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.430
bit earlier on, which is
what does a CTO do,

248
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.680
right? That's one of the
things that a CTO does

249
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.110
is what are the things
that we have to be

250
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.740
doing as a technology company
that empowers the scenario, just

251
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.720
describe what are we going
to do from a tools

252
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.130
perspective, from an infrastructure perspective
that allows those applications to

253
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.670
be built. There's a talk
that I've done periodically, which

254
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.270
is called architectural discontinuity is
in the last mile, which

255
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.230
is what are the architectural
discontinuities that are coming. And

256
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.350
then how do we close
the gap of that architectural

257
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.820
last mile and laying that
out to 16,000 of your

258
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.820
closest friends so that they
can communicate it to their

259
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.730
customers. And here's the problem
set. And by the way,

260
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.740
this is a co as
a company, this is what

261
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.190
Microsoft is going to do
about that. And when you've

262
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.500
got all these cultures and
all these modalities and these

263
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.570
multiple dimensions, and I mean,
at this point, these things

264
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.550
can't be described in a
two dimensional graph anymore. I

265
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.340
mean, we've got more dimensions
than we can visit visualize.

266
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.370
How do you take things
that are just part of

267
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.730
the business? Like, like certifications.
Like if someone says, you

268
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.630
know, all of our customers
are MCs, whatever startup star,

269
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.260
maybe all of our consultants
should be MCs start at

270
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.890
star. I'm sure discussions like
that must must happen, but

271
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.770
maybe they're not appropriate on
a cultural basis. Maybe one

272
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.590
culture doesn't think that testing
is appropriate. I mean, H

273
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.780
those are the kinds of
fights that you, that you

274
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.430
deal with. Cause we have
to deal with that at

275
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.050
our, you know, what am
I going to say? Our

276
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.650
company I've worked at Microsoft
for four months previously to

277
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.770
keep our status. We had
to be a solution developer

278
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.510
or whatever, our MCs people,
It is something that we're

279
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.360
driving. So this event check
ready, which is an integral

280
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.850
Microsoft event for our technical
field. It's sort of like

281
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.750
tech, ed internal. It's the
way of thinking about it.

282
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.650
Exactly. We actually have the
ability for people to take

283
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.420
certification courses. Yeah. And there'll
be about 1200 exams that

284
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.760
people will take by the
way. Not everybody passes the

285
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.060
first time. That's true. I
know that. I know that

286
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.100
too. And so we actually
have a lot of these

287
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.190
things that are going on
here to actually drive that

288
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.140
same level of certification. And,
but we have a double

289
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.440
dimension problem that somebody outside
of Microsoft doesn't have is

290
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.810
one you have to know
about the current set of

291
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.560
products and as a Microsoft
consultant and having come, I

292
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.290
actually joined Microsoft in 1990
as the first architect in

293
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.320
consulting when there were 20
people. Oh, wow. And it's

294
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.480
interesting when you're the Microsoft
consultant and you're inside a

295
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.350
customer, you're the Excel macro
guy, the PowerPoint color-code guy.

296
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.450
You might actually be the
middle tier data architect as

297
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.300
well, but you're Microsoft when
you're there. And the expectation

298
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.580
of the customer is that
you actually know or can

299
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.190
find out about a lot
of stuff. And so there's

300
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.520
this expectation of ambient level
of information, which is almost

301
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.480
impossible to sustain. And then
you have to know about

302
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.200
what's coming and how the
current things, the current technologies

303
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.180
are going to be morphing
and changing of a time

304
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.650
to be something else. And
so the accreditation problem actually

305
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.880
is a necessary, but insufficient
in this case, we've got

306
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.870
to get beyond there, Right?
Yeah. You went exactly where

307
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.190
I thought you were going
to go with that. I

308
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.290
appreciate that. As someone who
worked with large banks in

309
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.870
the, in all over the,
all the U S I

310
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.110
worked for a company that
did banking and we, we

311
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.870
always came up against IBM.
And the joke was in

312
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.080
the early two thousands was
that my IBM developer, my

313
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.050
IBM consulting services person has
20 years of experience. And

314
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.890
my Microsoft consulting person is
20. And, and this was,

315
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.070
this was the case in
the late nineties. And it's,

316
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.120
it's been really interesting to
interact with a lot of

317
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.790
MCs people in the last,
you know, kind of five

318
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.940
to six years that have
really kind of, you know,

319
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.270
hardcore experience 10, 15 years
working in like large banks

320
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.520
in the Northeast and things
like that was that just

321
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.590
a matter of the maturity
of the organization. I mean,

322
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.860
MCs just had to get
older. Well, it's older and

323
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.980
more mature. The problem set
that we're dealing with changes

324
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.290
sort of MCs version one
was about infrastructure, was about

325
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.620
deploying, Oh, it's two at
that time. Yeah. At times,

326
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.620
You know, getting an infrastructure
in place, followed by the

327
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.390
apps today, it's actually very
different today. There's a part

328
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.870
that's about infrastructure. There's a
part about applications. And there's

329
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.990
actually a new initiative that
we're driving. We're just creating

330
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.210
this called engineered for health
is how do you actually

331
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.300
design applications that are built
to be healthy? How do

332
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.600
you design applications that are
built to be green? So

333
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.430
a lot of work that's
going on in that space.

334
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:15.100
So there's different problems being
solved. And the altitudes, the

335
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.680
level of sophistication in those
problems is different than it

336
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.380
might've been Well writing an
application to be green is

337
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:24.070
really, I mean, did we
know that the background spellchecker

338
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.590
in word was going to
cost us battery life, right?

339
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.690
And to write an application
that has to deal with

340
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.640
that additional set of input.
We used to think that

341
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.650
input started at the keyboard
and kind of ended it

342
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.870
in the program. And now
you've got other bits of

343
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.980
context flowing in from the
machine. Well, Yeah, there's many

344
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.550
notions about the stimuli that
drive the system, be it

345
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.210
input or remote access or
whatever, but there's also been

346
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:50.340
this fundamental architectural assumption that
was made with most applications,

347
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.980
which is big stuff at
the middle of the application.

348
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.440
And by the way, the
big stuff is always there.

349
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.660
So it's always synchronous. And
if you're going to build

350
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.990
an application, that's green, that
assumption is no longer valid

351
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.280
because your database might be
quiet for power reasons or

352
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.290
a device might not be
there. You have to wake

353
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.560
it up. And so when
you start to superimpose green

354
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.800
assumptions, your programming model changes
completely. And that your assumption

355
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.510
has to be that the
other guy should be there,

356
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.610
but nine might not be.
And then how do I

357
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.030
wake it up? Wow. See,
this is we're coming to

358
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.350
the end of our time.
And this gets into, I've

359
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.880
got to, I've got to
talk to you and find

360
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.350
someone who can sit down
with me and talk about

361
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.440
green computing, because you just
blew my mind. The, I

362
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.810
mean, I know that the
rise of asynchronously was upon

363
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.770
us, certainly within a world
where it didn't exist previously

364
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.930
in the Microsoft programming model
for a lot of people

365
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.470
grew up in <inaudible> and
tried to shoe horn, asynchronously

366
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.540
and thing. But now we
have things like WCF and,

367
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.010
and rest models. Wow. He
blew my mind. I have

368
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.960
to go and think about
that. I'll add one more

369
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.930
thing to it, which is
virtualization actually becomes a key

370
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.930
part of that because my
app server might be completely

371
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.040
virtualized. And if I actually
need to add another virtual

372
00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.460
image of the app server,
because of load, right. The

373
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.380
consumer of that app seven,
it might have to quiet

374
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.750
us for a minute while
the virtualization engine is actually

375
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.300
provisions and other apps server
that might be in another

376
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.120
geography. Yeah. That's yeah. I
mean, outlook and exchange as

377
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.650
the kind of canonical example,
right? When sometimes this has

378
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.970
been the case where outlooks,
I don't feel like I'm

379
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.890
picking on them, but you
send an email and then

380
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.050
maybe the internet goes down
to the wireless, goes down

381
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.380
and everything stops because putting
a bite on the wire

382
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.960
is a pro a blocking
call, right. That's a challenge.

383
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.460
And it goes all the
way down the stack. It

384
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.710
does. And so we're all
starting to, I think, a

385
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.770
little bit about green and
what it actually means to

386
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.540
our apps. And I'm not
sure that how many, how

387
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.390
much people have thought about
the fundamental changes to the

388
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.500
application architecture. Wow. Well, that's
given me a whole host

389
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.300
of ideas for future shows,
and I know that you've

390
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.340
got another meeting right now,
so I appreciate you sitting

391
00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.590
down and talking to me,
this has been another episode

392
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.480
of Hansel minutes and we
will see you again next

393
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:50.660
week.
