this episode, Scott talks with

7
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.620
Kendall Miller, founder of Gibraltar
software. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.930
Hanselman and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes. We

9
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.680
continue the startup series that
will go indefinitely. I don't

10
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.200
know whenever I run out
of startups, but we're having

11
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.060
fun so far. And today
we're going to be talking

12
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.060
with Kendall Miller. He's the
principal and the founder of

13
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.780
Gibraltar making.net software. How's it
going? Kendall? It's going great.

14
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.320
How are you doing Scott?
Very well. Very well. So

15
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.780
you have a startup and
how, how old is your

16
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.790
company now? So we, we
shipped the first commercial version

17
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.090
of Gibraltar just a little
over two years ago. And

18
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.810
we've actually been working at
this a little over three

19
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.580
and a half, but it's
great to benchmark from the

20
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.980
first time you start asking
people to pay for what

21
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.490
you're doing. And so that's
been a little over two

22
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.940
years. Okay. So you've been
asking people to pay for

23
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.240
software for two years, but
how did you fund it?

24
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.040
How did you, how did
you start this and how

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.640
many people are you now?
So we got what we

26
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.370
were really lucky. I was
coming out of another startup

27
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.970
situation where basically we were,
you know, the company was

28
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.190
selling out and I was
not one of the owners,

29
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.130
but I responded very heavily
in the project. So I

30
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.780
got a bit of a
bump out of that and

31
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.920
decided that fundamentally, I really
enjoyed doing startups. And so

32
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.320
I looked around for an
opportunity and teams back up

33
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.710
with a partner that I'd
worked with at a previous

34
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.340
project. And we penciled around
it really started just saying,

35
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.380
we're gonna make a consulting
company, but the more we've

36
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.600
worked at, the more we
realized that we've done consulting,

37
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.870
what we really wanted to
do was a for product

38
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.360
work and got going with
that. And we funded it

39
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.810
primarily ourselves for the first,
really the first two years.

40
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.270
And then you relapsed into
it, a little bit of

41
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.230
friends and family financing, the
classic there, but it essentially

42
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.770
all self-funded internally. And when
you're, when you're funding something

43
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.370
like this, like if I
quit today and I want

44
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.470
to go into a startup,
is it as simple as

45
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.240
you know, I get four
or 500 bucks, I get

46
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.270
a copyright, I buy a
website and I just continue

47
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.730
to pay the rent, or,
I mean, how much money

48
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.710
should I set aside for
two guys for two years?

49
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.260
That's a great question. And
it's a lot harder than

50
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.470
that to give you an
idea, even, even on a

51
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.750
small scale, by the time
you get to the point

52
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.860
where the company's cash positive
or ramen profitable each month,

53
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.170
you're bringing enough revenue to
pay yourself enough, to eat

54
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.490
ramen and say, stay alive.
You're usually talking hundreds of

55
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.240
thousands of dollars. And the
reason is that you've got

56
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.120
to, you've got to do
a lot more than just

57
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.500
have a website up to
be a presence, unless you

58
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.780
already are like you yourself.
You could do this pretty

59
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.090
expensively because you're who you
are. And you already have

60
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.580
an audience listening to you
and what you're doing and

61
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.410
interested in what you're doing
next and all of that.

62
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.720
But most folks don't have
that. So you end up

63
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.110
putting a tremendous amount of
energy into being somebody and

64
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.010
getting anybody's attention for what
you're doing. And that requires

65
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.790
a lot of just time
and money over time. You

66
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.000
know, we spend, we budget
between three and $5,000 a

67
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.940
month on a couple different
types of marketing. We do.

68
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.130
And we've been doing that
for over two years. That

69
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.740
adds up because you're doing
that. Even if you don't

70
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.620
get any revenue in a
plus, you've got to have

71
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.940
yourself and a couple of
their folks, it takes a

72
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.040
number of people to pull
off a real product that

73
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.030
can sell in today's market.
And even if you're willing

74
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.630
not pay yourself, which is
where we were for the

75
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.170
first two years, you still
have a lot of expenses

76
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.750
to, to be enough of
a real company. People will

77
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.060
be willing to make an
investment in you, which is

78
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.950
what you're asking. When you
ask them to pay for

79
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.090
your software or service. You
know, you know how, when

80
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.460
you kind of drive through
parts of town you've never

81
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.320
been at before and you
maybe you'll be driving along

82
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.200
and you'll see a place
like, you know, come in

83
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.450
and do pottery, gotta come
in and paint your own

84
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.330
pot. And you think to
yourself, okay, these guys are

85
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.520
paying $2,000 a month in
rent and they want to

86
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.400
charge me $10 to go
and paint this little, little

87
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.310
ceramic pot. It's going to
take, you know, 200 of

88
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.440
these little ceramic pots before
they even hit the rent,

89
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.320
much less pay for stuff.
I mean, I'm sure I

90
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.330
must not. I must not
be the only person that

91
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.340
does that. And don't you
just count the number of

92
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.740
little pots they have to
sell and think, how are

93
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.330
these people in business a
day? Right? In fact, it's

94
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.620
one of the scariest things
about getting going, because in

95
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.190
many ways, for example, we
had set our pricing about

96
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.250
our market. So we sell
to the dotnet tool space,

97
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.980
and that has pretty established
price bands for what people

98
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.150
will pay for tools in
the.net development space. So pretty

99
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.940
much our pricing bands were
set before we sold licensed

100
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.950
one or had one line
of code written. And we

101
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.510
looked at that and we,
we did the math and

102
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.580
said, wow, we're going to
have to sell X, you

103
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.390
know, X licenses a day,
right. Even, and you start

104
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.340
thinking about X people in
the world have to find

105
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.470
my product and love it
enough to pull out a

106
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.430
credit card each day for
us to break even. And

107
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.920
it's it's mind boggling. But
the amazing part is particularly

108
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.040
in like the market of,
of.net is that there's so

109
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.880
many people worldwide in that
space that there are, there

110
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.400
are tons and tons of
prospects. If you have a

111
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.850
product worth getting, and that's,
that's really the challenge, like

112
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.860
the pottery thing or whatever
is, there's gotta be enough

113
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.460
people in your area that
want to do pottery, that

114
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.180
that will happen. And you
also have to be willing

115
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.680
to say at a certain
point, you know what it

116
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.480
turns out well, I love
pottery and you love pottery.

117
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.690
There's only so many little
ceramic frogs and cups that

118
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.360
we can have in our
house. This is it. We

119
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.930
can't make this be viable,
but it is it's daunting.

120
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.390
In fact, you know, for
us, we couldn't even conceive

121
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.430
of what that would look
like, but I will say

122
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.540
it's happened. I, we see
month after month, more and

123
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.080
more folks buying licenses more
and more folks buying our

124
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.800
products as, as more people
hear about it. And you

125
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.360
just have to sort of
face it that will come

126
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.490
around and you won't have
any idea where those people

127
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.400
are coming from. And most
of the time they just,

128
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.440
they just showing up, but
you have to be able

129
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.750
to persevere long enough in
the market for that to

130
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.730
happen. And that's really, I
think the biggest challenge is

131
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.700
it's not the launching the
product, a good rule of

132
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.070
thumb that we've seen in
our own. And I've heard

133
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.480
from talking to a lot
of other entrepreneurs is it

134
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.600
takes about 18 months from
when you first start charging.

135
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.450
And you're really full bore
in the market before you're

136
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.660
generating enough sales on it
on a monthly basis to

137
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.600
pay for your costs. And
we're not being extravagant about

138
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.510
our costs. We're watching it
very carefully, but we're still,

139
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.460
and that was about what
it took for us to

140
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.440
get there. So we had
to survive in a loss

141
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.340
mode for that long before,
before it even started breaking,

142
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.110
even let alone paying back
the investment we put in

143
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.620
to get to there. Yeah.
And that's the tragic thing

144
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.130
about like losses, like the
math doesn't quite, doesn't quite

145
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.480
work. I mean, if you,
if you have a bad

146
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.760
month, not only do you
have to dig out of

147
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.320
that bad month, but then
you also have to do

148
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.450
great the next month. It's
like, I remember when I

149
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.540
was working as a teenager
in retail and they explained

150
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.680
one of the first things
they explained to you is

151
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.520
how bad it is when
someone steals, when someone steals

152
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.070
something, it's not just that
you lose the profit, you

153
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.470
lose the thing that, you
know, the money, it costs

154
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.320
to buy that thing, you
know? Right. And then you

155
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.140
have to go and sell
five more to pay for

156
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.330
that one that got stolen,
et cetera, et cetera. So

157
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.010
I wonder when you worry
about your startup, do you

158
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.980
wonder that tomorrow no one
will buy the product and

159
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.630
that is that's it. We
just saturated the market. It

160
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.380
was a Tuesday. And now
this is Tuesday and September

161
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.740
and all the they've everyone's
bought it. It's over. I'll

162
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.300
tell you what, that, that
relates to one of our

163
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.860
biggest surprises moving from the
consulting business or the internal

164
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.580
corporate development world into, into
commercial software was we were

165
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.590
used to in consulting that
you look at about three,

166
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.320
four months and there's nothing
there, right? No, you don't

167
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.110
know where that conduct is
coming from, but, but it

168
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.530
always seems to show up
by the time you kind

169
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.090
of get close in and
on you go, and you're

170
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.960
always busy with software sales.
We thought we're building this

171
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.720
asset. We'll have this marketing
machine. People will be lining

172
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.640
up. It will be a
steady stream of purchases. It'll

173
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.450
all be good. Instead, what
we've found is literally every

174
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.450
day we go, that's great.
Today was amazing. We just

175
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.690
blew the doors off what'll
tomorrow be, and tomorrow could

176
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.650
be zero. It could absolutely
absolutely what happen. We had

177
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.010
Microsoft when, when they shipped
visual studio, 2010, that April,

178
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.150
we went through six weeks
where there was nothing, all

179
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.630
of our web stats, just
flat flatlined. And in retrospect,

180
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.240
that makes some sense. That's
done it for visual three

181
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.930
20, 10, everybody in our
market stopped pause and said,

182
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.110
what does this mean to
me when the whole visual

183
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.550
studio changes and not in
a framework and all of

184
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.280
that. And they stopped looking
at anything else at secondary,

185
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.200
like tooling and the rest
of it before they figured

186
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.120
out what did this mean
for me? Then they, they

187
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.780
picked it back up and,
and sales actually picked up

188
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.850
and we had a good
summer, but there was six

189
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.760
weeks there where the crickets
were chirping and we could

190
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.100
have turned the lights off.
And that's very nerve wracking.

191
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.900
You have to have a
certain faith that it will

192
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.750
eventually come back. And it
did, you know, we're seeing

193
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.190
a bit of that now
in the shadow of build,

194
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.960
I'm not surprised this time
we were kind of ready

195
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.120
for it. We budgeted, we
actually budgeted for it that

196
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.460
okay, after bill, we're gonna
allow four to six weeks

197
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.070
of quiet and just expect
it. So we're not going

198
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.140
to freak out when that
happens, but it means that

199
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.450
you also, when you have
a good month, you're stocking

200
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.210
it away in a war
chest, just waiting for a

201
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.090
bad month. The other thing
that I worry about if

202
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.010
one were to put together
a product is, is the

203
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.190
support burden. And this might
sound silly, but if your

204
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.800
product sucks, or if you
have a bad release or

205
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.220
something goes wrong, it seems
like the amount of money

206
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.980
it would cost just to
interact with someone is going

207
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.080
to take away from the
sales. Like I always think

208
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.960
about how, how hard the
credit card people and the

209
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.970
bank people try to keep
us from talking to another

210
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.060
human that someone told me
once it was like $8.

211
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.310
If you call the bank
and speak to a human,

212
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.740
right? Like that's how much
it costs for the entire

213
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.900
process before the human shows
up. So they do everything

214
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.490
they can to prevent you
from talking to another human.

215
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.340
But at the same time,
that's how you build relationships.

216
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.010
So how do you balance
support burden? I'm sure you

217
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.140
have like those customers that
just won't leave you alone,

218
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.510
they call you daily. I'll
tell you what, here's the

219
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.050
thing that we've done and
it's very counterculture, but it

220
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.850
has worked out really well
for us, which is that

221
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.750
we make it as ridiculously
easy as possible to get

222
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.640
ahold of us and take
advantage of us in that

223
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.220
regard. And there's a couple
of reasons for it. We

224
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.560
got some great advice early
on from another entrepreneur who

225
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.320
said, when we were worried
about the scalability of our

226
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.660
customer service, he said, okay,
let's say that this guy

227
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.250
calls, and let's say that
he actually calls you on

228
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.140
the phone and he spends
an hour asking you about

229
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.080
something. That's only remotely related
to what you guys have

230
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.530
sold him. But how do
you know that that's not

231
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.410
the best hour you can
spend right now to help

232
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.640
him out? So, because who
knows who else is going

233
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.630
to talk to you? Who
knows where he's gonna go

234
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.630
from that? So what we
instead did was focused instead

235
00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.020
of sort of trying to
avoid providing direct customer service

236
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.050
or finding ways to cleverly
Dodge. It, we have lots

237
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.420
of channels to let people
get ahold of us. And

238
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.090
we focused on is trying
to solve their question as

239
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.060
fast as possible. So by
being as effective as we

240
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.090
can, we try to control
our costs that way. And

241
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.430
one of the things we
do there that has been

242
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.150
actually brilliant for us is
we're really big on whatever

243
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.070
screen share technology the person
wants to use. We have

244
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.960
go to meetings, set up
as well as live meeting

245
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.360
and join me. And there's
all these services, right? So

246
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.430
we're very quick. If you
like do a live chat

247
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.470
with us through our website,
you will probably get me

248
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.770
or the other partner or
the lead developer. Cause we're

249
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.270
the ones who monitor that.
Cause we want to make

250
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.400
sure that we can give
you the best fastest answer.

251
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.280
We'll really quickly though, if
you're having an issue anywhere

252
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.530
near our product, say, Hey,
let's have a screen share

253
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.610
because we want to see
what you're doing. Because what

254
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.770
we've discovered is when you're
watching, how someone got themselves

255
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.940
into trouble, that is more
interesting than just making this

256
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.210
go away. Then that may
not be true of credit

257
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.250
card processing. But it's really
interesting for us to see,

258
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.710
for example, how people got
themselves in trouble and.net and

259
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.380
what are the crazy things
that they're trying to accomplish

260
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.500
that we hadn't thought of.
And that generates a huge

261
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.630
amount of our product feedback
that goes into our backlog

262
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.780
and, and, and what we
prioritize actually develop because a

263
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.150
lot of times people will
get into a problem over

264
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.550
in one corner, but they
got there because they didn't

265
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.370
do several things, several steps
back, or they didn't see

266
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.770
another way around to not
have the problem in the

267
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.050
first place. And when you
see their screen is to

268
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.840
see what they're trying to
do, it hits you what's

269
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.180
going on and, and how
you could really make a

270
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.940
difference to those people. And
the other thing finally from

271
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.030
that is there's no one's
used to that. So for

272
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.720
us, it means that our
customers are raving fans of

273
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.260
our ability to provide support.
And frankly, as a startup,

274
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.300
we've gotten away with some
stuff that should not have

275
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.050
gone wrong in our code
because we've absolutely stood behind

276
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.660
it to make it right.
And that's a trade off

277
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.910
you can make as a
startup, right? Because what you

278
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.410
have is you have some
time and you have some

279
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.830
smart people that are readily
available. So capitalize on that.

280
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.190
It may not scale up
to instantly the skeleton Microsoft

281
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.740
size, but it may not
scale up to even midsize

282
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.620
company size, but you're not
a midsize company yet. Right.

283
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.740
So instead, we're just trying
to make raving fans of

284
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.550
everyone we can come in
contact with. And so from

285
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.660
that, we make it really
easy to get ahold of

286
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.030
us and we will make
it really easy to get

287
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.070
support from us. And we'll
go very far to help

288
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.470
people out. There will come
a time that may change

289
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.390
a little bit, but frankly,
that's sort of part of

290
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.500
who we are now. Well,
the question of scale that

291
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.510
you just brought up was
exactly where I was going

292
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.960
with my next question, which
was that won't scale. Like,

293
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.420
you know, bill Gates doesn't
answer the phone anymore. Right?

294
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.780
He did. No, he doesn't.
How big can you get?

295
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.550
And are you, what are
you trying to do? Like,

296
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.560
I always liked the idea
of building what I call

297
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.310
a boutique. And I mean,
I mean, three, four guys

298
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.710
that can last and pay
everyone's rent and pay everyone's

299
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.810
mortgage. And then, you know,
you don't have to work

300
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.300
six days a week. That
would be great. So our

301
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.840
goal and we set this
out ahead of time was

302
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.790
that we didn't, if we
had any one software product

303
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.880
that needed more than 25
total people, we were going

304
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.700
to try to sell it
because that's not the business

305
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.460
we wanted to be in.
Because once you get to

306
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.140
that point, you've got to
be a couple of clicks

307
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.860
up from what's actually going
on in the product. And

308
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.710
that's less interesting to us
now, maybe in five years,

309
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.570
I'll say it's not 25,
it's 50, or it's a

310
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.160
hundred, but we really like
to be involved, be able

311
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.630
to be involved with customers
when we choose to. But

312
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.580
yes, things are gonna change
over time where it may

313
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.990
not be, you get ahold
of me. It may be

314
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.150
you get that. You know,
I'm not buying live chat.

315
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.510
It'll be other folks already
have the, you know, the

316
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.770
engineers involved and it'll trickle
down. And there may come

317
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.180
some time where that actually
goes to sales and a

318
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.910
bit of a triage. But
I want to defer that

319
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.090
as far as I can,
because I think it's such

320
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.430
a differentiator. I'll give you
an example of another company.

321
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.830
I think does really well
at this dev express is

322
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.710
big company, but when you
go onto their forums, that's

323
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.480
not live chat and it's
not a phone call, but

324
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.040
if you go onto their
forums and you post a

325
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.490
question about one of the
products, the folks that answered

326
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.620
that are the development team,
that's actually writing that little

327
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.600
product part of the product
and they get back to

328
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.660
you just immediately on stuff.
I mean, not like their

329
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.180
answer. And I think sometimes
the answers change as companies

330
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.800
get bigger. You don't have
the ability to say, you

331
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.630
bet we'll fix that. And
we'll send you something in

332
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.590
a week or less, but
you can still instill in

333
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.640
your culture that we support
our customers. Fundamentally attitude. I

334
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.890
got my career started John
Deere huge company. And one

335
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.360
of the things that, the
first things they taught us

336
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.220
when he came in and
I didn't know anything about

337
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.560
John Deeres equipment was I
had to learn all the

338
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.630
names of the things because
they said, look, you're gonna

339
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.190
be on a plane somewhere.
Someone's going to find out

340
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.900
you work for John Deere.
And they're going to say,

341
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.670
Hey, I love John Deere.
I've got this X, but

342
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.180
there's one thing. And there's
some problem. You need to

343
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.000
know what to ask what
to get, because if someone

344
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.710
speaks to anyone at John
Deere, since they spoke to

345
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.930
everyone at John Deere, and
we had a whole protocol

346
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.100
for what we did to
get back and make sure

347
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.290
that that person got taken
care of by their local

348
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.110
dealer and it was dealt
with, and that's a huge,

349
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.030
you know, it's a fortune
100 company, but they had

350
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.490
a system to make sure
that that was who we

351
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.780
were. And frankly, you know,
you get your career started

352
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.530
in a place like that.
You just can't let it

353
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.470
go. So my hope is
that we will always be

354
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.240
able to provide that level
of service. We'll just change

355
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.290
the tactics we use to,
to deliver it in ways

356
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.390
that are more cost effective
at scale. Hi, this is

357
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.030
Scott coming to you from
another place in time. Are

358
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.330
you using agile practices to
manage your software development? There's

359
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.310
lots of tools in the
market that manage the steps

360
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.560
of a project, but most
of them focus on individual

361
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.380
roles. Get ready for a
solution that caters for the

362
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.500
success of the whole team.
Guys at Tellerik introduced team

363
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.830
pulse. It's an agile project
management tool. That'll help you

364
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.520
gather ideas, estimate plan, track
progress in a common workspace.

365
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.150
Finally companies, regardless of their
size can use a lightweight

366
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.310
and convenient tool that makes
all the stakeholders work as

367
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.240
a United team. Even if
they're in different countries by

368
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.330
combining intuitive user interface and
the power server light team

369
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.120
poles removes the roadblocks that
you typically face and applying

370
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.210
agile in an effective manner,
no more lost data, no

371
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.410
disparate systems, no lack of
critical analytics regarding the health

372
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.830
and philosophy project. See if

374
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.040
please do thank tolerance for
supporting Hansel minutes on their

Facebook fan page, facebook.com/t L
E R I K color.

376
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.730
We do appreciate it. They
wouldn't be a Hanselman it's

377
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.880
if there wasn't, Tellerik helping
us. So one of the

378
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.970
things we haven't talked about
yet is what exactly you

379
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.880
make. So very briefly, what
did you build and what

380
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.970
are you selling? Sure. So
we have two software products

381
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.010
in the dotnet market. So
we sell to Don it

382
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.070
developers. We have two products,
one, our namesake product, your

383
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.940
Baldor is a logging and
application monitoring platform. It's basically

384
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.860
a little agent. You're a
little black box. You drop

385
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.620
into any.net app, gathers data
and lets it, send it

386
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.750
back to a server. And
you pull it down into

387
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.000
a client where you can
do all kinds of analytics

388
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.950
on how the features you
people use, how well it

389
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.910
performs, who your users, how
often they run the app.

390
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.650
You can also do that
critical error, defect, triage process.

391
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.210
What kind of errors are
people getting in the field?

392
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.720
What do they correlate to
that type of information? And

393
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.500
that's so that's the first
one we developed internally. And

394
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.960
along the way, about a
year ago, we actually acquired

395
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.230
another product from the company
called Vista DB. And that's

396
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.630
not part of our, our,
our family as well. Cause

397
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.160
we really love the product.
We actually use it in

398
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.840
Gibraltar. So we had the
opportunity to pick it up.

399
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.900
We, we went for it
and that is basically is

400
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.050
a miniature version of SQL
server that runs in your

401
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.320
Don and application. It's a
one Meg assembly that emulates

402
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.500
much of the language and
capabilities of SQL server. So

403
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.480
if you develop for it,
you can switch around and

404
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.300
just change a couple of
radio options and you are

405
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.080
going against SQL server. And
that sells that frankly, actually.

406
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.870
Now in terms of users,
data, how it sells Gibraltar

407
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.840
about two to one, because
a lot of people have

408
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.270
that need and we're, we
love that product. They both

409
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.980
fit in this family though
what we wanted to have

410
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.500
our company and be about,
which is not front end

411
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.130
components for developers, but what
we call rock solid components,

412
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.700
things that are foundational to
go underneath that make it

413
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.610
really works that mid size
and small companies can develop

414
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:03.090
solutions that just deliver for
their customers and can afford

415
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.770
to do it. But it
seems like, so you've got

416
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.640
a logging tool and you've
got an embedded database, but

417
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.600
isn't Microsoft coming in or
doesn't Microsoft have SQL compact

418
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.850
and some logging blocks. And
you know, you've got logged

419
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.380
for net and all those
other kinds of things like

420
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.860
Elma. I mean, you're basically
describing like the two most

421
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.370
useful in general things that
people have. But I don't,

422
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.050
you know, if Microsoft comes
out with a product like

423
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.760
that, they're, they're not trying
to kill you. They may

424
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.280
not even know you exist.
They're just saying, well, there's

425
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.830
a need. So then they
decide to do, but that

426
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.800
doesn't that go like, like
when SQL compact four came

427
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.040
out, weren't you just like,
Oh no, it's over. There's

428
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.020
always a moment right. Where
you see, Oh my gosh,

429
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.690
you would, did they do
that? And it's common for

430
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.250
is a good example because
it addressed a number of

431
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.700
deficiencies. The previous version of
sequel compact. In fact, I

432
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.920
would say the SQL compact
three, five was the best

433
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.560
advertisement for Vista DB. There
was because it got people

434
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.270
thinking they could do it.
And then they realized the

435
00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:00.410
limitations and came looking for
us. But the good news

436
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.470
is is that unlike Microsoft,
there's the threshold I need

437
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.990
for, of annual sales for
a business to be really

438
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.290
worth. It is relatively low.
You know, if something generates,

439
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.840
say a million or 2 million
in sales a year, that's

440
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.150
a pretty good business that
I would be willing to

441
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.490
be in from a Microsoft
name or even a mid

442
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.130
sized software company. That's not
worth it. It's worth the

443
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.700
marketing budget. So that's great
because it means that we

444
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.620
can just focus in on
what we do. And there's

445
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.210
always that Pang in that
fear. But if you talk

446
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.390
about like Vista DB, we've
really focused in, on being

447
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.080
the most deployable SQL server
engine that you can buy

448
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.870
because we have the best
compatibility with the full SQL

449
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.410
server SQL express and SQL
express is free to purchase,

450
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.290
but it's a large download
that has to be installed

451
00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.850
and run as a service.
And for a lot of

452
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.260
applications, that's not workable now
where it is. That's great,

453
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.450
but we provide the option.
It really runs for that

454
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.360
lower scale for folks that
can't do that. And there's

455
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.850
a lot of those folks
out there. Likewise, I'll tell

456
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.680
you on the logging side,
when we got started with

457
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.410
Gibraltar, one is assumptions we
made was that nobody would

458
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.450
buy a log viewer. That
that was something we had

459
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.820
to have a great log
viewer in there, but nobody

460
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.360
would spend even $1 for
the world's most singing, dancing,

461
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.930
beautiful log viewer. Ironically, our
feedback from our first nine

462
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.420
months of sales where people
bought it strictly as a

463
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.870
log viewer. So that assumption
we had was flat wrong.

464
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.320
When we actually talked to
our customers, That's interesting cause

465
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.720
you got them to buy
it, which is, which is

466
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.210
an achievement, but then they
went and used it in

467
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.160
a way you didn't expect,
which seems to be a

468
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.550
common thing in, in startups.
Like you have a vision,

469
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.860
you execute on, you know,
some fraction of that vision.

470
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.840
You think you've got a
lot of success and then

471
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.760
you start talking to the
customers and you realize that

472
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.070
they really expected a different
thing. And they even took

473
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.400
the product in a different
direction. Absolutely. What I like

474
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.320
to tell people is that
up to the moment you

475
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.590
ship the first commercial release,
it's all about your vision.

476
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.630
What do you think this
should be? She had to

477
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.880
put something in for people
to build around and get

478
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.180
and glom onto. But once
it ships, you need to

479
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.790
start listening really carefully to
what do they tell you?

480
00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.430
Its value proposition is all
about what did they tell

481
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.800
you? It really is. So
for the first version we

482
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.600
put out what they told
us is this is a

483
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.820
great log viewer. I'm plugging
this into log for net

484
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.100
and using it to view
my log for that data

485
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.700
because it's so much better
than the other logs and

486
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.230
that viewing options I have,
but I really wish it

487
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.170
did these three things. And
from that, we came out

488
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.960
with essentially, there are two
five version, which did those

489
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.030
things. And now that now
we get different feedback from

490
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.830
folks and what they're using
it for. And, and about

491
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.800
every year it's cycles a
little bit and we're adjusting

492
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.150
where the product goes because
of that. But at the

493
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.750
same time, we're also recognizing
that customers are good at

494
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.760
telling you how to refine
where you are and telling

495
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.310
you how they're using what
you're doing, but they're not

496
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:40.110
good at making this contiguous
jumps to new capabilities. So

497
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.140
for example, we've taken, we
actually taken that two swings

498
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.660
at a certain set of
functionality. And we know the

499
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.210
both, those swings are not
widely used by our customers,

500
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.190
but the ones that have
adopted it really love it.

501
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.220
So our next major version
of Gibraltar, which is coming

502
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.610
out late this year, takes
a third swing at that

503
00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.900
basic problem, which is error
management. And does it in

504
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.940
a different way. Based on
that feedback, we, we integrated

505
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.350
a lot of error management
in the system, but we

506
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.110
assumed everyone used a defect
tracking system. We said, you

507
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.370
know what? We don't want
to have our own thing.

508
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.830
We're going to great with
our defect tracking system. Now

509
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.090
it turns out that while
I have always used the

510
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.850
defect tracking system, most companies
don't use it, a real

511
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.790
defect tracking system. Most of
our customers turned out, don't

512
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.030
use real defect tracking system.
They use Excel. So what

513
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.160
they really needed was they
needed us to have that

514
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.360
capability built in, not leverage
the external defect tracking system,

515
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.280
other than the folks that
really do have one. And

516
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.960
for them, it's a deal
breaker. If it doesn't integrate

517
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.770
and that's some of the
challenges you run into, All

518
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:35.880
right? And I notice that
you do a lot of

519
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.010
community stuff. You go to
a lot of events, you

520
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.630
speak at a lot of
events and stuff like that.

521
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.970
Is that a part of
the business strategy or is

522
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.030
that just your personality? You
know, I justify it to

523
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.030
my partner and to the
rest of the company that

524
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.740
that's all part of our
marketing strategy. In fact, I

525
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.750
think I, I still like
two thirds of our marketing

526
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.510
budget to pay for trips
and sponsorships and things like

527
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.460
that. But to be totally
honest, I do it cause

528
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.760
I love the people. It
is, there's nothing like getting

529
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.010
out and meeting the community.
I wish I'd started doing

530
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.620
it a lot earlier than
I did because there's so

531
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.290
much going on and you
see, you can really hear

532
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.320
from other people, not just
the headline, Hey, this worked

533
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.140
great. I loved how this
new technology, this new approach

534
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.610
works, but you also can
have a conversation with and

535
00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.460
find out. Yeah, well there
were all these little issues

536
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.020
that didn't work out so
well and here's what we

537
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.810
had to do and all
of that. And there's so

538
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.540
many passionate folks around the.net
community space, both here and

539
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.350
in, over in Europe that
I've met that it's, it's,

540
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.010
it really motivates us to
do more and do better

541
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.070
and test out ideas and,
and, and talk to these

542
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.990
people to see where they're
going. And they're usually well

543
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.850
ahead. I'll tell you what,
the folks who go to

544
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.790
community events, that's a pretty
self selecting group. Those folks

545
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:43.070
are, are the tip of
the spear. They're well ahead

546
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.260
of the main part of
the market, but that's good

547
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.880
because it's a small company.
It may take me a

548
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.500
year or a year and
a half to react to

549
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.030
it and assimilate that kind
of feedback and, and have

550
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:57.400
something actually out in the
market for it. Hmm. Do,

551
00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.770
do you think that that's
an urgent thing that other

552
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.630
people should think about? Because
one of the things that

553
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.250
you mentioned a little bit
earlier in the, in the

554
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.190
show was that getting people
to actually hear about your

555
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.260
stuff, like you might have
something amazing and no one

556
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.210
will hear about it. I
mean, I was actually speaking

557
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:13.150
at a government agency yesterday
and I was showing them

558
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.480
some different things that Microsoft
sells or gives away in

559
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.580
this case. And they'd never
heard of them. And I'm

560
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.710
thinking to myself, wow, if
Microsoft can't get the message

561
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.070
out, how is like Joe
software company's supposed to, you

562
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.530
know, and is talking to
the community the best way,

563
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.980
or is it advertisements in
dead tree newspapers or, you

564
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.510
know, what's the best way
for a startup because there's

565
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.610
so many, let me put
it this way. If you

566
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.820
look at an open source
project as a startup, just

567
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.650
a smaller scale, I get
probably 12, 13 emails a

568
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.290
week of like, Hey, take
a look at this open

569
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.090
source project, trying to get
it off the ground. And

570
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.750
you just wonder, why do,
why do a hundred like

571
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.420
languish, just sit and get
hub or coat flex with

572
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.510
no one using them a
couple hundred downloads and then

573
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.760
other ones take off. It
makes me wonder if marketing

574
00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.470
matters at all. Maybe it's
all just word of mouth

575
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.860
marketing is all aligned. Well,
I would say that marketing

576
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.680
has all of those pieces
and, and if you cannot

577
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.590
market your product, you at
best will be the coolest

578
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:11.500
part, no one ever heard
of. And you're right, that

579
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.320
even the big companies can
have trouble with this. Microsoft.

580
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.050
I think from my standpoint,
the biggest challenge of windows

581
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.710
phone seven is exactly one
of marketing you, if you

582
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.780
can get people to try
it, it doesn't matter how

583
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:27.730
great it is now. You're
in each specific product space.

584
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.460
You're going to have certain
unique marketing challenges, but as

585
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.460
a small company, one of
the greatest lies that we

586
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.310
tell future entrepreneurs often is,
Oh yeah. And now with

587
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.630
the internet is a great
level. You just put up

588
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.960
a website and Google will
index it. And you're golden.

589
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.160
Maybe by some ad words,
you know what that's just

590
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.400
doesn't pan out at all.
You can find ways to

591
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.460
generate traffic in a short
burst. If you re, if

592
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.800
you get lucky, like let's
say you, you were to

593
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.560
post something about your Balter
at the top of your

594
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.400
blog. I guarantee you for
three, four days, we would

595
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.730
get a huge spike of
traffic. I also would bet

596
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.760
you solidly that. If I
look back six months later,

597
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.590
it would have made virtually
no difference in our sales.

598
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.090
Exactly, exactly. People always like,
Oh, great, thanks for tweeting

599
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.220
my thing. I was like,
well, you know, of the

600
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.830
a hundred people that visited
it, maybe one person installed

601
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.940
it. You know, I mean,
conversion ratios are just horrible.

602
00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.190
People are happy to look
at stuff, but to actually

603
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:24.620
get someone to take an
action is a hugely difficult

604
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.810
thing, But here's the metric.
And, and, and I think

605
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.730
it's really important for startups
to spend energy and try

606
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.130
to develop a metric or
yardstick to measure what you're

607
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.920
doing. And frankly, be willing
to try just about anything

608
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.130
if you can measure it.
So for example, we actually

609
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.060
stopped doing a lot of
our internet advertising and redirected

610
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.970
all of that money into
funding, community events, but it

611
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.780
had had provides us a
metric, which was $3 per

612
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.600
person we talked to. And
we just talked to pretty

613
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.020
generally, like, you know, I'll
spend three bucks at least

614
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.360
exchange email with somebody that
I've never, you know, back

615
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.780
and forth or a live
chat or an actual, you

616
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.330
know, live demo. And so
we thought about, and he

617
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.920
said, you know what? Geez,
if we spend a thousand

618
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.990
dollars to sponsor to code
camp and we get a

619
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.820
hundred people to walk by
the booth, which is easy

620
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.580
to do, what does that
cost? That cost is $10

621
00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.380
a person. All right. Well,
if we also speak at

622
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.630
that camp, there's another a
hundred people that, that maybe

623
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.040
in that room or there
maybe it's 50 or whatever

624
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.020
it is, what's that costing
us per person that we're

625
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.080
talking to. We use that
sort of is our quality

626
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.250
bar, because it really is
about freeing those conversations in

627
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:29.270
the end. People buy from
other people, they that's what

628
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.580
happens. So you have to
find some way of being

629
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.770
a person to them or
being somebody they know where

630
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:38.630
feel like trying out. And
we find the moment for

631
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:39.920
us right now. I mean,
you've answered a good channel

632
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.470
for that. If I was
developing billing software for dentists,

633
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.350
I would be finding every
dental conference that there was,

634
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.710
I'd find the local association
of dental professionals or whatever

635
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.160
it is, and in, in
Spokane and, and go there

636
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.920
and talk with them. And
you have no idea quite

637
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.200
how those are gonna pan
out. So you sort of

638
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.300
have to just keep plugging
away at that, but finding

639
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.970
some way of measuring it
to adjust over, say three

640
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.490
or six months, what you're
doing and, and keep mixing

641
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.580
it up. We do get
some feedback that says, for

642
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.650
example, community events, the first
time we go to a

643
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.780
community event, particularly one when
maybe a code camp, we

644
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.880
get very little traction. When
we show the second or

645
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.730
third time, we get a
lot of traction. People are

646
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.130
looking at you're committed to
their community, their space to

647
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.060
do something before they take
you seriously. But in the

648
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.610
tool space, I find that
we find, we think that

649
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.520
that's effective. That said I
would be hard pressed to

650
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.130
prove it. And as a,
as a, as a, you

651
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.580
know, if you're a developer,
I don't like things I

652
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.200
can't prove. But reality of
it is that's marketing. You

653
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.420
need to focus not on
traffic though. That's the challenge

654
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.430
that you talk about a
tweet or, or being a

655
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.840
top of blog. That's about
just sharing traffic, traffic. There's

656
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.620
nothing wrong with traffic intrinsically,
but traffic doesn't actually move

657
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.360
your business forward on its
own. That that is really

658
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.440
the, like the conclusion almost
right there. I mean, go

659
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.010
where they are, right. Go
where the developers are. We've

660
00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.460
been talking about that ourselves.
I was at a tech

661
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.090
ed recently with Damien Edwards
and we found a couple

662
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.370
of ladies that worked for
a government agency. And they'd

663
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.050
been in, they said, they'd
been using web forms since

664
00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.470
2004, and they'd never heard
of Scott goo and they'd

665
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.300
never heard of me. And
they never read a book.

666
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:18.030
And they just basically, you
know, they they've done web

667
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.550
forms for, you know, almost
10 years and had no

668
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.210
idea that this community existed.
So then now our challenge

669
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.640
is while we met them
at this conference, it was

670
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.770
the first conference I'd ever
gone to. But our question

671
00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:32.190
is then where are these
people hanging out? You know,

672
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:36.090
where do they go? They
don't go to, to, to

673
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.190
code camps, you know? So
I have to go to

674
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.570
their, do they have to
go to their place of

675
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.040
business at this point? You
know, that's a, that's a

676
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.000
real challenge that many competing
professionals don't go to anything.

677
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.240
They go to work and
then they go home. Now

678
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.710
they may not be the
best folks to, to reach

679
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:53.850
out to you want to
find the folks on the

680
00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.070
bubble, right? That would be,
if they realized there was

681
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.020
something available to them, they
would make that extra effort

682
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.500
to go and do it.
But the governance sector is

683
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.720
very isolated. You know, the
public sector and the private

684
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.120
sector are really very, have
very different criteria for making

685
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.460
decisions. We do sell the
bull sectors. And it's very

686
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.150
interesting. Here's the completely different
decision matrix is on those

687
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:16.170
two sides. And on the,
on the public sector, you

688
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.700
really do have to have
different way of reaching in.

689
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.390
That's emphasizes working in that
government space. And it's very

690
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:26.400
long term, but yeah, it's
a big challenge to, to

691
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.740
get into those, those organizations,
if we back off from

692
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.160
public sector, which is so
specialized that you really almost,

693
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.810
you just have to have
a dedicated or organization that

694
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.530
just thinks like that and
works in that space. How

695
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.880
do you, you know, how
do you get yourself into

696
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.570
those environments beyond code camps
and the like, well, you

697
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.580
do have to keep, keep
asking yourself, where are these

698
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.560
people going, or what are
they looking at and how

699
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.360
do I put an ad
in their way? And it

700
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.490
may be that you have,
for example, an ad on

701
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.700
stack overflow, that's leading to
something else because gosh, if

702
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.140
they search a problem, they
may well end up at

703
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.780
stack overflow. If that type
of user is a good

704
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.890
fit for what you're doing,
or you may end up

705
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:05.730
in a situation where it's
not, it's not about technology

706
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:09.840
users, groups, but about going
to the end customer groups,

707
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.990
you know, the government sector
does have all kinds of

708
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.290
groups that worry about all
sorts of things that, but

709
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.900
they tend to not have
these pure technology groups. And

710
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.550
some of the large companies
do that. They'll actually have

711
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.310
internal groups. I know a
lot of the pharmaceutical companies,

712
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.410
for example, have internal groups
that just worry about technology

713
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.950
and pharma. And those are
some interesting groups to get

714
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.220
into because once you can
get any connection into that

715
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.550
space, there's a, there's a
lot of people there and

716
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.500
they tended to look at
what each other do, dude,

717
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.680
to pick their products and
pick what to move forward

718
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.570
with because you must have
already gone through a lot

719
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:46.670
of problems that takes again.
Yeah. Because the other thing

720
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.280
that there's a little dirty
secret about buying software by

721
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.650
using software and inmate, this
is probably true. Really it's

722
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:55.460
really true of most products
is that nobody really has

723
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.850
the time or the need
to make a completely what

724
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.020
you might call well-informed purchase
decision. In other words, if

725
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.660
you go out and you
need a grid control, your

726
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.460
boss might say, okay, well,
we need to find the

727
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.890
best grid control for the
least money to solve this

728
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.140
application. But I can guarantee
you, you're not actually going

729
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.720
to download each and every
possible grid control, open source

730
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.180
and closed source. Test them
all out, find out which

731
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.690
one is exactly the very
best for your need. And

732
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.820
then go with that one.
You're going to, you're going

733
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.560
to find some way of
subsidy. Then some things that

734
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.660
you feel you could live
with seeing if they appear

735
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.040
that they're going to work
and you're going to put

736
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.740
your name behind them, that
those are our worthy solutions

737
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.900
in the end, are you
willing to have your reputation

738
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.740
attached to that option? That's
what people really work, whether

739
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.500
it's buying cars or buying
grids or buying logging systems.

740
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.750
And so what you need
to get them to do

741
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:45.080
is feel good enough with
you that they're willing to

742
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.960
put their reputation at stake
a bit for you. And

743
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.850
that's one of the reasons
why we focus so much

744
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.130
on our service side, our
customer sports size. I want

745
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.230
to make sure people feel
like even if something's not

746
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.880
quite right, they'll be able
to work with us and

747
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.530
be able to get it
right. And as a small

748
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.080
company, the thing is as
a startup, that's something you

749
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.390
can do that he's the
biggest Abbott's players can not

750
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:06.770
do. They just can't afford
it. Know Oracle can't afford

751
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.350
to provide that type of
personal service at no cost,

752
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:13.100
but you can so use
that advantage to compensate for

753
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.290
the disadvantages you have as
a small startup that Oracle

754
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:20.890
does not have. Yeah. Yeah.
There's a lot of information

755
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:23.110
there. You, you, you, do
you have any other presentations

756
00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.450
of yourself talking about startups
online that people who are

757
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:27.070
listening might want to check
out because we've got it.

758
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:30.070
We do. And, and cause
I do, I do talk

759
00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.990
about this at a lot
of Coke camps and other

760
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:35.200
community organizations. If you go
to our blog, either from

761
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.690
the www.gibraltarsoftware.com site, or just
go straight to that rock

762
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:44.980
solid dot Gibraltar software.com, you'll
actually find all the slide

763
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.480
decks of each of the
talks had been at an

764
00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.810
Elizabeth van schedules. Cause I
may be talking in your

765
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:52.420
area and I would really
love to make the connection

766
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.400
and, and have a chat,
whether you're doing a startup

767
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.920
now or just thinking about
it or just want to

768
00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.540
peer over the fence at
what it would look like.

769
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.080
It's, it's always a lot
of great conversation and, and

770
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.970
that's why that's really why
we do it. You know,

771
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.840
I, I'm lucky that I
can have the company pay

772
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.060
for the things that I
feel are important for me.

773
00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.550
I use that to sponsor
users, groups, and community events

774
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.510
and go and attend. And
I have the opportunity. There's

775
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.220
actually some operations coming up
on the events page right

776
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.740
now, where I talk about
how to set up your

777
00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.250
own software company and what
it takes to succeed in

778
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:27.700
New York city, the New York cook
camp and over, over in

779
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.970
the UK coming up later
in October. Very cool. Well,

780
00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.650
thanks so much for chatting
with us today. I appreciate

781
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.290
it. It's been great. Thank
you much. This has been

782
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.010
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

783
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.330
Week. <inaudible>.
