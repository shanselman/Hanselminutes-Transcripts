00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:49.380
today@raygun.com. That's our a Y
G U n.com. <inaudible>. Hi,

11
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.140
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another Hansel minutes. And

12
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.180
today I'm talking with dr.
Kutz research scientist, working with

13
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.260
the United States air force Academy.
You have amazing LinkedIn, and

14
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.720
I'm not going to talk
about any of this stuff,

15
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.760
even though that would be
a, probably a better show.

16
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.380
In fact, what I want
to talk to you about

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.880
is the space or three
60, the greatest controller ever

18
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.450
created during the nineties. Indeed.
Thank you very much, Scott.

19
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.220
And it was wonderful to
be on the show. Know

20
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.680
the, the space orb was
quite a find at the

21
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680
time I was still regarded
as one of the most

22
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.370
interesting controllers made in the
history of computer games. And

23
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.530
it's a bit of a
pity that a, that concept

24
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.080
hasn't been picked up on
and carried forward, but it

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.330
still exists today and yeah,
you can still use them

26
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.270
the, the space orb. Now
of course, we're on a

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.810
podcast, so we can't exactly
see this, but you can

28
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.730
certainly go out and Google
for it. But how would

29
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.740
you, how would you explain
the space? What does it

30
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.490
look like? It's a sort
of a curious beast. So

31
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.800
we're all familiar. I think
with the game pad, that's

32
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.530
sort of become the standard
for engagement with computer games

33
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.660
these days, but you have
to imagine something that's a

34
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.790
bit plainer than that with
just a few buttons. And

35
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.490
instead of all the joysticks
and touch pads and all

36
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.770
the other stuff sprouting from
it, there was just a

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.830
big ball and that ball
was the focal point for

38
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.690
whatever your avatar in the
game would do. If you

39
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.790
want her to move ahead
and turn left and look

40
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.410
up all at the same
time, you would just push

41
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.600
the ball in that direction.
And that's what you do.

42
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.170
And it was really something
at the time I first

43
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.840
ran across it, just set
the stage. This is back

44
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.800
in the 1990s, windows 95
had just come out and

45
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.840
windows, wasn't really an Avenue
for games. And I just

46
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.930
produced a rather bad show
where a game called Flynn

47
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.300
sprint. And at any rate
that led me to the

48
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.050
game developers conference of 1996.
And it was, it's hard

49
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.110
to really describe the hope
and potential that, that, that

50
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.060
area felt like, I mean,
blizzard had just come out

51
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.510
with a Warcraft to the
folks who did the flying

52
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.450
toaster screensaver. If you remember
that were there. And then

53
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.750
I saw this odd little
game controller there and nothing

54
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.300
else was quite like it.
This is a, an era

55
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.230
when oftentimes game controllers would
be made to fit a

56
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.050
particular game. You had a
entire series of flight Sims,

57
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.630
which had, you know, fighter
sticks and crusted with buttons

58
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.610
and switches. You had odd
little game controllers, and then

59
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.670
you have the space org.
And it was originally packaged,

60
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.170
I think with a six
degree freedom game called forsaken.

61
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.750
So six degrees of freedom
games like descent and forsaken,

62
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.390
where you can move in
all six axes of movement

63
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.960
at once were horrendously difficult
to control with keyboard and

64
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.540
mouse, which was the standards.
And so people tried different

65
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.790
things in the space where
it was one to actually

66
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.610
navigate through them, the ball
on the space, or I

67
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.790
always imagined it as like
the head of the person

68
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.950
on their neck. And it's
almost like you grabbed someone's

69
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.970
head and just gave it
a little push forward. And

70
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.130
then you could twist the
head and like you strafed

71
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.490
by basically imagine if you
pushed yourself in your ear

72
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.950
laterally. So then you could
do strafing twisting lookup, maneuvers

73
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.290
stuff that I don't even
know if you could do

74
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.590
that today with two thumbs
walk sideways, look up into

75
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.450
the left while turning exactly.
It was absolutely dynamite for

76
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.460
some games that are required,
that sort of free movement

77
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.710
on it. And at the
same time it was horribly

78
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.870
flawed. And I think part
of that is the reason

79
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.870
that it had such difficulty
gaining traction for six degree

80
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.440
of freedom games. There really
was nothing else. But the

81
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.750
problem is that this freedom
came with a bit of

82
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.720
a penalty and that's that
it was actually very difficult

83
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.960
to do very precise, aiming.
And so with so many

84
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.740
computer games focusing on targeting
and, and very precise shots,

85
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.690
people who were extremely competitive
actually didn't like it that

86
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.610
much because it was very
difficult to line up, say

87
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.240
a sniper shot or something
like that. So for example,

88
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.570
in a team fortress two,
which is a very popular

89
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.420
online first person shooter type
game, for one thing, you're

90
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.370
not using all six degrees
of freedom to begin with,

91
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.400
but for something like a
scout, we were moving quickly

92
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.670
running, jumping, avoiding enemy fire.
It was dynamite. I actually

93
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.710
got banned from a surfer
at the time for using

94
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.620
it, which surprised me because
if I switched to a

95
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.780
different class like a sniper,
I couldn't land a single

96
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.750
shot. So it was really
very on and off, but

97
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.530
I found it absolutely fascinating
that it was so intuitive

98
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.670
in a genre that was
extremely difficult to control. And

99
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.160
other ways, in fact, I
had a young friend of

100
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.380
the son of a friend
of mine who played dissent

101
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.380
recently. He was very into
retro gaming and I had

102
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.850
him try it with a
space orb. And he said,

103
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.980
you know, this is janky
and hard to control, but

104
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.410
I feel like this is
just how it's meant to

105
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.170
be played. And that's exactly
the right feeling when you

106
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.090
get a controller that matches
with what you want to

107
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.130
do as that, that is
the way it's meant to

108
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.770
be played. So I rather
regret that we don't have

109
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.110
that well, we do in
some areas, but that freedom

110
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.450
of, of trying lots of
things. And then everything is

111
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.880
kind of standardized to the
two thumb game pad nowadays,

112
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.910
right. And then of course
there's the mouse and keyboard

113
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.660
people that are convinced that,
whereas D plus mouse is

114
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.580
the, the one true way,
but it's really the one

115
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.430
true way for the sniper
for the, for the precision

116
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.550
shot, because your precision is
on your mouse. But ultimately

117
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.950
if you want to stray
look up into the right,

118
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.240
all at the same time,
your strife is a binary

119
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.010
thing, you're your movement of
Right? Or I'm not because

120
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.160
I'm using the DBA On
the keyboard, right. And this

121
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.700
was extremely, it was very
analog. So you could do

122
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.620
all of those things with
a certain degree of, of

123
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.930
elegance once you got the
hang of it, but there

124
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.350
was this learning curve associated
with it. And I think

125
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.480
that learning curve, you know,
it was very difficult to

126
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.580
isolate movements. At first, when
you were using it, you

127
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.680
try and move forward and
you find yourself flipping left

128
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.230
and rolling over at the
same time. And I think

129
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.090
that through gamers a lot
as well, and people liked

130
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.150
the ability to jump right
in and start going. So

131
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.960
there was a certain amount
of learning involved and there

132
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.390
still is to be honest.
Yeah. It feels to me

133
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.790
like we have almost, I
would say settled it's that

134
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.460
we've picked the most generic
thing that the two thumbs

135
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.190
is the one that's generic.
Like a couple of days

136
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.330
ago. I finally received my,
my modified end 60 For

137
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.460
where I added an ultra
HD. So I have an

138
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.120
N 64 with an HTMI
port. I was playing perfect

139
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.240
dark. And the only true
way to play perfectly Dark

140
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.360
is not with one of
the, The janky single thumb

141
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.210
stick and 64 controllers. But
rather with two one in

142
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.130
each hand, thereby Simulating the
didn't exist at the time

143
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.910
two thumb stick controller. It's
kind of sad that there

144
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.090
aren't different controllers for yeah.
Different games. Otherwise we'd have

145
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.330
a diversity in our choices.
Well, in a way, yes,

146
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.930
there's a, a, there's a
branch of linguistics relative linguistics,

147
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.780
which posits that you can
only think thoughts that you

148
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.910
have the ability to express
in language and whether or

149
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.680
not you agree with that.
I think that's definitely the

150
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.800
case for controllers. If you've
got a wheel and pedals

151
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.390
that you'd use for driving
a car, or you won't

152
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.820
even think about the things
you could do flying a

153
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.450
plane with them. And so
I feel like the fact

154
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.270
that we have standardized on
basically the two thumb stick

155
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.140
game pad is a boon
for economics and game consoles

156
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.080
everywhere, but it does restrict
the things you can even

157
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.860
think about doing in a
game, what minor diversion I'm

158
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.010
playing with virtual reality now.
And I think it's very

159
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.890
fun to see that just
a change in controllers and

160
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.890
behavior changes the kind of
games which are made. You've

161
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.900
got two things that look
like, you know, feel like

162
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.090
sword. So you have games
like beat saber, or you

163
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.080
have endless archery simulators, and
that's different entirely, I think

164
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.510
because of the controller and
the perception. So it's, it's

165
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.070
fun to think of what
games would have looked like

166
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.410
if something like the space
orbit really taken over and

167
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.490
lasted. But like, I, I
have a, I'm very lucky

168
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.730
and blessed to have a,
an HTC Vive, which has

169
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.790
those, Those controllers and they're,
they're lovely. But then I

170
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.850
also am looking at a
mixture of windows mixed reality,

171
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.290
like on a lower end
virtual reality head set. And

172
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.930
while it has that stick,
you know, the bottom part

173
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.710
of the lightsaber, ultimately it's
just two buttons a trigger

174
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.470
and there's that thumb stick
again. So right. They've taken

175
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.540
an Xbox controller and split
it in half and now

176
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.110
you hold each half basically.
So there's a lack of

177
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.240
creativity there. So then you're
saying that that would indirectly,

178
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.270
without even realizing it, the
mind of the developer so

179
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.790
that they designed to that
constraint, maybe, even though they

180
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.540
don't know that they're, I
think it definitely does. And

181
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.700
one of the nice things
about things like the Vive

182
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.670
and other headsets nowadays, is
that you can still use

183
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.550
a game pad or other
controller. And one of the

184
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.240
most mind-numbingly nausea dating experiences
I've had recently was actually

185
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.060
playing dissent overload, which is
rewrite of the original descent

186
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.440
in virtual reality, using the
space orb, which was an

187
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.920
really peculiar experience marrying these
old games of the mid

188
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.700
nineties with the most modern
technology and display. And it

189
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.670
was surprisingly effective, actually still
great fun. And so it's

190
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.680
fun that the controller and
the game, honestly, it's still

191
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.420
relevant after, Oh goodness, 20
something years. And also there's

192
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.550
a lot of innovation happening
with things like the Xbox

193
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.860
accessibility Controller, which theoretically be
used by, By someone else.

194
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.800
Who's, who's not differently. We
could use that. Just like

195
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.620
we use rock band controllers.
Yeah. It's I I've come

196
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.090
to think of myself as
a bit of a patron

197
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.090
Saint of abandon and controllers
because my workshop is just

198
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.840
littered with full things like
the, the Novant Falcon, which

199
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.600
was a haptic controller that
was out for awhile. I've

200
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.060
wired up an exercise bike
to be a keyboard and

201
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.420
control different games. And I
love the play of that,

202
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.390
that just changing how you
interface with something affects how

203
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.040
you enjoy it and what
you think of doing with

204
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.860
it, which is probably the
reason I've, I've kept the

205
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.650
space or a, a bit
of life support for quite

206
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.750
many years at this point,
<inaudible>, you know, one of

207
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.860
the greatest game controllers ever
made and certainly an utter

208
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.100
and complete waste of plastic
is the, the legendary, yeah.

209
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.290
X-Box steel battalion controller, Basically
an entire dashboard. I mean,

210
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.710
yeah, The thing is like
three feet wide and every

211
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.800
button means something like literally
every button works. They didn't

212
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.040
just say here's two joysticks,
Simpson, plastic, they lied, they

213
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.320
lit it all up, but
it's a huge waste. And

214
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.720
now you find them at
Goodwill, which is just sad.

215
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.960
It is. And actually it's
at a junk stores like

216
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.390
that, that I found a
whole lot of space orbs

217
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.300
or very similar devices. So
the, the orbit itself was

218
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.140
an a game controller. It
was intended for that purpose,

219
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.960
but there was also a
variant actually, I think, for

220
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.650
the PlayStation one. And there
were a number of desk

221
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.560
mounted versions, which were primarily
used by the CAD community.

222
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.930
You could hold your model
if you will using the

223
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.480
orb and move it around
to look at different things

224
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.910
and then use a mouse
to do manipulations to it.

225
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.830
And those actually had a
work surprisingly, one of those

226
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.900
game controllers as well, because
now you can have your

227
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.780
course movement in one hand
and you're fine movement with

228
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.150
the mouse for aiming and
the other, what you then

229
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.190
lose is the ability to
flail at the keys and

230
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.940
select weapons or do other
actions. But that combination actually

231
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.780
works surprisingly well. So I
don't think just even though

232
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.120
the orbit self has, has
kind of, well, it's in

233
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.700
suspended animation, and we're keeping
it alive in some ways

234
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.980
that idea that you can
have degrees of freedom and

235
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.530
one control surface is still,
I think, alive and well.

236
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.360
I've Both a space orb,
three 60, the original game

237
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.640
controller that I got on
eBay. Yeah. As well as

238
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.910
the larger space, what is
it? The long one, that's

239
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.400
almost like a forum That
you use for CAD with

240
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.350
any of that. Well, there
were a couple of different

241
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.190
models. The space ball 4,000
was one and the 5,000

242
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.380
looked very similar. Yeah. I'd
have one of the, one

243
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.430
of the thousands Special one
these are not made, is

244
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.690
that correct? The company has
gone 3d connection. I don't

245
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.350
think it makes them anymore.
You know, there were, there

246
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.900
was another company in Magellan
which made the Magellan space

247
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.480
mouse. And I don't remember
if they still exist either,

248
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.840
although they might write three
connection. Has these kind of

249
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.770
like balls are knobbies, like
almost like the volume controller

250
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.790
on your, you know, old
style stereo. Yes. I've seen

251
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:47.250
those. Right. And they're basically
just a knob and then

252
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.940
you can pull them. Yeah.
So it's a similar idea,

253
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.070
but it, to me, I
think it wouldn't feel quite

254
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.320
as nice. I'm not sure
I've not used one yet.

255
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.080
Indeed. So the space or
three 60 had a nine

256
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.160
pin serial port at what?
9,600 BPS. Yes. So it

257
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.760
was a 9,600 and it
was cereal. And it's probably

258
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.210
a little difficult to imagine
for a lot of people

259
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.220
who did not live through
that. What connecting something to

260
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.340
a computer was like back
then, because this was before

261
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.730
the universal serial bus, you
didn't even have USB, there

262
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.720
were specialist controls or, or
plugs for joystick ports and

263
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.660
anything more advanced had to
communicate over this serial bus

264
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.480
with this massive nine pin
serial connector. And that's what

265
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.900
the org chose to do.
Hm. And was there was

266
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.530
that enough fidelity. We have
systems now. And every Xbox

267
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.630
controller is a full computer
that has to have firmware

268
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.570
updated and they send stereo
and video and all kinds

269
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.930
of context and information is
9,600 BPS serial enough for

270
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.870
six degrees, Freedom plus buttons.
It is. But when you're

271
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.670
just doing the input and
you're not carrying all of

272
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.780
the other information, the protocol
that they used was actually

273
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.490
kind of complicated and they
had different settings that would

274
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.560
tell you different things about
it. And there were different

275
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.620
response curves so that if
you pushed it a certain

276
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.560
distance, you know, that proportionally
would get you more or

277
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.320
less of an output than
at the center than it

278
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.450
would at the edges. So
that you had a little

279
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.080
bit of freedom in the
middle, but the real Achilles

280
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.680
heel, I think of it,
it wasn't just the complication

281
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.840
of learning to use the
silly thing, but there were

282
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.640
only six buttons and that
you run out quite quickly,

283
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.090
especially in a modern shooter
where even the, the shooters

284
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.190
back then first person games
in science you'd have a

285
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.470
number of different things. You'd
want to choose different weapons

286
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.230
to send. For example, you
had a key for the

287
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.760
map and a key for
a different weapon and the

288
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.320
key for different rocket and
the key for this and

289
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.330
the key for that. And
if you had to hold

290
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.340
the thing in one hand
and grab the ball with

291
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.370
the other, you really ran
out of inputs very quickly.

292
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.510
So that was another little
problem that had had that

293
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.510
nowadays. I think people expect,
and Microsoft does encourage this

294
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.590
a bit with the X
input API. They expect an

295
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.500
ape, a Xbox style controller,
and they will use every

296
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.080
input on that. And they
figure that's all the inputs

297
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.480
they have. So they won't
bother with more, but at

298
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.930
the time people would just
design games for as many

299
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.180
keys as they thought people
could humanly press. And if

300
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.310
your controller didn't have enough
buttons on it, well, so

301
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.010
much the worst for you.
So it was a bit

302
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.330
of a mismatch there as
well. Acne and Zen database

303
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.660
is the best in class,
single secure, scalable architecture for

304
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.440
edge data management. It's the
perfect solution for software developers

305
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.370
who want dedicated application data
management and deliver business critical

306
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:38.020
products and services into OT
and low it environments, customizable

307
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:43.090
installation, self tuning, seamless backward
compatibility, minimal memory requirements and

308
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.260
exceptionally low support requirements and
better performance than most alternatives

309
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.260
like SQL Lite all means
that you can deliver applications

310
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.710
to customers at scale across
a wide range of platforms

311
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.010
with direct access from C
plus plus Python and other

312
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.330
popular languages. Zen simple set
of API significantly expands the

313
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.810
pools of developers capable of
building their next business critical

314
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.430
application on acting Zen, try
today at <inaudible> dot com

315
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:16.000
slash Zen that's act I
a n.com/zen. So I wrote

316
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.480
a blog post in September
of 2010, where I discovered

317
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.710
a website called J Crow
Crow with an e.com and

318
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.850
he still runs it's Birdman
space or message board. So

319
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.850
this is almost 10 years,
Years ago, nine years ago.

320
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.800
And there was discussion there
about a mapping between hid

321
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.130
or human interface device kind
of standards at the time,

322
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.850
10 years ago. And the
space orb and Arduino was

323
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.550
I think, just getting started
so you could buy an

324
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.220
Arduino and do cool stuff
with it. And then put

325
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.460
on top of the Arduino,
a, a hat or a,

326
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.670
what was the word? They
call them the shields for

327
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.030
some reason. So you put
a shield on top, you

328
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.090
plug your serial port into
one side and you USB

329
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.790
into the other side and
you bridge, you bridge the

330
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.160
old and the new you
bridge the nineties serial port

331
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.780
world, the nine pin RS,
two 32 with a direct

332
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.180
X and direct input. This
is 10 years ago, you

333
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.490
were doing this. How would
they heck did you pull

334
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.570
this off? Well, that journey
started even earlier than that.

335
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:23.320
When I, the problem with
older controllers is of course

336
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.160
the companies go defunct or
abandoned them. And so I

337
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.680
use my space or for
quite a while, until windows

338
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.580
XP kind of started giving
up the ghost, actually it

339
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.370
was, I think the arrival
of XB that broke the

340
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.550
driver. And at that point,
I thought, well, I I'd

341
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.960
love to use it this
thing, but I don't know

342
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.970
how to use it. So
I will write a windows

343
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.300
driver. It was very imaginative,
imaginative of me at the

344
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.410
time, because it turns out
driver development is an extremely

345
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.160
painful little subset of software
development. And particularly when you're

346
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.860
mucking about an protected areas
like you do with drivers,

347
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.140
you can trash hard drives.
You can do terrible things

348
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.450
to your computer. So after
flailing at that for a

349
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.930
while, and having the APIs
change with different additions of

350
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.450
the operating system, I said,
what I'd like to do

351
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.560
is just bridge directly to
a USB controller, a human

352
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.920
interface device. And in fact,
move, what I was doing

353
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.070
essentially is writing a hardware
driver where you plug in

354
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.340
a DB nine, you'd have
software on the Arduino microcontroller,

355
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.100
which would parse the input
and spit out an event

356
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.010
stream. And then you could
map that event stream to

357
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.960
arbitrary human interface, device actions.
And so what happened is

358
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.520
you would plug this thing
in and the Arduino would

359
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.320
communicate. They had had a
native RS, two 30, two

360
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.870
serial type communication. So it
would load things from the

361
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.050
orb and then it didn't
have a very good USB

362
00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.660
output. So we would emulate
that by a piece of

363
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.450
software, which I borrowed from
other folks, all praise open

364
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.170
source. And it would just
kind of bit bang, manually

365
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.320
turn lines on and off
too. Send the signals over

366
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.680
USB and lo and behold.
Oh yeah, it was a

367
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.410
strange thing, very manual and
very error prone. So I

368
00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:09.470
was timing specific and timing
extraordinarily. So, but at the

369
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.180
end of the day, it
all worked and you could

370
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.060
plug it in and it
would show up on your

371
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:18.530
computer as a six axis,
16 button game controller. Now

372
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.360
the 16 buttons was a
bit of a stretch. This

373
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.910
is actually still the question
I get the most when

374
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.100
people start using this as
why don't the edge buttons

375
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.890
work. So again, hard to
imagine this thing, but you

376
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.960
can imagine holding something that
looks a bit like a

377
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.080
Crescent shape and on the
face of it facing toward

378
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.820
you or four buttons and
on the edge where your

379
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.670
index finger would lie or
two more. And I thought

380
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.070
one thing that really frustrated
me was that problem of

381
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.740
running out of buttons earlier.
So I would try courting.

382
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.590
So the four face buttons,
Brian would be on different

383
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.470
pages and you'd have zero
one, two, three, or one,

384
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.270
two, three, four. If you
don't start at zero like

385
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.570
normal humans and you'd press
one button and then you'd

386
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.270
have a five, six, seven,
eight press another button, nine,

387
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.040
10, 11, 12, and press
both of them together and

388
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.110
you'd have up to 16.
So you had 16 virtual

389
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.110
buttons. And once you got
the hang of it, that

390
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.340
actually works surprisingly well, because
then you would think maybe

391
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.640
thematically the front page buttons
were for firing weapons in

392
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.590
the game or whatever the
second page buttons might be

393
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:17.120
for selecting weapons, that sort
of thing. And then the

394
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.960
fund only got more because
if you're already emulating a

395
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.660
human interface device, it's only
a step from there to

396
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.030
say, well, it's not just
emulating a joystick. You could

397
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:29.360
also make it emulate a
mouse or a keyboard. And

398
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.520
that was a very fun
rabbit hole to drop down

399
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.500
because after a while, it
got to the point where

400
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.070
you go to assign axes
to keyboard buttons or mouse

401
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.850
movements and get control from
this thing in games, which

402
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.950
never even imagined being controlled
by a joystick, much less

403
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.440
a ball on a game
pad. So very fun, very

404
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.080
fun project. And it demanded
a fair amount from me.

405
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.440
My software development background had
not included microprocessors up to

406
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.620
that point. And I thought,
well, this is it. You

407
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.550
know, I, I think we're
done and Alaska, it, it

408
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.360
wasn't the case. So we
actually, I envisioned that as

409
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.000
a kit because I kind
of grew up in the

410
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.550
era of Heath kit, which
is this wonderful company which

411
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.860
had a motto. We will
not let you fail and

412
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.540
you'd buy a kit for
building a radio and you'd

413
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.070
learn how to build a
radio. So I made little

414
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.170
kits for these orbs shields
and a couple of the

415
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.980
follow ons, but more often
than not, people just wanted

416
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.050
to actually use their old
device without learning to solder

417
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.950
things together and write software.
So I, I thought something

418
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.980
a little more user friendly
might be an order. And

419
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.860
it's, it's still not terribly
user-friendly, but we moved from

420
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.950
having an Arduino, which you
would purchase and then the

421
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.560
shield, which you would purchase
and stick on top to

422
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.500
actually trying to manufacture a,
an all in one device.

423
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.510
So who does that Though?
I mean, here's the thing,

424
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.180
there's, there's all these people
on the internet. And we

425
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.680
talked to them all the
time and they have all

426
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.640
these amazing ideas, but so,
so rarely do they do

427
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.450
it though. You had an
idea. I've had lots Ideas.

428
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.020
I have about 30 registered
domains that are all a

429
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:06.060
monument to my failure to
execute You actually not done

430
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.040
only from writing software easy,
but then making, making onside

431
00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.010
drivers and then drivers for
windows Vista and then making

432
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.970
a board making instructions and
then creating the boards like,

433
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.460
is this, this is a
hobby or is your spouse

434
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.730
okay with this? You know,
How do you execute and

435
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:28.230
ship Physical stuff when it's
not a business, I will

436
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.230
tell you not very efficiently.
And my wife actually is

437
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.540
very much okay with it.
In fact, when she learned

438
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.570
about it, she saw what
we were doing and learned

439
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.360
how to put things together.
She actually became much better

440
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.980
than I am at at
soldering. The silly things it

441
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.670
is, she's absolutely delightful. The
manufacturer actually took a long

442
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.760
time and it mostly came
from this. Of course we

443
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.120
all know and love open
source software, but opensource hardware

444
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.340
is quite a movement as
well. And so the Arduino,

445
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.280
wasn't just a nice thing
you could buy and take

446
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.150
home and play with the
specifications are online. The schematics

447
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.540
are online. So you quickly
could see, Oh, well this

448
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.340
is just a bunch of
parts and I can assemble

449
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.500
them together. And if I
only knew how to create

450
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.750
a circuit board, then that
would happen. And so I

451
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.650
learned how to create circuit
boards through a, a really,

452
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:23.010
really primitive process of photocopying
schematics onto magazine pages, and

453
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.620
then ironing them onto circuit
boards and etching away, which

454
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.480
was not the way you
really wanted to do it.

455
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:32.310
But I learned, and then
with the advent of kind

456
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.010
of the hobbyist electronics serum,
a lot of circuit board

457
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.770
shops, I mean, proper fabrication
shops have cropped up where

458
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.570
you can send away a
design and get boards back

459
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.270
in just a couple of
weeks. And this takes a

460
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.910
while. I love software because
you can type a new

461
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.840
thing and you'll, you'll get
the results instantly instead of

462
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.330
trying something out and getting
a prototype back in a

463
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:55.280
couple of weeks, but it
didn't work, but hardware is

464
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.240
painful. It's extraordinarily frustrating in
the world of software. You

465
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.980
never, you know, write a
program and then have to

466
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.380
say, I'm afraid the four
loop didn't really work out

467
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.430
on that one. You're going
to have to tune it

468
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.250
up. You know, you, you
modify it, but there's not

469
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.150
a gap between design and
manufacturing and in many ways,

470
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:17.630
right? And with hardware, especially
small scale batches, the tools

471
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.580
and techniques you have to
use are almost comical. So

472
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.410
when I first started producing
these, I was on an

473
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.580
assignment in London. And the
way you put the lay

474
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.470
things out, as you put
a stencil down and you'd

475
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.070
smear soldering paste all over
and they would get through

476
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.950
the holes in the stencil
and soldering paste is just

477
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.500
a little blobs of solder
floating in flux. And you

478
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.930
take this and you delicately
put all of your little,

479
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.600
you know, bite-sized components on
some of these things are

480
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.250
as small as a grain
of rice, you know, the

481
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.460
little resistors and capacitors and
such. And then I would

482
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.210
literally cook them on a
$30 hot plate that I

483
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.400
bought from target and turn
up the heat until I

484
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.740
could see the solder melting.
And eventually it would coalesce.

485
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.630
And then you turn it
down and pull everything off

486
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.970
and then you'd start testing
and find out what everything

487
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.930
didn't work then traces might
be bridged, or things might

488
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.320
need to be moved and
modified. So it's really fairly

489
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.280
painful to actually get through.
And, and if you're not

490
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.830
careful and you let things
sit too long, for example,

491
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.470
this latest batch Sutter pay
set too long, and it

492
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.750
didn't spread very well. And
out of eight boards, we've

493
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.120
only got one that came
out cleanly and worked from

494
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.530
the beginning, all the rest
of you're going to need

495
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:26.540
rework. So I hate hardware,
but there's something really nice

496
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.990
that is different from software.
In that you get a

497
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.040
thing, a physical thing, you
can hold in your hand

498
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.320
and plug in and it'll
light up or communicate and

499
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.980
do something. And that's really
engaging, which is one thing

500
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.440
that keeps me coming back
to controllers and small electronics

501
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.100
project, because I just think
that's absolutely wonderful. And I

502
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.530
bought an orange shield and
I put it together and

503
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.240
I've got it. I'm looking
at it right now. And

504
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.550
it sits on top of
an older Arduino and it,

505
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.810
it looks big and things
are spaced far apart. And

506
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.790
now I'm looking at the
new thing of Tron, which

507
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.760
is amazing. What is it
called? The thing Ultron 9,000.

508
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.630
So the, a thing of
transactionally, the, the company name,

509
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.770
or I should say these
self-propagating hobby named Arbitron 9,000

510
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.550
for awhile. I foresaw a
bunch of different little devices

511
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.500
that would all end in
Otranto because I just thought

512
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.240
it was hilarious for no
apparent reason. There was the

513
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.350
kettle Tron, which was a
temperature controller for teakettles electric

514
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.280
huddles, or as the, I
can't remember I was putting

515
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.890
together another small amplifier, things
like that. Cause I thought

516
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.920
it would be fun for
people to have kits right

517
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.960
now we're a little divorced
from our electronics in a

518
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.660
sense, a phone is a
magical black box and you

519
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.700
don't really know what goes
on it. And I thought

520
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.760
it would be nice for
'em to have small kits

521
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.560
of different devices that people
could open up and with

522
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.380
and put together a and
alas, I ran out of

523
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.690
time and also had a
child. Both of those things

524
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.500
happen in close proximity. It's
funny how those things happen.

525
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.180
And then projects, one project
replaces another where indeed the

526
00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.270
baby replaces the Arbitron. I'm
looking at a picture of

527
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.090
an orbit drawn here and
it's small and stylish, and

528
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.460
it's got that lovely. It
is literally, it probably could

529
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.360
be even smaller, but it's
limited by the, the, the,

530
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.100
the size of the, the
nine pin serial adapter on

531
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.800
the side there, right? The
serial adapter takes up the

532
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.920
bulk of the board. And
nowadays, instead of this giant

533
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.990
Arduino, well, we have a
very small flat packaged ATS

534
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.840
AMD, 21 chip with a
ton more memory, and it's

535
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.360
on more speed, which we
don't entirely need. And the

536
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.340
only other thing that's really
on the board chip wise

537
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:34.080
is a small RS, two
32 adapter, because the, the

538
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.270
orb did a couple of
different things that communicated at

539
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.240
a much higher voltage than
you want to have on

540
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.900
a small USB powered board.
So that little ship adjusts

541
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.770
voltage levels and handles the
serial communication. And then the

542
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.350
only other components on there
are a bunch of little

543
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:55.050
capacitors for voltage smoothing and
voltage adapters as power sources.

544
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.500
So you're right. It could
actually be even smaller. The

545
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.890
two limiting factors are the
plug itself, which is this

546
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.280
big old 19 era or
in 1990s era serial port,

547
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:11.820
and my ability to place
things with tweezers. And how,

548
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.340
how do you do you
from do firmware flash this

549
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.310
yourself? Like if I buy
one someday, you know, in

550
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.920
a, in a perfect world,
does it come with code

551
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.220
that you've added and then
is it, is it updatable?

552
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:28.110
Yes. So this basically is
an Arduino. This is adapted

553
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:32.640
from the wonderful aid of
fruit, one of their boards

554
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.940
with a similar processor. And
so it runs a very

555
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.410
similar firmware and it is
actually programmable from the Arduino

556
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.900
IDE. And the idea was
that was how you would

557
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.670
modify it and map things
to different control surfaces. And

558
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.280
so now keyboard commands as
you'd write a separate program

559
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.580
and, and upload it. And
it does work smashingly well

560
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.160
for me and other folks
seem to have a little

561
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.420
bit of a hard time
with it. And I'm not

562
00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.700
sure if it's a device
driver issue, but yes, it

563
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.810
is actually quite adaptable and
reprogrammable. I do flash it

564
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:08.190
here with a hardware flashing
device. I'm don't know what

565
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.100
else you can call it,
but it's ideally just flushable

566
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.410
from the USB port. You
load up the Arduino ID,

567
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.040
you can still send code
to it. And what I'd

568
00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.100
like to move toward one
of the new trends, I

569
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.030
think in the small electronics,
like Arduino is languages like

570
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.520
circuit Python, where you just
write code, drop it right

571
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.830
on the device as if
it was a flash drive.

572
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.200
It just shows up as
a storage device and then

573
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.760
things run. I think that
would be a lot more

574
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.760
convenient because honestly, the difficulty
of setting up the Arduino

575
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.730
ID and downloading the extra
drivers for the board and

576
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.440
getting them to talk nicely
has been a bit of

577
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.910
a difficulty, but it does
work. And I have had

578
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.070
a head folks say that
it works actually very well,

579
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.020
and I've had others that
never quite managed to get

580
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.900
it to work. And in
the programmability side of things,

581
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.600
it always seems to work
as it stands, you know,

582
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.430
plugging it in and getting
a game device out of

583
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.700
it. As I look around
on the internet and Google

584
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.340
around for orbs and orbit
shield and space, or I

585
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.540
find a, unfortunately just a
littered mess of broken domains,

586
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.570
people over the last 10
years doing this, but there

587
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.930
are still those of us,
myself included who are passionate

588
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.920
about making this happen. Here's
the question? Is it just

589
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.640
you and me left or
right there, are we talking,

590
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.160
you know, there's dozens, dozens
of us, you know, like

591
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.620
what are we looking at
here? Well, I often wonder

592
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.710
that myself and my, I
sort of say, you know,

593
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.440
this is an awful lot
of effort, just onesy twosy

594
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.980
and these boards out, because,
you know, if this, if

595
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.230
I knew we were going
to have hundreds of units

596
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.330
sold, it would be worthwhile
to pay for someone else

597
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.360
to assemble them. And they'd
probably be a lot nicer

598
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.740
and smaller and prettier. But
when I make a batch

599
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.740
of eight 16, something like
that, they'll trickle out over

600
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.410
a period of a couple
of months. And every time

601
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.700
I threatened to stop making
them, my wife says, yeah,

602
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:55.300
but you always sell every
batch. So yeah, there are

603
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.670
actually quite a few people
who still want them and

604
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.570
they're surprisingly spread around the
world. You know, we've had

605
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:07.300
buyers from Australia, various countries
in Europe, the UK. And

606
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:11.170
so there are lovers basically
around the world and surprisingly

607
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.750
many of them still interested
in using it. Well, I

608
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.000
hope that we, we find
them. I hope that this

609
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.540
podcast educates the people, not
just the people, but also

610
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.120
the young people who should
immediately go to eBay and

611
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.570
find themselves one of these,
because I think it is

612
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.730
just a joy, but I'm
also a big fan of

613
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.000
history, remembering our history and
being able to keep that

614
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.250
history alive. And I love
that you're doing that with

615
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.310
open source hardware and software,
and that you didn't just

616
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.520
make a custom board and
make it totally non programmable

617
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.750
and closed that you used
Arduino pieces because it in

618
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.680
itself, like if you go
away, the arbitrage 9,000 could

619
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.640
live live forever. It could
indeed, even the design of

620
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.420
the board is online at
a get hub repository and

621
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.250
I'll send you the link.
Oh, fantastic. Thank you so

622
00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.560
much, dr. Vic putts for
talking to me today about

623
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:03.520
the world's greatest game controller,
this space orb three 60

624
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.410
and the Orbitrap 9,001. This
has been another episode of

625
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:31.020
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week. <inaudible>.
