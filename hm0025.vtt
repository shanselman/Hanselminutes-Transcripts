11
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.800
episode, Scott talks about his
own personal favorite blogs. Hi,

12
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.500
this is Carl Franklin and you're
listening to Hansel minutes. I'm

13
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.870
here with Scott Hanselman. Once
again, your friend and mine

14
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.160
this week, Scott, we're gonna
talk about your blog roll,

15
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.190
the shouts outs to your
friends. It is a shadow.

16
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.630
Well, I wouldn't say it's
a shout out to friends.

17
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.620
Some people's blog roles are
a list of buddies, you

18
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.450
know, and some people's blog
roles are lists of every

19
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.310
blog that they've ever seen,
so they can have as

20
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.620
many blogs as possible and
get all the information they

21
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.100
can. And you're all about
value, right? Yeah, I can

22
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.020
kind of, man. It's all
about quality, not quantity. I

23
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.850
used to have a like
1500 it's down to two

24
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.220
or 300 now, but the
ones we're gonna talk about

25
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.070
today, probably not more than
20 or 30, this is

26
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.110
definitely a handsome and it's
show where folks are gonna

27
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.330
want to actually visit the
site and take a look

28
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.310
at the list of links
and a reminder to everybody

29
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.320
that you can always go
to the site, click on

30
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.510
the name of the show
and the links, every single

31
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.730
link that was mentioned during
the show will appear on

32
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.450
the site there. Okay, great.
So this isn't the complete,

33
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.120
can I have a complete
list of the Hanselman blog

34
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.250
roll, but it's the ones
that I think I, I

35
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.020
keep coming back to, I
guess there's kind of the

36
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.480
old friends, right? These are
the ones that usually are

37
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.720
the middle part of the
wheel and the hub and

38
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.740
spoke, right. You know, there's
the top 25, maybe. I

39
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.360
don't know. I actually didn't
even didn't even count them.

40
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.340
They just kind of, I
looked at the blog roll

41
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.990
and I said, man, I'm
always looking at this one.

42
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.190
I'm always looking at that.
And interestingly, feed damon@feeddemon.com feed

43
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.770
demon is the aggregator that
I happen to use has

44
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.710
a really interesting new feature
in the version two that

45
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.580
is blogs. I pay the
most attention to and blogs,

46
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.990
I pay the least amount
attention to these are actually

47
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.190
the blogs whose items I
actually read. Okay. So that

48
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.530
was really interesting. So I
used that feature to figure

49
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.390
out kind of which of
these I'm actually looking at.

50
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.010
So this is a little
bit of just me saying,

51
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.260
wow, I read that guy
a lot or that gal

52
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.870
a lot, but also that
my aggregator having watched me

53
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.300
over the last year actually
told me that these are

54
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.630
the blogs that you keep
going back to. Okay. Number

55
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.800
one. So in no particular
order, actually, but number one

56
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.760
in, in order Sam champion,
Tilly, is it Jim Tilly

57
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.320
or Gentile? It's Gentilly Gentilly,
Sam Gentilly, strength.com/g Oh eight.

58
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.830
Sam started this thing a
while back called new and

59
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.010
notable. And I keep coming
back to that. It's kind

60
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.110
of a, of a, of
a, I don't know, it's

61
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.910
not necessarily daily, but it's,
you know, a couple of

62
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.490
times a week and he'll
list all the different, new

63
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.370
notable links. It's kind of
a feature on his blog,

64
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.860
like a link blog of
things that are going on

65
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.010
in the, in the.net space
that are worth, worth looking

66
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.310
at Sam's a good guy
and is always focused on

67
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.710
innovative dotnet stuff. Now as
a partner to Sam, the,

68
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.950
you know, the original and
still the best LARC where.com

69
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.270
Mike Gunder Lloyd's stuff shrink,
stir slash GOK Mike's daily

70
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.330
grind is fast becoming legendary.
He's coming up on his

71
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.820
one thousandths daily grind. And
this is a link, a

72
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.800
link blog primarily, but he
also does reviews of software

73
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.530
reviews of books. He's got
a certain kind of a

74
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.610
sass to it though. He's
out in Eastern Washington. He's

75
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.580
like off the grid, you
know, he's a deep dotnet

76
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.810
technologist, but totally off the
grid and just, just a

77
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.510
hoot because he doesn't, he
doesn't pull punches. He'll tell

78
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.970
you exactly what he thinks
about your software. He's the

79
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.830
kind of guy that'll link
to you and say, I

80
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.600
don't think you're gonna make
any money on this, but

81
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.870
you know, maybe that's just
me, I'm old. And he's

82
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.680
hilarious. So between Sam, Sam
site, doing new and notable

83
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.160
and Lark, where.com you pretty
much got your, your, your

84
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.030
coverage there for, for link
blogs. You know, one of

85
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.670
the, one of the posts
I still go back to

86
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.760
when I'm teaching a class
is Sam, Jen Tilley's post

87
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.200
on how calm inter-op is
broken. It turns out it

88
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.170
really isn't broken, but I'm
just sort of the weirdness

89
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.660
about, you know, inter-op and
calm objects. He sorta dug

90
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.140
into the, you know, asking
the questions and getting answers

91
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.240
from Microsoft about why they
did this and why they

92
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.330
did that. And you know,
some fairly deep logic there,

93
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.160
but it looks like they
made the best decision. They

94
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.940
could Microsoft that is move
comment or out totally. Sam

95
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.380
is an interrupt beast. Definitely.
Another blog I keep going

96
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.510
back to, which is this
blog is kind of like

97
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.280
a, of a car wreck.
And I don't mean that

98
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.810
in a bad sense, but
just in the, you can't

99
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.200
look away is Darrell was
on Joe. He's at shrink

100
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.980
stir slash geo nine. And
he he's at 25 hours

101
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.490
a day.com. And it's also
called a carnage for life.

102
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.220
He's had a number of
different addresses and dare is

103
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.560
a as a Microsoft PM.
He used to do system

104
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.980
dot XML, and now he
does some stuff on live.com

105
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.740
and you know, building community.
And he's his big interest

106
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.280
is social, social interaction on
the internet. And he he's

107
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.980
one of these guys like,
like, like Rory or like

108
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.590
Scoble where he, he says
stuff and he's a Microsoft

109
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.050
employee and people go, wow,
how did he get away

110
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.710
with that? But it's true.
You know, he may say

111
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.330
it, I may have a
little edge, a little crispness

112
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.500
to it. And you may
say, how does this guy

113
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.690
keep his job? But, you
know, it's kind of hard

114
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.980
to argue with truth. And
I really like reading his

115
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.860
blog because it gives you
a real insight into how

116
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.010
groups at Microsoft look at
other groups at Microsoft. Now

117
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.340
you mentioned his name. Is
it Daryl or dare? Dare

118
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.040
D a R E either.
Obasanjo or Obasanjo. Okay. I'm

119
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.290
not sure. I would probably
say, Oh, Boston Joe, myself,

120
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.120
but Darrell would have to
correct me if I was

121
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.570
wrong. <inaudible> was on Joe.
I'm not sure. I think

122
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.680
his dad's the president of
Nigeria. Okay. The, the next

123
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.830
one is Greg Hughes. Greg
Hughes is actually our, one

124
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.780
of our chief security guys
at Kirlian and he's at

125
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.100
shrinker slash <inaudible>. And, and
he has a really interesting

126
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.730
blog cause he, he, he's
almost like a personal slash

127
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.180
dot it's. One of those
blogs of many interests. He

128
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.130
used to be kind of
a SharePoint guy, and then

129
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.400
he started moving more into
security and he just has

130
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.770
just the right mix of,
you know, pictures of his

131
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.310
cat and, and real world
stuff. And people keep going

132
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.900
back to him. He used
to actually do some work

133
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.780
for Chris Parillo and the
locker Noam guys. And he's

134
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.130
big into the whole gnome
decks vibe. And Greg's Greg's

135
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.680
blog really has a very
personal without getting too personal

136
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.020
kind of tone to it.
And I really enjoy reading

137
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.820
his stuff. And he's always
digging around and thinks about

138
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.540
security, things about fishing safety
of the internet. Definitely worth

139
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.510
checking out. Now here's a
guy, I don't know if

140
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.150
you've ever heard of a
Casey Chestnut, but he's at

141
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.000
brains and brawn.com. He's at
shrink storage slash G O

142
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.300
B. And I got the
opportunity to, to meet Casey

143
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.650
in a, an event in
the Midwest. And this guy's

144
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.890
blog is called brains and
brawn for a reason. And

145
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:59.150
he's like, I don't know,
five, 10, two 80, probably

146
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.040
benches twice as weight. And
does artificial intelligence programming just

147
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.780
for giggles. You know, that's
like what he does in

148
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.400
the spirit in spare time,
you know, he'll go and

149
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.800
do like a dead lift
of 500 pounds. And then

150
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.700
he'll code his own audio
analyzer voice recognition system on

151
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.390
the windows CE and in
the original seat. Awesome. Yeah.

152
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.480
Seriously, he's hardcore. He's also
one of these guys that

153
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.540
doesn't like punctuation or pushing
the shift key. So his,

154
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.730
his site is kind of
like reading an E Cummings

155
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.920
poem, you know, where everything's
lowercase, it's all run on

156
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.860
sentences, but take a look
at some of his artificial

157
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.580
intelligence stuff. It's really amazing.
He's done some pattern recognition

158
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.690
stuff. He's always hooking up
crazy hardware up to things.

159
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.440
He got his, his X-Box
controller to plug into his

160
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.220
computer and control a media
center, just stuff with direct

161
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.330
state direct input, definitely, really,
really heady and deep stuff.

162
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.810
That's the trickster slash GOP.
Cool. I'll check that out

163
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.050
now. Know everything it, blogs.msdn.com
is gold. I mean really

164
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.800
the quality of the blogs
up@msdn.com are pretty fantastic, but

165
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.440
I keep coming back to
the base class library, team

166
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.140
blog. I really like team
blogs. You know, I can't

167
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.420
keep track of 15 different
members of the team, but

168
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.160
I really like it when
a team shares a blog

169
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.860
and the BCL team, the
base class library team at

170
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.680
strength slash GOC always has
a lot of really good

171
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.770
content. And a lot of
it is about why did

172
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.960
we do that? Why did
we make a decision about

173
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.280
something in the BCL if
you've ever read the, the,

174
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.150
the base class library annotated
reference, right. Sounds about as

175
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.410
exciting as reading. Well, I
don't think anybody reads it.

176
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.870
I mean, you, you go
and you refer to it,

177
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.650
but that is a heck
of a read, Oh dude,

178
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.340
I read it, man. Hey
aardvark. You know? Yeah. I,

179
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.250
I love that kind of
stuff. I used to read

180
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.940
things like the PDF and
I love reading it. The

181
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.540
thing that's fun about that
annotated reference is that they'll

182
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.230
have like all the methods
and properties on string. And

183
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.450
at the end, they'll have
comments from half of the

184
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.460
team saying, here's why we
did that. And we had

185
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.010
a really great argument about
why this is camel cased

186
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.730
and stuff like that. I
love that. It's fantastic. The

187
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.550
blog is of similar quality.
I definitely enjoy reading that

188
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.840
blog. That's shrinks slash GOC.
Now on next one, here

189
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.180
is of course the polymorphic
podcast, you know, one of

190
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.180
our podcast brethren over there,
Craig Shoemaker doing it to

191
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.290
shrinks their slash G O
D actually that was shrinks

192
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.950
your slash God, probably not
the cleverest shrinks to Earl

193
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.010
I've passed out, but the
stuff over at polymath podcasts,

194
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.080
he keeps cranking them out.
Man. They're very good quality.

195
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.760
They're good. Yeah. Quality. I
believe both of us have

196
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.700
been on that show. Haven't
we, I actually, I don't

197
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.790
think I've ever been on
that show. Oh no. I

198
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.300
covet that show. I would
like to be on that

199
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.810
show. Maybe this is an
invitation that Maybe it is

200
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.600
what's that considering I made
him shrink stir.com/god, which I'm

201
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.710
probably should change. Next one
is of course, you know,

202
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.950
Scott Guthrie, right? And Scott GU
the man he's the man.

203
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.160
We love Scott goo. This
guy went from having kind

204
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.220
of a typical program manager
blog a couple of three

205
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:04.010
years ago to consistently spitting
out insight and content and

206
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:09.260
stuff about the internals of
asp.net. That is just all

207
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.050
goodness flows from this blog.
This is at strengthener slash

208
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.400
G O E when the
web application project stuff came

209
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.310
out, that allowed you to
compile your code on windows

210
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:24.200
2005 in the original compilation
style, that 2003 supported that's

211
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.600
when I felt that Scott
Guthrie's blog really took off.

212
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.390
And now it's just every
week, three, four, five, really

213
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.340
high quality posts. Well well-written
with lots of screenshots. It's

214
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.710
almost like a, it's a
free technical book every week.

215
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.780
Cirencester slash GOE. Yeah. He's
very prolific. And I remember

216
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.840
one post that he did,
that was just absolutely amazing

217
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.270
and insightful into Microsoft was
on their testing architecture. Did

218
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.310
you see this? You know,
when they, when they're testing

219
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.300
about how they push out
To like dozens and dozens

220
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.580
of machines, dozens, hundreds With
scripts and Oh yeah. It

221
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.970
was just amazing. He shared
testing matrix is fantastic. He

222
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.090
showed racks of the machines
just lined up. Right? I

223
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.550
love getting insight like that
into the, into the beast.

224
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.220
You know, knowing what's going
on up at the system.

225
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.270
Absolutely. You know, other blogs@msdn.com
that are worth looking at

226
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.940
are like Raymond, Chen's the
old new thing at shrinker

227
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.330
slash G O G. This
is a guy who just

228
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.030
seems to know everything. He's
like the trivia guy. Like,

229
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.800
if you want to know
why the tray is not

230
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.100
really called the tray, it's
the system notification area. He'll

231
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.710
tell you about the meetings
in 1994, when they were,

232
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.320
you know, when windows 95
was being thought about and

233
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.690
they were trying to name
stuff, you know, or if

234
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.570
you want to know like
why WM broadcast message works

235
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.060
the way it does, he
remembers that stuff. So he's

236
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.330
like the, the, in the
historian of this, of the

237
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.160
system, another great MSDN blog
is, is tests. The debugger

238
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.290
lady. This lady is amazing.
I don't know if you've

239
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.630
seen this. This has happened.
Tell, told me about her

240
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.460
before on the show. And
I went and looked at

241
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.250
her. It's it's crazy. I
read that when I want

242
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.590
to feel stupid. Yeah. I
mean, that's how good she

243
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.530
is. She, she is like,
it's like, it is CSI,

244
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.320
you know, inside your computer.
Yeah. She's like, she's like

245
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.870
monk, have you seen monk
on USA? You know, where

246
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.580
you just walk into a
room and you go, Oh,

247
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.660
someone died. He was left-handed
five, eight. You know, she,

248
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.580
she will take a big
dump file and build up

249
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.090
the entire forensic. Here's what
happened. It was a Tuesday

250
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.880
morning. She'll paint the picture
for you. Step by step

251
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.450
consistently high quality. I hope
she keeps it up. She's

252
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.060
awesome. Now you give a
lot of presentations and you've

253
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.970
been doing it probably longer
than I have a presentation.

254
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.380
Zen is a fantastic site,
a shrink stir.com/gof. This is

255
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.850
a blog I keep going
back to when I want

256
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.510
to kind of reinvigorate the
way I do presentations. You

257
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.230
know, it was like a
cliff. It cliff Atkinson, the

258
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.370
guy beyond bullets beyond bullets.com
got me, started with presentation.

259
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.650
Zen got me, got me
stuck there. They had a

260
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.680
really great post awhile back
where they compared the Yoda

261
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.530
style and the doth Darth
Vader style, you know, as

262
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.270
if you were giving a
PowerPoint and is there a

263
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.430
Darth Vader we're giving a
PowerPoint. They also did a

264
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.780
really interesting comparison between bill
Gates and Steve jobs. And

265
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.870
who's the more effective presenter.
So if you're into presenting

266
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.890
and presentation a thought and
theory presentation, Zen is fantastic.

267
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.480
Leave it or not. Scott,
I got a lot of

268
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.990
pointers about presentations from you,
which I think you called

269
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:23.310
from Don box. Maybe, I
don't know where you got

270
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.890
it, but there was like
a list of, of rules

271
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.950
for presentations. And I followed
them to the right. I

272
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.720
wrote that when I was
in Malaysia at the tech

273
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.330
ed Malaysia. Yeah. That's just
picked up from a world,

274
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.830
picked up all over great
stuff. I appreciate that. Yeah.

275
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.170
I pick those up just
from watching. Don was the

276
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.550
first presenter I ever saw.
And, but after that, it

277
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.400
was just picking up actually
a lot of standup comedy,

278
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.950
frankly, watching a lot of
standups, do their work, timing,

279
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.430
preparation, all those kinds of
things. Presentation Zen is a,

280
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.960
does a good job of
rolling up that kind of

281
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.780
stuff. Scott, one of Don
boxes points for a presentations

282
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.960
was never used PowerPoint. What
do you think about that?

283
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.710
I mean, certain, certain things
lend itself to PowerPoint and

284
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.800
certain things don't. But if
I'm talking to developers, I

285
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.020
generally don't use PowerPoints at
all. Unless I'm going to

286
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.300
show, you know, visual, like
a graph or something like

287
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.980
that. Right. I like using
PowerPoint as breadcrumbs for your

288
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.370
presentation. You know, lets you
know where you've been, kind

289
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.680
of reminds everyone about what
we're doing, keeps you on

290
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.350
track a little bit, but
no, if PowerPoint's the meat

291
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.480
of your presentation, unless you're
doing a five day course

292
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.300
and you really need to
follow an outline, I find

293
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.940
that it's not necessary, but
I think that Lawrence Lessig

294
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.530
and Dick, the guy from
skip identity are the guys

295
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.100
who did the identity. 2.0
presentation are really invigorating. The

296
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.630
PowerPoint kind of medium with
this new rapid fire hundreds

297
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.760
and hundreds of slides with
one word on them. Kind

298
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.210
of style of presentation, Patrick Caldwell.
And I did our presentation

299
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.160
like that at tech ed.
And it was pretty effective.

300
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.950
It worked out okay. There's
a time and a place

301
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.900
for PowerPoint, but I think
it is true that the

302
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.490
whole six bullets, six words,
PowerPoint style is dead. It

303
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.570
sounds like you were going
for like the David Byrne

304
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:13.450
style. Yeah. Very, very existential.
Yeah. Like the movie Brazil.

305
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.970
Yeah. We should do a
talk and presentations. That'd be

306
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:20.680
a good idea. Roy <inaudible>
has kind of silently become

307
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.750
the expert on regit, regular
expressions. You know, he's got

308
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.750
his regulator tool. He's just
come out with regulation. Have

309
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.990
you seen this? I've heard
of expert system for regular

310
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.210
expressions. That basically looks at
what you're trying to do

311
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.100
and gleans it and kind
of helps you along your

312
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.050
way. You give it examples
of what you're looking for

313
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.390
and it figures it out.
Now it's the trickster slash

314
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.810
Gooi regulator and the regulator.
He'll probably build them into

315
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.280
big one super IDE for
regular expressions. Huh? He's at

316
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.670
weblogs that asp.net. He's been
a fan of dotnet rocks

317
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.920
for a long time. I
know. And I guess I

318
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.900
think he's also doing his
own. He tried to do

319
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.520
his own podcast. I don't
know if he's trying to,

320
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.190
he's still doing it Desi.
Well, he's one of these

321
00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.470
guys like me where, you
know, he's running around doing

322
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.630
15 different things, you know,
he'll he did the podcast

323
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.220
for a while, but then
he started getting into this

324
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.440
tool. He'll kind of hide
out for a couple of

325
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.050
days and then software I'll
just appear. He actually just

326
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.450
put up a new tools,
dot a tool site up

327
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.030
at his, his domain with
all of the things that

328
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.340
he's ever kind of written.
So he's actually been consolidating

329
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.340
all of his tools into
one site. So it also

330
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.450
does a really geeky contest
that about your, your desktop

331
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.370
photo, you know, take a
screenshot of that. He's doing

332
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.800
that right now, actually at
the, take a look at

333
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.930
his blog, it's up at
shrink stir slash GUI. And

334
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.980
he's doing basically at glamour
shots thing for, for desktops.

335
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.070
So people are gonna submit
their, their desktops, a screenshot

336
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.700
of your desktop and then
you, myself, Mike and Roy

337
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.970
will vote on the best,
best user's desktop. Right. We're

338
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.060
actually contest happening right now
with judges. That should be

339
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:51.750
fun. Yeah. So now here's
a great blog, coding horror.

340
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.630
This is Jeff Atwood's blog
at <inaudible> dot com slash

341
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.600
G O J. This guy
is my, I like to

342
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.990
call him my nemesis, but
we're actually good friends. This

343
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.150
is one of those blogs
that I keep going back

344
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.130
to and saying, why didn't
I blog that? And that's

345
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.410
really, when you know, you
found a good blog that

346
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.910
you're going to get good
information from is when you

347
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.190
look back on the last
week and you go, Oh,

348
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.640
beat me by a day
or Oh, what good. Oh

349
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.740
man. Now I can't blog
about that ever. Cause he

350
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.570
just put his thumb on
the chest piece and now

351
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.620
I'm screwed. Everything that he
writes is gold. I don't

352
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.350
necessarily always agree with him,
but the thought and the

353
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.560
introspection that he puts into
his stuff about the software

354
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.800
development process. It's not usually
highly technical, right? He's not

355
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.890
someone like me. Who's putting
up code snippets and stuff,

356
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:40.140
but he's talking about everything
about coding, the culture, the

357
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.920
product management, the product development.
How do you manage your

358
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.500
bugs? How do you manage
your office? What's your cubicle

359
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.170
like everything in the periphery
there. That that is the

360
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.500
sum total of software development.
Jeff talks about nothing's off

361
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.160
limits. Great stuff. Cool. Shrinks
are slash G O J

362
00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:04.590
a and Phil hack@hacked.com. It's
shrink, stir.com/g O L a

363
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.740
two. A's hacked with the
AA. Cause that's his last

364
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:13.530
name? Phil hack or slash
G O L nother, consistently

365
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.410
good blog and always on
the cutting edge. This is

366
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:20.040
a guy who like marks
up his code with, you

367
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.280
know, CSS and marks up
people's names with how he

368
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.070
knows that person he's really
into micro format. So a

369
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.620
grant example, he might just
mention my name and a

370
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.160
post, but he'll actually put
semantics on it. He'll tag.

371
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.820
My name like friend met,
you know, met him, you

372
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.540
know, information about me. So
when you hover over it,

373
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.020
that information that's semantic information
about me is embedded in

374
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.740
the post. He's actually the
main developer on subtext, which

375
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.230
is a great blog. It's
a fork of dot text.

376
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.240
Definitely check out hack.com shrinks.
There's nice Gol. Now of

377
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.480
course the, the 800 pound
gorilla in the, in the

378
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.500
houses is Chris sells, right?
Sales, brothers.com shrink stir slash

379
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.360
GOM. The Marquis day sells
is the, the blog title.

380
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.980
And you know, he's, he's
one of the superstars of,

381
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.590
you know, developers from back
in the day. And he's

382
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.360
actually here in Oregon. So
I get to hang out

383
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.600
with them occasionally. And I
were talking a lot about

384
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.760
Chris, about Chris while Roy
was here last week. And

385
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.540
just what I had, just
a great decent guy, Chris

386
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:32.660
is, and incredibly smart, but
not at all egotistical, you

387
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.640
know, he'll tell you like
it is, he doesn't pull

388
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.490
any punches, but he's not
a jerk. You know what

389
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.250
I mean? It's a great
guy. And, and he's, he's,

390
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.570
he's, it's funny because every
once in a while I'll

391
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.870
ask him a technical question
and he'll pause. And I

392
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.850
know if he pauses too
long, it's because I'm an

393
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.050
idiot, you know, but he's
not going to tell me,

394
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.260
right. Are you asking that
that's not at all how

395
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.590
it works? You know? And
then he'll say things like,

396
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.930
well, I would, I would
encourage you to check out

397
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.600
the documentation and you know
that you've, you've just asked

398
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.540
him something stupid, but he's
very gracious about it. And

399
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.020
his blog has consistently got
good information, good opinions and

400
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.960
pointers to great content and
great tech shrinks there slash

401
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.920
G O M very technical
yeah. To asp.net sites. Of

402
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.240
course up everything up@weblogsdotasp.net is
great. Most of the blogs

403
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.470
that are hosted up there
consistently have good content structure.com/goo

404
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.620
goo. But you know, my
personal hero when it comes

405
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.590
to asp.net, Fritz onion for
its ever read his, his

406
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.860
asp.net, one old book was
fantastic. Fantastic. His blog is

407
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.780
of similar quality shrink stor
slash G O N F

408
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.430
Fritz onion. Everyone knows him
from his view state Dakota.

409
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.190
Yep. Sometimes you want to
crack open view state and

410
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.530
he had the tools for
us. He's up at Pluralsight,

411
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.020
got a great series of
tools you can check out.

412
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.410
Now, you know, if I
had another 15 hours in

413
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.270
the day, I'd probably want
to do more video blogging,

414
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.910
but you know, everything that
I do, the channel nine

415
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.490
guys do better. If you've
seen the channel nine up

416
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.970
at shrink stir slash GOP,
I really am enjoying their

417
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.580
video stuff. As a scope
of wanders, the halls and

418
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.040
interviews folks, it gives you
such an interesting insight into

419
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.340
what's going on inside of
Microsoft and their, their RSS

420
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.350
feed, which is the kind
of the complete feed of

421
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.840
all the videos. That's what
I take a look at

422
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.460
it. I don't really visit
the site much anymore. I

423
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.910
just subscribed to shrink slash
GOP. And I see all

424
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.820
of the videos As they
come in. The one thing

425
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.830
you get at channel nine
that you don't get anywhere

426
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.220
else is really the penetration
into Microsoft. And you may

427
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.190
not, you may or may
not find technical information there,

428
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.850
you know, that you wouldn't
find outside, but you'll definitely

429
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.760
get early information like you
get at first to channel

430
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.410
nine and you'll get just
a, a cultural look inside

431
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.650
inside the campus. Yeah. Which
you can't get. I really

432
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.750
liked getting the insight there's
stuff going on at Microsoft.

433
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.390
You don't even think about
like a really good example

434
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.820
of a blog that I
learned so much from is

435
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.990
Michael Kaplan at shrink stir
slash Gor. This is a

436
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.830
guy who does internationalization at,
at Microsoft, right? So here's

437
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.770
a, this isn't like internationalization
of applications. This is the

438
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.880
enabling us to internationalize our
apps. Like if somebody wants

439
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.360
to get a certain Tamil
character into windows, this is

440
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.130
one of the guys that
you talked to. This is

441
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.160
a guy who is instrumental
to making Ethiopian Americ a

442
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.300
language I'm personally interested in
work on Vista. You know,

443
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.120
when cling on gets get
support, you know, he'll be

444
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.850
the guy that makes it
happen. And he's so funny

445
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.000
because he'll always make each
post. This post is brought

446
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.240
to you by, you know,
Latin letters, Schwab or whatever,

447
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.030
and put the, the funky
glyphs for it. And you

448
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.800
know, your fonts are messed
up. If you read any

449
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.310
of Michael Caplin's posts and
they're all black squares, he's

450
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.140
always doing hardcore stuff like
that. It'd be a good

451
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.100
time to just mention that.
If anybody's thought about doing

452
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:49.460
globalization, doing, you know, internationalization
of websites with asp.net and

453
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.250
they're using any other technology
as a yard stick, by

454
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.600
which to think about using,
you know, asp.net for this,

455
00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.590
just throw it away, the
internationalization stuff in.net. That's just

456
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.790
built into the framework, you
know, by, by stacking resources

457
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.520
in multiple directories and just
hanging them off the web

458
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.730
directory. It, you know, the
bin directory, it's just beautiful.

459
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.540
Yeah. Consistently I see people
trying to roll their own

460
00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.240
stuff, put things in databases
sometimes that's necessary, but the

461
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.150
stuff, man, if you've got
an internationalization lean on the

462
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.520
framework so much, and it's
gotten so much better in

463
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.310
two Oh and it's even
so much more, better, and

464
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.600
more better, it's so much
more better in Vista. Some

465
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.220
of the stuff that he's
shown me in Vista is

466
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:38.800
pretty, pretty fantastic. He's also@blogsdotmsdndotcomothergreatmsdn.com

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.280
the assembly loader really works,
right. And then developing for

471
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.380
developers. This is a great
site. I think this is

472
00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.900
a little nugget inside of
msdn.com. People don't really know

473
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:04.090
about shrinker slash GP two
it's blogs that MSDN slash

474
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.340
dev dev. And this is
basically like programming pearls. This

475
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.350
is a great book from
back in the day, teaching

476
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.990
you how to little pearls
of information, little pearls of

477
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:18.670
wisdom. This developing for developers
blog consistently has great stuff.

478
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.790
It's almost like dr. Gooey.
Remember back in the day.

479
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.830
Sure. Gooey MSDN kind of
like that Kind of a

480
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:28.810
conversation definitely enjoy that other
really hardcore blogs that I've

481
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.920
enjoyed. Like Wesner moist has
a really interesting blog called.net

482
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.810
undocumented shrinky.com/gos. This is a
guy who basically developed pivot

483
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.050
tables and Excel worked for
Microsoft years ago. And now

484
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.350
has gone off to do
his own static analysis tool

485
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.450
that he's going to be
revealing onto the, into the

486
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:51.160
world and wicked smart guy,
wicked smart, always talking about,

487
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:56.560
you know, AI, very deep,
thoughtful analysis about the motivations

488
00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.190
behind software development. I, I
very much enjoy reading his

489
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.860
stuff. And then when I,
when I do feel stupid

490
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.440
because I read these really
smart guys, blogs, I go

491
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.780
over to the daily WTF
and I take a look

492
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.600
at that strengthened our conversation
got, of course, this is

493
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.840
the forum of all the
worst kind of written on

494
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.430
the bathroom wall kind of
code you've ever seen. You've

495
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.670
you've been up to the,
The daily WCAB the daily

496
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.140
WTF. Yeah. The daily. What?
Yeah, it's enough to make

497
00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.790
you really feel ill. And
then let's end up on

498
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.540
a couple of fun, fun
blogs that speaking of fun

499
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.350
blogs like the daily WTF,
another, another WTF moment would

500
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.680
be a Hans's matter.com. This
is shrinker slash G O

501
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.920
U. This is really interesting.
This is a Chinese gentleman

502
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.740
who moved to States speaks
both Chinese and English fluently.

503
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:52.020
And he has dedicated himself
to basically translating people's tattoos

504
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.090
that they've got an, an
ancient Asian Kanji and explaining

505
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.790
why really, why they didn't
get what they thought tattooed

506
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:03.810
on themselves. This is a
great site. Basically, you send

507
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.760
in your tattoo that says,
Oh yeah, this is my

508
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.720
name spelled in Kanji. And
he says, no, this means

509
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.740
sweaty antelope it's on your
it's on your arm. You

510
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.140
might think about that. Or,
and he'll, he'll, he'll Mark

511
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.450
them up in paint shop
and say, well, this could

512
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.270
be that. But I think
maybe they went into Babblefish

513
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.970
and looked it up themselves.
You know, don't get an

514
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.420
Asian tattoo. Isn't really the
goal. There really great site.

515
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.580
Very fun shrinks you slash
your friends. Would you like

516
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.180
to send to that blog?
You definitely should check this

517
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.910
out. This is true. MC
hammer. He's got his own

518
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.260
blog. It's can't touch this
MC hammer. Yeah. This MC

519
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.990
hammer. This is his real
blog. It's a Blogspot blog.

520
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.440
He blogs to it with
his T-Mobile sidekick. No kidding

521
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.290
shrinks shrinks your slash gov.
He puts up pictures. His

522
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.300
family has a, he's got
a new album out on

523
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.030
iTunes. This is the real
guy. It's not a fake

524
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.360
blog. It's just actually MC
hammer blogging, hits his comments.

525
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.470
He does. He does answer
comments. It's real guy. And

526
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:06.900
another celebrity who's actually blogging
is a Kevin Smith Simon bought

527
00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:10.800
from clerks, right? He's at
signup. Bob speaks.com shrink, stir

528
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.740
slash Gow signup blog. It's
the real, it's the real

529
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.200
stuff. It's, it's really interesting
to read blogs like this,

530
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.150
like Wil Wheaton from, you
know, from star, Trek's got

531
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.640
a blog, right? These are
the real guy, Zach Braff

532
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:24.540
from scrubs. It's interesting. You
know, we look at celebrities

533
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.250
and we think, Oh, wow,
it'd be really cool. What's

534
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.800
this guy like, and then,
you know, you read their

535
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.870
blog and you find out,
Oh, this is what MC

536
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.360
hammer does on a random
Tuesday. Isn't that interesting? That's

537
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.080
a heck of a thing.
Interesting. An interesting blog. We

538
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.690
talked about overheard in New York
a while back. There's another

539
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.830
one called overheard in the
office, which is just really

540
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.560
crazy quotes from real people
sent in from all over

541
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.260
the world about what's going
on in their office. Little,

542
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.660
sometimes not really safe for
work. It's kind of a

543
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.480
off-color humor, but I think
it's worth taking a look

544
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.360
at shrink slash G O
X, always, always good for

545
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.410
a laugh overheard in the
office.com. And then of course,

546
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.440
Phillip Tarone, you know, is
just the bomb. The man

547
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.000
at the magazine write, make
blog. This is at shrink

548
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.710
stir slash G O Z.
This guy is the guy

549
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.620
who's always taking two or
three pieces of hardware and

550
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.580
putting them together. He, he
actually took a GPS and

551
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:22.950
a computer strapped it to
himself, ran around downtown New York,

552
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.680
trying to make designs with
the direction that he was

553
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.010
running and then overlaid the
resulting GPS data onto a

554
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.760
Google blog onto a Google
map rather. So he could

555
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.000
draw stuff by running by
with his body. You know,

556
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.710
he'd like run like, you
know, 10 miles and then

557
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.680
go back and see what
the, what the design looked

558
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.370
like. I heard about music.
He's a guy who, you

559
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.280
know, strapped a camera onto
a Roomba and just see

560
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.930
what the room of view
of the world is. You

561
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.820
know, that, that actually caused
me to do the same

562
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.200
thing with my room. I
was going to say, you

563
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.240
did the same thing with
you. Remember that? Yeah, I

564
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.140
totally took, I put a
logic tech on top of

565
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.210
the room, but watch the
camera for a while. And

566
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.420
I was like, wow. Phillip
is, is the guy that

567
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.010
inspired me to really get
into the, you know, the

568
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.650
coding for funds. Some assembly
required stuff. We could start

569
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:09.130
messing with hardware, but he's,
he solders things. And I

570
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.230
don't, I don't use solder.
I'm not big, big wiring

571
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.050
guy, but the magazine is
just amazing. The stuff that

572
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.550
you could make, if you're
ever looking for something to

573
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.100
do with your kid on
a random weekend, take a

574
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.060
look at a shrink stir
slash G O Z. And

575
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.340
then of course, you know,
the, the original Joel on

576
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:29.110
software, you know, shrink stir
slash GP three, Joel is

577
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:34.210
a wise old man. He
runs fog Creek software, make

578
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.330
her a fog bugs. And
I think he's been blogging

579
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.340
on not really blogging. I
wouldn't call it blogging, but

580
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.340
he's had a website forever.
One of his best posts

581
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.460
is the, the post about
what any, what any developer

582
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.590
must absolutely know about internationalization
talks about encoding of ASCII

583
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.040
and Nancy and stuff. I
got a really, really nice

584
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.470
email from a guy who
works on the one of

585
00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.190
the I E teams inside
of Microsoft that said that

586
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.760
my, my list of questions
that you've got to learn

587
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.970
about.net in order to really
be an effective developer, right

588
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.350
along with Joel's article about
what you absolutely minimally must

589
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.080
know about. Internationalization helped him
get the job that he

590
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.750
has at a, at Microsoft
as a design engineer. That

591
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.570
was really cool. And it's,
it's, it's people like Joel,

592
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:23.110
and these other blogs that
we've, we've talked about today,

593
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.330
that, that really raised the
bar and make it easier

594
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.000
for us to do our
jobs, right? Yeah. Don't you

595
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.220
always turn, you turn to
the blogs, right? You're using

596
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.710
Google now as a way
to find other people who've

597
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:36.340
had that problem, right. Someone
they've almost replaced the newsgroups,

598
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.690
you know, they definitely have,
they definitely have newsgroups or

599
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:44.140
are dead and people still
use newsgroups to trade wares

600
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.360
and stuff like that. But
I don't see, I don't

601
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.420
see a lot of people
using them for information. Yeah.

602
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.270
I really like these communities
of blogs, like web blogs,

603
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:58.570
that asp.net, like a code
better.com you know, Pluralsight, bunch

604
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.430
of smart. Yeah. It's a
bunch of smart people get

605
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.370
together and, and put their
heads together and blog as

606
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.800
a group. And then of
course, Google makes it all

607
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.860
easier for us to find
them. I'm sure I've forgotten

608
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.730
some blogs. I've got another
235 blogs on my list,

609
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.040
but these are the ones
that I keep coming back

610
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.220
to, and I hope you
enjoy them as well. Excellent,

611
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.580
Scott, thanks a lot. This
is a great show. And

612
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.610
we'll talk to you next
week on Hanselman's.
