<inaudible> Hansel minutes.com it's Hansel

8
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.720
minutes. Our weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

9
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.400
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing
show number four 78. In

10
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.770
this episode, Scott talks with
Hansel minutia veteran Richard Campbell. Hi,

11
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.780
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

12
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.640
minutes. This is specifically Hansel
minutiae live number 16. This

13
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.850
is the show about nothing
with Richard Campbell. We do it

14
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.020
well too, with 16 of
these 1516. It's ridiculous. We've

15
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.210
been doing this for a
while. And of course, since

16
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.480
the advent of Google Hangouts,
we record these live. So

17
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.610
if you are hearing just
our voices, you can certainly

18
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.560
go up and check the
show notes and there will

19
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.370
be a link to the
live video show. So check

20
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.990
that out as well. So,
Richard, I just got back

21
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.650
from subway sandwiches five and
five minutes ago, and we

22
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.290
had sort of a plan
about this show, but now

23
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.420
it's over planned for, yes,
I'm very upset. So I'm

24
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.080
sitting there at subway on
my work computer and I'm

25
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.710
doing my thing. And I
get a prompt that says

26
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.790
that Adobe flash is to
date, but I have Google

27
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.830
Chrome. And I know that
Chrome includes a copy of

28
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.200
flash and that typically I
shouldn't have to do that.

29
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.740
Additionally, when I did that,
my first impression is, Oh,

30
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.870
weird, I've got a toolbar
virus or I've got something

31
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.690
going on. So I look
at the URL, but the

32
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.450
URL is where I was
going. So I didn't get

33
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.310
it. I didn't get maliciously
redirected. Right? I did not

34
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.140
get redirected. I see, you
know, food.com hasn't changed. So

35
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.780
that's weird. So I do
a view source and I

36
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.970
started poking around and it
all looks legit except@thebottomitsaysbestsoftware.com or

37
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.880
something like that. Best free
software.com. So I go and

38
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.600
I hit download and it
brings down this dope, this

39
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.420
virus that sends me off
to some Russian malware site

40
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.290
and it's evil. So now
I'm freaking out and I'm

41
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.090
like, wait a second. I
just got this laptop a

42
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.240
couple of weeks ago. I'm
a reasonably smart person. I

43
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.010
know my toolbars. I know
my viruses start around in

44
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.990
the task manager, nothing weird,
okay. Could be a root

45
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.700
kit, but still don't feel
right about that. What's going

46
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.240
on. I continue surfing for
a while and it happens

47
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.290
again in a different browser.
Oh wow. So not even

48
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.070
down to the browser. So
now I'm thinking, well, TDS

49
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.730
or some network interceptor and
I'm poking around using auto

50
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.710
runs from sysinternals and looking
at the networking stack. And

51
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.840
then I, I, I search
for a Google for, you

52
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.950
know, weird Adobe redirects. Right?
Yup. And come upon this

53
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.070
thread that suggests that the
router may be the issue,

54
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.710
which is extremely disturbing to
me. And you were in

55
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.560
a subway and I'm at
subway, but you know, I'm

56
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.840
in rural Oregon. So I
go up to the guy

57
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.650
who owns the subway and
I'm like, Hey dude. Cause

58
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.570
that's how I approached the
owner said, Hey man, you

59
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.960
know, can I tell me
about your router? So he

60
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.550
shows me the router and
he's got a whole weird

61
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.740
Frank and router kind of
a situation. He's actually got

62
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.900
two, two routers. He's got
one 92, one 68, one.one

63
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.080
for the, for the register.
And then I'm on one

64
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.370
68, a two.one. So he's
got a router behind a

65
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.860
router and as a way
of making kind of an

66
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.580
ersatz a guest network, right?
So he doesn't have a

67
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.360
modern enough router to go
and do guest networks correctly.

68
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.140
Right. So I say, listen,
you know, do you mind

69
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.750
if I check out your,
you know, your, your admin

70
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.430
page and you know, he's
seen me around, he knows

71
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.380
I'm a, I'm a good
guy, got your first visit.

72
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.050
Not my first visit. He
knows. Let's just say, let's

73
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.670
just say that they know
my, they get my food

74
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.650
started when they see my
car pull up. So I

75
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.630
start poking around and nothing's
wrong. It looks totally fine.

76
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.110
DNS is cool. It's not
an obvious DNS hijack. Right.

77
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.720
But it says copyright 2009,
this is the router he

78
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.800
got out of the box
freaking six years ago. It

79
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.410
still works. Yeah. So I
go to status, I get

80
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.240
the number and I go,
Oh, that's fine. I'll just

81
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.940
upgrade this guy's firmware. Right.
Right. So I go to

82
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.140
the update firmware button and
I'm already concerned because it

83
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.830
doesn't have the automatically update
firmware. Yeah. It's the browser.

84
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.560
Yeah. Go and look for
the firmware. So I go

85
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.310
looking, this is the latest
firmware. Okay. So you're up

86
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.150
to date with this guy.
He's got a, the moon

87
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.950
virus, a router worm is
infected his router. So then

88
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.690
I got, please just get
two of these routers now.

89
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.240
So I'm trying to figure
out which routers got it.

90
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.450
It's a one, that's the
one furthest upstream. In fact,

91
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.550
I'm sure both of them
got it. You think they

92
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.060
both do? Yeah, probably true
because it's self-propagating and that

93
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.010
is a valid point. Actually,
even though one is downstream

94
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.760
of the other I'm scandalized,
this is the same thing

95
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.820
about the internet of things.
Right. It's lovely. But all

96
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.740
those things need to be
firmware updated. Sure. And you

97
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.030
know, The moon virus is
new. It's like 2013, 2014.

98
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.080
So there's no way whoever
made that router could have

99
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.290
anticipated and their answer's going
to be buying new or

100
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.330
something that's projected. Exactly. And
that's, and I went over

101
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.270
this, I spent about 45
minutes there and I said,

102
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.280
listen, man, I think you
got to ask for a

103
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.220
new router. Like I don't
see a way out now.

104
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.340
Here's the part where I
think, you know, our, our

105
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.740
very kind Twitter followers, some
of which are watching the

106
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.020
show right now, maybe missed
the point a little bit

107
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.200
because they say, Oh, well
this is, you should just

108
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.160
use, you know, DD WRT
or, you know, open tomato

109
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.100
or whatever. It's like, right.
This is just regular person.

110
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.650
Yeah. Mortal. He's not going
to customize it firmware. It's

111
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.480
not, I mean, no, no
diminutive implied. He's just trying

112
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.030
to do his job. You
know what I mean? No,

113
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.140
I think this falls on
The link says net gear

114
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.830
Cisco's of the world, the
guys who made this hardware

115
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.280
that had the vulnerability and
they've just not fixing it.

116
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.670
Exactly. And the idea that
I should go and flash

117
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.450
it with an open source,
third party, you know, that'll

118
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.850
solve the problem in the
short term, but then think

119
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.940
about this as we are
all it for our families

120
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.110
and friends, you know, it's
going to get broken into,

121
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.400
and then I got to
go get an update to

122
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.970
open WRT w you know,
cause like these things happen.

123
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.520
Every light bulb out there
represents a, a threat these

124
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.950
and every year that goes
by, it's like, you know,

125
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.610
It's the responsibility of the
manufacturer. You made the money

126
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.450
on this. You've got to
pay the cost manufacturers come

127
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.000
and go though. Right. I
mean, yeah, Right now I

128
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.940
can go down to Goodwill
or, you know, any thrift

129
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.330
store and find one of
the little raggedy or blue

130
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.660
links lynxes riders. Yep. That's
cool. And I can flash

131
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.990
it with an open source
firmware, but that's because that

132
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.870
little blue links, this router
is the most popular router

133
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.840
in the history of routers.
Yeah. Five years from now,

134
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.610
let's say that I stopped
by know Goodwill and five

135
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.600
years and in 2020, which
is impossible to conceive of

136
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.930
that. That's going to actually
happen it's five years and

137
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.450
I'm going to find a
nest or I'm going to

138
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.860
find a light bulb like,
Oh, Hey, cool. Free internet

139
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.640
of thing thing. Take it
home. Oh, wow. That company

140
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.190
went out of business. There's
no updated firmware. It wasn't

141
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.210
popular enough to have an
updated firmware. So now it's

142
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.840
just an infection I'm bringing
into my house. Well, if

143
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.290
the router scares you, have
you heard a red balloon?

144
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.590
No. What is that? A
red balloon was a French

145
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:47.170
movie. Yeah. 99 left balloons.
But these were a bunch

146
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.930
of white hats that did
a demonstration a few years

147
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:55.470
ago where they created a
malformed word doc printed it

148
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.260
on the HP Printer, took
advantage of a buffer of

149
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.460
flow, rewrote the firmware for
the printer, and then made

150
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.550
the printer constantly seek on
the same location until the

151
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.170
protocol fire until it caught
fire. Yeah. It just like

152
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.550
my mind smoke fire. Okay.
So it made it less

153
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.250
dramatic version where, what it
did was sent a copy

154
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.340
of every document that you
printed on that printer to

155
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.430
another site. How's that for
corporate espionage that is disturbing,

156
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.280
the physicality of these things
is weird. You know, like

157
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.770
know I've got this insulin
pump, you know, and people

158
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.170
can break into that and
do something with it. It's

159
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.470
just not a big enough
or interesting enough target. It's

160
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.280
really interesting Scott. Well, the
point I'm making is that

161
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.130
the idea that one could
attack the physicality of a

162
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.280
thing yes. In the example
of the printer, make it

163
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.160
move fast enough that it
would cause friction and therefore

164
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.220
and burst into flames. Well,
there's a story. I mean,

165
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.990
going back to the cold
war where one of the

166
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.960
ways to CIA spied on
the Soviets is that they

167
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.980
were maintaining all their photocopiers.
And so they took copies

168
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.380
of everything that was copied.
Well, this is a digital

169
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.080
version of that. I can
infect your printers with stuff

170
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.160
that will give you copies
of everything you print. You

171
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.200
know, I just remember when
I used to go and

172
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.860
throw, you know, I would
see open printers like in

173
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.420
the neighborhood and just say,
Hey, your printers, you know,

174
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.590
and I would send them
the early days of broadband.

175
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.080
I took it upon myself
to drop documents on people's

176
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.230
desktops. This is looking at
machines wide open, see this,

177
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.060
I was here. Would you
like me to format your

178
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.450
drive? Cause I can. So
what do I do? This

179
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.700
is my local subway. This
is, this is conference room

180
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.690
B. This is where I
go. And you know, eat

181
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.500
and surf. I'm thinking of
my five point. But you

182
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.480
understand though, that this is
the part where I think

183
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.050
we all can, can relate.
Yeah, I might. I'm not,

184
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.340
I can't leave this broken.
I have to fix this

185
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.640
guy's router enemies. You've got
to replace this router. Yeah.

186
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.870
Which means I'm now the
guy, you know what I

187
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.660
mean? You routers, you know,
you stayed the links, this

188
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.570
line, you know, the WRT
2,500 AC router, but for

189
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.540
200 bucks, like it's a
good painting. It's maintained. It's

190
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.830
got the guests that we're
going with, got all the

191
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.560
features he actually wants. But
from the perspective of the

192
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.290
user, but the one that
frontier gave me or the

193
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.470
one that century link gave
me was free. It's garbage.

194
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.130
It's not fair. And it's,
you know, it's like someone

195
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.160
goes and buys a car
and I say, Hey Richard,

196
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.980
I just got a great
Toyota Camry. And since you

197
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.690
know, cars, you go, well,
that's crap. Swap the engine

198
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.780
out. He's a pretty good
car. Actually what I'm saying

199
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.890
though, to your point, the
free car, probably not as

200
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.360
good as the car had
paid for. Yeah. I hear

201
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.630
what you're saying, but I
keep coming back to nontechnical

202
00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:00.010
parent, non technical relative. I
just think that the internet

203
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.710
is a thing that's supposed
to work. And there's all

204
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.180
these great pieces of advice
that people, people gave me.

205
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.940
They're like, well, you could
just feed PN or, you

206
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.590
know, you could use this
or use that. There's all

207
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.500
sorts of things I can
do locally. That doesn't solve

208
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.250
it for that person though.
No. So that makes me

209
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:22.290
sad. And it's yeah. It's
not going to either. I'm

210
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.820
looking in the Q and
a here. If you click

211
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.410
on the Google hangout on
the right. On the left

212
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.990
hand side there, the Q
and a blue button. Yup.

213
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.600
They've people have noticed that
I have got the crud.

214
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.840
You can hear it in
my voice. Yeah. You know,

215
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.870
you remember when a, a
cold was a couple of

216
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.990
days and a little bit
of tea and now it's

217
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.280
like five hours, five hours,
five weeks of thinking. I'm

218
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:50.250
thinking through a fog there
They're evolving too. Yeah, exactly.

219
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.190
I think I may literally
have caught this cold from

220
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:59.070
this router. At some point
I would not seriously. It

221
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.170
would not surprise me if
I have somebody. I think

222
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.260
I like freaked out. Scan
it. It's good. Fun. Oh,

223
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.700
well then this is the
other thing though. And this

224
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.270
is why InfoSec is such
a funny place that people

225
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.720
who, who are maybe listening,
who are InfoSec, people are

226
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.420
probably rolling their eyes so
hard that they can see

227
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.410
the back of their brains.
That like, Oh man, someone's

228
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.470
finally caught these, the InfoSec
thing because there's so much

229
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.680
fear-mongering going on. You know,
it's just like, everything is

230
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.600
insecure. You know, you're just
completely, you know, it's all

231
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.780
tinfoil hat part that's disturbing
is when you discover that

232
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.580
it's all true. Everything they've
been telling us is totally

233
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.540
true. Like Whereas radio shirt,
because this is what we

234
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.200
do with that show. I've
actually had a pineapple demonstrated

235
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.380
to me where we walked
into a Starbucks and just

236
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.400
Troy does an account's in
30 seconds. Yep. Yep. Read

237
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.530
Troy hunt Blog and the
pineapple and how you can

238
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.680
set up a honeypot. They're
just wonderful. Yeah. My dad

239
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.110
always says, just because you're
paranoid doesn't mean they're not

240
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.830
after you. It's true. Which
is basically what's happening. So

241
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.910
you're not wrong. What was
the original thing we were

242
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:12.900
supposed to talk about on
this episode? Google IO. Sorry.

243
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.170
No, You know, this is
bigger than this is bigger

244
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.840
than someone is wrong in
the internet. This is, you

245
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.310
know, there's a problem at
my local, at my local

246
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.990
subway. Like, you know, like
here, my print, Jackie, I'll

247
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.290
just retweeted the internet. It's
just the thing that should

248
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:32.910
work. You know what I
mean? Like I don't turn

249
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.940
on water in my faucet
and assume that it's got

250
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.500
a root kit and a
virus. I mean, I'm sure

251
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.960
it probably could, you could
get sick from it, but

252
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.400
it's just, you know, water,
shelter, internet. It just feels

253
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.740
like I should be able
to expect. And yet we

254
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.740
have problems with water quality.
We have problems with electricity

255
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.520
quality. Like all of our
utilities struggle. This is just

256
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.620
another utility. We're still not
recognizing any utility. Yeah. Very

257
00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.310
frustrating. Yeah. Okay. So thank
you for letting me get

258
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.960
that up. I'm looking at
the wave form here on

259
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.600
the, on the NIC. Like,
well that's all me talking.

260
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.590
Yep. And there's, Richard's going,
you've been very patient Was

261
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.260
you had the anxious moments
and I understand that. And

262
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.830
it's, I've been watching these
firmware viruses for a while.

263
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.290
Cause it's, it's, it's an
ongoing problem with no good

264
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:22.300
answers. You know, it's extremely
trusted. Computing initiative is supposed

265
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.700
to deal with this. That
they've had so much pressure

266
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.730
for people not liking it.
That it's been kind of

267
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.090
undermined like Hewlett Packard should
be doing this at all

268
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.530
the printers leash we're doing
on the routers. Like there's

269
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.130
a, there's a solution, but
there's been so much resistance

270
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.530
to it. They're just not
applying it. Yup. And if

271
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.970
you look at the, the
Chain, you know, frontier who's

272
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.300
happens to be my internet
provider. Yep. They don't care.

273
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.400
Like I don't even think
you ever feel like your

274
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.090
internet provider just doesn't really
feel like being. Yeah. Well,

275
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.390
I mean, it's just like
a utility, every touch of

276
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.690
you, the customer costs them
money. Right? It's the price

277
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.290
of being a utility. So
freaking true. People are like,

278
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.810
Oh, I'm so upset that
I don't get 24 hours,

279
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.600
you know, seven days a
week. Perfect. 99, five nines

280
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.650
internet providing from my host
and I pay them $4

281
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.010
and 95 cents a month. You
know what I mean? Unacceptable.

282
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.080
You know, and then they'll
go, Hey, well, Azure is

283
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.460
$15 a month. Unacceptable too
much money. And then one

284
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.030
phone call. Yeah. We've blown
that the profit margin gone.

285
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.870
Oh yeah. Pretty close. Yeah.
You know, I have business

286
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.030
class internet in the house
cause I run my own

287
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.690
server closet. Cause I'm insane.
I get pretty good service

288
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:39.130
from my providers, but I
spent a substantially larger amount

289
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.030
of money with them. I
want to take a moment

290
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.840
to thank our sponsors, sync,
fusion, sync fusions, mobile web

You know, when I bought

300
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.730
my first computer with my
own money, I mean, I

301
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.310
had a trash 80 and
I had 64, but it

302
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.900
was when it was time
to really grow up and

303
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.940
become an adult. I went
out and I bought it.

304
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.680
I got a loan from
U S bank $2,000 and

305
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.070
I bought a 46 and
the big controversy was like

306
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:46.030
ESX or DX DX 33
all the way, man. I

307
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:51.390
might need to do that.
And I bought this $2,000

308
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.510
computer and it was fine.
It was a great computer,

309
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.660
but 46 right now, if
I buy a $42,000 computer

310
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.630
now, like I have all
my neighbors are buying four

311
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.780
99 machines from Walmart, you
know? And they expect the

312
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.440
world. Yeah. And Hey, here's
a true story. My wife

313
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.180
had a laptop 18 months
old, turns it on last

314
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.450
week. And it weird popup
comes up that says your

315
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:21.420
battery has now ended its
life it's done. I mean,

316
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.550
it was just a weird,
it's like elf shot the

317
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:29.310
food. What the hell? That's
what I'm like. Okay. By

318
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.340
guests, I'll get a new
battery for your phone or

319
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.970
for your, for your laptop.
So go online. Thousands of

320
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.090
people with the same problem,
right. This battery has built

321
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.600
in firmware on the damn
battery, excuse my French that

322
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.560
says I can be recharged,
you know, 272 times or

323
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.170
whatever. Right. And she's recharged
and it's just like, I'm

324
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.540
done end of life. So
I'm like, okay, I guess

325
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.510
I'll replace this Battery. Nope,
No user serviceable parts inside.

326
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.510
So then I got to
order, you know, because my

327
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.340
wife wants it fixed. Right.
So that means it's going

328
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.880
to Just care about the
details tech boy, fix this.

329
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.960
Exactly. So I go and
order a new one, you

330
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.170
know? And every step of
the way the, the laptop

331
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:16.010
manufacturer is threatening me. Like,
don't, don't do this. It's

332
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.690
going to be bad. And
you, you know, I'm going

333
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.890
to get warned. Like I'm
going to go and get

334
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.070
this aftermarket Chinese battery. You
have to plug it in

335
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.200
and their little software things
going to go. And it's

336
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.960
just not one of our
ink jet printer cartridges. You

337
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.540
have to, you don't try
refilling your ink chats. Yes,

338
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.970
Exactly. Yeah. Anyway, I bought
the battery in. It works,

339
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.370
but it's the principle of
the thing. So that's just

340
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.800
one part like Moore's going
to break the machines old

341
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.590
enough. Now stuff's going to
unravel like rarely have I

342
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:50.410
found that it's worth upgrading
stuff. Just replace it. It's

343
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:58.610
done. That is unacceptable. That
is the, Are a DVR

344
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.490
Wert Geier and check go
patch that firmware I'm a,

345
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.900
I'm a Portlander and I'm
a tree hugger. And I

346
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.260
don't like waste, you know?
I mean, yes, I have

347
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.270
a lot of gadgets and
stuff, but every single one

348
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.270
of them, I'm always looking
for a home. You know,

349
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.220
I don't want to get
rid of something if, if

350
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.430
I can avoid it. And
that just, it just offends

351
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.070
me to toss it. And
I'm very careful about hazardous

352
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.740
materials and batteries and stuff
like that. You resell your

353
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.840
old Kendall. Do they get
the new Kendall? Like you're

354
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.710
pretty diligent pay it forward.
So the idea that Top

355
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:35.570
is like a Mac book
is just, yup. Can't can't

356
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.280
replace. I've got a Mac
book here in the battery.

357
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.120
It says it's 43%. Right?
That's the usable life of

358
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.490
the battery. And you know
how these batteries get to

359
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.580
the point where it's like,
you've got 12 per click.

360
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.900
Yeah. But The point I
make about replacing the battery

361
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.660
is, you know, the fans
are failing, you know, the

362
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.200
SSDs at his limits, you
know, the casing material is

363
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.090
going to start to crack.
You know, the plugs are

364
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.530
loose, the power adapters broken,
like this is what happens.

365
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.900
You spend the money, put
a new battery. I just

366
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.910
did this. I put an
SSD in an old laptop.

367
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.890
The fans failed. Right. We
got Another six months out

368
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.350
of it after spending a
hundred bucks on an SSD.

369
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.170
Now the fan's done. I
can't really replace them, man.

370
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.870
It's really hard. This is
where we're at. We're no

371
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.540
longer like the young wide-eyed
people. This is where I

372
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.450
go. I go straight, get
off my lawn. You know

373
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.700
what I mean? So I
go and try to buy

374
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.250
some GI Joe men for
my kids, you know, the

375
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.220
little action, action people. I
think they were Marvel. I

376
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.010
have boys. I have girls.
No geo Joe is my

377
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.400
life. I mean, every everyone's
different. My, my niece loves

378
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.230
GI, Joe, actually, she's got
to pick her collection than

379
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.780
we do. Yeah. But the
point is I go and

380
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.260
I get these, these J
Joe people, their arms don't

381
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.440
they'll do that anymore. Think
about that. Like that's the

382
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.810
Canary in the coal mine.
Like let's get to the

383
00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.780
essence of it, right. By
the way, I feel like

384
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.000
I'm one of those radio
pundits right now. Like I'm

385
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.010
like rush Limbaugh or someone
who's on the radio. Like

386
00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.350
going down the path, let's
talk about, what's really wrong

387
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:11.580
with America. GI Joes joints,
no longer bend. How could

388
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.910
this be? You know, I
mean, 10, 15 years ago

389
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.550
they would have full articulation.
Right. And now it's just

390
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.870
like Han solo in Carbonite.
And we think this is

391
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.700
okay. And the worst part
is that my kids don't

392
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.040
know any better. You know?
So I was like, wait

393
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.920
a second. I can pay
$13 for a single molded

394
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.240
piece of plastic without bendable
joints. Right. But, and here's

395
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.430
the funny part. Where are
the action figures that do

396
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.610
bend? Well, those are $50
and you buy them in

397
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.310
toys for adults and you
get them at the comic

398
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.980
book store where, you know,
40 year old nerds like

399
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.680
me hanging out and God
forbid, you should take it

400
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.660
out of its container. You
never give it to a

401
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.510
child. You never give it
to a child. They messed

402
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.770
them up. Well, that would
be, Was a toy. What

403
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.520
are you talking about? It's
a collectible. It is. Where

404
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.540
are the micro machines? Where
are those toys? You know

405
00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.040
what I mean? Like I
got my little halo guy

406
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.040
here. Now we've got this,
this guy is like, that's

407
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.270
a $20 action figure. Yep.
That's unacceptable. Right. And did

408
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.470
I show you this? This
is my samurai Darth Vader.

409
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.590
I got this. They gave
it, they gave this to

410
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.910
me for my birthday. I
was in Japan for my

411
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.860
birthday. And they gave me
full-size articulated with force and

412
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.980
he's got interchangeable force hands.
So he can like, he

413
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.740
can, you know, I'm your
father hand And he is

414
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.160
a curved lightsaber. How can
you curve a lifesaver? It's

415
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.380
because it's a, it's a
contaminant. Yeah. It's fantastic. I

416
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.900
love this guy, but Oh,
his hands, his fell off.

417
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.220
Oh, let me see. I
just literally really put his

418
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.160
arm. Well, that's, that's actually,
that's in line with all

419
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.050
of the star Trek Canon.
You always have to lose

420
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.340
your right arm. Every, every,
every star Wars has somebody

421
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.170
losing an arm at something.
All right. Before the new

422
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.560
movie, I'm super excited. I
am, I am looking forward

423
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.230
to the new movie, but
I'm still upset about Lupita

424
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.840
and Django. One of the
world's most beautiful and talented

425
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.800
women is all CGI. So
if they pull a jar

426
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.730
jar, I'm burning the whole
place down. I'm burning it

427
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:19.720
down and you're like, you
know, no revolution, revolution will

428
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:25.540
happen. Unless she becomes like
the Andy circus level of,

429
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.380
of like, she gets an
Oscar for right. Whatever character

430
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.290
transcends everything. But it just
seems like a waste. You

431
00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.240
know what I mean? I
mean, Abraham's made a lot

432
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.460
of models. He's not George Lucas
is he's not going to

433
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.550
go all digital, everything. I
have faith in Abrams. Do

434
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.670
you have faith in Abrams?
I feel, I feel like

435
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.650
there's, if there's going to
be a lot of lens

436
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.620
flare that's all I know.
Yeah. Well I liked his

437
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.790
star Trek reboot. I thought
it was great. Yeah, it

438
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.690
was good. But he actually
apologized later for, for the

439
00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:01.060
policies later for a little
too much lens flare. He

440
00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.370
did seriously go look for
Abrams and lens flare. And

441
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.940
he's like, yes. I'm sorry.
I know. I know. I

442
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:11.290
know. Yeah. I know. Yeah.
I still I'm still upset

443
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.800
too funny. What a mess.
And then someone suggesting you

444
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.220
mad max film. Oh my
goodness. You mean Furiosa one?

445
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.690
Yeah. I thought Madmax was
really good. It took a

446
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.990
minute to like absorb it.
Yeah. But you know what?

447
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.090
It's the first movie I've
seen in a very long

448
00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:31.120
time where I've been. I
was okay. Coming out of

449
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.550
it and a day later,
like I got to go

450
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.460
watch that again. I miss
them. But you know, that's

451
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.320
a really good way to
put it. I felt like,

452
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.730
like what happened? What just
happened? What just how, okay.

453
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.970
Well let me sense. That
More story. We didn't see

454
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.680
the relationship between the three
brothers. The there's so much

455
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.500
stuff going on in there.
It makes you feel like

456
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.320
either it was really just
brilliant filmmaking. And they trust

457
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.750
us as viewers to not
be idiots. There was no

458
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.950
obvious callbacks or anything that,
you know, like in your

459
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.920
face, they just let you
assume stuff. They were very

460
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.130
judicious about telling like every
character had a name, but

461
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.720
they weren't, they weren't in
your face. They didn't keep

462
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.040
repeating the names. I know
somebody mentioned. Yeah. But they

463
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.610
also had passed the Bechtel
test where all the women

464
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.890
were having conversations together. There
was one scene where there

465
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.610
were 12 women talking and
not talking about men, which

466
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.910
is the Bechtel test. Yeah.
I was good. I think

467
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:35.380
that I did feel that
having, was it Tom Brady

468
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.030
vain? I like, I like
him, but is that his

469
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.400
thing now is to star
in a film and have

470
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.530
six lines. Well, that was
the Madmax thing. Like the

471
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:51.150
substance to the original mad
max, the idea that they

472
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.630
named the movie after a
guy who's really a supporting

473
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.880
actor, you know, there's a
whole other story going on

474
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.870
there that he's largely trying
to avoid. And then when

475
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.740
he finally goes and then
gets involved and then he

476
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.300
leaves and he is not
interested in, in anything, like

477
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.060
he just wants to cover
his own butt and make

478
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.180
sure that he is safe.
Right. Yep. Yeah. I thought

479
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.730
it was great, but I
kept because I can have

480
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.690
him as Bain though. I've
always, you know, in my

481
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.850
mind, everything that he would
say, I would say it

482
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.850
over again in Bain's voice.
I was wondering what would

483
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:33.800
break for us. So it's
just everything man. Mad max

484
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.840
would do. I could hear
Bain in his, in his

485
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.330
voice. I was bored in
the darkness. So I don't

486
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.660
know what happens. You get
typecast from one film and

487
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.650
I watched it again recently
and you can't even tell

488
00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.660
it's him. You know what
I mean? It could have

489
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.660
been anybody. It could have
been. I'm not over the

490
00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.440
cat. The bane cat wrecked
me. Anytime I hear the

491
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.960
Bay character it's being cast.
I would encourage everyone to

492
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.310
stop watching what we're doing
immediately and go in search

493
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.310
for bang, cat, bang, cat,
and it'll change. Your life

494
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.470
will change your life. He's
got t-shirts as well. It's

495
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.790
amazing. Yeah. It's brilliant. I
feel so. It's so cathartic

496
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.070
to talk to you. I
just feel like sometimes I

497
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.100
just need to call a
Canadian and just we're here

498
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.970
for you. Just go out
just, Oh my goodness. Oh,

499
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.400
here we are. Americans addict.
You forget about us most

500
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.500
time. What's the why you
look up here and wow.

501
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.050
This cool stuff right here.
That's it. Speaking of cool

502
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.650
stuff. I got a package
in the mail just minutes

503
00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.890
ago. Let me open it.
Any idea what's in it.

504
00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:41.570
I think if I can
find a knife or I

505
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.440
think it is my Lenovo
one doc, I got a

506
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.190
Lenovo X, X one, opening
this with a Lego. I

507
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.680
don't, I don't have a
knife. So I'm using a

508
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.430
really sharp Lego. Well, all
Lego is sharp. Just step

509
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.700
on it, you know? Yeah.
Yeah. So I think it's

510
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.460
a Lenovo one doc, and
this is nice because I

511
00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.060
wanted a docking station for
my X one carbon speaking

512
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.270
to spending $2,000 on a
computer. Don't talk to me

513
00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.850
about that. Oh, this is,
this is lovely. I want

514
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.400
to point out the size
of the box. Okay. Yes.

515
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.370
This is giant box. The
size of a refrigerator. It

516
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:20.210
comes Portland boy again. And
then, Oh, there's another, any

517
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:26.720
bugs? Any box inside? There's
no business. Okay. So how

518
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.290
many boxes are in here?
No. Yeah, it's stupid. It's

519
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.380
all. Well and fine until
your stuff is broken, then

520
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.720
your wife, why wasn't there
more packaging? Oh, and then,

521
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.590
Oh, there's more boxes. It's
this big it's okay. It's

522
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.260
all it is. They could
have, they could put it

523
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.890
in an envelope with like
a, they literally could have

524
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.860
sent me this thing in
a puffy envelope, a popping

525
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.490
envelope. Here we go. So
this is nice. This will

526
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.620
now get, this is the
called the one doc. It's

527
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.360
got one connector. Yep. And
it does power. It does

528
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:05.860
multiple one, two, three, four,
four USB threes and a

529
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:16.120
DVI. No. Pardon me? Six,
six USBs. Yep. Glorious. No

530
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.850
drivers either. This is real.
The old one used to

531
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.510
use display link technology, which
is, you know, VGA over

532
00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.830
USB. This is legit. So
look at that. Oh wow.

533
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:31.870
It's got display link. It's
got DVI. It's got, I

534
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:37.960
see four USB threes and
two USP twos all into

535
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.300
one. Yep. I love it.
I'm happy already. And no

536
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.360
drivers. The word on the
street is so that is

537
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.060
my gadget today. So what
I've been doing lately is

538
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.930
alternating between the surface pro
and the new third generation

539
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.930
X one carbon, which I'm
very happy with. Yeah. People

540
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.620
love their little Denovos I
you're not a fan. What

541
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.320
are you? What do you
never been? That guy. Yeah,

542
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:06.420
But they were the only
PC vendor. They kept growing

543
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:10.200
when it, when the market
was shrinking. So this was

544
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.270
me. Good stuff. This is
interesting. So I'm looking at

545
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:17.430
this thing. Here's the power
thing it came with, right?

546
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:23.620
Standard infinity. The infinity. Where's
the brick thing. No, no.

547
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.590
There's gotta be a brick
somewhere. Look for another box.

548
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:30.950
Nothing here. It'll be shipped
separately. Oh my goodness. I,

549
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.210
yeah, Amazon always sends me
those. What did you think

550
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.450
of our packaging? Didn't think
very much of your packaging.

551
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:40.890
Amazon. I'm from Portland. So
think about that. Here's the

552
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.930
brick. Here's the brick. Oh.
And the brick is bigger

553
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.540
than the dock also. Nice.
Yeah. I need it. I

554
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.760
need to learn about electronic
engineering and find out why

555
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.380
this brick needs to be
as big as this thing

556
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.100
is Hockey. I did that
show. That's a geek out.

557
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.830
Really is. What's in there.
Is it capacitors? What's going

558
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.070
on in there? It's the
switching power supply. It tolerates.

559
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.740
The Japanese invented it because
the Japanese have the worst

560
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.160
electrical system in the world.
They have two 20 on

561
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.040
the West coast and 110
on the East coast in

562
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.860
different frequencies. And so they
had to build these power

563
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.590
supplies to take anything. And
everybody uses them now because

564
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.810
you make one with a
different power plug and it

565
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.690
works everywhere. But it's bigger.
I did not know that.

566
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.430
No. I hope that we're
not going to hear from

567
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.770
people who are, are the,
both of the people who

568
00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:27.030
are watching that you just
disrespected all of Japan's power

569
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.930
grid. Japan's power grip is
a remarkable piece of work

570
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.360
that has a huge legacy
to it. And it's as

571
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.790
bad as I'm describing. So
I just want to make

572
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.850
sure direct any, anyone from
Japan, you can direct your

573
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:46.250
hate to Richard Campbell. I'm always
careful. I'm just saying, I

574
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.130
don't want to make declarative
statements about another power grid.

575
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.220
I will. On the other
hand, talk about Amazon's packaging

576
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.600
problem While you demonstrate in
front of us. Yes, exactly.

577
00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.470
You know, I feel much
better. I feel like I

578
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.120
got a weight off my
chest, even though you can't

579
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.440
hear it, there's a resonance,
but you didn't, you sound

580
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.930
better. You only spoke for
like six minutes, which means

581
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:13.090
I'm a lousy interviewer, but
your greatest sales conversations, we

582
00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:17.260
always have. I feel good.
I feel good about How

583
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.150
does it make you feel?
It's good. I feel great.

584
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.880
Oh my goodness. Well, what
else do we wanna talk

585
00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.430
about now remaining for you
Minutes? And the remaining few

586
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.740
minutes, I did a different
kind of geek out that

587
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.010
went out last Thursday. So,
you know, talk about that

588
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:33.790
electricity show. When do you
do the second one? Right?

589
00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.860
Like you, you take a
topic, you put together an

590
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.470
hour on it. You hammer
away on it. Now three

591
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:43.480
years later, when do I
revisit it? And so we

592
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.070
did this show that was
just like, well, here's an

593
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.900
update to electricity. Remember we
talked about this and this

594
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.490
here's the new news. And
then we talked a little

595
00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.800
bit about fusion power. And
the big thing on the

596
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.700
space side was space X,
Elon Musk, looking at you,

597
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.870
Damien Edwards, he asks, is
now allowed to fly payloads

598
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:02.440
for the air force. So
about a year ago, when

599
00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.260
a space X was getting
good enough that they were

600
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.650
going to be able to
fly military payloads, United space

601
00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:12.550
Alliance or United launch Alliance.
This is Boeing and Lockhart

602
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.750
working together, locked the air
force into a five year

603
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.950
like 37 payload deal. So
that space X couldn't play

604
00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.490
and, and Musk got little
annoyed. How how's he going

605
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:26.770
to solve that problem though?
He was going to go

606
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.380
to Supreme court and Sue
and dah, dah dah. And

607
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.010
this is the end of
it. Two years later, the

608
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.960
air force saying, Hey, this
is a pretty good rocket.

609
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.170
We're going to fly it.
And I'm hoping like this

610
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:42.700
is the big deal. This
has to encourage Lockhart to

611
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.510
start thinking more commercially, you
know, they only do these

612
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:51.370
military deals where it's time
plus materials. Like it's a

613
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.410
fixed bid. And if you
make all your deadlines that

614
00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:55.510
you make a profit, which
means there's no reason to

615
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.510
save money, right? Like don't
be efficient because they'll always

616
00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.820
pay your costs. As long
as you make the dates.

617
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.030
And for people who don't
know, Locke Mart is a

618
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:09.250
short shortened, Lockheed Martin, correct?
Yes. The makers of the

619
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:12.130
Atlas five, You know, Elon
Musk is a glue closest

620
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.080
thing. We have to Tony
stark and everyone says that,

621
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.600
but it's totally true. Yeah.
But yeah, I love the

622
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.440
guy waiting for the iron
man suit, But you guys

623
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.200
start working on it. I
did not enjoy his power

624
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.500
wall speech at all. Oh
yeah. I just feel like

625
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.910
too often we put the
leaders of companies up as

626
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:35.080
the speakers. They should just
hire somebody like Pros. Do

627
00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.730
it, let the pro speakers
do it. It's a different

628
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:40.410
job. So Elon Musk comes
out and cause very awkward,

629
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:45.330
very uncomfortable speech about, about
the power wall. Why don't

630
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:49.080
we hire, you know, Kevin Hart
or, you know, some, some

631
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.140
actor who is equally passionate
about that, you know, get,

632
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.860
get Matt Damon up there
to give a speech. I

633
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.170
watched that like, why, why
do we always feel the

634
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.050
need to put the VP
or whatever on stage talk

635
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.000
about something just because they
happen to lead the team.

636
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.570
Like Microsoft's got disease to
yeah. Yeah, we do. You

637
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:10.530
know, but I can't say
that. I can't, I mean,

638
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:17.010
I can think it, but
yeah. Yeah. But you know,

639
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.760
the point is higher up
higher talking yet. Yeah. I

640
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.220
think let the presenter do
the job, communicate the message

641
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.280
the most effective way possible
and then go build a

642
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.640
product. I would love to
see Kevin Hart talk about the

643
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.390
power of nice. That'd be
cool. Oh my goodness. Okay,

644
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:38.490
cool. So that's an episode,
isn't it. Again? We had

645
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.330
32 viewers. I'm happy about
that. Thank you for watching.

646
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.210
Fantastic. All right. I'm going
to do my exit with

647
00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:49.830
my voice. Okay. One octave
low. Alright. This has been

648
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:59.270
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again. <inaudible>.
