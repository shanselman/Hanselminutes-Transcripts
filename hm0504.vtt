00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.630
It's Hansel minutes, all weekly
discussion with web developer and

9
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.780
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number 504.

10
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.990
In this episode of Hansel
minutia. Scott talks again with

11
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:11.940
Richard Campbell about technology gadgets, industry
trends and new directions. Hi,

12
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.950
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

13
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.090
minutes. This is Hanselman Nooshin
number 17. Hansel minutia is

14
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.760
exactly what it sounds like.
It's a portmanteau with my

15
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.610
name and minutia. This is
random stuff that I talk

16
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.510
about with my friend Richard.
And this started when I

17
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.030
used to call Richard when
I had some rant or

18
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.180
some thing that bug the
heck out of me, and

19
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.280
I would talk to you
on the phone and we

20
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.680
would complain and somewhere around
halfway through it, you would

21
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.130
say, why don't we just
record these? Yeah. So these

22
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.560
are your kind of like
a regular, a regular guest

23
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.230
on the podcast and you
come on and you, we

24
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.110
rant about stuff, but also,
you know, you do some,

25
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.840
some angel investing and you're
a techie and a gadget

26
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.660
person. So we also talk
about the direction that the

27
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.690
world is going from a
technology perspective. I had done

28
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.890
this for like eight years.
Yeah, the podcast you are

29
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.360
probably episode 501. I think
I hit episode 500 last

30
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.020
week. Nice. Did you do
something so celebratory 500 is

31
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.530
on a round number. It's
pretty rough, maybe for five

32
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.610
12, actually a real round
round number. Yeah. So I

33
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.080
just came off a whole
lot of travel. Both my

34
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.580
soul is tired. It was
William Gibson. Who said that jet

35
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.910
lag is actually the effects
of your soul being pulled

36
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.870
out of your body from
jet travel. You just catch

37
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.380
us up. Yeah, it really
does. I've been going to

38
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.240
bed early and getting up
early. The thing that is

39
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.180
nice about doing jet travel
when you travel West is

40
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.270
you get the superpower of
being a morning person just

41
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.390
like that for free. So
I'm temporarily a morning person,

42
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.790
which kind of sucks. Cause
I don't like morning people.

43
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.800
So now, so now I
don't like myself and that

44
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.220
is problem. Cause I'm usually
like Now in this flurry

45
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.850
of my travel, I went
to South Africa and so I

46
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.930
flew for 12 hours and
didn't change time zones. And

47
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.680
that literally lets you know,
I went from Frankfurt to

48
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.370
South Africa and that really lets
you know how much air

49
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.630
travel sucks versus time zone
changes. It turns out air

50
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.610
travel sucks. I gotcha. So
you were moving West at

51
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.190
the same speed at which
the earth turns and ended

52
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.510
up arriving the same moment
you left. Well, 12 hours

53
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.870
later, but you know, no
excuses for why you're so

54
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.020
tired and cranky. Yeah. I'm
a mess. I'm a mess.

55
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.360
And my last travel was
North and South. So I've

56
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.190
got North South jetlag as
well. Right? It's awful. Oh,

57
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.330
speaking of feeling like crap
and actually I have measurable,

58
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.340
I can measure it now.
I, I went and I

59
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.390
got the band, the band
too. Did you get one

60
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.400
of these? I have not
yet, but it is on

61
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.740
a Christmas list for the
wife. So she wants one

62
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.140
For the, for the people
who are listening to the

63
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.930
podcast, you can go and
listen, look at the YouTube,

64
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.220
go to my youtube@youtube.com slash
<inaudible>. But the, the new

65
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.450
band is it's pretty nice.
It is actually much, much

66
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.520
more comfortable than the previous
one. It's interesting because it's

67
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.440
the first reaction you'll have.
When you look at the

68
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.860
new band is it looks
big and bulky what's happened

69
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.350
is they've taken the sides
of the band, which were

70
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.750
big and bulky on the
original band. And they moved

71
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.560
it to the bottom. This
part here, they moved the

72
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.030
heart monitor to here, right?
And while it looks bulky,

73
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.330
it is so much more
comfortable. The original band you

74
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.880
had to put on and
then suffer for a month

75
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.210
and then go, ah, and
then you'd eventually forget about

76
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.480
it. You get used to
it. There's sensors on the

77
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.880
back of it. And there's
also sensors of the class,

78
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.730
Right? There's a galvanic skin
response one at the top,

79
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.660
right? And then there is
the heart rate. One at

80
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.700
the bottom. The result is
the result is a much

81
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.940
more comfortable band. I got
one for my wife and

82
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.000
she immediately replaced her Fitbit
and she totally digs it.

83
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.690
What inspiration are you using?
Like what is it? God,

84
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.020
It's got like 12 or
13 things, but the ones

85
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.720
that are interesting, you know,
of course the pulse and

86
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.470
stuff like that. The excuse
me, the UV Ray one

87
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.540
is nice. If you're outside,
it'll tell you how long

88
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.140
until you'll burn. Which for
me is about 10 minutes.

89
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.640
But the, what I like
about it is of course

90
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.490
the web tile stuff that
I helped design so I

91
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.430
can make, I can make
little apps. So like here

92
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.370
is that one that says
webcam, webcam never does. The,

93
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.270
the one that says AP
is the associated press web

94
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.970
tile. And it actually shows
you the news. You can

95
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.980
go and make your own
web tiles. So even with

96
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.600
very little anyone who does
JavaScript or the tiny little

97
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.020
bit of HTML can make
a web tile nice. And

98
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.850
a web tile is just
a zip file with a

99
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.450
JavaScript file inside it. And
I made one to track

100
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.390
my blood sugar. You could
make one for any device

101
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.970
around your house or any
JavaScript or a blog, your

102
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.810
favorite blog or anything that
returns XML or Jason, that's

103
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.930
actually a visual designer you
can drag around and make.

104
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.030
So, so if you had
to build server anything at

105
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.300
all you could do in
10 minutes, make a, make

106
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.660
a tile, which is nice.
This one also has a

107
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.080
barrier of barometer, barometric pressure.
So it knows how far

108
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.210
upstairs you went. So it
counts flights of stairs. That's

109
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.810
a stupid trick too, but
Could it figure out if

110
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.200
you had a tornado coming?
You know, I don't know

111
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.120
it or maybe it just
think he went downstairs really

112
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.470
fast. I don't know. I
remember hanging around with a

113
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.490
meteorological geek at the Eglin
air force space outside of

114
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.150
Fort Walton, beach, Florida. And
he had, he kept on

115
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.320
his wall, the barometric readings
of a tornado going right

116
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.990
over the facility was in
and just, he was so

117
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.420
excited at the pressure drop.
Like it was, it got

118
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.240
higher and higher and higher
pressure. And suddenly this bang

119
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.980
is the thing went over
it and then came back

120
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.300
up again. That for a
meteorologist is a big deal.

121
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:29.380
Yeah. Excited about yet. Build
it. Your wife just didn't

122
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.940
care Was trying to feign
interest. Yeah. I don't really

123
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.220
care. Well, I was nicer
about it. I apologize. That

124
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.400
is fascinating. You don't need
your pity enthusiasm, honestly. It's

125
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.670
all good. It's all good.
Oh, one of the things

126
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.430
I got that I'm happy
about is I took my

127
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.550
surface and I replaced it.
I have a surface pro

128
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.690
three, you know, the service
roll forward, came out and

129
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.640
you know, I'm just, You
recently made your three worthless.

130
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.830
Yeah. I've literally just paid
this thing off. So I

131
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.680
don't want to, I don't
want to go buy something.

132
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.870
I just, I just paid
for this thing. Right. But

133
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.340
I got the keyboard, the
surface for keyboards. Great. So

134
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.800
here's, here's the deal like,
you know, I don't work

135
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.280
for Microsoft marketing, but if
I did, I would make

136
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.510
a surface pro three upgrade
pack. Right. And I would

137
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.950
sell the new keyboard and
the new pen and it

138
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.000
makes your surface pro three
better. They should just be

139
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.400
like a hundred dollar pack
or $150 pack and you

140
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.560
buy it, you drop it
in the new keyboard and

141
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.540
the new, the new pen,
everything is better like this.

142
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.270
It's a great device, like
to be clear, but once

143
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.970
you've used this keyboard, that's
it it's over. Like, you'll

144
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.200
never, the old keyboard will
offend you and the new

145
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.500
one with the fingerprints. Pretty
nice too, man. Yeah. That's

146
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.620
not, that's the surface pro
that's the surface, which we

147
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.320
will talk about. Yup. But
I'm just saying that I

148
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.440
can sit here with this
guy and then just put

149
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.810
the fingerprint and then I'm
logged in. Yeah. You know

150
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.660
what I mean? And that's
really nice. So I'm very,

151
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.750
very happy with that purchase
it. I would recommend it

152
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.490
to everyone. I did a
blog post about it recently.

153
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.050
Also Happy with your three
after the four came out,

154
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.700
you played with the book
and you're like, well, now

155
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.830
this thing's absolutely. So there's,
there's, there's a couple of

156
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.250
things there. There's the surface
pro four, which has a

157
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.760
better screen, smaller bezel spit,
faster speed. But it was

158
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.520
the keyboard. That was the
trick. Yeah. And when they

159
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.380
added the, the drivers for
the fingerprint for 'em To

160
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.220
enable the four keyboard on
the three I'm sold, I'm

161
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.590
good. I don't need a
forum. Happy. Nice. But you

162
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.500
went and bought a surface
book. So I actually ordered

163
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.230
this thing while the keynote
was still going on. In

164
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.270
fact, I had finished my
order before I do the

165
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.290
screen came off. Is it
the ultimate laptop that they

166
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.020
have? I promised you, it
is the nicest laptop I've

167
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.930
had and I've had some
pretty nice laptops. It is

168
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:02.660
clearly first-generation hardware. So I
have had three firmware updates

169
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.960
in a week and a
bit, a little twitchy here

170
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.870
and there, but there's so
much good about this machine.

171
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.100
Isn't it a little top
heavy at all. Yes. It

172
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.380
doesn't sit well on your
lap. It'll tend to lean

173
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.720
back. But I don't know.
He saw me laptop though.

174
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.910
I thought the whole point
of the argument against the

175
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.450
surface is the lack of
lap ability. Right? If I

176
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.780
can't expect that from a
surface book And it, it

177
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.520
depends on the lap. I
can use it there. I

178
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.400
just tend not to. I
never thought I'd use the

179
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.730
screen, pull off feature and
I've immediately used it. So

180
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.740
I was, we did a
hackathon this past weekend for

181
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.980
humanitarian toolbox. And so I
was walking around, checking in

182
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.890
with devs about race. You're
working on the key milestone

183
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.950
items and stuff and having
the screen loose. It just

184
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.350
made it really pleasant to
do. And they call that

185
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.530
clipboard mode. Right? You basically
used it as a clip.

186
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.000
There it is Put off
here. And again, the people

187
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.920
who are listening, I have
to go and check it

188
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.040
out at the YouTube. I
don't know if you could

189
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.610
see this picture, but that
is a photograph from the

190
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.060
discovery satellite, which is an
L one. So it's between

191
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.820
the earth and the sun.
And it actually, there's a

192
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.670
camera facing the planet all
the time, which is where

193
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.240
it's fully illuminated because it's
between the earth and the

194
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.100
sun. And they happened to
cat a picture as the

195
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.580
moon was transiting in front
of the earth. So that

196
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.070
is the dark side. That
I'm the real, that's real.

197
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.470
That is not a component.
You go to Snopes and

198
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.800
discover. This is not real.
I got it from NASA.

199
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.040
So it's the real thing.
Okay. So you're happy with

200
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.920
the laptop though. Hey, you
know, it's been a week

201
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.080
so far, so good. I've
moved everything over to it.

202
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.620
I spent the past week
on the road and I

203
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.230
carried my old laptop and
the new one. And now

204
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.660
I feel like I can
carry just the new one.

205
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.500
Although I ordered another gadget
I haven't picked up, which

206
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.700
is one of those ACEs,
10 ADP monitors that are

207
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:03.330
both powered and signaled by
USB three. So really it's

208
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.910
a 50 Screen weighs less
than a pound. Is that

209
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.940
palms with its own stand.
And you plugged into USB

210
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.480
three port extension monitor. And
what is this called? It's

211
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.060
a, it's an ASIS monitor.
I think it's still one

212
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:20.010
69, B 69 B monitor.
Huh? There was a thing

213
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:24.750
called MIMO monitors that you
could, you could use the

214
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:30.150
display link technology and you
could send HTMI over something

215
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.170
that you can send video
over, over USB three. Is

216
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.330
it really, it's probably doing
some compression though. Isn't it

217
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.850
It's USB three. It should
be able to do it.

218
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.540
It's only 10 80 P
so not talking nothing. Any

219
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:48.030
miracles, 1366 by seven 68.
So there's one model. It's

220
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.570
seven 68, one model. It's
10 80, but is a

221
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.540
10 and one that's a
10 80, but it's IPS,

222
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.950
Scandalous and interesting. And you
like this, this is a

223
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.900
good one. I just ordered,
I haven't gotten it yet,

224
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.240
but I'd seen one in
the wild and then went.

225
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.730
Yep. I want that. Well,
yeah, You know, they, they've

226
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.870
got that duet application, which
is, and there's another one

227
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.200
called air display. These are
using your iPad as a

228
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.030
second screen. Right? I A
duet for, I think it's

229
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.480
15 or 16 bucks. We'll
let you do that. But

230
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.580
one of them, I forgot.
I think it is duet

231
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.250
prefer, you know, some of
them do it wirelessly, which

232
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.180
is not good. But yeah,
this is a, it's a

233
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:36.180
duet display. It is wired
connection. So it's only your

234
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.020
computer to your iPad and
with a wired connection. So

235
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.290
basically to like you should
describing two screens and you

236
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.270
could be in a hotel
room somewhere with your laptop

237
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.280
and then boom, you've got
a second screen. Right? I've

238
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.130
been exploring that as a
possibility for my, my surface.

239
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.250
Well, I be carrying the
two laptops, which a bit

240
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.170
too heavy, but it's nice
to have a second screen.

241
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.550
So now I just want
to carry the screen. Interesting.

242
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.980
I don't know if the
I've already got an iPad

243
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.130
lying around. If you can
use that iPad screen, you

244
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.210
use it. Absolutely. Yeah. Then
of course you have to

245
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.430
deal with the DPI differences.
You move from screen to

246
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.930
screen though. I got to
look at that as well.

247
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.840
Okay. That's a good, I
got to put all this

248
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.640
in the show notes because
this is giving me food

249
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.220
for food. I thought I've
got the link. I'll send

250
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.060
it to you. Okay, cool.
I think the last time

251
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.300
we did this, had we
talked about Google changing its

252
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.600
name, the holding company name
to alphabet that was made.

253
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.370
Yeah, it was the last
of this. So I think

254
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.850
maybe it was just happening.
There was something like that.

255
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.530
No, that was the show.
We were going to talk

256
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.750
about Google IO. And then
you had that incident in

257
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.010
subway and that's all we
talked about Because there's always

258
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.700
some incident at subway that
gets me upset about stuff.

259
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:51.530
So w thoughts on alphabet,
They kind of it, then

260
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.350
it became a non, a
non issue. I was kind

261
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.020
of waiting to see if
there would be other things

262
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.190
after this, like another, like
Google's the G and then

263
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.380
is there another company that
is another letter? Have they

264
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.800
done that already? Have they
announced other companies Underneath it?

265
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.260
Not that I've seen. I
thought it was just a,

266
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.900
a legal game. They want
to play with ownership. They

267
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.210
want to be legal. The
sec rules. It's just a

268
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.120
way of a way of
packaging up the commentators differently

269
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.730
and hiding their reporting. So
they don't have to admit

270
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.600
that they're spending money on
asteroid mining. I thought it

271
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.030
was a nod. I thought
it was not a tax

272
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.070
thing. I thought it was
about focus like Google did

273
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:29.800
search and then they'd have
a health division and then

274
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.950
they'd have a asteroid mining
division or whatever. Like it

275
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:37.510
was about separate companies with
each individual focus. Well, I'd

276
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.640
hope so, but I guess
we'll see what actually happens.

277
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.690
Hey folks, I wanted to
take a moment to tell

278
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.710

and funny names for everyone

293
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.420
thinks that there's a new,
a new car company coming,

294
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.440
not Tesla, but one called
Farah day because apparently we're

295
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.990
going to name all of
our car companies after famous

296
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.830
electrical engineering people. I had
not heard this and okay,

297
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.710
so Faraday is go ahead
and start Googling around for

298
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.430
it. There, it sounds like
it's a shell company that

299
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.970
it's actually hidden hiding the
Apple car. That would make

300
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.840
sense. Yeah. And I don't
know if I want an

301
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.160
Apple car. Yeah. There's something
said about that, but you

302
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.680
know, making cars is way
harder than it looks. You

303
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.480
know, it's one of those
things we take for granted.

304
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.720
Why, why is that? Because
the suspension is so difficult.

305
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.210
It's all of the things,
you know, when I got

306
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.760
fascinated with cards as a
kid, you know, my teens,

307
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.190
you needed to maintain your
car. You had to constantly

308
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.100
tinker with it. Cars needed
caring, feeding. And then about

309
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.650
20 years ago. So they
just stopped. They got to

310
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.250
a level of manufacturing and
design where a, you couldn't

311
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.550
work on it. And B
they didn't break. You know,

312
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.320
they took them in once
or twice a year for

313
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.710
maintenance. And that was it.
And that represents a very

314
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.510
sophisticated level of, I don't
think other companies can get

315
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.280
into that easily. That's interesting.
Also it brings up the

316
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.690
question of about maintenance. I'm
realizing I turn a computer

317
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.550
on, I have a Mac
here and a PC that

318
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.740
I don't use very often
and I turn them both

319
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.610
on and it's been maybe
three months each of them.

320
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.220
And I'm not trying to
pick on Mac or PC.

321
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.720
Each of them required way
more app updating system, updating

322
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.870
windows, updating, updating than I
think is required after just

323
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.480
three months off the network.
Oh wow. Yeah. You know

324
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.720
what I mean? That's, that's
a lot to ask. Does

325
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.670
the same thing happen if
I parked the car at

326
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.560
longterm parking, is it going
to just go and get

327
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.930
all the different updates and
firmwares and stuff? You know,

328
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.050
even a modestly old car,
like an early two thousands

329
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:38.000
Prius still has to get
firmware updates. Yeah. And, but

330
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.370
just because you parked the
car, doesn't mean it's actually

331
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.890
off like is the real
issue here that your machines

332
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.260
are actually off. They should
be in a standby mode,

333
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.140
picking up their updates on
their own time. Not, you

334
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.100
know, the sin is interrupting
you that when you turn

335
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.470
that machine on, because you
needed to use it right.

336
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.600
Then it's like, Oh wait,
I have things to do

337
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.020
before I can serve you.
That's a good point. And

338
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.490
interestingly enough, you know, windows
has done a decent job

339
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.010
about that lately. They've been,
they've been adding this idea

340
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.610
of, I will do the
install when you're not busy.

341
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.100
Right. You know, and they'll
schedule, they'll let you schedule

342
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.140
it or they'll just notice
that you're not busy. So

343
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.200
I have not with windows
10 had a time when,

344
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.920
when I have been interrupted
by the update, it just

345
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.830
has been happening. But from
a car perspective, how can

346
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.450
the car not know that
you're going to jump in

347
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.060
like right now and race
to the hospital? No, I

348
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.840
think there's a probability thing
too. Yeah. You know, you're

349
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.880
less likely in the wee
hours of the morning. Maybe

350
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.260
it's got some history to
you, so it knows what

351
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.600
you tend to do, but
even if it is updating,

352
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.840
why would you stop from
driving? You know, my new

353
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.440
Infiniti and I've had a
few, has a very slow

354
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.800
boot time you're calling boots
up. Oh yeah. And it's

355
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.490
visible to different screens. They
start at different times. They

356
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.120
say loading apps, you drive
it while it's booting. Absolutely.

357
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.940
And more importantly, when you
flip it and reverse the

358
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.960
reverse camera lights up right
away, the most annoying part

359
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.650
of that behavior is if
you've left the radio on,

360
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.440
when you parked the car,
it will be on when

361
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.350
you start the car and
you can't turn it off

362
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.980
and it's it down. Is
it still So it's loud

363
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.020
and screaming at you? Well,
you know, Know how, when

364
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.270
you come home, you've been
rocketed out on a long

365
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.790
drive home, you know, I'm
coming back from Redmond. So

366
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.770
the music's loud. And then
you get in the car

367
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.930
the next morning, turn it
on. And you're like, ah,

368
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.230
and there's other, you can
do soft buttons. It's all

369
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.010
soft buttons. So now I've
been the reflex of, part

370
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.200
of me turned, the car
off is turn the radio

371
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:38.930
off. I'm accommodating my car,
The internet of things. Right.

372
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.000
We talked a little bit
about this before the idea

373
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.800
of all the different things
we have to update firmware

374
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.860
for. Yes. I've, I've got
these light bulbs that still

375
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.800
have old from where, because
it's just, now, it's now

376
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.060
it's just tedious and they're
not automatically updating themselves. And

377
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.310
I saw a guy on,
on Facebook recently was saying

378
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.470
that he had to put
a firmware update on his,

379
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.010
on his fridge where he's
rebooting his refrigerator in some

380
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.120
way. But the concerning part
is that these companies that

381
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.300
are making all of these
internet of things, the internet

382
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.170
of crap is that they,
they're not always going to

383
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.290
be around, you know, like
some of these light bulbs

384
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.490
that I've got, I don't
even know what the company

385
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.990
is around anymore. You know,
like it was a kid,

386
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.360
But that's no different than
Osborn or Columbia or, you

387
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.900
know, companies fail. But those
aren't being used anymore by

388
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.690
like by the masses. Right?
Like if what I'm saying

389
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.900
is that it's conceivable that
millions of internet of thing,

390
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.240
items could be sold and
the company could still fail

391
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.330
and then they are all
a liability. Yes. Right. They're

392
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.180
all just floating out there,
providing a bridge into my

393
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.680
house. Yep. A path of
vulnerability without a doubt, just

394
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.920
like that access point that
the subway had. Right. And

395
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.810
you think maybe the company
still exists, but they're not

396
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.030
going up there yet. Yeah.
Well, the other thing that's

397
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.270
happening is that there are
products that are having internet

398
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.450
capabilities added to them by
companies that it is the

399
00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.120
internet. Part of the product
is not their, their, their,

400
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.010
their expertise. Right. Core skillset.
I saw this brilliant, a

401
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:12.390
young woman named Marina. Sandvik
at the Trondheim developers conference

402
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.240
a couple of weeks ago.
And she and her team

403
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.500
had hacked into a sniper
rifle that the company had

404
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.980
added wifi to. Right. Like
I'm not, I'm not a

405
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.020
big a gun person, but
you know, I'm sure it's

406
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.460
a lovely guns sniper. It
also has this ability to

407
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.570
identify targets and then fire.
And they basically hacked into

408
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.760
it and lied to it
about what the target was.

409
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.300
Nice. No, it's not a
self shooting weapon, but it

410
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.430
is a, you know, I
want to point at that

411
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.220
thing. And then it will
decide about wind speed and

412
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.080
all this stuff, and then
do the adjustments and they

413
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.630
just lied to it so
they can point it at

414
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.620
other stuff. And the company
that made this weapon is

415
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.460
not particularly interested in fixing
it, which kind of gets

416
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.650
to my point that they
probably shouldn't have added wifi

417
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.140
to it because, you know,
security, hardening and firmware and

418
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.810
all that kind of stuff
was not there. Not only

419
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.550
that was not their, their
expertise, then their principle way

420
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.610
of, of being, and then
also what who's going to

421
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.340
update the firmware on their
gun. Right. Well, you know,

422
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.250
I think you're fairly motivated
to do that, but the

423
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.740
bigger thing is why did
they add wifi? Like they're

424
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.260
not committing to the full
requirement. It's not just a

425
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.050
check box. So you're putting
it in. It takes some

426
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.590
care of feeding. No. Yeah,
yeah, Totally. Right. Then you

427
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:32.250
needed an entire organization behind
it too, to manage that

428
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.980
thing. Like when you, when
your company enters the world

429
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.050
of the internet of things,
by adding new stuff, if

430
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.040
it's just one person, right.
These, these products always seem

431
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.760
to, to fail. They always
seem to include not enough.

432
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.650
Like for example, when people
add wifi to different things,

433
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.110
often you'll go and look
at their open source licenses

434
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.210
and you'll see that they
use open source software, but

435
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.460
then they don't include the
license or text. They don't,

436
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.500
they don't include the list
of the software that they,

437
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.180
that they shipped with the
thing. So then you see

438
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.520
all these people complaining like
this doesn't, this violates the

439
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.430
GPL, or they haven't really
released the source or whatever.

440
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.310
And it's just this kind
of laissez Faire attitude about,

441
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.670
about the internet of things
is that it's really starting

442
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.200
to bug me. It makes
me afraid to want to

443
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.240
plug any of these things
in, not that I'm gonna

444
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.160
plug a sniper rifle into
my house, but light bulbs,

445
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.120
at least. Yeah. In a
related note this past weekend,

446
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:28.250
the Atlantic magazine put out
an article called programmers, stop

447
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.280
calling yourselves engineers. Ooh, that's
a controversial. And it's an

448
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.180
indictment of, this is what
engineering discipline looks like. And

449
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.640
I know you guys are
using the title, but you

450
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.890
haven't earned it. Programmers, stop
calling yourself engineers. It undermines

451
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.790
a long tradition of designing
in Brazil, building infrastructure in

452
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:58.850
the public interest. Yikes. Well,
I can't disagree with the

453
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.510
argument authors making well, I
mean, it is a, it

454
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.900
is a valid argument and
actually I've in the middle,

455
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.560
I'm in the middle of
writing a blog post right

456
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.640
now that talks about my
concern that we have outsourced

457
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.140
QA to the end user
because the updates cycle in

458
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:19.820
the cloud enables us to
update most stuff much quicker.

459
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.430
So that means we can
put sloppy things out, but

460
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.230
that only works, you know,
in the old days, of

461
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.880
course you work really hard
for two years and you

462
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.130
put out a really solid
first release and it now

463
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.020
like seems everything is version
0.9, you know, and permanent

464
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.110
betas. Yeah. We are in
a state of PERMA beta.

465
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.870
And I don't like it
because I just, you know,

466
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.810
you know how, when you're
at a party or a

467
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.610
cocktail party and you hear
like, I don't want to

468
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.520
go to cocktail parties you're
somewhere. And there's that, that

469
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.130
moment of calm when everyone
stops their sentence at the

470
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.720
same time, you know? And
it's just like, Oh, and

471
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.540
you know how it's rare,
right. This has been happening

472
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.460
my entire life, but it's
still rare that I notice

473
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.770
it. Okay. It's a thing
that happens in software. So

474
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.440
there's a moment where windows
10 was released and, and

475
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.830
my browser was stable and
window. And, you know, in

476
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:13.190
the office to 2016 was
stable and there was silence

477
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.280
for a moment where everything
worked for about a week.

478
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.660
And then, and then all
the betas started up again.

479
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.200
And then it was like,
you know, iOS nine, everything

480
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.230
was great. Everything was fine.
And then, you know, I

481
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.420
just have to have the
taco emojis. So I put

482
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.060
the beta of 9.1 and
then everything just goes to

483
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.130
heck. Yup. And you'd think
with standards like iMac and

484
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.010
whatnot that, you know, in
Cal dev, I be able

485
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.680
to talk to my Gmail,
but even now I'm getting

486
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.160
errors on iOS nine because
I can't stand like, well,

487
00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.370
it's just, it's very frustrating.
I, I I've complained about

488
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.310
this before, but I'm starting
to realize that if the

489
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.170
outsourcing of QA is one
of the larger problems, that's

490
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.680
bugging me, Well, this is,
this is the indictment of

491
00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.830
the engineering thing, right? Like
if you ran around calling

492
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.760
yourself a doctor and trying
to do doctorate type things,

493
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.650
you're going to get charged.
Like it's a crime. We

494
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:14.300
put engineer in our title,
we talk about software engineering

495
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.400
groups and we, and in
real engineering, civil engineering, you

496
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.380
know, this may be one
engineer in that entire group.

497
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.710
That's an actual engineer, that's
a PE a practicing engineer

498
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.400
that's certified that, that maintains
all the rules and is

499
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.010
beholden to the public, not
to his company, but to

500
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.160
the public, to the certifying
body. Yeah. I mean, I

501
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.440
have to, I'm looking at
this Atlantic article right here,

502
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.050
and it's talking about skyscrapers
and bridges and power plants

503
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.720
and elevators, you know, and
the thing about them is

504
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.420
that there are professional standards
and expectations, and you put

505
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.810
your life in, you know,
in the hands of the

506
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.930
engineers that create this kind
of stuff. And that's the

507
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.360
difference between the kind of
people who make websites. I

508
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.670
like, like I do. And
the kind of people who

509
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:04.070
make, you know, actual baby
monitors that run neonatal wards

510
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:07.010
and medical software that kind
of has to work and

511
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.340
Literally your software, like you
can kill somebody with an

512
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:17.000
elevator pretty easily. We'll patch
that up. We all have

513
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.180
the great stories of, you
know, the software failed and

514
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.100
people are endangered because of
it. It was really interesting

515
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.420
article here, civil engineering, mechanical
engineering, aerospace engineering chemicals. These

516
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.790
are all engineerings. They are
a pretty noble. And this,

517
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:39.200
this article is basically implying
that, that software engineers for

518
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.180
the most part. And I
think when they say software

519
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.770
engineers, they're talking about, you
know, the mainframe main mainstream

520
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.850
consumer type applications, not necessarily
people that are working on

521
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.190
actual control systems and stuff.
I assume that there must

522
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.040
be some, like when I
was in working in banking,

523
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.650
like we took quality quite
seriously. We didn't whip out

524
00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.630
a new app, a new
version of the banking software.

525
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.020
Yeah. But we both went
through 99 and it was

526
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.170
all hands on drag to
try and survive the 2000

527
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.500
rollover. Right. Yeah. Well, and
we worked on a lot

528
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.770
of stuff really fast. The
testing was sort of post

529
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.650
facto. I mean, we got
through it. I figured the

530
00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.170
2000 was going to be
the point at which real

531
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.140
regulation hit the software industry.
We were gonna, we were

532
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.970
to crush the world with
the Y two K bug.

533
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.790
And that was going to
be yet Stuff that really

534
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.610
mattered though in Y two
K was getting fixed, you

535
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.730
know, everything got fixed and
it was being fixed quietly

536
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.800
because it was infrastructure stuff.
And the stuff that did

537
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.680
break like alarm clocks and
stuff didn't matter. It didn't

538
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.770
really matter Some survived. I
worked on that. I think

539
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.850
he did too. And I
know folks that worked on

540
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.200
other utility aspects, water and
electricity and so forth, we

541
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.020
did have to fix it.
I've just every real engineering

542
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:57.220
discipline has sort of Seminole
moments, you know, in Canada,

543
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.100
they talk about this bridge
collapse that happened in 1900.

544
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.710
And that supposedly made rings
out of the iron from

545
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.770
that collapsed bridge that every
engineer wears as part of

546
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.550
their oath saying never again
is going to be our,

547
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.510
our iron rain moment for
software. Cause it's clearly coming.

548
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.690
I was watching minority report,
which is really great, not

549
00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.910
the movie, but the TV
show. It's a great TV

550
00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.040
show and the tragedy is
it probably won't be renewed,

551
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:26.880
but it's, it's really, really
good. Interesting. It's really good.

552
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.110
And it's good because it
talks about, because it's set

553
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:35.250
in 2065 and they talk
about the past, like it

554
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.650
was like the actual past,
and then we're all carried

555
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.050
forward by it. And it's
really interesting on an episode

556
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.770
I was watching yesterday, two
of these hackers were talking

557
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.870
and one of them was
like, you know, we all

558
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.330
thought it was going to
change after 2035, when like

559
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.170
everyone's email became public. You
know, that was the hack

560
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.220
everyone's email became public. And
they said, you know, 15 million

561
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.850
suicides happened because of that
because of every, every single

562
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.910
person on the planet, email
became public. And that's when

563
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.480
whatever cryptos scenario, you know,
that's when we encrypted the

564
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.080
internet. Right. And when, when,
when you're listening to that

565
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.790
and I was listening to
that going, wow, I could

566
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:15.960
totally see that happening. You
know, like some Epic hack,

567
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:22.170
you know, some Snowden, two
plus two powers, Epic consumer

568
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.250
level hack, you know, like
everyone's Facebook becomes public or

569
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.500
whatever, whatever it is. Would
that be like you said,

570
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.480
the iron ring moment that
would flip it. I don't

571
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.430
know. I don't know what
it's going to take, but

572
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:36.120
we need to become an
engineering discipline. We are eating

573
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:42.550
the world and we're doing
it very haphazardly Very wise,

574
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.590
very wise, very wise. We're
coming up on 30 minutes.

575
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.220
What else do we have
Did the humanitarian toolbox hackathon

576
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.640
this past weekend on the
Microsoft property? It was at

577
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.310
the garage and Billy 27.
What did you all build?

578
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.280
People can go in and
Google for humanitarian toolbox and

579
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.590
learn about the software that
you make to help the

580
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.810
red cross and disaster recovery.
So we were working on

581
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.870
the white cross project project
called already. We're actually getting

582
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.150
to the middle viable product.
We're ready to put it

583
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.840
in the field this month.
Seriously. Yeah, we're there. Oh,

584
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.460
congratulations. It was a really
great sprint, like a great

585
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.880
group, some MVPs, a couple
of RDS and a bunch

586
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.310
of regular developers that just
were interested in the project.

587
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.800
And we all came together
and, and we, we hauled,

588
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.350
we Tightening some screws and
getting it ready for release.

589
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.810
Yeah. And had a couple
of red cross people there.

590
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.420
So they're, they're looking at
taking it out. And the

591
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.670
goal is, this is the
first scenario. Cause this app

592
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.250
could do a lot of
different things is putting smoke

593
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:42.500
detectors into homes. Don't have
them. So finding qualified installers,

594
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.560
that'll donate their time and
homes that need them and

595
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.590
just using some geolocation to
coordinate them so that each

596
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.620
installer, you know, the one
thing red cross has taught

597
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.500
me is just get somebody
to volunteer. Doesn't mean you

598
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.430
should waste their time, right.
Value the time available. So

599
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.840
here's a qualified installer. And
if we do everything all

600
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.280
by hand, maybe you'll get
a couple of smoke detectors

601
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.890
installed at a day. But
if I get the software

602
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:10.340
right, maybe six, eight, 10
in a day, like this

603
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.270
is simply saving lives. Very
cool. And this is people

604
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:15.800
can go and see this
code. It's all up on

605
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:22.340
GitHub, github.com/hd box slash already.
Okay. And of course, if

606
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.500
they go in and they
Google for him, a humanitarian

607
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.300
toolbox, they'll find it. And
then from there they can

608
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.370
also find the code HD
box. So to, or give

609
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:34.400
you can't spell humanitarian, you're
saying HT box Vox, humanitarian

610
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.420
toolbox box. Cool. Well, thank
you very much. Richard Campbell for

611
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.820
chatting with me. My pleasure,
sir. Always fun. This has

612
00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.310
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

613
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.910
next week.
