00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.140
In this episode, Scott talks
with Zed Shaw about learning

9
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.140
to code the hard way
Enhancement. This is another episode

10
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.390
of Hansel minutes, and I'm
talking with Zed Shaw. He's

11
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.520
the author of the Mongo
web server. And most recently

12
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.890
the creator of the learn
to code the hard way

13
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.820
series. You can learn C
Python, Ruby rejects, SQL command

14
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.370
line interfaces. And lots more.
Thanks for talking to me

15
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.060
today, Zen. Yeah, not a
problem. You're a, you're a

16
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.390
bit of a legend from
an opinionated perspective. You have

17
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.180
opinions that are very, very
strong. And I feel like

18
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.660
the, the learn to code
the hard way is such

19
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.030
a, an embodiment of your
opinion. You know what I

20
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.710
mean? It's just kind of
like, just suck it up

21
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.500
and let's get to the
hard stuff. I really liked

22
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.310
that. Like where does that
come from inside you? Yeah,

23
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.590
I would say that's actually
true. I'd say that for

24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.980
the most part. I don't
know. I guess it's just

25
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.570
from my background. I mean,
I was, I was in

26
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.840
the army. I've always just
been told that the way

27
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.270
to learn stuff is to
sit down and actually power

28
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.210
through it and learn it
and you know, and actually

29
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.940
do it. And there's not
really any shortcuts. And actually

30
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.950
that's one of the things
I try to show people

31
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.130
is that the joy of
learning something is struggling with

32
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.260
it and conquering it and
kind of getting through it.

33
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.820
And that it's not supposed
to be easy. Like if

34
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.390
it's easy, then what's the
point. Right? And so I

35
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.430
think in a lot of
ways, the way I teach

36
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.290
sort of reflects that. Although
I have to sort of

37
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.850
like demilitarize it for people,
but I would say probably

38
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.900
the biggest influence would be
military experience, martial arts, things

39
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.110
like that. And that's why
it's like that. So those

40
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.290
are all very things that
emphasize discipline. Do you think

41
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.200
that discipline is something that's
like kind of sadly lacking

42
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.130
from our industry? I think
discipline is a sadly lacking

43
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.540
from education in general. I
think, especially in American education

44
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.020
systems, I think it got
a bad rap it's associated

45
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.020
with the negative kind of
discipline, like corporal punishment, rote

46
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.130
memorization. And, but I also
think at some point it

47
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.330
got sort of like attributed
to a lack of creativity

48
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.760
by a bunch of people
who really kind of don't

49
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.950
know how creativity is is
done. So I just, even,

50
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.830
I think kids these days
aren't taught discipline. I think

51
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.640
they aren't taught self discipline,
which is the key. And

52
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.860
that's actually just kind of
pervasive now. I'm not sure

53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.980
why I have some theories.
I think the rise of

54
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.260
constructivism and education and education
departments, all sorts of things,

55
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.620
but in general, yeah, I
think disciplines missing and needed.

56
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.890
It seems a little bit
to me and I'm raising

57
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.510
two little boys. I have
a six year old and

58
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.660
eight year old that their
expectation of how long it

59
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.880
takes to learn something relates
directly to how long it

60
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.620
takes to like find something
out. So I'll ask a

61
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.960
question and like, you know,
why is the sky blue?

62
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.610
And when I was a
kid, we would go and

63
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.640
we get the encyclopedia Britannica
and you know, we'd go

64
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.430
and get, you know, the
volume number 19 and look

65
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.530
it up and try to
figure that out a while.

66
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.270
My six year is like,
well, we should Google that.

67
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.200
So like even acquiring basic
bits of facts and stuff

68
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.560
is too easy. Almost like
there's no challenge. Maybe there

69
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.510
should be. Maybe when you
Google for something, there should

70
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.270
be like a challenge that
you have to accomplish first,

71
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.450
a barrier. You have to
do 10 pushups, do something

72
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.640
10 pushups to make sure
that the connect sees you

73
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.170
do the pushups. And then
we will allow you to

74
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.780
unlock the secrets of why
the sky is blue. So,

75
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.050
so from that perspective, they're
not interested in putting in

76
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.710
the work it takes to
become good at something. It

77
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.390
seems. Yeah. I think, I
think actually programmers are very

78
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.790
guilty of this too. Like
they have this tendency to,

79
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.270
once they read about a
thing, they assume they know

80
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.850
it and can do it
and they don't ever take

81
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.400
that next step of, Oh,
and now I'm going to

82
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.430
actually do a bunch of
these things. So they might

83
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.800
read about music and then
say, I can play an

84
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.750
instrument. And you're like, no,
you don't know anything about

85
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.200
music. You actually have to
practice. It's hard. And I

86
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.410
think that's the key is
if it's just arbitrary facts

87
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.970
and things, you can look
up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's

88
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.920
no point in memorizing that,
but there are a set

89
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.770
of skills and a set
of things that people want

90
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.090
to do and learn how
to do and be good

91
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.650
at that require practice and
repetition and application. And I

92
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.500
don't think you get that
and in like, especially the

93
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.220
internet culture program or culture,
things like that. Yeah. Yeah.

94
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.050
And it's the direct, like
people are just used to

95
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.230
getting stuff right away. They,
they assume that tidbit of

96
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.180
info I got from Google
is, you know, I mean

97
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.520
that, that was so quick.
And now what you get

98
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.580
is they don't want to
invest the time and learning

99
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.510
it and going through the
struggle. Yeah. I'm working on

100
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.880
an iOS app right now
with a, with a web

101
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.210
component that's gonna involve pairing,
you know, kind of like

102
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.370
pairing this app to this
website so that they all

103
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.760
talk to each other. And
the discussions that I'm having

104
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.100
with my partner are basically
like, Oh no, that, that

105
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.620
extra click could mean 10%
of our users are going

106
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.200
to leave at that point.
Like if they can't download

107
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.810
it and within two minutes
or three clicks and we

108
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.850
just like made those numbers
up, you know, they're going

109
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.610
to abandon it completely. And
just like really, it's an

110
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.690
amazing app. And you're saying
that there's all these UX

111
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.580
mistakes that we could potentially
make. And he's imagining 100%

112
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.920
of people show up. They
have to do this. Boom,

113
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.780
okay. You've lost half of
them, you know, like really,

114
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.270
really they downloaded it. We
lost half of them. They

115
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.750
want to do it. We
have such low expectations of

116
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.610
our users. We're just like,
yeah, they're not going to

117
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.090
be interested in, you know,
clicking. That's such a champion

118
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.310
now. Thanks. So we're actually
going to be using QR

119
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.410
codes. I know that the
answer to is, should you

120
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.470
use a QR code is
always no, but basically it's

121
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.450
like, okay, they can either
see this goo it and

122
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.370
type this good. Or they
could, you know, what's the

123
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.500
easiest way we can get
this, glue it into this

124
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.140
device. And it's just like,
gosh, I feel like the

125
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.480
onboarding process is completely overshadowing
the awesomeness on the other

126
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.640
side. And I feel the
same way about programming, like

127
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.790
the on we're all, we're
focused so much on onboarding

128
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.250
people into development and they're
completely missing. Why am I

129
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.410
doing this? Yeah. I also
think there's a slight, a

130
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.510
slightly odd American cultural component
where for the longest time,

131
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.580
like people who are nerds
and geeks and programmers are

132
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.800
sort of like assumed to
kind of not be doing

133
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.410
anything important. Right? Like it
was like a hobby. Like

134
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.700
a lot of people just
got paid to do their

135
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.800
hobby. That's how I looked
at it. And it's only

136
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.290
really recently that people are
like, Oh wow, you can

137
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.420
actually be filthy rich. If
you do this and you

138
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.780
become Mark Zuckerberg or whatever.
And so there's this a

139
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.340
huge cultural like debt, I
guess you would call it

140
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.650
of people used to think
being a programmer was just,

141
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.440
Oh, well that's easy. But
nobody really bothered to figure

142
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.180
out how to do it.
And whether it was easily

143
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.360
easy, they just thought you
were just like some strange

144
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.190
little nerd who liked to
work with a computer. So

145
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.610
obviously it must be easy
and now people are into

146
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.740
it. And they're sort of
realizing that, Oh, it's way

147
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.800
more difficult than that. It
takes you years to be

148
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.670
good at it. And that's
probably a big reason why

149
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.670
you're seeing this. Like you're
seeing people come to programming

150
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.390
from a background of not
understanding it at all, but

151
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.270
also sort of like a
general low thing of nerd

152
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.840
culture within a large sections
of society and they come

153
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.940
to it and then they
go, Oh, well this is

154
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.970
actually more difficult than I
thought it was. And I

155
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.980
mean, I'm sort of waiting
for it to be too.

156
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.680
I'm hoping my books give
people some respect for what

157
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.750
I do. I think that's
a big part of it,

158
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.960
but you might actually, and
actually you do see some

159
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.060
backlash. You see people who
are, who are like, Oh,

160
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.890
why should my kids learn
how to be nerds? That's

161
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.670
so stupid. And I think
that's one of the negative

162
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.770
things you try to fight.
Yeah. When I was coming

163
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.520
up, being a nerd was
a bad thing and I

164
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.430
don't understand why that is.
I mean, being smart should

165
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.980
not be looked down upon.
I saw in a newspaper

166
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.860
today that Neil deGrasse Tyson
is bringing back the cosmos

167
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.860
series. He's going to bring
back cosmos that Carl Sagan

168
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.000
did because he said that
being smart and knowing these

169
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.500
things, as somebody looked down
upon, he wants to try

170
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.050
to make it fun again.
When you, when you were

171
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.450
thinking about like the boy,
which was the first one,

172
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.250
what was the first learn
to code? The hard way

173
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.070
was Python, right? Yeah. It
was Python. And I had

174
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.160
actually written that for a
friend who wanted to learn

175
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.690
and she couldn't find any
other books. So I just

176
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.740
started like started hacking on
it while was watching TV

177
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.420
pretty much Well, but why,
why learn the hard way?

178
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.120
Why not learn Python in
24 hours? Surely there must

179
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.210
have been a book like
that for your friend. Yeah.

180
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.040
And that was the thing
is she tried those and

181
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.190
you know, I actually probably
could think that if someone

182
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.560
wanted to spend the whole
24 hours and sit down

183
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.450
and like do it for
24 hours straight, they might

184
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.770
be able to get through
a large portion of the

185
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:19.820
book, but it does, it
does like SAP, your intelligence

186
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.560
and your brain just stops
working. So I don't know

187
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.740
how useful it is, but
I think it's actually just,

188
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.410
it's more like how the
subjects were taught by all

189
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.520
these other books didn't work
for very beginners. So I

190
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.470
think it was, they were
books were either written for

191
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.650
little kids. And so they
were kind of useless or

192
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.110
they were written for adult
programmers, even if they said

193
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.790
it was for beginners, they
were totally written for a

194
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.260
programmer. And they just assumed
tons of information that, that

195
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.780
you just wouldn't have. And
so, because I had a

196
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.600
specific person in mind while
I was writing it and

197
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.630
I sort of had experience
from, I had just completed

198
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.270
a music school. So I
had, like, I had suffered

199
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.400
through trying to learn to
play guitar at like, you

200
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.100
know, my late thirties. So
I knew a lot about

201
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.680
how adult learning was like,
what would work? And I

202
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.810
was just like, I'm like,
yeah, you know, what you

203
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.520
need to do is you
need to have it like

204
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.550
the bare minimum, just start.
I need to just do

205
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.100
a lot of practice. And
so you can get up

206
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.160
until these words don't seem
so weird. I'm in the

207
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.170
same way that you need
one play guitar, you got

208
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.230
to do the same thing,
you know, and that was

209
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.230
the primary difference. It was
just that I thought as

210
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.170
an adult learner, it doesn't
come quickly to you. Languages

211
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.590
don't come quick, quick to
you. So wrote sort of

212
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.490
practice and then applying it
is a better way. And

213
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.480
it turned out to be
right. Do you think that

214
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.700
that means that one should
be an adult? I mean,

215
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.860
should I stick a 12
year old on learn Python

216
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.750
the hard way or, I
mean, what age is appropriate?

217
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.740
Well, a lot of the
theory behind it later, I

218
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.720
sort of backed into the
theory was based on the

219
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.620
direct instruction school of teaching.
And I think what happened

220
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.500
is because I had written
it for an adult who

221
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.690
was trying to learn it
and was busy say, right,

222
00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.000
right. I think that made
it easy enough that just

223
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.100
about anybody can go through
it. So there are people

224
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.960
who don't even read English
very well, go through it.

225
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.300
Kids go through it just
about everyone does. It's sort

226
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.240
of like I set my
bar of the learner so

227
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.090
low, no offense to my
friend, but I set the

228
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.460
bar super low. And so
that meant that a lot

229
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.030
of other people could actually
finish it. And then also

230
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.190
I think it fits well
with kids, from what I've

231
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.920
seen, because it's very tiny
chunks. So it's hard for

232
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.920
them to get distracted by
it or they, you know,

233
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.920
to get overwhelmed by it.
It's like teeny tiny little

234
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.500
chunks. She knew me like
little hour, which I think

235
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.630
seems to work better when
you're, you know, when you're

236
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.870
younger, but also if you're
in a busy adult, But

237
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.780
not direct instruction as a
concept is something that's not,

238
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.210
not new. It was came
up in the sixties, actually

239
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.450
the university of Oregon and
it's it's characteristic is this

240
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.140
idea that there's the systematic
go, you know, scripted lesson

241
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.900
plans, you go, boom, boom,
boom, boom. That, that is

242
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.580
that the discipline. And how
is that different than what

243
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.660
you, you, the word rote
learning. How do you describe

244
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.750
your technique and that the
kind of idea behind direct

245
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.070
instruction versus just what we
call rote learning? Yeah. I

246
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:06.690
think the thing with direct
instruction is that they're more

247
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.060
using these scripts to make
sure that things are taught

248
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.860
consistently and included in direct
instruction is also a application

249
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.730
of it. And they also
have very solid statistics and

250
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.120
analysis that show like, well,
this doesn't work for later

251
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.980
learning, you know, like it
doesn't work as well when

252
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.870
you're trying to teach creative
art, but it wouldn't work

253
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.430
well if you're trying to
teach how to draw circles,

254
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.140
right? So applying math to
solving physics problems, this doesn't

255
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.080
work, but learning the basics
of algebra or the basics

256
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.050
of trigonometry, this totally works.
And I think I have

257
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.750
a similar approach within my
book and that I tell

258
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.610
people if you're a programmer,
like in the very beginning,

259
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.910
this book will drive you
nuts. Like it's so annoying

260
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.960
because yeah, if you're a
programmer, this is like the

261
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.610
worst way to learn a
programming language. But if you're

262
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:55.470
not a programmer that slow,
methodical, scripted way of applying

263
00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:00.150
it and doing the proper
exercises works better. That's also

264
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.490
why my book sort of
stops at the point when

265
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.740
you would go and get
creative. Cause it doesn't really

266
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.890
work the road kind of
repetition doesn't really help you

267
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.920
in creative activities. Right. It
just helps you learn the

268
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.350
tools you need to then
apply them. Yeah. It felt

269
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.080
like, like you're, I've done
both the Python one and

270
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.080
the C one. And it
felt like when I kind

271
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.620
of ended and I was
like, where's part two, like,

272
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.840
like it kind of left
me like, Oh, I could

273
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.270
do input. I could do
a basic game. Whereas the

274
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.910
larger architectural context. And I
was like, Oh, well that,

275
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.500
wasn't the point now. Was
it? You know what I

276
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.290
mean? Right. Yeah. It's, it's
mostly, I tell people like,

277
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.660
it gives you your Brown
belt. Like it teaches you

278
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.940
all the kicks in the
punches and you know the

279
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.980
stuff, but now you gotta
go work and use it

280
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.440
to get your black belt.
Right. And then I point

281
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.750
people at loads of other
resources for doing that. Cause

282
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.050
honestly what I see with
all the other books out

283
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.520
there, I mean, I don't
want to say all of

284
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.980
them, but most of the
other books, they start at

285
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.190
where my book ends. So
they assume even if they're

286
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.650
trying not to that you
already kind of know programming.

287
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.870
Right. And my book is
like, okay, I'm going to

288
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.010
get you to a point
where you can go through

289
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.200
some other books. And so
that's what I do. And

290
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.810
then I shove people off
over to Django or <inaudible>

291
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.730
or any of these other
projects without have books they

292
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.910
can. Right. Right. I actually,
as, as someone who was

293
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.420
a professional C programmer 20
years ago, I did still

294
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.700
find the learn, see the
hard way kind of a

295
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.160
nice refresher because it was
like, okay, well here's the

296
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.810
state of the tools right
now. And here's what you're

297
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.030
gonna need on a Mac
on windows or on Linux.

298
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.730
And I was like, Oh,
well, that's, I forgot about,

299
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.310
you know, the way that
worked. Cause I haven't been

300
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.830
a programmer for, I haven't
been a C programmer for

301
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.440
gosh, 95 was the last
time I really wrote any

302
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.710
significant C. So it seemed
like it did fill in

303
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.360
some of the pieces. There
were certain kind of Tetris

304
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.400
pieces that fell into like
the parts of my brain

305
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.170
that I'd written over. And
I was like, Oh wow,

306
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.140
I totally forgot about that.
Right. Yeah. And that book

307
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.790
actually was targeted at scripting
programmers who don't really know,

308
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.420
see, it's so helpful for
them to know it because

309
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.080
I mean, I'm extending their
languages, depend on it. Even

310
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.040
just simple things like how
programs crash, how security bugs

311
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.860
work, all of that stuff
works is just way easier

312
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.200
to understand if, you know,
see, and what I found

313
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.760
is you had a bunch
of people who knew Ruby

314
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.920
and Python, these other languages
that were kind of like

315
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.530
they had imposter syndrome because
they didn't really know how

316
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.480
a computer worked and they
didn't really know how memory

317
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.420
management worked and how point
worked. And so my book

318
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.210
is targeted at that and
also just cause see's fun.

319
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.760
I mean, it's fun and
cool. And you can break

320
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.620
things Like it's a, it's
an accessible kind of assembler

321
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.020
where it's like, you're, you're
in the beast, you know,

322
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.910
you're deep in there and
it's gonna, when it crashes,

323
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:35.020
it crashes spectacularly because clearly
your fault, it's never, it's

324
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.320
never the computer's fault when
it's in C. Exactly, exactly.

325
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.590
And also that's like an
important lesson that I think

326
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.290
people learn from the book.
I think too many programmers

327
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.890
don't get past that stage
of blaming the computer, you

328
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.470
know, like they, they don't
take on the, I guess

329
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.880
it's kind of like, you
know, when you learn, we

330
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.350
need to, again, a martial
art, you learn a martial

331
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.180
art, you start to realize,
Oh, I can die doing

332
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.790
this stuff. You know? So
when they learn, see they're

333
00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.010
like, Oh man, you could
really hose a computer with

334
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.830
this stuff. You know? And
it's like with scripting languages,

335
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.200
they don't get that. You
know, When did this start

336
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.540
becoming the kind of like
the Khan Academy of, of

337
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.660
code. I remember that it
seemed like the learn Python

338
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.760
was almost a piece of
charity that you put out

339
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.440
there for all of us.
And it was like, wow,

340
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.660
you know, dad's this great
humanitarian has given us this

341
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.850
book of work. And then
a year and a half

342
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.090
comes by, I go back
up. Now there's a whole

343
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.540
series of books and there's
Kindle and there's videos and

344
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.310
there's commentary. Yeah. I would
say about two years ago.

345
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.800
Well, so what had happened
is I wrote the book,

346
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.020
got it. It's a PDF
on my website and just

347
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.030
kind of put it up
there. And I think I

348
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.340
was up to like exercise
34 and I was kind

349
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.410
of like unclear on how
I wanted to do it.

350
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.480
And I have this weird
working habit with books where

351
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.000
I get to a point
and I go, Hmm. And

352
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.190
I sorta let it simmer
sometimes way too long. And

353
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.630
then I come back to
it and like a flash

354
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.340
of insight and I sort
of like finish it off

355
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.220
or I revamp it. But
I think it sat up

356
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.100
there for a year. And
then I went back and

357
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.290
pulled down the download statistics
for it off of my

358
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.470
web server for the PDF.
And I found it like

359
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.980
in that one year, 350,000
downloads had been made to

360
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.400
this one PDF. And I
was like, Oh wow, okay.

361
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.410
Maybe this shouldn't be a
PDF. And maybe I should

362
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.270
actually like, you know, charge
a little something for it.

363
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.440
And I still wanted it
to really be online for

364
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.020
free because I mean, it
was just, I felt for

365
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.320
me, it was like, I
wanted other people to understand

366
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.750
me, right? Like I want
other people to understand programmers

367
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.970
and what computers are doing.
And I felt like they,

368
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.970
they were getting kind of
like bowled over by computing

369
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.430
technology. But if they learned
at least the basics of

370
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.370
programming, they would survive better
within this world that suddenly

371
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.280
like just overlapping them with
computers. And so I just

372
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.680
kept it up there and
then I threw on, you

373
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.420
know, Hey, you can, you
can buy a PDF, you

374
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.420
can buy videos and put
them on a course website.

375
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.400
And then eventually I was
getting enough purchases that I

376
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.830
was making more money from
just that one book than

377
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.960
I was from my job.
So I was like, well,

378
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.940
all right, I'm just gonna
quit my job and work

379
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.760
on this book. And then
I just wrote the next

380
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.910
one. And the next one
got stalled, sorta stopped, started

381
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.730
making a website to sell
it a little better. And

382
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.260
that's where it's been. I
mean, I think it's been

383
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.360
that way for about two
years now. Yeah. Two, 200.

384
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.780
And this is effectively your
full time gig now, or

385
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.600
are you doing other work?
It's my full time gig.

386
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:19.160
And so what I do
is that book funds me

387
00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.680
working on other subjects that
I plan on teaching to

388
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.640
people. And I'm sort of
trying to be kind of

389
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.420
like a translator between the,
the programmer slash geek world

390
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.010
and the rest of the
world and back and forth.

391
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.280
So, cause I have a
really weird diverse set of

392
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.460
interests. So what I'm planning
on doing what I've been

393
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.020
doing for the last year
and why I've sort of

394
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.750
been maybe a little quiet
is I've been learning subjects

395
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.580
well enough that I feel
like I could teach them

396
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.800
or at least a corral,
a couple other experts to

397
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.220
help me teach them and
sort of teach them to

398
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.130
programmers or programming topics to
regular people, so on and

399
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.890
so forth. And that's pretty
much all I've been doing.

400
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.530
I've got those five books.
I got to finish, never

401
00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.660
get around to finishing them.
Right. And I do the

402
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.430
videos and then have other
books in the works that

403
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.550
I'm sort of tinkering with.
And, and then in the

404
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.430
spare time, I, I write
fiction and I paint now

405
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.800
and just all sorts of
random stuff. Wow. That's pretty

406
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.040
slick. What do you think
about the things like the

407
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.580
Khan Academy's computer science section
and code Academy and things

408
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.170
like that. I mean, do
you think that there would

409
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.230
be some merging of you
and these other things, or

410
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.390
do you like the independence
that doing this on your

411
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.200
own offers you? I actually,
I sort of feel like

412
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.050
I like the independence of
it and I've been approached

413
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.860
by, I think just about
every learn to code site

414
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.500
out there. And apart from
the fact that they just

415
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.450
don't know how to structure
a deal. I mean, I

416
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.670
don't get it, you know,
there's like, they want it

417
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.860
for free. I was like,
that's not how it works.

418
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.400
So yeah, you have to,
I mean, I, I have

419
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.870
to eat, you know, but
I think what happens is

420
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.520
because I'm not really, there's
no investors for me. I

421
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.420
make enough to survive and
live, you know, reasonably comfortably.

422
00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.870
I'm not wealthy by any
means at all, but because

423
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.120
I really have no masters,
I can sort of like,

424
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.180
just write for people and
write what those going to

425
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.460
help them out, what I
am interested in, what they

426
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.850
do. And that freedom is
really priceless. I mean, at

427
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.130
times I feel like maybe
having a gig would give

428
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.910
me things to write about,
but when it comes down

429
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.910
to actually producing educational material
and writing these books, yeah.

430
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.830
Being a free agent, I
think gives me way more

431
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.020
freedom to kind of do
it the way I see

432
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.830
works and the way that
I'm good at and also

433
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.310
sort of lets me keep
my personality. I think that's

434
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.380
the big thing. Cause when
you start working for other

435
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.540
people, for whatever reason, they
don't want to have your

436
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.030
personality too. And I think
my personality is a big

437
00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.860
part of my writing. Well,
how do you then Align

438
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.720
the, your personality style, your
preferences in the writing and

439
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.880
that you have some of
these books, like the rejects

440
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.130
book up on GitHub and
you encourage people to make

441
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.470
changes. And, and how does
that work? Is it open

442
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.740
source or not? What do
you own? What are, what

443
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.010
are we the public own?
Can you explain that? Yeah.

444
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.080
For the most part, I've
had to start taking those

445
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.470
books down because in a
lot of ways, like I

446
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.120
keep the red jackets and
SQL book up cause it's

447
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.380
not really available yet. But
when I have the other

448
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.240
books up, I've had people
come in and rip the

449
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.060
code out, put their favorite
language in and then declare

450
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.090
themselves the author of my
book. Yeah. And the code

451
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.820
is not the hard part.
Like it's how you structure

452
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.060
the exercises and the actually
what's written, that's the hard

453
00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.100
part. And you can slot
in code and it may

454
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.440
not work, you know? So
I've had to take the

455
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.380
books down from get hub
and things, the Python and

456
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.900
the Ruby and all that.
And, and sorta like say,

457
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.570
yeah, I've, I'm just putting
up for free. It's not

458
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.830
editable anymore because I don't
mind receiving edits and stuff

459
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.320
like that. People send me
the email edits, but when

460
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.020
it was up, people assumed,
Oh, if it's up on

461
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.600
like Prius or something like
that, obviously it's totally free.

462
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.940
And I can just, you
know, steal this guy's work.

463
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.700
And then they get all
super offended. When you tell

464
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.130
them you can't, it's like
a, yeah, you can't do

465
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.070
that. Push the clone that
made it mine though. Right?

466
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.520
Yeah. It's, it's like, I
am very into the free

467
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.580
exchange of ideas that opensource
gives people, but there's a

468
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.310
lack of respect for creators,
I think. And I think

469
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.470
they just, they just assume
that the stuff is free.

470
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.500
It's like roads, right? It's
like, no, there's some dude

471
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.470
made that. Yeah. Yeah. As
someone who's been blogging for

472
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.400
now 12 years, a couple
of weeks ago, I started

473
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.160
seeing another site showing up
ahead of me in Google

474
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.860
and it made me very,
very frustrated and basically a

475
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.640
very nice gentleman in China
had completely cloned my entire

476
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.920
site. It was a complete
copy. You know what I

477
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.560
mean? It was like a
parallel universe version of me

478
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.860
with like a goatee and
an evil attitude. And I

479
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.200
just, I was like, wow,
evil Scott is a total

480
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.720
jerk and he's he ripped
my ads out and he

481
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.670
was running his own ads.
And the part that blew

482
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.920
me away was that he
didn't see a problem with

483
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.460
it. Like, yeah, there was
like, I made this though.

484
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.540
I put a lot of
work into it and he's

485
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:55.680
like, well, I put a
lot of work into this

486
00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.250
site as well. I'm like,
well, by definition, not nearly

487
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.980
as much. Yeah. Yeah. And
it's funny. Cause if you

488
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.750
did that to them, they
would be livid. Oh, of

489
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.000
course. Absolutely. Yeah. Well, one
of the things that you've

490
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.530
done that I think is
really nice though, that I

491
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:11.490
find it to be quite
a clever compromise is, and

492
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.050
I'm not sure if this
is still being actively done,

493
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.740
but you've actually created a
construction kit so that I

494
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.470
could make my own something
the hard way. You've basically

495
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.050
given us a construction kit.
That is a, it looks

496
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.600
like a series of rust
files and latex that just

497
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.030
says, all right, here's the
structure that I use to

498
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.580
make the book. You go
and make a learn, fool

499
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.740
yourself with my, my build
system. Yeah, because the method

500
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.050
is really straightforward. I mean,
I'm basically just ripping off

501
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.480
a guitar method books. It's
not that hard. It's like

502
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.120
you set a bunch of
exercises you're done. So I

503
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.940
just wanted to make the
barrier to entry. So small

504
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.600
someone who has a programming
language to make their own

505
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.310
book. And it's like, look,
you just come up with

506
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.530
52 exercises, start people with
the bare minimum. And by

507
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.970
the end, figure out what
your goal is, who you're

508
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.820
talking to that you're done.
But it, it was more

509
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.290
of a compromise. It was
kind of like, well, instead

510
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.130
of stealing my book and
being lazy, I want you

511
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.050
to write your own book,
but I know this is

512
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.270
kind of like hard to
figure out like digital publishing

513
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.970
is a pain, right? So
here's a template that just

514
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.190
makes all the crap for
you. Like it just, everything

515
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.920
works. Although I do have
to update it, I got

516
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.080
some stuff to do, but
yeah, that was the idea.

517
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.480
It was a compromise. It
was like, grab this, do

518
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.360
what you want now, programmers
being programmers. Of course they

519
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.550
can't just use what someone
else gave them. So they

520
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.310
all go make their own
thing. And then they have

521
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.220
their own layouts and they
started don't get the concept.

522
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.470
But the idea is there,
you know, you can write

523
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.260
your own. Have you seen
anything helpful come out of

524
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.610
that? I know that a
lot of people put things

525
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.590
out online and they seem
like a great idea, but

526
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.810
has anyone made a learn
Fu that you've been impressed

527
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.900
with that we should take
a look at? Yeah, there's

528
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.940
a few of them and
actually I've been wanting to

529
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.460
collect them together. I know
there was Steve Loesch did

530
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.510
a learn them the hard
way. It's not particularly structured

531
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.840
my way because he is
targeting programmers. So my style

532
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.000
would annoy them. But the
same concept is there where

533
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.940
you, you go through and
you do exercises and, and

534
00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.120
you figure out how to
use them. There's another gentleman,

535
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.660
Graham, who's working on learn
Java the hard way. And

536
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.110
his book is, is good.
He's still working on it,

537
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.360
but I believe he teaches
this to high school students.

538
00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.950
So it's actually a good
target audience to like, you

539
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.380
know, aim that kind of
book at, and he's going

540
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.230
through it all by himself
too. And, but I haven't

541
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.260
really seen many other books.
I know there's a few

542
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.330
here and there. They might
use the title, but they

543
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:30.100
don't necessarily use the same
structure. And also I think

544
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.770
there could be some languages
that would really benefit from

545
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.780
this kind of book. Like,
you know, I would love

546
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.540
to see one on closure
or lists that was structured

547
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.260
the way mine is. And
I would also really like

548
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.070
to see one on rust,
I think is a language

549
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.990
that's looking pretty interesting. I'd
like to see one on

550
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.730
that Definitely seems to be
a language that's coming up

551
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.030
quite quite quickly. Yeah. I
like the fact that they're

552
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.120
focusing on systems and it's
compiled and it has the

553
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.880
same expressiveness as a dynamic.
So we'll see how that

554
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.480
goes. But again, I think
there's like, there's big problems

555
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.120
with the way a lot
of these people write their

556
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.180
books for their programming language,
which is understandable, cause they're

557
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.540
busy writing or programming language.
But I think what they,

558
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.630
they really skimp on is
install. I think for beginners,

559
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.850
the biggest thing is install.
Like if you can't get

560
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.590
someone to install it, they're
just not going to bother.

561
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.880
And I think that universally
applies to just about everybody,

562
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.630
every programming language and every
programmer. So yeah, like in

563
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.090
mine you notice I've got
like a really extensive install

564
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.680
at the beginning of the
Python book. And I had

565
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.690
to strip down the tools
to make it like, it's

566
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.230
just a text editor, right?
Your shell and Python. I've

567
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.990
had actually conversations with folks
at, at Microsoft where I

568
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.720
work, where I say that,
you know, there's lots of

569
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.380
reasons that node has done
really well. You know, the

570
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.470
fact that it's JavaScript, it's
not a particularly amazing way

571
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.750
to do things it's quite
confusing and the threading models

572
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.310
and mess and all that
kind of stuff. But if

573
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.320
you could put your finger
on one thing, it's the

574
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.420
fact that you make a
text file and you type

575
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.540
node and it works. And
I tried to explain that

576
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.920
to some of the folks
at Microsoft. I was like,

577
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.050
you know, when you put
that up against something, that's

578
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.330
like, okay, well download this
one thing. It's only a

579
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.890
gig Mount this ISO and
then reboot twice, you know?

580
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.780
And then you wonder like,
well, why isn't anyone using

581
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.430
this? Yeah. Yeah. And it's
sort of like what you

582
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.080
were saying. Like I remember
back in the day I

583
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.780
would spend weeks just to
get something to work. Cause

584
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.910
that was fun, you know?
And I was like, Oh

585
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.900
yeah. Now I'm kind of
like, wait, this takes longer

586
00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.900
five seconds then. Yeah. NPM
install pretty much anything. You

587
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.520
know what I mean? Like
I was telling my boss,

588
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.470
we should make it so
we could NPM install ASP

589
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.600
net. And if it works
and then you can just

590
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.870
type it, people would probably
use it. Yeah. Yeah. And

591
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.390
it's, it's, it's, it's totally
true, man. If like they

592
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.220
can sit there from the
command line and just like,

593
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.740
you know, I mean, PowerShell
was awesome. Right. You mentioned

594
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.620
if you could just PowerShell
install like a commandlets that

595
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.050
would just be the bomb.
Right? Funny, funny story. You

596
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.170
can now it's called P
S get and install. Yeah.

597
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.000
P it's called P S
get, and there's a great,

598
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
you know, you'll love this.
He has read line it's

599
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.360
up on get hub. It's
a new implementation of redline

600
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.620
for PowerShell and it's Fantastic.
Great, great. Yeah. I'm very

601
00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.260
impressed with PowerShell. I mean,
you know, like I'm, I'm

602
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.210
pretty agnostic. Like if tools
are good tools are good,

603
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.880
you know, and, and I
think this also run to

604
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.400
the reasons why I like
being a free agent in

605
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.830
my teaching because there's, there's
a lot of people who

606
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.670
use their teaching as sort
of an indoctrination propaganda technique

607
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.790
and I'm much more into
no, I'm just teaching people

608
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.270
to be independent and do
user stuff. And so, yeah.

609
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.980
So when I was writing
the command line crash course

610
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.970
book, and I'm trying to
find the power shells, I

611
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.210
tried to find the command
with power show. Yeah, no,

612
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.990
the, the analogs between Linux
Unix and PowerShell, there's like

613
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.840
about 14 commands that are
super similar, like CP and

614
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.870
aliases. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And
so what I did is

615
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.030
I was like going through
it and I'm like, man,

616
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.300
PowerShell is kinda awesome. I
was like reading about commandlets

617
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.330
wait, wait, you can write
dotnet assemblies and plug them

618
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.910
in and get commands. Wow.
You know, it's just like,

619
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.710
this is great. You know,
I wonder if it should

620
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.870
be Michelle, the hard way
is the, is the, is

621
00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.150
the concept of the hard
way, something that you have

622
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.250
trademarked? I mean, you said
that there's someone who has

623
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.260
learned VM and learn VIM
script the hard way. Does

624
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.470
that person have to ask
your permission or how Nope.

625
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.230
So one of the things
about titles is it's nearly

626
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.210
impossible to kind of trademark
them. So you could, I

627
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.310
could trademark like a service
if I was teaching it.

628
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.560
But the title of a
book, you can't really trademark

629
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.660
the form of a title.
If you could, people could

630
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.760
just wipe out the entire
publishing. Don't you think the,

631
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.010
for dummies people would probably
come after you if you

632
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.340
called it that Yeah, I
think they would, but you

633
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.410
know, it's like when they
come up with movies that

634
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:32.870
have similar titles and when
they have all sorts of

635
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.750
other books that have similar
titles, they it's just hard

636
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.850
for people to go after
it. But I think what's

637
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.320
what a lot of people
do is they get a

638
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.980
service Mark. So service Mark
is like, I am teaching

639
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.740
this thing. I have like
a consulting business. So you

640
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.510
know, the seven habits guys,
those guys. Yeah. So that's

641
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.730
why people can say the
seven habits of highly effective

642
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.670
dorks or some just change
one word and they can't

643
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.740
be sued for it because
you can't really like trademark

644
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.950
a title. Right. So I
don't really do it, but

645
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.410
also it just seems like
I want this method to

646
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.180
be a little more accessible
and I'm not going to

647
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.040
go around like, you know,
chasing some guy down. If

648
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.010
he's helping people learn his
programming language or his favorite

649
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.050
programming language. So I sorta
let people just use it

650
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.690
and I don't even bother.
And also like, I don't,

651
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.400
I don't have enough money
for lawyers and all that

652
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.710
crap. I mean, I can't
even like register the trademark,

653
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:20.130
you know? So One of
the last things that I

654
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.710
wanted to ask you was
this idea of the historical

655
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.340
context, the older I get,
not only do I kind

656
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.620
of get that old man
strength, but I also get

657
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.720
a sense of like, Oh,
you kids don't understand how

658
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.820
hard it was in the
bat in the past. So

659
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.070
when I go and teach
at the local university, I

660
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.490
do the exploring engineering class
where it's just like, I

661
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.380
usually sit down and I
want to teach them about

662
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.870
like the IBM Selectric, typewriter
and all this kind of

663
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.630
stuff. And half the kids,
eyes glaze over and the

664
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.490
other half, you know, asleep.
What, but if I tell

665
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:51.570
you, no, actually I talked
to Douglas Crockford and he

666
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.320
said that we're not teaching
this stuff enough. We're not

667
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.530
teaching kids about why it's
that way in the history

668
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.470
of CRL F where do
those things fit in a

669
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.960
very practical world, like learning
to code the hard way.

670
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.070
Yeah. I think, you know,
partially a lot of the,

671
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:13.140
those historical things were because
of just odd sort of

672
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.690
like problems with technology in
the past. So I think

673
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.780
there's some stuff that people
just like, Oh, okay, there's

674
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.700
no reason why should anyone
should have done that. If

675
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.560
anything, I would consider that
kind of like a cool

676
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.820
anthropology course, like the study
of how, how humans basically

677
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.730
screw up technology with like
bad decisions and then we're

678
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.350
cursed with them forever. You
know? So, but as far

679
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.020
as like, I think the
biggest thing about like teaching

680
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.410
technology that you don't get
from a lot of educators

681
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.770
now is they're not making
people make stuff. You know,

682
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.570
like if you go get
a degree or you let's

683
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.370
say you learn carpentry or
art or any other activity

684
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.100
where there's a creative result
where you're making a thing,

685
00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.650
you make things like to
have, you make things. If

686
00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.630
you're in a class in
carpentry now, and you don't

687
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.790
make a thing, you're not
really taking a good class.

688
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.090
And I think what we
get with programming is way

689
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:07.830
more lecture and not enough
the actually building stuff. So

690
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:10.260
if I were to teach
the history of programming, I

691
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.620
would actually teach people how
to make these crappy computers

692
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.710
we had back then and
like how they would build

693
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.810
them in software or like,
well, Hey, what if you're

694
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:20.010
going to do this? Okay,
what are you going to

695
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.200
do that? And like, actually
build up these things and

696
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.570
show them that, Oh, the
problem existed because of these

697
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.020
things, by having them actually
make stuff. That is a

698
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.450
really good idea. I don't
know anything about music. I

699
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.360
know that you're a musician,
but I can only assume

700
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.460
that there's quite a big
difference between music theory and

701
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.490
music class and music theory.
You expect to be sitting

702
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.850
in a lecture thinking about
things Like that. But most

703
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.890
music classes, I assume, have
an instrument in your hands.

704
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.380
Yeah. It's actually true. Even
in music theory or using

705
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.980
a, your voice, at least
someone has a piano they

706
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.650
have in the music schools,
I've been to, you have

707
00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.920
to do a performance on
a regular basis, or you

708
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.220
have like an ensemble class
you take, or you compose

709
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.040
things. I think in all
the music theory class, I've

710
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.970
had a composition classes, we
compose things. And also you're

711
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.580
learning. If you're learning to
play songs, you actually play

712
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.410
them and you have to,
you're graded on how well

713
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.190
you play them. I think
too often in the programming

714
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.850
classes, they have, you do
things that are sort of

715
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.390
like very arbitrary kind of
dumb exercises that don't really

716
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.410
have any impact and you
don't really make stuff. And

717
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.690
that's fine in the very
low level beginners, kinda like

718
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:31.670
where my books at, like
you're not making anything useful

719
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.430
in my book, but in
the more advanced creative stuff.

720
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.710
Yeah. You should be building,
you should be building lots

721
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.770
like over and over. That's
very cool. I'm going to

722
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.780
put in the show notes
are linked to, of course,

723
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.200
learn the code, learn code
the hard way.org people can

724
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.480
certainly go and Google for
Zed. Sean find you. And

725
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.690
there's also at amazon.com/is ed
dash Shaw. There's all the

726
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.700
books. You can see all
that will be in the

727
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.850
show notes as well, and,
and be sure to explore

728
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.360
his site because well, the
books are available online and

729
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.550
HTML and you can get
them as PDFs. You can

730
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.280
get them in Kindle format,
but you also get the

731
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.070
videos. So you've got a
video per exercise as well

732
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.010
that you've done in your
studio at home. Hmm. Yep.

733
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.340
That's true. Yeah. And yeah,
I spent a long time

734
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.070
building a do it yourself,
a vocal booth out of

735
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.340
a garden shed. So hopefully
the videos are good. Very

736
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.930
cool. Well, thanks so much
for chatting with me today.

737
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.570
Yup. Thank you very much.
This is fun. This has

738
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.150
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again.

739
00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:33.430
