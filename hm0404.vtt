professional model Lindsey Scott. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

10
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.010
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And right now I

11
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.480
am talking with Lindsey Scott
iOS developer, who happens to

12
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.840
maybe on the side work
as a model full time.

13
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.630
Hi, how are you? I'm
great. How are you? I'm

14
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.230
a fabulous, thanks for chatting
with me today. So you

15
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.660
kind of showed up on
the internet a couple of

16
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.050
days ago with a Quora
question. They basically, someone asked,

17
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.540
what does it feel like
to go from physically unattractive

18
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.050
to physically attractive? Can you
describe what happened? What were

19
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.820
you doing when you saw
this question and what caused

20
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.950
you to answer it? It
must've been 3:00 AM in the

21
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.220
morning. I saw this question
come up in my inbox.

22
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.870
And for some reason in
between programming code, I decided

23
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.790
this would be a great
idea to answer this question.

24
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.130
And it's been an experience
because it's something that was

25
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.640
very personal to me, a
very personal experience growing up

26
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.590
and, you know, I'm being
bullied a bit and now

27
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.880
being a successful model, it
it's kind of after the

28
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.930
fact after posting it and
after seeing this incredible response

29
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.540
I've gotten, which I wasn't
expecting at all, it's been

30
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.400
strange, revealing so much about
myself to so many people,

31
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.310
but I think some good
things have come from it.

32
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.830
Did you just, was this
one of those stream of

33
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.780
consciousness? Did you just kind
of flow out from you?

34
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.670
You threw some pictures and
posted it and forgot about

35
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.940
it? Yes. I didn't forget
about it for long though.

36
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.890
I woke up and all
of a sudden I had

37
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.600
so many views and comments
and messages related to the

38
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.720
article. So I didn't forget
about it at all. And

39
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.810
then this is actually starting
to make kind of regular

40
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.150
news. This is showing up,
like it's starting to show

41
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.280
up in regular news, like
San Francisco gate and different

42
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.420
news articles. That's good. This
is like, this is legit.

43
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.560
Does it feel a little
bit, it's a little bit

44
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.240
vulnerable, isn't it? When you
put yourself out in the

45
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.320
area? Oh, definitely. Definitely. And
it's hard to describe exactly

46
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.600
what I was going through
during that time. And it's

47
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.490
something I don't think about
as regularly as I used

48
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.150
to, you know, the, those
experiences during that time. So

49
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.580
it's weird to open up
that part of my life

50
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.240
again and in such a
public way. Does it feel

51
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.790
though sometimes that like, do
you feel like two different

52
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.520
people or when, when, when,
when you're in a stranger

53
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.740
on the internet, in this
instance, I'm a stranger on

54
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.490
the internet, right? You're, you're
a, a very pleasant and

55
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.240
articulate young woman and you
don't, I can see that

56
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.760
that's you at age 11,
but it seems like a

57
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.550
different person. Do you feel
like a different person or

58
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.700
do you feel like this
is an evolution? I, I,

59
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.450
I feel like the same
person on the inside, but

60
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.430
it's also strange because the
same people that I went

61
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.350
to middle school and then
high school with it was

62
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.590
a seven year school. So
based on me grow from

63
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.240
middle school to high school
and seeing them after the

64
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.360
fact years later and having
them automatically look at me

65
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.530
and decide that I'm a
completely different person. It's, it's

66
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.020
off putting it's it's, it's
weird. And it's uncomfortable when

67
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.840
also I didn't really know
why back then they viewed

68
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.450
me in, in such disregard
it's such distress. So it

69
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.950
actually was disregard. You felt
that you felt disrespected? Yeah.

70
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.960
I w I wasn't treated
very well. I was, I

71
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.850
was You're you're actually pulling,
I'm sorry. Yeah, I I'm,

72
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.900
I've moved on past it,
so, yeah, it's weird talking

73
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.570
about it now because I
really have moved on, but

74
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.540
I was bullied. Yeah, it
is. I went to my,

75
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.920
my 20 year high school
reunion and to be honest,

76
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.500
had forgotten how much I
was bullied and they, they

77
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.750
I'm, I'm not one to
think about things in terms

78
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.450
of like revenge or anything
like that, but there's, there's

79
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.140
that old, you know, saying
that the best revenge is

80
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.810
living well. Yeah. And I
ended up bumping into someone

81
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.670
at the end of the
night at the high school

82
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.930
reunion who was really intoxicated
and just, it was clear

83
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.780
that their life was not
going well. And this was

84
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.930
the person that used to
beat me, mercilessly, you know

85
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.030
what I mean? Like shoved
into a locker type person.

86
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.520
And there, I mean, that
doesn't really matter what they're

87
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.110
doing now, but let's just
say that they're not doing

88
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.340
anything amazing or awesome. And
I thought having, just giving

89
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.440
it the slightest bit of
thought before I went to

90
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.870
the event that, Oh, man,
wouldn't it be awesome to

91
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.330
see those, you know, those
people and those bees and

92
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.020
those a-holes and, you know,
see that their lives suck.

93
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.050
But when you're faced with
that, it was just really

94
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.350
sad. It was like, I
would not have wished this

95
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.880
level of pain and lack
of success, basically, an individual

96
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.470
who peaked at 20, at
17. Well, I feel like

97
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.910
I haven't peaked at all.
You know what I mean?

98
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.020
I wonder, do you don't
know? Do you hold a

99
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.790
negativity towards those? No, I
think over time, I've also

100
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.550
realized that the people who,
you know, might've pushed me

101
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.400
or thrown my books down
or whatever they did, that

102
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.750
they clearly had their own
insecurities. So I, I I'm

103
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.840
over it. I understand that
we all had our issues

104
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.890
back then. Yeah. When, when
you're, when you're growing up

105
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.650
and you're thinking about software,
is it, is it something

106
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.090
where you were, you had
a mindset towards computers or

107
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.280
did you discover like in
high school, working on a

108
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.590
calculator somehow that you were
a programmer, you didn't even

109
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.860
realize it. Yeah. I started
doing games on my TA

110
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.760
ti 89, and I'd read
through the documentation and find

111
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.800
out all about the different
capabilities, but I didn't at

112
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.990
all equate that to computer
science until college. When I

113
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.020
took a computer science course
and realized, wait a second,

114
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.620
this is very familiar. I've
done this before. And did

115
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.680
you have computers in your
life? Yeah, there were computers.

116
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.380
They were much slower back
then. Was there a moment

117
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.580
you can say, like, was
it the, was it the

118
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.130
TA 89? For me? It
was the Commodore 64. Like

119
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.530
when my dad, one day
I came home, the van

120
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.020
was gone and there was
a Commodore 64. And I

121
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.480
found out that my dad
had sold the van because

122
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.610
the teachers had said, you
need to get this kid

123
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.860
a computer to keep him
out of trouble. So he

124
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.300
just did whatever he could
do. He, so he sells

125
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.160
the van and this calendar,
it shows up and I

126
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.260
didn't know anything about it.
And that was the moment.

127
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.830
And if that van hadn't
been sold, I never, would've

128
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.010
seen a computer. Like in
my neighborhood didn't have computers.

129
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.030
It was the only one
within blocks. Yeah, for me,

130
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.240
it was the 89. I
wish I hadn't similarly. Cool

131
00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:02.440
story. It, it was interesting
though. After once I've gotten

132
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.570
older, I've realized my own
father has experience in computer

133
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.530
science. He worked for the
NSA programming for them. Yeah.

134
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.730
And I, I didn't know
that at all, until after

135
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.580
my computer science, after I,
I got my computer science

136
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.990
to be that, wait a
second, we have this thing

137
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.310
in common. And I, I
didn't even realize, Do you

138
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.050
talk tech with him now?
Is that, is that something

139
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.190
you bond with When he
works there? It was mostly

140
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:37.060
zeros and ones. So he,
he, he likes to brag

141
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.790
that he's the best program
rat there, but I don't

142
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.150
think he's done any of
it in many, many years.

143
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.590
Punch card days. Yeah. Yeah.
That's scary though. As soon

144
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.960
as you said NSA, I
mean, I don't know if

145
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.820
you watch scandal or not,
but I was just like,

146
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.720
wow, that's your dad. Hopefully
he did. He didn't kill

147
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.170
anyone during his time at
the NSA just program. I'm

148
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:04.640
sure he didn't. Now I
noticed that you are, you

149
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.300
have a burgeoning career on
stack overflow as well. Yeah.

150
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.670
Over the past couple weeks,
I've gotten really involved with

151
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:16.130
it. I've been building up
my reputation. Is that related

152
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.260
to the core post? Like,
did the core postmark a

153
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.060
point where you decided it's
time for you to become

154
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.970
a social programmer or is
this a coincidence? It's a

155
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.620
coincidence completely. I started it,
maybe the fact that I

156
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.520
started becoming more social online,
having a new Twitter page,

157
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.770
a new Instagram, adding my
answers to stack overflow. Maybe

158
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.150
that made posting my answer
on Quora a little easier.

159
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.020
Maybe that was a more
natural progression because of that.

160
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.720
But no way I started
answering the questions on stack

161
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.750
overflow a few weeks before
my core posts. Do you

162
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.460
think this is the beginning
of a new and a

163
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.800
new era that involves social
programming and you know what

164
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.050
I mean by that? Like,
do you want to solitary

165
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.420
developers seems like for a
number of years, haven't you?

166
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.640
Yes. In college, I did
programming, for example, we had

167
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.340
one class with just three
students in it where we

168
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:16.340
just spent the entire semester
building a compiler. And so

169
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:22.220
I I've had those experiences
programming in groups, but yeah,

170
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.490
over the past few years,
I've definitely been very much

171
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.510
a solitary program. And you
went to Amherst in Massachusetts?

172
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.950
Yes. And you, you did
graduate with a, an undergrad

173
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.000
in computer science. Yes. Computer
science and theater. That is

174
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.580
actually deeply awesome. Is that
a double major or was

175
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.980
one of the, I majored
yet separately. Separately. Yeah. Double

176
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.410
major. That's awesome. That's funny.
My background is in theater

177
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.600
as well. I did theater
and music and I did

178
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.320
musical theater. So, you know,
what's funny is that, that

179
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.780
set me up for a
career kind of as a

180
00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.730
programmer slash presenter and teacher.
So it's interesting. Have you

181
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.450
thought about user groups and
presenting, so like you should

182
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.520
do that. I mean, that's,
that's the closest thing programmers

183
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.620
have to theater. Yeah. I
spoke to Hottie that the

184
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.240
head of covid.org yesterday, and
I would definitely love to

185
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.210
get involved with an organization
like that and give lectures

186
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:26.300
and speeches and try to
encourage young kids, especially women

187
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:32.300
and minorities to program, to
learn more about technology. Now

188
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.820
covid.org for people who may
not be familiar as a

189
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.330
nonprofit. And they have a
sister organization called commuting and

190
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.540
the computing in the core,
and it's a public nonprofits.

191
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.660
It's a five Oh one
C3. And they're focused on

192
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.730
STEM with a focus on
code. And you may have

193
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.650
heard this idea of an
hour or teach an hour

194
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.890
of code that anyone can
learn. Yes. They also have

195
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.910
hour of code. They just
released two weeks ago. And

196
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.440
I was astonished 15 million students,
I think within the first

197
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.210
week we're on the website
creating their own code, getting

198
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:09.060
their own programs. Yeah. 170
countries, everyone learned is starting

199
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.760
to learn to code. And
that's, he told me that's

200
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.510
more than signed up to
Instagram, for example, and Facebook

201
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.180
and all of this within
several years. So in one

202
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.560
week more students are involved
or are interested, are doing

203
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:30.330
programming, then you know, all
these other social media websites.

204
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.460
I think that, that the
thing that I like most

205
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.130
about code and why I
think things like code.org and

206
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.020
organizations like them are so
interesting is I think that

207
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.220
they teach people to be
creators as well as consumers.

208
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.360
I think that we have
a lot of people that

209
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.330
are just spent spending their
time consuming. Yeah. Do you,

210
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.350
you said that as we
talked a little bit before

211
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.990
we started recording that you
wanted to find different ways

212
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.100
to express yourself creatively. So
your job like your, your,

213
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.700
your work and what pays
the rent today is modeling.

214
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.750
And, but that is a,
that is a sense of

215
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.530
expression of theater of, of,
Yeah, definitely. I think I

216
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.990
got involved with it because
of my interest in acting

217
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.160
after college, I started doing
acting. I thought I would,

218
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.320
I would do that. And
somehow I ended up getting

219
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.080
a contract with Calvin Klein
and that really set off

220
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.040
my career with modeling during
that year, I worked for,

221
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.850
you know, Prada, Gucci, all
of a sudden these jobs

222
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.870
were coming in and a
Victoria secret. I also did

223
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.060
Victoria's secret show that year.
And just the, the fact

224
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.340
that I'm able to put
on all these outfits and

225
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.120
makeup and have my hair
done and become these different

226
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.200
characters. It's exciting. That's my
favorite part. Definitely about the

227
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.890
job. And do you, when
you're traveling around, I assume

228
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.950
you're spending months in different
cities and you know, it's

229
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.380
like a contract job. You,
you go somewhere and you

230
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.810
work for an organization for
some number of months, or

231
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.480
how does that work? No,
I travel a lot, but

232
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:10.080
it's, each job is in
most jobs. Don't come with

233
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.530
a contract. So one job
here and then I go

234
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.380
to a bunch of castings
and maybe through those meetings,

235
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.500
through those auditions with people
I find out I get

236
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.740
another job. And so it's,
it's all very last minute.

237
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.410
Nothing's guaranteed when I go
traveling, but luckily it's, it's

238
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.170
worked out. Okay. So does
that mean that you you'll

239
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.390
say I'm going to go
to London for this job

240
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.190
and then I'll stick around
for a few months and

241
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:39.600
hope other jobs are found?
Yes. And do you write

242
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.520
your code when you're kind
of just hanging out in

243
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.650
the hotel? Or how does
that explain to me how

244
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.520
you balance? What is effectively
a fulltime, albeit a piece

245
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.940
together job with your writing
apps and putting apps in

246
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:56.630
the store? Sure. I, I,
when I start coding, I

247
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.880
have trouble stopping for the
most part, but I'll, I'll

248
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.320
maybe I'll start before casting
go to meet with clients

249
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.930
and then come back and
pick up where I left

250
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:14.120
off. And the same for
jobs. I'll start coding in

251
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.900
the morning. Do my job
come home, probably stay up

252
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.380
way, way, way too late
and do the same thing

253
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:29.690
the next day. Sometimes I,
I bring my computer science

254
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.790
issues into work. I was
sure where I'm on the

255
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.130
phone with Apple during my
hair and makeup. Seriously. Have

256
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.290
you ever heard that that
is really important. Have you

257
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.380
been in the chair getting
your hair and makeup done

258
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.600
with the laptop in your
lap and you're writing code

259
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.290
It's happened before? I'm not
proud of that moment. I

260
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.450
have to say that I
am proud of that moment

261
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.190
and I was not anywhere
near that moment. That was

262
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.600
awesome. I'll try not to
do that so often, but

263
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.360
there was just an issue
with the Apple server and

264
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.920
I needed to push an
update. I'm just saying though,

265
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.690
that, like the thing that
I find so interesting about

266
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.090
it is that my initial
reaction, when I heard about

267
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.120
this and what you were
doing was that these, these

268
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.000
are two incompatible things. But
now as we talk, the

269
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.650
more and more I hear
about it, this is all

270
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.500
just a form of creation
and expression. And they are

271
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:21.340
very competitive. True. That's true.
And with my last app

272
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:26.020
that I released, it was
specifically for models and artists.

273
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.440
I, I made this portfolio
app as a model. We

274
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.810
carry around our books with
our pictures in them and

275
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.600
they're heavy and the books
fall apart and the pages

276
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.460
get dirty. And sometimes you
forget to have your comp

277
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.350
card and back, which is
like a business card for

278
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.100
models. So I created, created
an app called I port

279
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.530
it's available on the Apple
app store for iPads. And

280
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.710
so it's, it's something that's
out there and it's something

281
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.030
that models are using. So
it's nice to create a

282
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.600
product one that's useful through
yourself. And then also useful

283
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.850
for the people in the
industry that you surround yourselves,

284
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.210
yourself with myself with. So
it looks like your app

285
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.550
is just been updated just
a couple of weeks ago.

286
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.670
It looks like you put
out version 1.5. Yeah. That's

287
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.410
great. And this does someone
take this app and, and

288
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:21.880
like, Oh, I'm modeling. Let
me pull up my iPad

289
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.400
and I'll show you my
Yes. Oh, I mean, I

290
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.320
carry my portfolio out of
it. Okay. So now she's

291
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.990
on Skype here. So she's
pulling out her portfolio. This

292
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.810
is awesome. So can you
then share it with someone

293
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.940
that could I could, I
let's say you meet someone

294
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.910
on a train and this
is a, a scout you

295
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.300
can share your, As long
as you have internet access,

296
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.760
if you have three G
network or wifi, then yes,

297
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.280
you can enter their email
address and I'll send it

298
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.010
right to them and they
can even open it up

299
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.370
in the app. So if
they have the app on

300
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.380
their device, or if they
download the app for free

301
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.930
on the Apple app store,
then they can view your

302
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.400
portfolio in its original format
with the custom table background,

303
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.640
the custom book, color, the
custom logo and everything that

304
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.090
you've designed for yourself, You
get all the assets. It

305
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.400
seems like it's a very
polished app. You've got textures

306
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.050
and backgrounds and all sorts
of stuff. Did you find

307
00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.710
a texture pack or how
did you find Like stock

308
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:19.520
images? And, and I added
them to fit the portfolio

309
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.400
books and well, most of
the books are various colors.

310
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.700
So I created a lot
of those graphics too. That's

311
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.800
cool. And is that something
that you find yourself always

312
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.140
selling that in the sense
of like, you see like

313
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.970
a model or a friend
with an iPad, you're like,

314
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.070
Hey, did you know that
you can run your portfolio

315
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.230
Sometimes, but rarely for the
most part, they see me

316
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.610
with the app and like,
wait, Oh, that looks cool.

317
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.520
Where did you get that
from? So I tell them

318
00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.850
then, But that's one of
the unifying traits of nerds

319
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.520
though. The idea that, that
there's a problem and I

320
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.390
have the power to build
something to fix it. Well,

321
00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:02.600
that's definitely the thing that
I love about programming. So

322
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.080
maybe I, I I've always
felt that that as a

323
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.110
builder, like a programmer as
a builder and how can

324
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.570
you, how can you not
see it? See a problem

325
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.640
of some kind and not
want to write something or

326
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.670
make something, or create something
that is utilitarian, some utility,

327
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.220
like you, you clearly saw
a problem and you want

328
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.710
to solve this problem. And
I think that I call

329
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.320
that one of the unifying
traits of, of nerds. And

330
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.620
I've decided to own that
word, you know, like that

331
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.130
they can't hurt me with
the word anymore. Yeah. They

332
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.470
can't push you into the
lockers with the word anymore.

333
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.090
D did you ever, did
you think about yourself as

334
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.720
a nerd? Does that word
have meaning to you? No.

335
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.600
I, I didn't really think
of myself as a nerd

336
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.150
growing up. It's just everyone
else called me, her growing

337
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:53.480
up. But now that I'm
older and I'm wiser. Yeah.

338
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.330
It doesn't hurt me so
much anymore either. Yeah. There's

339
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.150
definitely been, I think, a
move as the internet, like

340
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.160
as someone who was on
the internet before the internet

341
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.320
was cool. And I don't
know about you, but I

342
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.360
mean, I was on, you
know, well, and all this

343
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.520
kind of like, you know,
I was online before people

344
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:13.220
were online and that it's
almost like, like, like when

345
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.140
you have a band that
no one's ever heard of,

346
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.060
but you've heard of, and
then everyone gets on that

347
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.680
band and you're like, Oh,
you know, but I knew

348
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.350
about them before. I feel
like that about the internet.

349
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.020
Like everyone's talking about how
exciting social media is, but

350
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.950
I was on CompuServe man.
And we were social before

351
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.250
social, you know, and now
people are taking the word

352
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.770
and they're, they're, they're modifying
it. Like there's, I don't

353
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.100
know if you've heard the
term blurred, blurred black nerd.

354
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.790
Oh yes, I have. Yeah.
There's websites like planet blur

355
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.750
and Yeah. What's the guy
from community called himself a

356
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.560
blur. Yeah. Oh, what's his
name? Yeah. Yeah. The guy

357
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:54.250
from community who is a
child, childish Gambino, Donald Glover, Danny

358
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.850
Glover. Yes. Donald Glover. Who else?
Who has an album out?

359
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.660
Childish Gambino. Right. And that's,
that's a way of saying

360
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.850
that. That's cool. And then
you have, I think people

361
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.850
like, like Cielo who choose
to dress a certain way

362
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.360
and it's like, wait a
second. I can be popular

363
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.620
and interesting. And well-spoken and
a geek and into software

364
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.260
and into gadgets and widgets
and all of those things.

365
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:22.320
And that's that's okay. Yeah.
Yeah. I hope it's okay.

366
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.990
I think it's deeply. Okay.
I think it's deeply. Okay.

367
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:29.100
So do you feel like
you are living on both

368
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.970
sides of, of reality? Sometimes
I feel like I'm categorized

369
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.740
as a computer person. Like,
I'll go to a party,

370
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.200
I'll meet someone and we'll
be chatting and then they'll

371
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.770
go, Oh, you're a computer
person. And that either means

372
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.750
we are going to be
like friends for life because

373
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.350
they're a computer person too.
Or this conversation is over

374
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.680
because I'm not a computer
person. That's strange. I couldn't

375
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.280
imagine that happening. Where are
you talking about, you know,

376
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.730
where are you talking about
your profession and well, with

377
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.430
me as a model that
happens sometimes where people feel

378
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:04.170
uncomfortable after I mentioned the
fact that my model. So

379
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.620
you're seeing that as that,
that, that profession, that aspect

380
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.750
of your personality is the,
I don't know. I don't

381
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.030
want to say turn off,
but I want to imposing

382
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.840
like meet someone. It's like,
It's definitely not necessarily a

383
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.010
turn off. Sometimes it's a
turn on, but it, it,

384
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.210
it overwhelmed. It's it always
takes precedence over everything that

385
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.230
about me with strangers. Often,
as soon as they find

386
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.340
that out, their opinions made
up, Oh, you said it

387
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.680
much better than I did.
That's exactly right. That the

388
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.750
identity, that label model for
you is the thing that

389
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.580
someone will notice when they
meet you or they chat

390
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.870
with you or that you
talk to them. And then

391
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.720
they say, Oh, I'm a
model I'm paid to be

392
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.960
attractive. And to do these
things well as a software

393
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.270
person, when I meet someone
and they go, Oh, you

394
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.880
work for Microsoft or, Oh,
you're a software guy. There's

395
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.610
like, they immediately, you can
see where they almost kind

396
00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.830
of put you in a
box. Their face has changed.

397
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.630
Their posture changed. And now
like, Oh, I got you

398
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.830
figured out you're a model
or you're a computer guy.

399
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.380
Yeah. I didn't really know
anything about computers or I

400
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.410
don't really know anything about
modeling. You, you could be

401
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.960
put into two different boxes.
Like if you just led,

402
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.410
you should try this sometime
lead with the software engineer

403
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.860
thing. Yeah. And as you
meet people who aren't technical,

404
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.480
see how their posture and
their style changes around you.

405
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.490
It's, it's, it's interesting. I,
I feel in talking to

406
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.850
nontechnical people like in my
neighborhood here, that if, if,

407
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.350
if, if I lead with
being a computer person that

408
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.970
they suddenly have very little
to talk about, which seems

409
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.740
like it's very similar with
you with the modeling. Like,

410
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.120
if you say I'm a
model, like, you know, gosh,

411
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:49.210
I don't have a passport
or People when you tell

412
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.470
someone, I don't think a
lot of people, most people

413
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:59.320
probably don't know fashion models
or don't run into them

414
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.490
in their day to day
lives. So they normally have

415
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:08.590
questions for me. They're often
intrigued, but sometimes you don't

416
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.090
always want to talk about
your living, your, your livelihood

417
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:18.130
in a way that sensationalizes
it, especially, Is that what

418
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:19.840
they usually want to do?
I mean, I know that

419
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.730
when people talk to me
about software, they think that

420
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.640
we make piles of money
and we know everything about

421
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.360
every kind of computer. Yeah.
Well, they want to know

422
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.650
what kind of clothes I
get for free and where

423
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:39.280
I've traveled and who I
know. And, and I'm a

424
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.100
pretty, I'm a, I'm a
human being. I'm a pretty

425
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:50.110
normal person, but it's, it's
not, not something I necessarily

426
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:55.600
feel the need to talk
about with strangers. Yeah. I

427
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.300
hear you. Let's talk about
the, the app as we

428
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.450
end here. So you've got
a couple that you had

429
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.770
there. You have the one
app now, and you're working

430
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.650
on a second app. What
kinds of features of you're

431
00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.950
doing iOS apps, right? So
these universal apps, iPhone and

432
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.640
iPad, I've done. I have
actually two apps currently on

433
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.040
the app store. The first
one is a universal app.

434
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.510
It's for a charity. I
created this app for a

435
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:25.840
charity called educate, which it
sponsors Ugandan youths, and that's

436
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:32.530
for both iPad and iPhone
devices. The last app I

437
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:39.070
made for model portfolios is
specifically for iPad. Since that's

438
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.790
the best way to view
the portfolios, I've had device,

439
00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.580
the current app I'm working
on uses both iPad and

440
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.660
iPhone devices. Now you're your
eye port app right now

441
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.550
is free to download. But
then it's just something that

442
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.760
says holiday special, $2 upgrade
you have like in app

443
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.850
purchases. Yes. It's to get
the full version of the

444
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:03.520
app where you can have
multiple portfolios, have more backgrounds

445
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.540
and table templates to choose
from right now, that's one

446
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.950
99 to upgrade. Have you
found that, that that model

447
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.810
works better? Like I know
that there's lots of different

448
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.420
way thoughts around how to
get people to download this

449
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.900
trials. And there's 99 cents to
download and more to upgrade.

450
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.000
Do you find that free
to download and then an

451
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.460
in app purchase to unlock
is the best way. I'm

452
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.240
not sure if it works
better necessarily. It seems like

453
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.200
it would. But my reasoning
behind that is because I

454
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.680
said, I want people to
use what I've created. I,

455
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.240
I, I enjoy that idea
of someone having my app

456
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.680
on their phone. And yeah,
it's important to it. I

457
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.620
have some, a little advertising
in that app and I

458
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:51.000
have the in app purchases,
but I do want people

459
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.630
to download it and to
have it for free. I

460
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.660
feel like that's the best
way to get them at

461
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.460
least to check it out
and see what it's about

462
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.870
Is, is monetization and the
idea of a second career,

463
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.410
why you're coding, or did
you think that you'll always

464
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.690
do both things or like
I'm trying understand, do you

465
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.100
want to make money on
this or is it really

466
00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.840
more of a creative outlet
where you have to express

467
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.550
yourself and it doesn't really
matter whether you make money

468
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:18.500
on your app? Well, in
order to create apps, I

469
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.820
can't necessarily do every single
modeling job that comes along.

470
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.820
For example, I've had to
turn down some smaller jobs

471
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:31.880
with, you know, smaller paychecks
just to make sure that

472
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.250
I well, or just to
focus on this a bit

473
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:40.670
more just to get it
done. And so, yeah, it's,

474
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.950
it's good for me to
monetize it to some extent,

475
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:47.780
just to compensate for the
work I'm losing modeling Really.

476
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.560
So you've, you've prioritized coding
over your full time job

477
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.810
and said, you know, I'm
not gonna take Only for

478
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:57.440
jobs that I don't necessarily
feel like I need or

479
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.080
want to do. And about
how much time do you

480
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.140
spend coding in an average
average week while you're working?

481
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:09.560
Hmm. A lot, I'd say
20 of these, or no

482
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.750
more than that. Some days
when I was working on

483
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.260
iPod, I must've been spending
at least 12 hours a

484
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.060
day. I did that app
in about a month and

485
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.660
a half. I'm a pretty
quick coder that I probably

486
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.490
took a month and a
half and I was working

487
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.890
at least 12 hours a
day on it when I

488
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.940
wasn't doing a modeling job
from nine to five. Wow.

489
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:31.520
So it sounds like you
have kind of the typical

490
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.310
coder obsessive personality in the
sense of like when the

491
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.290
app is inside, you, you
have to get the app

492
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.100
out. Yes, definitely. And I
won't sleep until it's done.

493
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.760
Yeah. Has that been a
coding quality problem at all?

494
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.580
Have you had any major
issues? No. No. I, I

495
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.260
haven't because, well, in this
case, this app took, like

496
00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.140
I said, a month and
a half, and then I

497
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:59.510
did those additional, I guess,
five updates. And right now

498
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:02.390
I'm very happy with the
way it is right now.

499
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:10.790
But no, I I'm pretty
thorough. I really check for

500
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:15.470
errors and issues as I
go along. So it hasn't

501
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.810
been an issue. Do you
have any tales of particular

502
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.940
bugs that have kept you
up or have had any

503
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.730
like major issues? Like sometimes
you have war stories about

504
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:26.180
like a particular bug you
couldn't catch or a feature

505
00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.300
that you couldn't crack. And
then that moment of epiphany

506
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.690
when you've solved that problem,
It happens all the time.

507
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.910
I think when I'm switching
from iOS six Taya was

508
00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.880
seven. There were a lot
of things that I needed

509
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.760
to in order to make
that transition and to, to

510
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.340
find out what was, what
the new device, what the

511
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.840
new iOS system was capable
of, such as background modes.

512
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.170
The fact that now it
supports seven background modes instead

513
00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.460
of the two original ones.
I think location changes and

514
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.510
playing music in the background
was those were the only

515
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:09.040
things previously supported. But now
that they've implemented background fetch

516
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:15.910
back background, fetch background mode,
location, service, background mode, local

517
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:20.110
push notification, background mode, all
these things are very useful

518
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:24.160
and it makes for a
better user experience and a

519
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:28.930
more, it gives you more
options. As far as programming

520
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.250
an app goes. Have you
thought about lighting up specific

521
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.530
features or did you light
up specific things to make

522
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:40.200
your app utilize iOS seven?
Like when you light up

523
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.110
a feature, it's like, Oh,
if you have iOS six,

524
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.910
the app works like this,
but if you have iOS

525
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.580
seven, I detect that you
support this background, motor, that

526
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.650
bike wouldn't post. So I'm
going to light up this

527
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.810
feature. Are there any things
that you're looking forward to

528
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.910
within iOS seven that you're
going to think will make

529
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.270
eye port go to that
next level? I'm with iPod?

530
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.450
I didn't necessarily need any
of say these new background

531
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.960
modes. I didn't need any
of that the way it

532
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.460
is now, it works perfectly
for its intended purpose with

533
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.470
this new app that I'm
working on. It's a networking

534
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:15.180
app of sorts in which
I am using several iOS,

535
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.950
seven things particular to iOS
seven, especially the background modes,

536
00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.710
the background fetch and performing
background fetch every 10 minutes

537
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:28.170
to get information from my
parcel server, checking for location

538
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:32.220
updates. As you know, I
could have done diagnostics to,

539
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:40.290
and I'm also using push
notifications to trigger server and

540
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.800
interface updates while the app
is in the background. So

541
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.390
it sounds like you just
said you're using parse for

542
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.080
your backend. Yes. Yes. I
just, I, at first I

543
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.690
was using Amazon S three.
I've used that with previous

544
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:59.460
apps and parse is it,
it has so many great

545
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:05.400
features. Like you could have
different various users. It does

546
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.210
a lot of the leg
work for you. So right

547
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.970
now I'm very happy using
parse as long as I'm

548
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:19.200
dealing with files that aren't
too large because there is

549
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:23.790
a, I believe a minimum
file size for, or they,

550
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.810
it only takes for Amazon
S three. I can have

551
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.200
files as big as I
want, and it's just, I'm

552
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:37.620
just charged per server call.
Right. But with parse, it's

553
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.520
a little different, it doesn't
take so much data on

554
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.740
the maximum file size, or
there's a maximum amount of

555
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:50.710
space tire class. So I'm
your new app comes out

556
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.480
in a couple of weeks
and hopefully all that, when

557
00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.160
you let me know what
it is, I'll add the

558
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.610
link to the show notes
for this show. And I'll

559
00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.070
also, if you don't mind,
I'll put your stack overflow

560
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.640
a profile and a link
to the Quora question. So

561
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.990
folks can read about what
it was like to, to

562
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.360
go from an in, in
the, in the statement of

563
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.390
the cork core question from
physical and attractive to physically

564
00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.240
attractive. But I like what
you say, where, you know,

565
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.120
you really haven't changed. You're
still the same interesting person

566
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.270
as before, and no one
could see it before. Hmm.

567
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.080
Thank you. Thanks so much
for chatting with us today.

568
00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.110
I appreciate it. Thanks for
having me. This has been

569
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.930
another episode of Hansel minutes
and see you again. Next

570
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:38.920
