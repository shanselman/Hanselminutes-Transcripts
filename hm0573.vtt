8
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.140
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today. This

9
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.300
is handsome. Anousha 1818 Richard Campbell.
How are you, sir? I'm

10
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.970
well, my friend, how are
you? I am a little

11
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.120
disheveled, a youth. We tried
to do this with the

12
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.440
Google Hangouts. Yep. It failed.
And then we tried a

13
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.530
few different ways, but it's
apparently YouTube streaming has got

14
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.220
the problems guy. Yes, it
is the 8th of March right now.

15
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.260
And YouTube is down. So
that failed horribly. So what

16
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.100
we're doing is a little,
a little janky. We've got

17
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.450
multiple cameras. Which camera am
I on here? That one

18
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.690
we've got multiple cameras going,
multiple mixers. I ended up

19
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.430
bringing up downloading and installing
OBS studio. I set myself

20
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.840
up with a, a local
stream. I'm on messenger. Facebook

21
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.950
messenger with you right now.
Yep. Capturing that screen. It's

22
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.580
pretty. It's it's it's a
poor person's Google Hangouts said

23
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.240
it's janky, but, but I
think we could probably make

24
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.700
this work in the future.
Yeah, no, I'm happy. I

25
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.470
happy. We got it together.
And it's been a while

26
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.210
since we did a minutia,
it's been more than a

27
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.140
year. Anyway. It is. I
hope people can hear you

28
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.560
if they can't hear you
then. Well, this will just

29
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.150
be a podcast that they'll
be listening. Well, I don't

30
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.280
know. It just be me
talking to myself. Wow. Wouldn't

31
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.560
be the first time. All
right. Good deal. So let

32
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.690
me tell you what I'm
excited about and then you

33
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.690
will inevitably interrupt and make
the talk that much awesomer.

34
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.230
Yes. I bought a switch
and Nintendo switch and joy.

35
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.840
It is so, so good.
It's that good? That you

36
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.380
are just like, it's awesome.
I just, I'm so excited

37
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.800
about my switch. I can't
even stand it. It's really

38
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.440
just a, we, you in
sort of portable form, right?

39
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.640
It's such an old guy
thing to say, Oh, well,

40
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.840
you know, that's what a
PSP was, is it is

41
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.810
we'll hear it because people
can't see it, but I'm

42
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.030
going to just pick it
up, hold it up. And

43
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.980
this is the thing, it
was on the TV over

44
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.550
here to my side. Right.
And now here you go.

45
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.840
Where are we at? Here
we go. Where's Zelda. Look

46
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.160
at that. I mean, it's
just so special, so exciting.

47
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.780
Right. And it's all about
that one game, right? It's

48
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.120
all about the Zelda game.
Yeah. It is a portable

49
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.790
Zelda system. That's all that
matters is that it's seldom,

50
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.560
I don't know if let's
say Zelda is a hundred

51
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.980
hours, right? Well then that's
an open world game. That

52
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.730
particular Zelda game. So No
dollars an hour. It's three

53
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.610
bucks an hour. I mean,
it's so it's, it's a

54
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.320
$3 an hour Zelda simulator
every hour. The way I

55
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.990
look at it as this,
every hour that goes by

56
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.540
that I play Zelda makes
the, the switch that much

57
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.930
more inexpensive. Right? It's it's
constantly justifying its existence with

58
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.790
right. By consuming time. And
what's so exciting about it

59
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.820
is that I think, I
think I'm actually, people are

60
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.790
looking at it on this
screen here, turn it over

61
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.240
here. I just drop it
in for the little dock.

62
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.170
And then it immediately is
going to pop up over

63
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.100
there on the screen, which
is unbelievable. Let me see

64
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.730
here. Yeah. So they can't
see because my streaming is

65
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.150
so janky, but now I
plugged it into a doc

66
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.520
and it's up on the
main screen. I've got the

67
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.580
pro controller and then I'm
watching it on TV. Like

68
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.630
exactly like the commercial. So
does what it says it's

69
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.580
supposed to do. It does
exactly what it wants to

70
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.970
do. And I'm seeing all
these people complaining on, Oh,

71
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.310
you know, it's a dead,
it's the worst launch in

72
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.730
years now. Come on. I
don't think they have enough

73
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.490
of them. Good. Basically sold
out everywhere. They have, they

74
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.010
have more. Do you want
from a launch then you

75
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.670
sold them Well, and didn't
it sell the most since,

76
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.790
since the, we, I think
I just like, I don't

77
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.290
know. Millions and millions. Millions.
Yeah. I don't know. I'm

78
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.480
I'm with you. I just
I'm happy that there's three

79
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.020
video game machine companies, right?
I mean, you've got Sony

80
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.310
and Microsoft and Nintendo still
making devices still innovating. That's

81
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.910
what a working ecosystem looks
like. You know, that's actually

82
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.970
a really good point that
this is the third party,

83
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.510
right? I mean, they, they
said that it says here

84
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.620
in Japan, it's sold third
of 1,000,003 days. They're saying

85
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.920
that the city the, we
use, so just 3 million by

86
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.640
the end of 2012. Wow.
So, you know, I don't

87
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.980
know. It's not, it didn't
blow the doors off, but

88
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.830
it's, I think it's special.
I think that it was

89
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.550
a week a week launch
in the sense of the,

90
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.470
the number of games that
were available. Of course it's

91
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.460
small, But again, you need
a marquee game. You need

92
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.240
one and individ, Zelda, you
got to make the game.

93
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.780
You could've sold that. Many
of those machines, if all

94
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.080
it played was Zelda. Yeah.
Someone in the chat here

95
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.470
just said, it's just like
the commercial, except without hip

96
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.420
cool kids On the road
too. I will say guys,

97
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.600
talk about a video game
machine. I have not To

98
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.370
any roof parties. Oh. Which
is, you know, that's too

99
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.200
bad. Exactly. It's, it's beautiful
though. It's fun. You just

100
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.170
pick it up. You walk
away the, I mean, I

101
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.840
felt looking for like knits.
There's no nits. The only

102
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.040
knit is that the doc
is cheap plastic and you,

103
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.100
if you just slapped it
in the dock, it could

104
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.780
theoretically, I don't know. Scratch
the thing. Scratch the screen.

105
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.180
Yeah. It'll be fun to
see how it survives. I

106
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.060
mean, in theory, cheap plastic,
you know, this gorilla grass

107
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.940
on that screen screen, it
should survive. The you'll break

108
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.430
the dock. We break the
unit. I don't think it's

109
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.980
gorilla glass. No, I think
there's talk about it. Maybe

110
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.710
not pink irrelevant. But I
think that to get back

111
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.280
to your original point, there
is a third perfectly viable,

112
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.810
fantastic game company out there.
And I'm hearing just by

113
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.020
looking on, you know, reading
some different, more obscure blogs

114
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.930
that the trick with the
switch is going to be

115
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.140
indie, indie devs. I think
that this is the year

116
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.660
of the indie developer. I
hope that comes true. Cause

117
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.440
it hasn't so far. And
Nintendo is, I would argue

118
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.770
of the three now maybe
second worse. I think Microsoft

119
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.930
has the best shot to
actually get indie dev to

120
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.740
work. Not that they have
and then in Nintendo and

121
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.530
then at Sony is openly
hostile to just about everybody.

122
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.840
So it's very unlikely to
make it work in Sony.

123
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.670
Yeah. I definitely think that
if they can get the

124
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.470
indie dev thing right, then,
then that'll be good. Well,

125
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.760
let me just give you
that. We'll make a level

126
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.630
playing field so that folks
can contribute their good ideas.

127
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.600
You know, you think about
how many unity games have

128
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.540
been made. Just the ability
to build a decent game

129
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.140
with one, two, maybe three
people, some off the shelf,

130
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.790
resources it's incredibly doable. And
the other thing that's important

131
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.890
for me about the switch
is that didn't go for

132
00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.800
the monster horsepower. You know,
the race between the PS

133
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.900
four and the Xbox one
and a one ass and

134
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.060
all, all of this is
about more compute and more

135
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.430
compute and more compute. And
the downside for that in

136
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.630
the gaming industry is it's
no longer economically viable to

137
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.790
build a game that will
press against the limits of

138
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.240
those machines. It takes so
much art. It takes so

139
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.780
much graphical resources to actually
push the edges of a

140
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.260
PS4. You have to have
be sure you've got a

141
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.790
guaranteed winner to actually do
it. So you don't utilize

142
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.820
the machine and the switch
hasn't gone that way, right?

143
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.030
Zelda is beautiful, but it's
not leading edge graphics. They're

144
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.350
not going all out. It's
just a better It's it's

145
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.920
last year's graphics. They're saying
that it started being designed

146
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.750
in, in what, 2015, you
know, it's, it is a

147
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.550
portable, we, you, right at
this point, it's gotta Older

148
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.830
than that. So knowing they
couldn't get much more powerful

149
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.650
than the, we, you, what
they did was they Moore's

150
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.470
law to drive down costs
and to drive downsize and

151
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.280
power consumption so they can
get a reasonable price, portable

152
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.230
version of a we, you
with the screen built in,

153
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.410
right? Don't go to the
edges of compute all the

154
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.710
time. Don't go mental on
the, on the GPU, but

155
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.950
creative, right? Give enough room
that we can make something

156
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.800
pretty and spend more of
your energy, making something with

157
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.710
a great story. That's fun
to play than going for

158
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:26.450
the perfect realism. Nobody cares
just how perfectly somebody Bleeds.

159
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.810
Right? That is a really
valid point. People keep bringing

160
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.210
up things like, Oh, it
doesn't do 4k. And I'm

161
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.890
like really 4k in a
tablet that I carry around.

162
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.900
That is, that is thick.
Exactly. You see that monitor

163
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:47.420
behind me? That's that? 43
inch Dell fork. Okay. Okay.

164
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.680
So that's a four K
monitor at 120 DPI. So

165
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.840
you can actually use the
full resolution and I'll tell

166
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.600
you something that's as big
as you ever want a

167
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.130
monitor. 43 inches is awfully
big when you've got stuff

168
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.310
up in the corners of
that screen. It's a long,

169
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.600
Yup. I think that this
is, this is a seven

170
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.340
20 P screen. It's 180
odd DPI when you're holding

171
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.890
it. Yep. I'm, I'm sitting
here next to a 35

172
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.520
inch screen when you dock
it, it goes to 909

173
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.240
rather than seven 20. And
not, don't not 10 80

174
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.550
either, which is not 10
80. And then there's a

175
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.130
couple of complaints about frame
rate. I guess the frame

176
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.830
rate is locked to 20
tries to hit 30. Maybe

177
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.850
if it's like in the
rain and it's covered and

178
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.840
you're in a grassy field
and you're being attacked by

179
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.650
a dozen and you know,
goblins, it might slow down

180
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.690
the frame rate, but this
whole thing where I'm going

181
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.330
to somehow dismiss an entire
new launch because it's not

182
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.750
60 frames Silly. And there's
always a group of people

183
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.540
that, and they're the tweakers
and the tuners, right? The

184
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.580
folks that are pushing against
the limits all the time

185
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.080
on their own machines. It's
like, if you're not doing

186
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.630
that, then what are you
doing? Here's the real question.

187
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.990
Is that fun? Are you
having a good time? Clean

188
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.430
it? That's what I look
for in a game. Yeah.

189
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.880
It's lose your marriage fund.
It is like I was

190
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.070
in here plan. The kids
were down. It was nine

191
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.310
o'clock last night. My wife
was like, you know, come

192
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.690
out and we'll watch a
show. Right. I blinked. And

193
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.330
it was one in the
morning. And you had not

194
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.100
watched the show your wife
had given up and you

195
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.560
had gone to bed and
you were going to have

196
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.280
a bad morning. I tell
ya. And it's bad. But

197
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.010
at the same time, that's
the level of immersion that

198
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.030
you only get with quality
game design. Yep. That I

199
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.470
am experiencing that on a
daily basis with Twitch. It's

200
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:47.450
it's almost like calling sick
fun. Oh no, no. It's

201
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.220
a, she said that. No,
I know, I know it's

202
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.030
concerning, but at the same
time, like I was, I

203
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.180
was tweeting earlier about all
the different things that it

204
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.030
is. It's right. It's the
feeling that you get with

205
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.410
a grand theft auto it's
the puzzles of portal. It's

206
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.130
the scope of a shadow
of the Colossus, which is

207
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.700
a freaking 15 year old
game. It's the open world

208
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.780
of grand theft auto. Right?
It's it's Skyrim where, I

209
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:22.390
mean, I'm, I'm on, it's
only 900, 900, 900 horizontal

210
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.660
lines or seven 20 P.
But I'm having moments of

211
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.200
like breathtaking. Like you come
up over that mountain and

212
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.650
you kind of go Holy
crap, because what it doesn't

213
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.140
have in high Rez, it
has an a, what's the

214
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:41.320
word? What's it called? Not,
not field the distance. Like

215
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.140
there's no depth of field,
but there's no, there's no

216
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.150
pop in. It's not like,
Oh, you know, it can

217
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.790
only, it can only draw,
you know, mountains when you

218
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.380
get close to them and
then a mountain pops in

219
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.630
front of you. It doesn't
happen. Right. You know, it's

220
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.750
the, it's the inventory of
like a Bard's tale and

221
00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:01.300
Skyrim. It's just a freaking
perfect game. It's just cause

222
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.520
if you're a play just
cause where you're running around,

223
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:09.490
you know, like you I've
even forgotten honestly what I'm

224
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.740
supposed to be doing right
now. Like I know that,

225
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.920
I know that there's a
main, what's the word? There's

226
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.630
like a main quest, right?
Yeah. Primary story. I know

227
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.270
there's a main quest. I'm
completely ignoring it. I have

228
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.970
no idea what I'm supposed
to be working on And

229
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.190
off the beaten path. You
know, the last game that

230
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.400
really did that to me
was fallout. Yeah. I've heard

231
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.590
that. Yeah. Follow three was
good for that. You know,

232
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.480
you're on the main storyline
and then you pop into

233
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.820
a village and there's some
mystery going on in that

234
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.370
village. And next thing you
know, you've played three hours

235
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.710
dealing with that mystery that
had nothing to do with

236
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.200
the primary. You know that.
So I was in a

237
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.100
village yesterday and like a
little kid runs by like

238
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.920
a nine year old. And
he says, Hey, if you

239
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.580
can get a Traveler's sword
and, and show it to

240
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.670
me, then I'll give you
something. And I ran off

241
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.830
looking for that, you know,
and now, and then I

242
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.870
bring it back. And if
like with all good quests,

243
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.270
she's like, well, if you
can show me this and

244
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.910
now it's, you know, he's,
one-upping wants to see something

245
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.780
else has nothing. It's a
side quest. Totally useless, but

246
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.960
I'm climbing. Oh. And then
yesterday I spent freaking three

247
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.700
hours trying to climb rocks
that were wet. Apparently you

248
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.760
can't climb walks when it's
raining. So then I'm like,

249
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.610
this is unacceptable. I'm trying
to figure out if there's,

250
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.070
so then there's like, well
there's special climbing pants that

251
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.680
you can get. That'll let
you climb the wet rocks.

252
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.520
Oh my God. It's just
a blast. And of course

253
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.870
I can't let the kids
see it or I'll never

254
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.500
see my kids again. Yeah.
It's awful. Someone who's commenting

255
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.660
on your microphone. They said,
it's as big as your

256
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.660
head. It's very special. My
head what's going on? What

257
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.930
is, why is that microphone?
So what is that? It's

258
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.390
like a piece of foam
around An 80, 2020 in

259
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.760
here. And then this is
a chaotic eyeball and it's

260
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.180
called an eyeball. Yeah. It's
called the chaotic eyeball. And

261
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.730
it is both a pop
filter and a foam baffle.

262
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.750
So it stops the audio
reflections from the wall behind

263
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.670
me from hitting the microphone.
Again, it just absorbs it

264
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.220
all. So it gives me
a really nice flat, you

265
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.180
know, crisp sound without having
to do conditioning to the

266
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.150
whole room. This is basically
a sound booth around the

267
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.090
mine. It says here, the
alternative to a sound booth,

268
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.640
it acoustically treats your space.
They have a very nice

269
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.170
website with a cool scrolly
thing that shows exactly how

270
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.150
it gets in. It's actually,
it looks like it is

271
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.260
dense. It is not. It's
an empty open space. Yeah.

272
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.360
It means it's a ball.
It's a ball with a

273
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.890
hole in the middle of
it. And that this front

274
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.040
piece comes off. Like it's
a, it's an interesting device

275
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.430
and it's kind of expensive
for a ball of foam,

276
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.520
you know, 200 bucks. But
I needed it when the

277
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.560
basement flooded. I mean, I'm
back in my basement. It's

278
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.260
been more than a year,
still lots of work going

279
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.240
on down here. It's taken
a long time. So when

280
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.780
I was upstairs, I absolutely
had to have this. And,

281
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.970
and I just sorta got
used to it. I like

282
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.060
it rather than just a
regular pop filter, have the,

283
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.080
the eyeball on the whole
thing. And it looks like

284
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.050
something out of portal, which
makes me happy. It does.

285
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.800
Yeah. Actually speaking of portal,
Zeldas got all this everything's

286
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.810
orange and blue. Whenever you're
doing the puzzles, it's orange

287
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.460
keeping. I keep wanting to
open a portal. Zelda born

288
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.030
in colors. Yeah. Yeah. There
a guy just put in

289
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.390
the chat here that there's
an article about in independent

290
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.350
devs being treated like royalty,
bine and Tinto by Nintendo.

291
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.980
Cause I mean, I I've
worked with game developers for

292
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.650
many, many years and I
had a bunch of friends

293
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.920
who worked with Nintendo found,
found them very challenging to

294
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.600
work with, but that was
a number of years ago.

295
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.680
If they've clued in to
this idea, that indie games

296
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.540
are the thing that this
is what will make the

297
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.570
world a better place. That's
going to shape up the

298
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.120
market in a big way.
That's how I've always felt

299
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.310
like an intended was kind
of stuck. Like how were

300
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:56.410
they the real original incumbents
right from the NES in

301
00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.070
the eighties on forward, right?
Mario is more than 20

302
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.770
years old. How are they
going to be modern? If

303
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.290
they can crack crackly, the
indie market, they're going to

304
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.960
be on top of the
world. Have you, have you

305
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.480
heard of shovel night? Have
you played shovel night? I

306
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.430
have not. It's like, it's
this perfect little pixel 2d

307
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.480
platformer with a nice story
about a night. And he

308
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.780
carries a shovel. If you're
a played like ghouls and

309
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.150
goblins or goals and ghosts,
it's kind of like that,

310
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.170
but it's very, very, pixely
very Metroid and it's got

311
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:34.180
some of the smartest leveling
platforming that, that I've ever

312
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:39.370
seen. And it's, it's kind
of a nice palette cleanser

313
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.860
that you can play on
the switch. It also is

314
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.640
on Xbox or a three
D S and basically shovel

315
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.160
Knight is everywhere. And it's
one of those little, you

316
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.560
know, kind of indie studio
games. That, that is the

317
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.710
way that we remembered two
D games for 20 years

318
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.880
ago. Yeah. So it's a
modern eight version of interpretation

319
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.730
of an eight bit game.
It is. It's very well

320
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.710
said because if you went
and looked at a real

321
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.400
eight bit game, they aren't
that they're not like, you

322
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.000
know what I mean? Like
lower than yes. Your memory

323
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.290
of what an eight bit
game, like the little, the

324
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:17.090
complexity levels. Yeah. But there's
this kind of new Renaissance

325
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.870
in toody and polished to
the action games. And I

326
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.050
think it's like eight bucks
now on, on various small

327
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.230
things. And now, because that
was a huge hit from

328
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.050
this company called a yacht
club. And now they're doing

329
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.570
like sequels and prequels and
they're building into the story

330
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.740
about this little cute little
night with a, an accident.

331
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.310
I've got him, I've got
an amoeba here. I'll show

332
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:42.500
you of this cute little
night with a shovel. Nice.

333
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.870
You know, and he's just
like, he's got like horns

334
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.420
on his head and shovel
and he's doing his thing.

335
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:52.220
So I like that on
the it's very Wagner ask

336
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.590
it is, it is. I
like on the switch that

337
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.230
I can play something that's
3d, like Zelda that's open-world

338
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.780
or something that's like today,
I'm really hoping they do

339
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.040
the virtual console thing so
that I could get, you

340
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.320
know, all the super Nintendo
games. I want an emulator.

341
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.720
Oh, I see. You want
to go back and play

342
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.030
a bunch of re remind
yourself of us to how

343
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.930
bad those old games actually
were. Yeah. Yeah. They definitely

344
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.900
don't hold up, but I've
got the virtual console on

345
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.960
my three DS, which allows
me to buy legally, you

346
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.310
know, super Nintendo games like
Mario. And what's the other,

347
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.300
one's us Metroid, super Metroid.
You can buy them from

348
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.940
their digital things. So I
think if the switch gets

349
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:38.120
those things, plus, you know,
the usual Hulu, Netflix, then

350
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.710
I think it will become
my tablet. I don't think

351
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.730
I will take my iPad
to the hotel anymore. And

352
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.950
there are people who carry
their PSP that way as

353
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.320
well. So it's like a,
they could turn it into

354
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.460
a contemporary PSP. Yeah. And
I would like a, I

355
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.350
don't want the dock, but
I want a cable to

356
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.940
plug in to the, the
HTMI of the hotel. Right.

357
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.550
Then I'm going to be
carrying my console with me.

358
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.060
Is there any issue my
plug on this switch? Well,

359
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.040
so that's the thing. If
I pull the switch out

360
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.120
right now, it is dark.
And at the bottom here,

361
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.100
there is only USB three.
Pardon me? USB C right

362
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.230
at the bottom of the
Twitch. I'm holding the Twitch

363
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.920
up here. So basically at
the whole thing, the power

364
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:27.500
is USB C. I am
not familiar with how USBC

365
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.770
works. Well, He has enough
bandwidth that it could be

366
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.610
feeding an ACMI output as
well. What, I don't know

367
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.500
how you would do it.
Would you have a, You'd

368
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.820
have to have a little
module that would do the

369
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.160
conversion. So you do need
a module. You need somebody

370
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.720
to like, cause it's doing
HTMI over The SPC. Exactly.

371
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.830
So whatever they're doing, it's
inside the doc. You would

372
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.870
have to have a module
that did that, but it's

373
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.940
probably doable. And you know,
50 bucks, The module, the

374
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.830
doc is nothing. It's nothing.
It's nothing. It's plastic. So

375
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.410
it sounds like that little
box exists in there. Yeah.

376
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.580
I'm hearing you say that
there, there is a possibility

377
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.570
for a, I don't know,
$30, you know, adjustable thing.

378
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:15.030
I'm saying $50, but yeah.
USB. Yeah. And I plug

379
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.840
it into the, the hotel
and you're all set. Yep.

380
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.660
So you look at this,
I hold it up here

381
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.860
and watch you just take
the controllers off. I mean,

382
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.660
that's just gold and they've
really done a great job.

383
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.400
They should see how that
has it. Like a number

384
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.960
two on it. Basically, if
you take it off and

385
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.110
one becomes, one, one becomes
two, then you can hold

386
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.660
them separately as we remote.
But if I plugged them

387
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.510
in and then I just
take the pro controller, which

388
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.850
is over here, it looks
just like an Xbox controller.

389
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.410
Very much like an X
box. And I just push

390
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.840
the button. Those two, the
two little ones shut off

391
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.780
and the big one turns
on and you're all set.

392
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.580
That's awesome. Oh, it's so
good. Battery life. I played

393
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.290
Zelda for, I don't know.
I sat at a McDonald's

394
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.390
with a free soda pop
and played Silva for at

395
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.080
least three hours. Right. And
at that point, your battery

396
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.570
life is now your friend,
when this battery's dead, you

397
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:18.000
should stop. That is a
very, with all due respect,

398
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.710
kind of practical old man
statement, You know, I play

399
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.680
Kerbal space program and it's
got a memory leak and

400
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.930
it's good for about three
or four hours. And then

401
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.410
it crashes and that crashes
my indication. I should stop.

402
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.230
I've been playing For too
long. That is so smart.

403
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.300
I'm going to tweet that
because that's exactly what it

404
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.910
is. I'm really good. It
doesn't have any day, all

405
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.720
day battery life playing for
three or four hours. You

406
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.990
need to go Three things
you should be doing. There's

407
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.950
nobody in the world after
that, battery's dead. Who really

408
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.300
has nothing else. Yeah. That's
smart. Go work in a

409
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.320
soup kitchen. If nothing else.
Right? Another comment here, someone

410
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.090
is asking if this is
my, is this my Logitech

411
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:08.250
Brio camera? Unfortunately, it's not
the people on Twitch stream

412
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.660
Twitch are seeing an old
life cam because what happened

413
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.250
was I'm calling Richard on
lighten this up a little

414
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.620
bit. I'm calling Richard with,
with messenger, which is Facebook

415
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.010
messenger. And I'm my embryo
cam. Then you're getting the

416
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.670
Breo cam, which I could
not get to work with.

417
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.720
I'm using OBS the open
broadcasting studio to send this,

418
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.510
this up to Twitch. The,
the 4k stream that it

419
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:43.110
is sending out was not
compatible. So he says, he

420
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.830
wants to know if I'm
still crushing it. I love

421
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:49.010
it. It is a fantastic
device. Couple of issues though,

422
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.550
if you go and check
out my, my Facebook and

423
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.880
my Facebook, my blog rather,
pardon me, the Breo has

424
00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.260
bad drivers. So every time
you run windows update for

425
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.160
the insider's updates, the prio
will on install itself. The

426
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.610
live cam looks okay. I
appreciate that. But I would

427
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.580
definitely say that the prio
is the superior camera. Yeah.

428
00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.890
I'm in the process of
wiring up my Canon <inaudible>,

429
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.290
which is a four K
video camera that the sort

430
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.390
of professional camera with a
shallow depth of field lens

431
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.400
and all that good stuff.
But I ha I just

432
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.940
got this black magic card
and it'll allow me to

433
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.860
plug it into the computer
and use it as a

434
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.490
gigantic webcam. But I'm waiting
on special The cables as

435
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.880
always black magic card. What
is that? This one, this

436
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.480
one's actually, is it a
tensity pro 4k? Oh, look,

437
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.940
I even have the blocks.
I'm looking here. Black man,

438
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.300
black, black magic design products,
which is the name of

439
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.190
its intensity pro 4k incredible
capture and playback in SD.

440
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.850
So it looks like it's
got DVI and HG. Yep.

441
00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:02.110
DVIU Interesting. So anything that
can spit out HD shows

442
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.450
up as a, as a
video stream. So for example,

443
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.970
if you wanted to do
a, what we're doing right

444
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.810
now in Twitch or broadcasting
studio, Our timing was bad.

445
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.760
My friend, I should have
this working, finding the next

446
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.890
week and I haven't got
it done yet. So I'm

447
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.160
on my surface book camera.
Yeah. So right now, not

448
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.140
only that, just to make
sure that people who are

449
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.280
watching this on video, understand
what's going on here, the

450
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.530
solution we put together to
make this happen is quite

451
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.820
cheesy. I am using open
broadcasting studio to capture a

452
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:36.340
window in that is on
Facebook messenger. You look horrible.

453
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.370
Not only because you're Jay
Peggy, you're lovely. And what

454
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.840
we want to be able
to do though, is figure

455
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.020
out a way to send
that high quality 4k stream,

456
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.900
you know, to OBS directly.
This is the thing about

457
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.210
OBS. I, you know, we
could do four K streams.

458
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.640
I could send a four
K stream to YouTube, you

459
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.130
know, with these different things.
But how do you do

460
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.400
chat? Like this high quality
chat in a, in a,

461
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.270
in a scalable way to
four K streams. Whoo. Yeah.

462
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.280
I don't know, but has
got to do the compositing

463
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.070
and that's where things get
that's where things get messy.

464
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.700
That's where it gets complicated.
That's for sure. Absolutely. So

465
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.130
that's gosh, I didn't mean
to talk about the, talking

466
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.120
about the switch for the
switch. She's awfully good, man.

467
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:21.130
Like you're not alone. There's
lots of people that are,

468
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.050
Can you just tell him
about it? And here's the

469
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.940
thing I said this on
Twitter. I'll say it here.

470
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:30.310
If in fact it doesn't
take off, right. It becomes

471
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.580
the next, the next we
you, with all due respect

472
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:37.900
to both of you about
one, it doesn't matter because

473
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.350
it's a fantastic portable cell.
The machine don't totally okay

474
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.100
with that. And I think
that's the whole, like, how

475
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.170
Do you get a new
machine to sell? It comes

476
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.620
down to that one marquee
game where you have that

477
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.410
moment that says, I just
want to play that. And

478
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.360
it that's enough for me
to want to own this.

479
00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.770
And honestly, all the different
people out there like, Oh,

480
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:02.630
this isn't just by, just
by we, you know, I

481
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.400
mean maybe if you find
one a Goodwill, I mean,

482
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.070
the, we, you was not
as good as the, we,

483
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.060
it didn't happen. It's clunky,
it's chunky. And additionally, the,

484
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.850
we, you version of Zelda
provides no additional. We, you,

485
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.010
you know, game pad specific
behavior, it's not, we use

486
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.950
custom. If this thing gets,
gets Netflix gets Hulu, gets

487
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.800
Amazon prime gets any kind
of play video off of

488
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.810
a USB key. And the
one thing I am worried

489
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.960
about actually, the cloud saved,
there is no cloud save

490
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.650
right now. So I'm on
a tight rope out there

491
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:41.750
in the world with 16
hours into Zelda. You know

492
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.340
what I mean? Every time
I save, I'm like, I

493
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.490
hope I'm not in somebody's.
For-loop where they're going to

494
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.740
destroy my saved game and
I'm going to be screwed.

495
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.760
So other than that, if
they fix those things, I'm

496
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.590
going to be, it's going
to be gold. I am

497
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.360
very happy with my purchase
bought with my allowance. What

498
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.340
did you say by allowance?
Did you give up to

499
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.750
have this Chipotle? I did
a blog. If you go

500
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:09.830
to hanselman.com/blog right now, I've
got a thing I'm trying

501
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.730
to get my relationship book
done again. Right. And I,

502
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.310
so I wrote up my
wife and my allowance system

503
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.880
for adults that justifies the
purchasing of things like this.

504
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.510
I pay myself first in
cash when the cash is

505
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:28.190
gone. So I have actually
been walking around with twenties

506
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:32.570
with $300 in twenties in
preparation, to be able to

507
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.400
buy this thing, but to
buy it, to be clear,

508
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.220
to buy it. Guilt-free right.
To buy us, to buy

509
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.980
a Nintendo switch. Guilt free
was so important to paid

510
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.180
with cash. No, No credit
card statements coming, nothing paid.

511
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.540
Yeah. And, and when I
brought it home, it was

512
00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:53.020
so great because my wife
did not say like, she,

513
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.920
she didn't go and say,
well, what is this? Or

514
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.890
do we need it? Do
we need another console? No,

515
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.740
we did not need another
console. Nope. I wanted it.

516
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.820
This is my indulgence. Yeah.
And the allowance system is

517
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.240
great. I think you have
similar ideas around finance. You

518
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.360
should be able to buy
things. Guilt-free if you can't

519
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.750
afford them. And this took
me seven weeks of saving

520
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.420
and I bought it. It
was good. Well, and I

521
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.460
tend to use credit cards,
but mostly for the, for

522
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.580
the financial protection, I don't
use them as loans they're

523
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.970
paid every month. Like the
advantage of their credit card

524
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.690
is that it gives you
privileges as a consumer Indeed.

525
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.480
And some people complained and
they said, well, that's silly.

526
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.200
You shouldn't have done that.
You should have used, you

527
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.990
should have used your credit
card to be clear for

528
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.000
big purchases. I do the
same thing. I have a

529
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.360
card, I get miles. But
what I do is I

530
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.100
carry the cash around. Yeah.
And then I give the

531
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.990
cash back to my wife
and then she puts it

532
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.450
on the credit card. Right.
So I, for big stuff,

533
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.130
for little stuff, you know,
I'll go and buy it.

534
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.960
I don't, I don't need
financial protection for a game,

535
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.930
but for the game system,
I carry the money around.

536
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.000
I saved it up. It
gave me, it gave me

537
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.890
something to focus on and
something to look forward to.

538
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.620
I bought the game and
then I gave my wife

539
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.010
the $300. Most important part
of that whole thing. Like

540
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.710
the process, the specific process
is an important that you

541
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:15.540
have a process is that
money is spent mindfully. It's

542
00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.850
just like eating right. Eat
mindfully, spend mindfully. You know,

543
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:25.320
we should do. Maybe the
next, the next podcast we'll

544
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.930
do one on mindfulness, because
I think I had, I

545
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.740
had this conversation today. I
met with a young woman

546
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.370
about career or some career
counseling at lunchtime. And she's

547
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.110
trying to figure out which
direction to take her technical

548
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.710
career. And honestly, as long
as you're doing it with

549
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.090
some consciousness, some mindfulness, as
opposed to just letting your

550
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.000
life happen by default. Well,
you're always going to have

551
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.310
three or four options. Are
you saying no to the

552
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.990
options that don't take you
to the direction you want

553
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.710
to go to? Right. I
mean, that's the biggest thing

554
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:59.010
is it's only a handful
of decisions that shape Career.

555
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.060
Yeah. You just add the
problem is you don't get

556
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.970
to think about them for
very long. When the opportunity

557
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.880
comes, you have to have
already thought about them. You

558
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.840
already need to know what
is yes for you before

559
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.640
you agree to going to
be able to make the

560
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.810
decision when it needs to
be made. Yup. Exactly. Actually,

561
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.520
I'm going to write a
blog post about this. It's

562
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.910
funny. So I just, I
just Googled myself ever do

563
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.030
this. I Google myself just
to see not myself, but

564
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.940
like I Googled life happens
by default to see if

565
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.010
I had written about it
before. Cause at some point

566
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.410
I might have written about
it. You've written so many

567
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.360
blog posts that that's for
the, I have that problem

568
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.270
with, You know what I
mean? Like I'm like Richard

569
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.400
that's right. I should write
a blog post about that.

570
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.240
And then I'm like, well,
have I written that blog

571
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.290
post before? So I have
not a very nice person

572
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.680
named Paul Apostolos did write
about that because apparently I've

573
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.980
said this before on the
show, so I'm going to

574
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.870
write a supporting blog post
and then link to his

575
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.850
site. That's very nice. But
yeah, mindfulness is so important

576
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.480
and yeah, maybe, maybe I
should have used some on

577
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.250
this podcast. Ah, you know,
But the Hansel minutia is

578
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.690
we've done over the years.
My friend, we've done a

579
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.870
bunch, many of the most
fun ones. Where, what are

580
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:20.190
you most excited about right
now? I appreciate you. Richard Campbell

581
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:26.550
letting me geek out about
my frivolous ridiculous cash purchase

582
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.590
of my Nintendo switch. That
I'm very excited. This is

583
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.810
also, you know, these are
the phone calls you and

584
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:33.900
I have anyway, when the
recorders aren't around. Right. That's

585
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.390
true. It's entirely possible. While
you were driving back to

586
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.820
Portland from Redmond, you could
have phoned me and said,

587
00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.290
we have talked about the
switch The whole way. Yeah.

588
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.830
I just, I will talk
about it with anyone. It's

589
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.200
so thoughtful. It's just a,
it's just a beautiful little

590
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.590
piece of hardware. It's and
I'm going to write up,

591
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.110
like I got these little
rubber, little, little things you

592
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:57.080
can improve. I like this
thing to about, about consumer

593
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.000
hardware. Now these are little,
little rubber covers know covers,

594
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.930
but they're not just covers.
It's got a little depth

595
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.360
to it. So it's it's
it gives it a grip.

596
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.600
Nice. Like a fat grip
for your hands. And I

597
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.310
don't think I could use
the switch without it. It

598
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.050
would hurt my, and now
it won't slide off a

599
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.820
table. Like it's it's tracks.
Exactly. It's tractioning that's good

600
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.710
idea. So that is, that
is our show. And I

601
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.740
appreciate your, your use of
your time. You know what?

602
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.660
I been too long since
we chatted like that. So

603
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.540
I'm glad we did indeed.
Now I'm going to turn

604
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.550
on my radio voice. I'll
do it and then maybe

605
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.910
you can do it after.
Okay. Okay. You ready? This

606
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.820
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes. We'll see you

607
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.340
again. Next week. This has
been another episode. We'll see

608
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.690
you again. Next week. I
may use that as my

609
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:55.090
new thing. <inaudible>.
