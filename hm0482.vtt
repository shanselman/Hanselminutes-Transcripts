our weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.500
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 82. In this

10
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.430
episode, Scott talks with technical
project manager and conference speaker,

11
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.570
and Juan Simmons about fan culture
and the rise of nerd

12
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.110
land. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

13
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.870
of Hansel minutes. And today
I'm talking with Anne Juan Simmons.

14
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.410
By the time you hear
this recording, he will have

15
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.140
spoken at code cough. That's
coming up for you in

16
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.500
Tennessee. Is that right? That's
right. Yep. And you give

17
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.620
talks all over. And when
I met you, you were

18
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.930
talking at South by Southwest.
We've been there together a

19
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.830
couple of times. Yep, absolutely.
And what's your, what's your

20
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.300
day job? I am a
software project manager and I

21
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.050
manage a set of developers
who are really very talented

22
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.380
and I help them deliver
software on time and on

23
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.080
budget. And you said that
like a true software development

24
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.680
manager, like you and I
have had this discussion before

25
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.640
that we are, I don't
know, nerds, geeks, geeks, we're

26
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.520
techies. We, we, we, our
brains operate a certain way

27
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.980
and that has caused some
challenges in interacting with, with

28
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.980
other people, particularly our significant
others. That is correct. We

29
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.130
are married to normals and
it's, it's fun to see

30
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.130
how that plays out. What
kind of things have you

31
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.440
have you bumped into? I
mean, is your wife? I

32
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.620
know she's, she's extremely accomplished
in her own, right, but

33
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.680
she's not, I assume taking
apart the remote control on

34
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.320
a regular basis. No, she
throws the remote control to

35
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.600
me to take it apart.
And then I throw it

36
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.170
back to her once I
fixed it. So you, you

37
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.850
like me? Are it support
for the house? Absolutely. I

38
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.970
feel like my wife does
not appreciate the work that's

39
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.450
involved in keeping a home
network running at peak capacity,

40
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.560
nor does my she's just
simply complaints about why haven't

41
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.450
you fixed this yet? Come
on. You're a tech guy.

42
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.460
Get it done. Yeah. I,
my friend saran who runs

43
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.060
a code newbies, her husband
when I met saran Serrano

44
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.550
of course, is a programmer
and she's highly technical. So

45
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.580
I just assumed that her
husband would not be, I

46
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.240
just assumed that geeks Mary
normals, you know, so I

47
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.770
figured she's super techie. He'll
be, he'll be not. They

48
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.160
are, they're equally techie, which
is amazing. Cause the tech

49
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.650
that runs their house is
so much more powerful. And

50
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.230
I keep thinking if I
could just get my significant

51
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.200
other to be more techie,
like there'd be no end

52
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.140
to what we could accomplish
as far as like, you

53
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.580
know, in the house. Yeah.
But with my wife, wife,

54
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.120
that ship sailed a long
time ago. So yeah, she

55
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.960
actually started out studying comps
high and she, after I

56
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.020
think one semester she did.
Okay. But she realized immediately,

57
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.330
this is not for me.
So she switched to MIS,

58
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.540
which is a much more
sensible degree to get from

59
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.740
undergrad. What does MIS management
information systems? Ah, okay. Well,

60
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.870
this is interesting though. Cause
you have two managers in

61
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.540
the house now, how does
that work? It means that

62
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.610
there are two cooks in
the kitchen and sometimes the

63
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.250
cooking is burned. So I,
it works well. And I

64
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.730
think that even though my
wife is decidedly normal, she

65
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.390
is an extremely intelligent woman.
She has a PhD PhD

66
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.980
in business and we are
able to compliment each other

67
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.990
and a lot of areas
to spite the fact that

68
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.980
she has no heart nor
no idea about geek culture

69
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.220
or how nerd land works.
You know, that's, it's very,

70
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.090
very similar situation. My wife
has a, master's an MBA

71
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.970
and she's working on now,
her third degree getting a,

72
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.810
a, a bachelor's of science
and nursing also she'll be

73
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.650
done in August. So there's
basically nothing I can tell

74
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.070
her. I'm allowed to reboot
the router. That's the extent

75
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.170
of what I'm allowed to
do. Yeah. So I can't

76
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.200
tell her anything. And what
kind of ongoing challenges like

77
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.090
I've been married 15 years.
I know you've been married

78
00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.060
as long, 13 years and
some change. Right. So, you

79
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.370
know, it, it obviously it's
working, right. What do you

80
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.850
think that we, we can
learn from people who are

81
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.690
in similar kind of mixed
relationships between geeks and normals

82
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.890
and could we have anything
to teach them? I think

83
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.680
that one of the things
is to just like a

84
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.740
lot of advice is the
first step is to admit

85
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.640
that you have a problem.
And so let me give

86
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.970
you an example of how
much of a normal my

87
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.540
wife is. If I pulled
my wife to the side

88
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.800
and just said, Hey, babe,
if I said three names

89
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.340
of people, and if you
just tell me how these

90
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.990
related, or is there any
relationship? And I said, Picard,

91
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.550
Riker, Troy. She would say,
I have no idea what

92
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.850
you're talking about. Are these
new types of shoes or

93
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.400
so she has no understanding
at all of geek culture.

94
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.990
So I have resigned myself
to the fact that these

95
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.840
are things that even though
I love them deeply, and

96
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.450
there are a big part
of who I am, that

97
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.940
that's something that we simply
can't share. So I think

98
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.330
admitting that there's a problem
is the first step and

99
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.100
making peace with that. Interesting.
Does she sit with you

100
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.920
though and watch these shows
with disinterest or have you

101
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.140
just decided after 13 years
of marriage that you just

102
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.170
best to go to the
movies by yourself? I have

103
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.570
decided that it's best that
I go to the movies

104
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.090
by myself or with other
geek friends. So let me

105
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.290
give you an example. We
went to see, I believe

106
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.910
it was the last iron
man before the age of,

107
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.360
of old trine. And I
just look at my wife

108
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.460
and, you know, iron man
three was okay. Not my

109
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.520
favorite one. I liked the
first one the best still,

110
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.190
but I just looked over
at her and just, she

111
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.190
was just in pain. It
was like agony and I

112
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.040
felt so bad. Like I'm
enjoying this movie. And while

113
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.110
I look over at my
wife and she is so

114
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.510
not enjoying the movie, that
it makes my enjoyment of

115
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.750
the movie very, very limited.
And so I've learned that,

116
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.390
okay, look, babe, I'm glad
you're here. There's no one

117
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.520
else. I would rather watch
a movie with other than

118
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.250
you. But I think that
from now on, I'm just

119
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.490
going to go with my
boys and then we'll, you

120
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.860
know, we'll find some movie
that we both enjoy. So,

121
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.540
so I think that coming
to that knowledge of there's

122
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.790
a certain things that she
is so not into it,

123
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.460
even though she very Kylie
wants to experience them with

124
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.890
me, it just best to
this to often just let

125
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.230
her stay at home and
let me do other things

126
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.390
with other people. Yeah. You
know, in early, early on

127
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.520
in the marriage, a couple,
two, three years, you know,

128
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.170
you want, you have no
kids and you're a couple

129
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.850
of years in, you want
to spend all your time

130
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.970
together and you want to
share everything that makes you,

131
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.810
you with the other person.
And then if you discover

132
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.330
that they're not into something
you want to push harder

133
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.800
and like, I, no, but
you really think if you

134
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.970
just spend some time watching
Firefly, you would understand why

135
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.150
it has all the answers,
you know, in life and

136
00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.680
you push and you push
and you push, but you're

137
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.190
right. Somewhere, your relationship reaches
a level of maturity and

138
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.200
it's like, you know, it's
okay to like stuff on

139
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.620
my own. Absolutely. And there
are things that she's really

140
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.120
into then I'm not into,
she likes tennis. So Serena

141
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.100
Williams is one of her
favorite heroes and I like

142
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.810
Sabrina. I think she's cool.
I think it's great that

143
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.290
she's won so many matches,
but I could go without

144
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.170
saying several of them, but
I'll sit next to her

145
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.930
on the couch and I'll
watch some of the matches

146
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.740
and understand that, okay, she's
into this and therefore I'll

147
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.660
go into it with her.
Yeah. It is a lonely

148
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.080
though sometimes because you'll see
something or read something and

149
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.480
then you'll turn to your
partner and you're like, but

150
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.080
look, this is, you know,
and then there's nothing, there's

151
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.450
I find this a lot
with comics, you know, I'll

152
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.180
read comics in bed and
she's reading something. I don't

153
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.890
know if you're reading a
nursing manual or she reading

154
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.800
some nonfiction or something. And
then we'll say like, did

155
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.800
you just, just see what
happened? And there's just no

156
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.070
interest. It's unfortunate. But what
we have been able to

157
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.180
do though, is find genres
that we can share. So

158
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.860
I thought it was one
of those things where we're

159
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.750
always going to read different
kinds of books and always

160
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.060
see different kinds of movies.
But I've learned that my

161
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.810
wife loves action movies. So
like the Expendables is one

162
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.930
of her most favorite series
of movies. And while it's

163
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.090
not Saifai or geek, it's
pretty ridiculous. So I, I

164
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.120
appreciate that, you know? Yeah.
And I think that my

165
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.370
wife and I also enjoy
a good action flag. She

166
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.060
likes more actions slash drama.
And so it can't just

167
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.960
be all guns blazing and
folks jumping all around killing

168
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.870
folks. But I think that
if there's a plot, if

169
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.340
there's a little bit of
drama, then she and I

170
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.560
can both enjoy and movie.
So she would hate the

171
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.920
Expendables, but she will like
some movie where there's a

172
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.850
little bit more, I think
a plot. We actually, one

173
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.130
of the ones that we
really got geeked out together

174
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.060
about was John wick with
canneries. We have not seen

175
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.510
that. It's like, you know,
it's just, it's, it's got

176
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.000
a plot, but it's also
got feeling and there's like,

177
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.360
he's got a pet, a
pet. So there's, there's this

178
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.940
grabby toss. And then there's
the, you know, his relationship

179
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.790
with his wife and how
that informs all of his,

180
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.240
you know, butt kicking that
he does. Interesting. You know,

181
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.230
actually one movie that my
wife loved and I was

182
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.540
shocked because this is another
one where I think we'll

183
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.030
have to drag her to
the movie theater was ex

184
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:24.110
Mokena. She loved ex macula.
And that is so geeky

185
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.390
that I was like, what?
But it was done in

186
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.450
a way where the technology
was really in the background.

187
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.810
It was more about the
plot and the ideas. So

188
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.740
I think that if there
are really cerebral, really deep

189
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.630
movies that are geeky, then
I can get her to

190
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.540
go show I actually enjoyed.
Is it that it's often

191
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.330
tough to find that mix?
Yeah. My wife was like

192
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.990
that about, that will be
her when the guy falls

193
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.280
in love with Siri, Right.
R Scott at Johansen. Yes.

194
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.920
And, and that, that got
her, got her thinking. Oh,

195
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.430
and then the time Traveler's
wife, We haven't seen that.

196
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.550
Okay. I'll have to try
that. Okay. That's a great,

197
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.640
great movie. Great book, just
an all in all great

198
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.640
experience. So we find, we
find ways to come together

199
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.770
on stuff like that. I
do wish though that I

200
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.190
could take her to a
comic book convention, you know,

201
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.950
but fortunately we have kids,
so I take them and

202
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.040
they think that's the greatest
thing ever. Absolutely. And that's

203
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.560
one saving grace up. If
you are married to our

204
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.090
normal and you re reproduce,
then you hopefully have kids

205
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.730
that have geek DNA. And
my kids love that stuff.

206
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.940
I mean, there are into
geek culture. I took my

207
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:37.940
comic book collection that I
started collecting in 1981. So

208
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.220
I have a few really
good issues. And so they're

209
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.920
still wrapped in the asset
free bags and with the

210
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.890
cardboard backing and I put
them on my boys' walls.

211
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.280
And so I've covered the
entire wall where comics from

212
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.770
the eighties and nineties. And
so there's a lot of

213
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.710
Spire demand, a lot of
X man, cause I was

214
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.340
really into those titles. And
so I felt that I

215
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.970
was passing, passing my childhood
on to them. And so

216
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.310
my kids often say, well,
can you know, can I

217
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.500
read that? I'm like, Nope,
you're not ready for that

218
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.810
yet, but it's on the
wall and I'll take it

219
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.910
down. We'll read it together
when you're ready. Cause I

220
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.610
have, you know, Punisher and
have some, some more adult

221
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:17.080
titles on, on their wall,
but they see that, Hey,

222
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.030
the things that are, that
they're making movies out of

223
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.720
now that wasn't to that,
you know, 20, 25 years

224
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.630
ago. And so that way
we connect over geek culture.

225
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.400
No, that one is one
of the amazing things about

226
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.970
being our, our age, not
to give our ages away,

227
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.610
but to be our age
at this time is that

228
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.510
it almost feels like there's
a vindication of our geekery

229
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.390
from 20, 30 years ago.
Now that they're making all

230
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.140
these movies and you know,
the infinity Wars are coming

231
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.150
and I already know what's
going to happen unless they

232
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.580
change it dramatically. Like, you
know, like we're like looking

233
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.730
at looking for the clues
from our, from our, our

234
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.820
high school years and our
middle school year. And in

235
00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.000
many ways it's not just
filling, been educated, but it's

236
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.550
the fact that we suffer
through the nineties when they

237
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.270
tried to make movies with
nineties technology and it was

238
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.020
horrible. And so it's not
just that we've seen that

239
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.240
Hollywood has come around to
the fact that there are

240
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.340
compelling stories that they can
make and make a lot

241
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.580
of money. But we saw
the many failed attempts over

242
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.160
the past 15 years or
so. And now we're at

243
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.320
the point where the technology
has caught up with the

244
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.020
storytelling. And so we can
enjoy that. So it is

245
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.870
a good feeling to know
that a lot of what

246
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.600
we knew was great when
we were kids and we

247
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.540
were gigs and you know,
people didn't understand it, but

248
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.590
when we see Marvel coming
up with the infinity Wars

249
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.810
and when now they're going
to probably do civil war

250
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.620
and knowing those storylines. Yes,
that is so amazing. Yeah.

251
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.130
Did you watch Daredevil on
Netflix? My wife very much

252
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.790
enjoyed that. I have not.
That's another series that I'm

253
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.710
going to have to check
out there. You know, one

254
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.960
challenge is that there's so
much good TV right now.

255
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.740
There's sensei, there's Daredevil, there's,
you know, game of Thrones,

256
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.960
which is of course more
fantasy, but there's so much

257
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.040
good geek content on both
TV and at the movies

258
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.170
that I can't keep up,
but it's a good problem

259
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.590
to have to say that
there's so much nerd land

260
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:14.040
around here. It's hard to
explore it all. Where do

261
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.860
you, Do you think the
line between nerd land is

262
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.070
nerd culture and geek culture
gone mainstream now, is everyone

263
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:24.540
a geek? I wouldn't say
that everyone is a geek,

264
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.720
but I would say that
people were more geekish. I

265
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.080
think that when you see
what's at the theaters, when

266
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.770
you see what's on TV,
where you see how personal

267
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.850
devices are, where, whether it's
a smartphone or a swatch

268
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.520
in the end of the
Apple, watch a though Apple

269
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.740
won't comment on how many
they've sold. I think that

270
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:48.360
it's become such a, an
iconic figure in terms of,

271
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.700
you know, people like Beyonce
w you know, brought out

272
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.170
the watch, came out, she
was doing photo shoots, wearing

273
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.980
one. I think that geek
culture and the things that

274
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.640
geeks love have become more
of the culture. And I

275
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.400
still think that there's a
ways to go, but I

276
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.040
think that there's far more
acceptance of the, of these

277
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.470
things than there was even
a decade ago. Yeah. My

278
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.630
wife has often asked me,
like, what is a nerd

279
00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.820
or what is it geek?
Because those terms, you know,

280
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.460
have a certain baggage along
with them. They, you know,

281
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.670
they evoke an image of
a specific individual and, you

282
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.550
know, the people in revenge
of the nerds, there's a

283
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.260
nerd or geek monoculture, but
I've been explaining it to

284
00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.110
her to say that it
is to be really, really

285
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.560
enthused about something like you
could be a needle point

286
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.330
geek, you know, or a
car nerd, if that's what

287
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.000
you're really into is that
you're excited about something so

288
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.360
much that it exudes from
you, you know, you overflow

289
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.800
with enthusiasm over that topic.
Absolutely. And I think at

290
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.950
the end of the day,
a gig is a fan.

291
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.610
It is someone who is
really into something, whether that's

292
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.570
new to a point, whether
that's the Avengers or anything

293
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.090
else, I think that you're
really into you're really, you're

294
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.280
really into something to the
degree, to the degree that

295
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.890
you want to know everything
about it. Right? So, you

296
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.930
know, a lot of us
grew up taking apart computers

297
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.840
or televisions because we were
so into electronics that we

298
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.450
had to know how they
worked. And I think that

299
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.520
that is really the essence
of a geek as a

300
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.300
fan. I think that the
Japanese word is otaku, which

301
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.910
is just someone who's really
into something. And so that's

302
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:29.950
the essence of, geekdom just
an, an almost irrational desire

303
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.960
to know something. I want
to take a brief moment

304
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.590
to thank my sponsors sync
fusion this week, the first

305
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.280
and only complete Hadoop distribution
designed for windows is now

306
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.060
available from sync fusion. You
can literally deploy a production

307
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.840
ready, big data cluster in
minutes. This revolutionary big data

308
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.030
platform will not only change
the way that you approach

309
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.260
big data, but it is
100% free for everyone with

310
00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.100
free commercial support for sync
fusion, plus members learn more

311
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:06.970
at sync, fusion.com/big. I think
that's great. The saying that

312
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.930
it's being a fan. I,
the boys were really into

313
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.850
this book when they were
like, I think four years

314
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.790
old or five years old,
it's called Joey fly private

315
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.370
eye. And it was just
all about this actual fly

316
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.980
who was a private eye.
And they thought it was

317
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.200
the greatest thing ever. And
they read the book and

318
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.750
they talked about it for
weeks and, you know, that's

319
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.810
where it could have ended,
but I encourage them to

320
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.200
send a letter to the
author of joy fly private

321
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.110
eye. So they agonized over
it for a week and

322
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.450
they wrote it in crayon
and they sent this, you

323
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.250
know, we really like your
book and will you please

324
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.760
make more? And the, the
author of this, this children's

325
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.750
book sent them a picture
of them as flies as

326
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.160
bugs. And that is now
up on their, you know,

327
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.400
behind glass it's we framed
it. So it seems like,

328
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.780
you know, you can read
a book and enjoy it,

329
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.160
but if you're going to
be a fan, you know,

330
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.450
you're, you're writing fan fiction,
you're sending, sending fan mail.

331
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.950
And when he sent back
that letter to them, they

332
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:10.010
cemented their fandom for forever.
That is amazing. And that

333
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.590
brings up something that I
think is cool to live

334
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.650
in this new era of
geekness. And that is the

335
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:19.700
such a, there is so
much more access to the

336
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.510
creators and your sons use,
I assume, you know, snail

337
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:27.740
mail to do it. But
for example, I purchased for

338
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.460
my daughter, a combo book
series called Prince lists, which

339
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.450
is about, I love Christmas.
And I bought Prince lists,

340
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.870
sorry, Prince Les. And I
give it to my daughter.

341
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.050
And then I tweeted a
picture of my daughter reading

342
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:46.490
the first volume and the
author of Prince less retweeted

343
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.710
that, and we exchanged a
couple of tweets and I

344
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.920
was like, wow, this is
something where, and this happened

345
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.030
literally within hours where I
am, I have introduced my

346
00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.050
daughter to something that is
really written for her and

347
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.890
with her, with her in
mind. And then the creator

348
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.460
of that work has connected
with me. And I think

349
00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.390
that is so awesome to
have the ability to connect

350
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.550
with the people who are
creating speakers. You know, when

351
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.920
I was reading Marvel comics,
there's no way I could

352
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.380
connect with a writer or
an artist, or it will

353
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.260
be really difficult because there's
only so much snail mail

354
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.600
and that someone can read,
but now whether it is

355
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.840
through Twitter or even email
or others, you know, social

356
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.700
media, the barriers to connection
between the creator and that

357
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.990
people who consume that content
are much more lower or

358
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.970
are much lower. Yeah. That
the, the barrier to entry,

359
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.370
like before you send a
snail mail, and you assume

360
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.920
that there's a pile of
snail mail is sitting unread

361
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.730
in your favorite writers, you
know, workroom, and they're never

362
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.990
going to get to you,
or if they do it's

363
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:53.240
luck. Exactly. Yeah. I've had
that, those experiences more than

364
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.290
once. And, you know, you,
you feel like you're building

365
00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.960
a relationship, even though you're
really kind of not you're,

366
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.200
you're, it's a fan, it's
a safe relationship. You know,

367
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.890
I read a comic book
by a comic artist named

368
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.120
Fu Richardson called genius. And
it did the exact same

369
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.910
thing. I tweeted about how
great it was. And then

370
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.700
a couple days later, there's
there she is. And then

371
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.740
you start looking at who
she follows and you're like,

372
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.810
Oh, wow, this is a
cool person. Like, this is

373
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.810
a human out there doing
really great work. And then

374
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.970
it makes you want to
support their work and, and

375
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.880
do other things you can.
Absolutely. And I think that

376
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.580
if I was a creator
of any kind of work,

377
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.150
especially if it's artistic in
nature, then it would behoove

378
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.270
me to use this media
platform to connect when people

379
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.390
reach out to me to
reach out to them. I

380
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.740
think that it's both in
the benefit, both redounds to

381
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.160
the benefit of both the
creator and the person who

382
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.140
is a fan. And so
this is just a great

383
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.990
time to be alive and
to be experiencing the spread

384
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.450
of geek culture, Absolutely being
able to find the communities

385
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.150
before they were just in
forums or in certain CompuServe

386
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.420
rooms. But now if you're
into something, you're going to

387
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.040
be able to find people
that are into it as

388
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.730
well. And I also think
that there's a, what's the

389
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.420
word, there's an acceptance of
geek culture more than before.

390
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.690
I always felt isolated because
I was really into things

391
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.240
like comics. But now it
seems like if you are

392
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.760
into something for the most
part, you know, kids that

393
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.740
I, at least my nieces
and nephews, they're not being

394
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.620
teased in high school for
being into something. They just

395
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.670
are everyone's into something. I
totally agree. And I think

396
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.740
that that is one other
benefit of having this wide

397
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.810
set of tools that people
can use to connect whether

398
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.740
it's in the lunchroom at
school, where kids and I

399
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.420
agree are very rarely teased
for being into stuff. Whether

400
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.750
there are online forums, whether
there are Facebook groups or

401
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.800
there's tools like Slack or
a flow doc, where you

402
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.320
can form a group of
people who are interested in

403
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.720
a certain topic and you
can just geek out on

404
00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.610
it. And I think that
this is a great time,

405
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.220
especially for young people where,
you know, when you and

406
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.800
I were growing up, it
was very tough to be

407
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.320
a geek. And you were
ostracized for being into Dungeons

408
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.980
and dragons or comic books.
And I think that our

409
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.830
children and the ones who
come after them, we live

410
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.830
in a much more open
and accepting world where if

411
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.380
you're really into something that's
cool, people will agree with

412
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.700
that. And probably say that,
that, that, that, that, that's

413
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.560
a good thing. And have
you found that to be

414
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.360
the case with you with,
with the things that you

415
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.250
introduced, like, you know, to
your, to your daughter, is

416
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.190
she into stuff and then,
and not getting any hassle

417
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.730
for it? Absolutely. My daughter,
like I said, she can

418
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.580
take her Pence lists come
and book to school and

419
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.250
you get, and she's told
me this, like, Oh, what's

420
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.880
that? Can I read that?
Or when my boys are

421
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.450
into things. And in fact,
they, my sons have found,

422
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:53.040
especially that they are drawn
into more of geek culture

423
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.770
by their friends who they
hang out with. And they're

424
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.880
reading things like obviously Harry Potter
was a great, I think,

425
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.790
force for doing this for
making things that are really

426
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.240
geeky, more mainstream. And there
was a book series called

427
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.600
Percy Jackson that my sons
got really into because a

428
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.210
lot of their friends were
reading that were reading that

429
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.700
title. So I do think
that there is a lot

430
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.410
of acceptance of gay culture
among children, primarily because it's

431
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.740
just so popular. And so
in fact, you're, you are

432
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.830
more than likely the odd
boy out or, or the

433
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.800
odd girl out if you're
not into these things rather

434
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.100
than the opposite. And I
think it's also cool that

435
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.860
there's a lot more diversity
of story. A Prince lists

436
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:39.060
is a great example and
actually true story, literally yesterday,

437
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.630
my seven year old boy,
and I read Prince lists

438
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.910
again, volume one, it's about
a, who basically gets tired

439
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.830
of sitting in a castle.
And she says, I'm just

440
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.760
going to save myself. And
regardless of, of the obvious

441
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.960
no gender interest in that
story, my seven year old

442
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.670
just thought that was really
cool. Cause he was like,

443
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.460
of course, like she's she
sat around. She waited, no

444
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.530
one's coming to save her.
Oh, she'll save herself. It

445
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.740
made total sense. And I'm
hoping that that informs their,

446
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.020
their attitudes towards gender in
the, in the, in the

447
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.750
future. And I think it's
so interesting that not only

448
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:17.080
has gay culture become more
mainstream, but I think geek

449
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.740
culture has become aware of
the need to reflect the

450
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.850
world and not just one
perspective or one demographic group.

451
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.210
And we see a lot
of interesting things being done,

452
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.100
you know, by Marvel with
having a female Thor, we

453
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.850
see the introduction of a
miss Marvel who is Muslim

454
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:38.170
and there are such great
storytelling and, and it's not

455
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.290
some kind of gimmick where,
well, let's just turn Thor

456
00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.720
into a girl and let's
kind of keep telling horror

457
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.780
stories. I think that their
storytelling becomes richer. And they're

458
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:51.970
finding that by embracing a
diverse world by making the

459
00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.510
fantasy world reflective of the
actual world. I think that

460
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.480
they're finding that there's a
lot more ability to tell

461
00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.780
stories that resonate with, with
readers and I've, and I've

462
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.090
been really happy to see
that. And I've been happy

463
00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:08.200
to see that, that embrace
that embracing of the fact

464
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.320
that we all have stories
to tell. And if we

465
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.650
embrace the diversity that's in
the world and reflect that,

466
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:19.450
then storytelling becomes richer. Absolutely.
Absolutely. I think that the

467
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.120
point you made there that
it's not just, Oh, let's

468
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.100
turn this person Brown. Let's
turn that person into a

469
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.790
girl. The stories have to
be good. And not only

470
00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.210
is the storytelling and miss
Marvel where it's a 16

471
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.230
year old Pakistani American fantastic
storytelling because the writer G

472
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.320
Willow Wilson is just amazing
writer. But if you look

473
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.780
at miles Morales, the black
and Latino ultimate Spiderman that

474
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.260
worked because the art was
just amazing. Some of the

475
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.300
best art that I've ever
seen in a comic book

476
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.690
was in the first issues
there of, of ultimate Spiderman.

477
00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.290
But the storytelling was thoroughly
interesting and was not a,

478
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.760
just simply a retelling of
Peter Parker story. Exactly. And I,

479
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.740
and I've seen, I've seen
the same thing with the,

480
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.220
I called her spider Gwen,
right? Where, and this alternate

481
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.040
world where Peter Parker was the
one who died and then

482
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:14.350
Gwen becomes Spiderman, arms shifting
Spiderman, spider Gwen, and you

483
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.850
have this female Spiderman. And
again, they could have did

484
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.580
it where she's exact same
aspiring man, right? This web

485
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.020
singing joke telling a hero.
But I think that if

486
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.770
they've taken a more nuanced
view and I really have

487
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.130
enjoyed following that development in
geek culture, but of course

488
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.940
the reality is that disliked
the rural world. And as

489
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.550
you embrace the real world,
you get into real world

490
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.670
issues. And so with the
fantastic four movie with the

491
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:48.060
choice, make a black human
torch and seeing that backlash,

492
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.490
I think that that's something
that we will continue to

493
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.490
see. And again, being a
father, I find that it's

494
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.900
important to both celebrate the
embracing of diverse points of

495
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.500
view in geek culture, but
to have real conversations about

496
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.020
there are some people who
will be against that and

497
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.080
helping my children navigate that
as part of my role.

498
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.780
And I think that, again,
back to the point of

499
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.650
having a spouse who is
a normal, I think being

500
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.990
able to have those conversations
is something that I can

501
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.900
do where my wife may
struggle to even understand what

502
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.780
the problem is, you know?
Yeah. You know, I don't,

503
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.710
I know that I try
to be an advocate and

504
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.200
an ally for diverse things,
and I have a diverse

505
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.720
family. Therefore I want the
world to be representatively diverse,

506
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.340
but it's comic books. Why
does it matter if human

507
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.650
torch is black or so,
or Thor as a woman?

508
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.770
It seems to me like
Thor was a frog or

509
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.770
a couple of absolutes. You
know, my kids think that

510
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:50.240
spider ham like the pig
Spiderman from an alternate universe

511
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.210
is about the greatest thing
ever if we can't mix

512
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.150
it up and try new
things, then what's the point

513
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.330
like of all those scenarios
that we could do this

514
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.640
fiction would be the place
to do it. I completely

515
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.280
agree. And I think in
a world where Spiderman can

516
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.120
be a ham, Thor can
be a frog where Superman

517
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.430
did all kinds of things
where, and exposed to different

518
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.880
types of kryptonite. Surely we
can expand our imagination a

519
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.240
little bit and see differences
in skin color gender. But

520
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.850
I think that the fact
that it's an issue is

521
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.580
something that is real. It's
something that doesn't make sense

522
00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.610
to me, but that doesn't
mean it's not real. And

523
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.090
I think is something that
I really take seriously in

524
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.690
my role as a parent
to guide kids who do,

525
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.210
like I said before, have
some of my geek DNA

526
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.550
and just help them understand
that there are some people

527
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.310
who see this as a
bad thing. Let's talk about

528
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.580
that and understand what we
can learn from the reaction

529
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.030
of people to this fantasy
world and see can that

530
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.100
better prepare us to deal
with some of those reactions

531
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.980
in the real world. That
is, that is the right

532
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.620
way to go about doing
that. I mean, people talk

533
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.110
when they talk about star
Wars, they often talk about,

534
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.260
you know, the cannon. And
if they hear a story

535
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.240
in a star Wars story,
that's not part of the

536
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.170
star Wars, Canon, they get
upset and cause they, they

537
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:10.220
clearly have some emotional investment
into that universe. And when

538
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.910
you mess with their universe,
then that's a problem. It's

539
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:17.360
interesting though, when people find
that it's the gender or

540
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.380
the color or the nationality
of that character, that matters

541
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.340
as far as Canon, as
opposed to the story, like

542
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.430
I could see if they
changed Peter Porter's origin story.

543
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.590
I could see where I
would get upset about that.

544
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.480
Like, wait a second. Well,
he was still bitten by

545
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.550
a spider. Like, you know,
like that, that's the part

546
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.280
I hang on to the
race and gender is part

547
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.580
of Peter Parker. Isn't the part
that makes him Peter Parker. So

548
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.840
it's interesting to see who
either consciously or subconsciously chooses

549
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.260
to hang on to Canon
as being or an aspect

550
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:52.110
of Canon as being particularly
important. I completely agree. And

551
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:55.770
I am a person who
loves Canon and I have

552
00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:58.350
seen some of the ways
that the movies diverse from

553
00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.350
Canon. And I think that
I, even though I love

554
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.820
the original thinking that Stanley
and all the people who

555
00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.810
were involved in creating the
Marvel universe had, you know,

556
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.060
30, 40 years ago when
they were doing that. I

557
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.790
think that when you have
to diverse from that a

558
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.220
little bit, because the world
has changed and storytelling has

559
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.530
changed. And I think that
you have to update that

560
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.900
I was still keeping the
essence of these heroes and

561
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.140
what makes them heroes. And
what's what, what makes Peter Parker,

562
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.470
Peter Parker, what makes read Richards,
Reed, Richards keep all of

563
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.590
that. But I think that
there is a benefit to

564
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.280
remixing some of that for
a new generation. And I

565
00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.280
think that, you know, in
many ways the ultimate line

566
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.550
of Marvel, I would not
say that it saved the

567
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.790
company, but it made, I
think Marvel positioned to do

568
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.370
what they're doing with the
cinematic universe. And I, so

569
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.970
I think if Marvel had
hesitated or not going as

570
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.830
far as they did, in
some ways with the ultimate

571
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.830
slime, I'm not sure if
they would have had the,

572
00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.640
the ability to do the
movies. And so we, we

573
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.100
see some of that in
having a black Nick fury,

574
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.650
like an ultimate sense, how
they took some of that

575
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.290
and put that into the
movies. I think almost in

576
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.050
recognition of the fact that
they had to remix some

577
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.540
of these storylines, you know,
to make them more mainstream.

578
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.960
Yeah, I think you're right.
I think by, by legitimizing

579
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.990
and saying that the ultimate
universe is definitely part of

580
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.350
the Marvel universe that introduces
the concept of the multiverse,

581
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.500
which means that the cinematic
universe, which is kind of

582
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.980
what we call it is
its own parallel universe as

583
00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.920
well. And then that means
there can be an number

584
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.810
of parallel universes. Exactly. And
I think that instead of

585
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.590
trying to deny that, I
think that we should embrace

586
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.910
that because if you have
multiple Perl universe, then you

587
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.910
have almost infinite ability to
tell stories. And I think

588
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.550
that at the end of
the day, sure, come a

589
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.470
book. Art is a big
part of it. I think

590
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.680
that the art is as
vital, but I think really

591
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.070
we get into these comic
books because of stories, right?

592
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:02.490
It's the ability to tell
compelling stories that speak to

593
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:05.580
the human condition that speak
to the hopes and dreams

594
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.310
of young people that speak
to things that we can

595
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:13.830
all understand with. Of course,
the unusual incidents of being

596
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.220
bitten by a spider or
being, you know, from my,

597
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:23.220
you know, ancient Norse mythology.
Sure. Those are elements thrown

598
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.520
in that of course are
fantastical, but really it's the

599
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.980
storytelling that compels us. So
I hope that people would

600
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:33.000
see that the ability to
remix the ability to mess

601
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.330
with Canon a little bit
is actually a good thing.

602
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.520
And that's something that we
should organize against, right? Yeah,

603
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.150
absolutely agreed. And hopefully we
will be able to pass

604
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.550
this culture on as we're
trying to, to our kids

605
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.560
and maybe to our significant
others a little bit over

606
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.080
time, another 10 or 15
years, I may actually get

607
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.350
my wife to take care
about this stuff. You know,

608
00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.860
hope Springs eternal. And I
think just like my wife

609
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.790
love ex Mokena, I think
like all parts of marriage,

610
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.920
there's going to be things
that you always work on.

611
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.350
And I think that whenever
I meet people who were

612
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.530
single and then they get
serious with someone and they

613
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.570
think, well, if you get
married, it's just going to

614
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.540
all be good and we're
going to immediately align. And

615
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.430
I'm like, no, don't think
that we're marriage is a

616
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.760
work in progress. And you're
constantly trying to tweak all

617
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.820
parts of how you relate
to this person, whether it's

618
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.000
through what you're into with
the entertainment, whether it's how

619
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.400
you deal with money, whether
it's where you go on

620
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.520
vacation, you have to have
those conversations. And I think

621
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.210
that the best marriages are
ones where both people evolve,

622
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.610
right? We, we leave a
little bit of room for

623
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:47.180
change in order to accommodate
our partner. And I think

624
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.850
that, like you just said
over 10 years, I think

625
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.790
that you will be very
successful and helping your spouse

626
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.130
evolve. And I'm hopeful that
I will as well. Of

627
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.500
course, if you ask my
wife, she would tell you

628
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.360
that another 10 years and
she'll have me exactly where

629
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.680
she wants me. So it
goes both ways. Absolutely. Well,

630
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.650
thanks so much for sharing
your thoughts on relationships and

631
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.860
key culture and key culture
in general. And one it's

632
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.550
been a pleasure. Thanks, Scott.
This has been another episode

633
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.650
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
