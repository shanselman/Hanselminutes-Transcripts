episode, Scott talks with Jerry Steele
about teaching children program with

10
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.870
hopscotch. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

11
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.660
of Hansel minutes, and I'm
talking with Fitzgerald steel. Call

12
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.150
me Jerry. Hi Jerry. Thank
you so much for coming

13
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.100
on the show. I found
your tweet. You're on Twitter

14
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.930
and surprisingly yeah, like everyone
else. And you know, you've

15
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.140
got a modest number of
followers, But you have a

16
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.930
tweet that just went insane.
What happened? I really did

17
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.920
shocked me too. So I
homeschool with my daughter at

18
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.120
least part time. And I
wanted to take the opportunity

19
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.370
to sort of introduce her
to some STEM fields, some

20
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.510
programming in particular, you know,
she probably wouldn't get that

21
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.490
in her, her normal school.
And so we downloaded a

22
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.220
program called hopscotch it's for
the, it's an app for

23
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.000
the iPad. It's a sort
of a, a visual programming

24
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.290
language. There's something similar. It's
called scratch from MIT that

25
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.320
they've been working on for
a few years. If you're

26
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.350
really old like me, you
use turtle logo in the,

27
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.690
you know, in the eighties
and nineties, it's really, you

28
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.490
know, sort of like an
advanced version of that. I

29
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.280
can have a character or
a number of characters and

30
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.400
give them some pretty discreet
commands and make them move

31
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.040
and turn and twist and
things like that. This one's

32
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.110
nice because court's on an
iPad. So it's touch table

33
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.530
and things like that. So
the lesson for that day

34
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.760
was to draw a square,
something pretty simple. Right. And

35
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.060
so I asked her to,
okay, talk to me about

36
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.950
like, if, if, if you
were to explain to me

37
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.490
how to draw a square,
tell me how you would

38
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.620
do it. And so she
said, well, I would draw

39
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.630
a line to the right.
And then I would turn

40
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.640
and draw a line up.
And then I would turn.

41
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.030
And I said, great. Now
make a hopscotch, do that,

42
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.700
make this programming tool, do
that. And it's got a

43
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.830
little character you can say,
okay, I want to download,

44
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.170
take this monkey and make
it go to the right

45
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.470
and then turn 90 degrees.
And so through that process,

46
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.650
you know, she, she was
pretty successful pretty quickly. And

47
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.400
she thought that was really
fun. She really, really opened

48
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.040
her eyes to, Oh, I
can make this thing, do

49
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.030
what I wanted to do.
So after about an hour

50
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.060
playing with it, I had
her write down, you know,

51
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.340
what did you learn about
programming after the last hour?

52
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.520
You know, what do you
remember from that? And she

53
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.410
wrote down a few things
and I took a picture

54
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.890
of it, posted it on
my, on Twitter and just

55
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.930
cause I thought it was
kind of cute. And I

56
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.480
guess everyone else thought it
was cute too. I think

57
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.160
she really kind of hit
the nail on the head

58
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.350
in terms of, you know,
some of the insights she

59
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.250
had about programming people seem
to connect with. Yeah. I

60
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.560
noticed on the first she
says five things I learned

61
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.390
about programming. The first one
here, she says that computers

62
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.350
are really dumb. That is
an insight that I think

63
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.780
that many adults don't have
a lot of people feel

64
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.700
that computer is smarter than
them. They sit down in

65
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.380
front of a computer and
they are intimidated by them.

66
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.230
Yep. But when you have
to actually tell it what

67
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.090
to do, you know, of
course we all know probably

68
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.250
your listeners know, everyone knows
that, you know, computers are

69
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.160
pretty, pretty procedural. You have
to be pretty specific about

70
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.390
what you want it to
do. And I think that

71
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.520
was a, a great thing
for her to learn an

72
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.220
early age that it only
does what it's told to

73
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.050
do. And you have to
be very specific about what

74
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.570
you tell it to do.
Sorry. I don't know if

75
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.130
she meant to do this,
but it seems like she

76
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.160
boldfaced you she's writing this
in pencil on a piece

77
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.410
of paper, but it says
they only know what you

78
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.000
tell it, what to do,
which was extremely insightful. I

79
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.700
don't know if she's that
smart, But yeah, you're right.

80
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.560
Yeah. And then she calls
out that it's, it's very

81
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.340
hard that she uses the
word specific. She immediately recognizes,

82
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.950
like you said, that specificity
and that attention to detail

83
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.480
Required. Yeah. That's absolutely true.
I think when we got

84
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.580
to the point of, you
know, trying to figure out

85
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.470
how far do you have
to turn, right? You can't

86
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.850
turn 85, 70 degrees, you
can't turn 93 degrees. And

87
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.430
so, you know, being able
to be very specific about,

88
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.160
you know, move this far,
turn this much, move this

89
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.970
far again. I think that
was a really good lesson

90
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.950
for her as well. Did
she have a concept already

91
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.350
of like degrees and it
seems pretty sophisticated for a

92
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.060
seven year old, be able
to say, turn 90 degrees

93
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.130
to the right. Or did
she trial and error her

94
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.710
weight into that? She, she
knows a little bit, you

95
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.560
know, so just from different
activities, she know no gym

96
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.890
teachers tell her to turn
180 degrees or her TaeKwonDo

97
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.080
instructor tells her to punch
at a 45 degrees. And

98
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.050
so I don't know that
she really understands what degrees

99
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.390
are, but she's been told
to turn 90 degrees. So

100
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.930
she gets that. And, and,
but the nice thing about

101
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.090
this tool as well is
that it was an opportunity

102
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.920
to really talk through some
of those things, right? So

103
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.200
we got to talk about
drawing. We got to talk

104
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.200
about geometry, we got to
talk about angles. And so

105
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.650
it was really an opportunity
to, you know, not have

106
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.040
a lesson on degrees, not
have a lesson on mathematics,

107
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.900
but just in the course
of trying to do something

108
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.720
to cool, those topics come
up. And it was a

109
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.030
nice teaching point as well.
How long did that take

110
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.730
from the introduction of the
program and tell a square

111
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.010
and then presumably you kept
going until she got bored.

112
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.570
Yeah. The lesson was about
an ah, an hour and

113
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.340
hour, hour and a half
really. I mean, I think

114
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.520
it was probably from, from
startup, this is hopscotch and

115
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.270
this is the characters to
a square on the page.

116
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.920
It was probably about 45
minutes to an hour. The

117
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.480
program's really simple touch base,
you know, events, you know,

118
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.660
so basically it's the format
is when some event happens

119
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.880
here, they set of instructions
to run. Right. So you

120
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.460
can give it into the
events like when the app

121
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.610
starts or when someone taps
on the screen or when,

122
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.580
you know, I think even
like a certain amount of

123
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.670
time when you run into
something. So given some event,

124
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.640
what do I do? And
she got that concept really

125
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.240
quickly when she, you know,
tried something out and it

126
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.490
didn't work. She really quickly
figured out, Oh, I just

127
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.730
go back and I can
tweak this instruction. And then

128
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.860
once you, once you got
it sorta got it. Once

129
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.530
the light bulb came on,
you couldn't stop her. Right.

130
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.610
I mean, we, I mean,
if we didn't have to

131
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.560
go somewhere, she'd probably still
be doing it. You know,

132
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.320
she just really took to
it and just had fun

133
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.490
playing with it. Is it
the touch aspect of things

134
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.830
that made this different than
scratch? Because scratch has been

135
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.890
around for years, I put
together a raspberry PI tried

136
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.690
to get my six year
old and eight year old

137
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.380
into scratch and they just
weren't captured by it. But

138
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.610
somehow hopscotch got them excited.
This one, this one worked

139
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.770
for my daughter. At least
I think that the barrier

140
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.130
to entry is really low
that I think you can

141
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.060
have success really quickly. So
that was really fun. You

142
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.490
know, you know, we had
a particular task that we

143
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.490
had to do and she
went and did it very

144
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.010
fast. I think that was
effective. Another nice thing about

145
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.500
hopscotch is that they make
it very easy to see

146
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.440
what other people in the
community have done. You know,

147
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.300
so right on the homepage
of the app, you can

148
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.580
download some special versions from
people at hopscotch or what

149
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.260
other people in the community.
So you can, so you

150
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.440
can see other people's source
code. And once she did

151
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.680
that, she found one that
drew a picture of the,

152
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.920
the opera house, the Sydney
opera house, right? So here

153
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.580
are the scrap. Here are
the hopscotch instructions for drawing

154
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.830
the Sydney opera house. Well,
she thought that was the

155
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.560
greatest thing in the world.
So now she can see,

156
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.840
Oh, this is how you
make it do water. This

157
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.430
is how you make it
do a solid. And so

158
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.010
she was able to pull
those ideas into her own

159
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.900
project. And now I have
to take a trip to

160
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.620
Australia. How is she still
sticking with it? Is it

161
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.450
something that you think you're
going to put into your

162
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.040
curriculum on a regular basis?
Well, hopefully I want to

163
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.490
keep exposing her to just
different, different STEM subjects, you

164
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.200
know? Right. I don't know
that I'm actually, you know,

165
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.540
that she's going to be
a programmer or anything like

166
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.370
that, but at least I
can, I can expose her

167
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.160
to it. We did this,
the followup lesson we did

168
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.500
was on, on loops, you
know, just sort of that

169
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.620
sort of, that sort of
constructs of repeating a set

170
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.540
of instructions. So I had
her go back and do

171
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.410
the square, but instead of
specifying, you know, line, turn

172
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.810
line, turn, line, turn, this
is what it looks like

173
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.540
if you put it into
it instead of repeat structure

174
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.890
and you know, so just
sort of slowly introducing her

175
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.340
to two different concepts so
far, she hasn't been totally

176
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.940
bored with it. And, you
know, as she is interested,

177
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.580
we'll do more things. We
recently bought a game on

178
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.180
Kickstarter called robot turtles, which
is basically a board game

179
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.230
version of logo, which is
how I learned. Okay. I

180
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.230
assume that, I mean, I
can't tell your, your age,

181
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.500
your generation, but I presume
that we are contemporaries and

182
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.430
you probably remember logo. Oh,
absolutely. I grew up in

183
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.100
the computer programming in the
eighties. That was a what

184
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.880
it did. Yep. I've also
noticed the, not only with

185
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.830
this robot turtles and kind
of this rise of these

186
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.420
kind of basic applications, I'm
also seeing activities in which

187
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.640
you can teach kids programming
in a physical way. For

188
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.100
example, you know, mommy or
daddy is the robot and

189
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.720
they will only do what
you tell them to do,

190
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.590
give them the instructions to
get you a drink. Right,

191
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.190
right. Don't forget to tell
me to stop when I'm

192
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.080
walking to the fridge, that
kind of thing. Yeah. I

193
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.300
think that's exactly kind of
thing. I think it's really

194
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.480
important for children, everyone to
learn, but especially children, when

195
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.310
the, you know, this technology
is going to be so

196
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.210
embedded in their life and
you know, it's, it's nice

197
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.350
to know both, you know,
what it's capable of and

198
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.350
how to best instruct this
technology, how to best interact

199
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.050
with this technology to make
it actually useful for you

200
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.340
to make it, do the
things that you want to

201
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.350
do. And I think that
starts, I think that starts

202
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.240
early. Otherwise it gets to
the point where it's just

203
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.580
a magic box and I
have no control over this

204
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.280
magic box. Well, no, this
is a magic box that

205
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.150
you can make do really
wonderful things. I think the

206
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.430
thing about the way your
daughter wrote it up in

207
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.980
her five points of about
programming was that she really

208
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.550
captured the essence. You actually
phrased it that way in

209
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.710
the tweet. And I think
that probably helped move that

210
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.430
tweet forward because there's nothing
technology specific about what she

211
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.130
said here. She didn't mention
hopscotch. He didn't mention the

212
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.300
iPad. You didn't mention touch.
Right, right. Yeah. Is that

213
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.130
the thing that we think
is missing? We talked about

214
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.020
the STEM gap and I
think that, you know, you

215
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.270
interact with people on a
regular basis and people say

216
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.460
things like, well, I'm not
a computer person. I don't

217
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.240
really, I don't understand computers.
Is it this essence that

218
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.640
they're missing? Or is it
the, the, the details of

219
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.840
the operating of the tool
that they're missing? I think

220
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.780
it's, it's a translation there,
right. Is it's somehow translating

221
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.190
from, you know, the, the
computer does have its own

222
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.980
language, its own way of
spunky thinking its own way

223
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.950
of, of, of interacting with
the world. And so I

224
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.310
think that there is a,
a place for tools like

225
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.220
hopscotch that sort of lower
that, that, that gap, or

226
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.770
sort of bridge that, that
gap make it go closer

227
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.150
from, this is the thing
that I want it to

228
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.510
do. You know, you can
tell a person, you know,

229
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.770
I want you to go
to the fridge and get

230
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.530
me a beer and I
can fill in a lot

231
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.990
of those gaps for you
and the, the languages like

232
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.350
hopscotch, visual programming languages. I
think really like a lot

233
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.480
of the touch interfaces in
general are really kind of

234
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.880
lowering that barrier of entry
and making the computers understand

235
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.530
what we mean. They feel
more of the gaps for

236
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:43.100
us more, I think as
Talley went about this, this

237
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.860
pro this project, you know,
she just had some success

238
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.100
with that. You told me
that you had some experience

239
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.850
working as a teaching assistant
teaching an engineering programming course.

240
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.780
How did your seven year
old go about this differently

241
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.000
than perhaps maybe a 20
year old would go about

242
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.340
this? I, yeah, that's it.
So I was a, you

243
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.370
know, a TA at my,
my, the university of Iowa

244
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.130
here. So I got to
work with, you know, first

245
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.380
year engineering students, you know,
this is the first time

246
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.790
they've been exposed to programming.
I think we used, you

247
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.290
know, a little bit of
C a little pass scale,

248
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.260
a little Python and things
like that. And I think

249
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.530
the biggest difference was the,
the, the willingness to try

250
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.560
and the willingness to fail.
You know, I think that

251
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.000
I can't count the number
of, you know, grown people

252
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.610
18 year olds that are,
you know, you know, given

253
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.010
like a blank page, you
know, a blank text editor,

254
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.440
what do I do next?
Right. And I got so

255
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.290
frustrated because you know, you've
been in this class for

256
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.850
seven weeks. You need to
tell him, you don't know

257
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.090
how to start. You know,
you know, it C Maine,

258
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.670
right? You'd been, you'd done
this a million times, but

259
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.430
when the instructions kind of
got outside of that place

260
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.410
where, you know, where there
is a specific answer and

261
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.460
it had to be, you
know, be creative and I

262
00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.210
don't want to delve into
a whole educational discussion, but

263
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.580
you know, for a lot
of these kids, I think

264
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.220
college is one of the
first times where every question

265
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.800
didn't have a specific answer.
Right. You know, the way

266
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.010
the education has gone, it's
been very sort of convergent,

267
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.650
you know, and you have
to study for this test.

268
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.990
And every question has a
specific answer that need you

269
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.910
to fill in so that
I know that you're ready

270
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.350
to go to the next
thing. Well, now we're at

271
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.160
a phase where the answer
isn't given to you, you've

272
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.780
got to sort of create
the answer. You have to

273
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.760
create the process to get
the answer. And that was

274
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.090
daunting for a lot of
these 18, 19 year old

275
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.910
year old kids. And they
were, and they could not

276
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.600
believe that I wouldn't give
them the answer, but you

277
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.000
know, my daughter didn't have
that same, you know, and

278
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.980
that's actually another reason why
we want to do homeschooling,

279
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.270
you know, cause I don't
want her to go into

280
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.220
that trap. I wanted to
know that the world is

281
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.210
full of interesting questions that
you can use these different

282
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.950
tools to explore. And so,
yeah, I love that fact

283
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.170
that, you know, she saw
that blank screen and of

284
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.630
course there's some nice characters
on, you know, in hopscotch

285
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.000
for her to play with
and interact with. But you

286
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.850
know, she sees this blank
canvas as like an opportunity

287
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.820
to, to color in, you
know, now I don't know

288
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.770
if it's general and not,
you know, the best thing

289
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.410
you can give my daughter
is a blank notebook. You

290
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.050
know, she loves just like
just, I just want to

291
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.270
go and fill this thing
with my ideas and I

292
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.610
don't want that to stop.
And so I'm hoping that

293
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.510
we can keep doing things
that will encourage that behavior.

294
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.030
Yeah. I think that the,
I like the term teaching

295
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.360
kids, how to think. Yeah.
I think that if you,

296
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.730
if you give them very
procedural, like here are the

297
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.770
rules and don't move outside
the, you know, don't color

298
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.730
outside the lines, then there's
danger. And then 20 years

299
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.500
later you don't realize that,
gosh, you know what, I

300
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.480
maybe should've let them color
outside the lines a little

301
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.290
bit. Yeah. I think that's
absolutely right. And I understand

302
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.200
our educational system has a,
a huge problem. They don't

303
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.000
have any money. I have
to move all of these

304
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.150
kids through. And so you
need some sort of procedure

305
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.030
for that, right? You need
to have some sort of

306
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.210
factory for that, but you
know, the world is full

307
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.060
of problems that don't really
fit that model. And as

308
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.350
you know, things get more
complex and more interconnected. I

309
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.200
think we need people. We
need kids that can think

310
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.870
outside those, those lines that
can color outside the lines.

311
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.910
Like you said, I think
programming is a really great

312
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.410
way to instill that kind
of, you know, sort of

313
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:20.440
cross functional thinking in them.
I haven't figured out how

314
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.390
to express it to my
kids. I don't homeschool. Then

315
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.400
they do go to a
community school. But this idea

316
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.490
of, of you are powerful
is what computer say to

317
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.980
me, the idea that, you
know, I used to think

318
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.920
that it was engineering and
hardware that made you powerful.

319
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.350
And I'm not a, I'm
not an electrical engineer and

320
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.570
I'm not really good with
robots. Although we do include

321
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.970
some of that in the
kids study. But for me,

322
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.420
just the power of plugging
things together, whether it be

323
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.570
transforming data from one format
to another, or even something

324
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.200
basic, like when I star
a tweet, take the picture

325
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.240
and save it on my
hard drive, like basic kind

326
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.320
of workflow like that, almost
like, you know, life macros.

327
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.300
I want, I want a
kid to be able to

328
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.910
push through all of the
things that are standing in

329
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.010
their way to be able
to accomplish what they want

330
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.240
to accomplish. So there's, there's
algorithms there there's data science.

331
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.400
There's also resilience, Resilience, right?
Yeah. Because those things don't,

332
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.950
they, you know, you know,
from writing any macro, it

333
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.600
never works the first time.
Right. You got to kind

334
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.000
of keep trying and keep
trying it and then guess

335
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.250
what the world changes and
you need to change your,

336
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.250
you know, you need to
change your automation. I like

337
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.960
that, that thought that you
said, you know, that they

338
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.140
are, are powerful and you
know, there's never, you know,

339
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.180
not a day goes by
that. You don't read about

340
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.180
some 14 year old kid
that, you know, got some

341
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.210
great Intel science grant because
they just thought outside the

342
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.160
box and they, and they
did something, you know, these

343
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.230
kids can be powerful and
there's never been a better

344
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:47.110
time for any kid, you
know, any person to have

345
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.270
a great idea to have
that idea go, you know,

346
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.270
I mean, tally, you know,
wrote this little, this, you

347
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.230
know, this little one hour
thing and I took a

348
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.200
picture of it. And now,
you know, that's been shared

349
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.260
by, you know, going on
3000 people now, that's, that's

350
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.150
amazing to me, you know,
that she lives in a

351
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.940
world where she can have
an idea and influence that

352
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.880
many people. And she knows
that she's powerful in that

353
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.660
way, that I'm less worried
about, you know, the box

354
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.520
that the school system is
gonna put her in. Have

355
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.980
you talked to her about
the, how far her thoughts

356
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:24.250
have traveled? Yes. Yeah. I
have. She's she thinks of

357
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.230
herself like a little minor
celebrity now a little bit,

358
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.480
you know, she's so she's
very cute and she knows

359
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.880
she's very cute. And so
she's kind of opposer. And

360
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.640
so she thinks that she's,
this is just the, you

361
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.980
know, the cat's Meow now.
She doesn't really, I mean,

362
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.950
all she sees is this
a number 2,700 on the

363
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.620
bottom of the picture and
Twitter. I don't know that

364
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.170
she really has a great
concept of what 2,700 people

365
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.880
is, but she just likes
to pretend that she's famous.

366
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.220
That's good enough. That gets
down to empowerment though. She's

367
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.980
like I've influenced people, right?
I mean, the number is

368
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.900
effectively a bajillion, but I
think that what I'm hearing

369
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.880
here is that she now
has the sense of, I

370
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.060
can do stuff. My thoughts
are important and I can

371
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.670
put those out there and
you know, the people, the

372
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.720
public is listening and that's
something that presumably I hope

373
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.080
will stick with her. And
15 year old Italian, 20

374
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.790
year old tally will have
that same sense of power.

375
00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.860
Goodness. I hope so. You
know, if that's the only

376
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.950
thing I, I provide her
is, you know, that feeling

377
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.910
that she can, she can
do, she can create and

378
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.740
she can make things happen
in the world that she

379
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.360
wants to happen. Then I
feel like I've done my

380
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.270
job. Yep, absolutely. And I
think that's what, what programming

381
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:37.280
is, is all about thinking
about things more detailed as

382
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.820
far as algorithms and data
science, when you're homeschooling, or

383
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.660
are you going to start
introducing concepts like that? And

384
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.490
at what age do you
think you'll, you'll get into

385
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.560
those kinds of things? Well,
the nice thing about homeschooling

386
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.540
is that it tends to
be pretty pretty child led,

387
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.130
right? At least the way
that we do it, the

388
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.280
thing that you kind of
do is figure out what

389
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.630
are they interested in and
then build curriculum and, and,

390
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.290
and, you know, activities around
that. Right? So she watched,

391
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.930
there's a movie called Akili
in the B a young

392
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.320
girl from the South of
Los Angeles that learns how

393
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.380
to spell. She does very
well in a, in a,

394
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.810
in a spelling bee. And
so Tanya watch that. And

395
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.530
she says, you know, that
girl's good at spelling. She

396
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.350
did that because she learned
Latin. So I should learn

397
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.500
Latin. Well, great. So we
spent the last six weeks

398
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.250
were working on Latin lessons.
Kidding me. That is fantastic.

399
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.160
She just decided one day.
Yeah. Well, you saw the

400
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.410
movie. Yeah. I'm interested in
Latin. Well, great. So our

401
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.900
next lessons are, you know,
our raw on Latin. And

402
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.960
so that allows you to
springboard to different things. Right.

403
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.210
Well, okay. Let's talk about
Latin. Well, let's talk about,

404
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.660
is there a country called
Latin? No. So within where

405
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.990
was, where did this come
from? Let's talk about different

406
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.210
ways that these words are
used now. So you can

407
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.150
do some vocabulary things. You
can do some geography, you

408
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.750
can do some history. And
so I, I imagine that

409
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.420
those topics will come up
as, you know, as she's

410
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.670
curious about things, right. So
when she's curious about, if

411
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.060
she ever asks, you know,
how many people saw this

412
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.580
tweet, or where did they
all come from? Well, great.

413
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.220
Now that's an opportunity to
talk about data science. That

414
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.830
probably means some homework for
daddy to make it accessible

415
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.560
for her. Right. You know,
to sort of help her,

416
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.560
help her through some things.
But I don't mind. It's

417
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.200
kinda fun for me to
learn too. You know, that

418
00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.080
simple question could be like
a week. You just like,

419
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.180
you got me excited because
I'm thinking to myself, all

420
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.640
right. For each cause you
gotta think about, all right,

421
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.680
well, what's the Twitter API.
And for each of the

422
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.750
people in there, you know,
how many of the tweets

423
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.810
were geo tagged. Right. And
you got a whole section

424
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.440
on latitude longitude. And then
could you guys build a

425
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.110
thing that used Google maps
to drop pins? Yes. It

426
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.520
makes me want to homeschool
somebody right away. Well, it's

427
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.410
really funny. Cause I mean,
and they're interested in it

428
00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.870
too, because you know, it
goes, you know, whatever they're

429
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.910
interested in and they tend
to keep wanting to learn

430
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.650
about, you know, and so
yeah, so you have to

431
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.920
sort of ride that wave
of their interest without running

432
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.410
into the ground and making
them bored with it. Right.

433
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.630
You know, cause, you know,
after, you know, you're trying

434
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.390
to explain about the details
of the Twitter API, you

435
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.150
know, she's still a seven
year old board. You've got

436
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.440
a high note. Yeah. Right,
right. You have to hide

437
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.980
that in daddy abstraction layer,
Right. Yeah. Even, you know,

438
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.110
nine year old or 10
year old tally might still

439
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.170
feel that way. But I
think there's opportunities to sort

440
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.510
of springboard on the thing
that you're interested in. Okay.

441
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.010
You're talking about my little
ponies now. That's something that

442
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.350
she's interested in. Well, you
know, so there, you know,

443
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.470
it's not main Hatton, it's
Manhattans and let's talk about

444
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.470
New York city, if that kind
of thing. Yeah. I think

445
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.540
that the, the, the resilience
is what we struggle with.

446
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.350
I I've met 20 year
olds that just don't have

447
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.840
the patience to sit down
and solve a problem until

448
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.160
it's done. And I think
teaching professional engineers, the idea

449
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.900
of done means done like
what is done. Yeah. I

450
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.630
think that's a really important
skill. There's there are very

451
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.990
few problems in the world
that are just done. You

452
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.520
know, there are very few
things that you can do

453
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.290
that are just, you know,
I do it one time

454
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.800
and it's done cause the
world changes if nothing else.

455
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.870
Right. So one of the
last points that I hope

456
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.760
that she always remembers, you
know, that she wrote on

457
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.340
this thing is you always
have to check your work.

458
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.410
You know, you always have
to sort of continually to

459
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.510
make sure that, you know,
your, you know, the thing

460
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.930
that you thought was done
is still done. And maybe

461
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.490
if it's not done anymore,
well, then you got to

462
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.510
try it again. When, when
people or friends, friends, and

463
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.210
family heard that you were
teaching her programming, did they

464
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.580
assume, Oh, you're trying to
make her a computer person.

465
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.830
Cause that's what my family
assumes that I'm trying to

466
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.220
turn them into little cubicle
children and they're not going

467
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.810
to be outside. And I
try to explain to my

468
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.020
family that this is about
learning how to think and

469
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.910
about having that sense that
I can do this in

470
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.810
any job. I mean, you
obviously are very familiar with

471
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.850
computers, but that's not necessarily
a part of your job,

472
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.550
right? You're not a programmer,
are you Not anymore? That's

473
00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.150
not my, my day job
anymore. I'm, I'm in a,

474
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.650
a marketing capacity now came
here through a user experience

475
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.190
development. And then from that,
you know, it did lots

476
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.890
of front end development and
things like that. So, but

477
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.350
you know, everything is sort
of a, a mishmash, a,

478
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.550
a crossover of physical and
digital. Now I think as

479
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:22.110
the way the world is
going. And so that really

480
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.660
prepared me for this role
in more of a marketing

481
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.250
role because everything's countable, everything's
digital digital. And I think

482
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.990
that's, you know, the world
that Talia is going to

483
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:34.680
see to, nobody really gave
us much, much guff about

484
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.940
this. You know, I think
they were just kind of

485
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.550
amazed that, you know, you
know, for a lot of

486
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:44.850
people, programming is just a
magical box. Right. And, and

487
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.090
I think kinda just how,
how they, how they saw

488
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.890
it, they didn't see it.
You know, they know that

489
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.590
I'm a nerd, a computer
nerd and they figured my

490
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.930
kids, you know, can I
see some computer nerd things

491
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.700
as well? Yeah. I think
that the idea of, of

492
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.030
teaching her Latin or letting
her learn Latin without even

493
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.450
like my first impression as
an adult was like a

494
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.510
Latin, that's probably kind of
hard, but that's really, if

495
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.030
you can tell the child
that is, that it's difficult

496
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.920
or that it's maybe not
a good idea. We'll wait

497
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.630
until you're 12. That's an
immediate turnoff. Like most of

498
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.010
you, wouldn't you say? I
mean, I, I, he went

499
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.870
up to, you know, pick
a random 15 year old

500
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.610
niece. I'm sure you have
one. I have one and

501
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.180
said, let's learn Latin. It'd
be like, Oh, uncle Scott.

502
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:30.460
Really? That's probably not for
me. Yeah. Child led child

503
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.610
creative too. You know, I,
so my daughter I've tapped

504
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.790
to like my daughter. I
think she's pretty cool. One

505
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:37.990
of the things that's cool
about her is that she's

506
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.300
got a black belt in
TaeKwonDo. She's been doing that

507
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.910
for a couple of a
couple of years. So she's

508
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:47.590
got some, some dedicated dedication
DNA inside her. She can

509
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.640
work on things she's pretty
resilient, but this last, this

510
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.910
last winter in her talent
show at school, I was

511
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.650
like, you should do something
to TaeKwonDo. You're really good

512
00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.570
at that. She says, no,
I want to do a

513
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:02.650
dance, honey. You don't really
dance. But you know, and

514
00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.210
I tried really hard to
convince her to do the

515
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.650
safe thing. The easy thing,
you know, you do TaeKwonDo

516
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.390
do that. And then all
of a sudden I was

517
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.240
like, you know what? You're
trying to do something new.

518
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.130
You're trying to grow in
a way that you haven't

519
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.470
done. You're trying to create,
you know, express your creativity,

520
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:21.100
go do that. Right. Why
am I stopping you from

521
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.320
doing the thing that you're
interested in doing? And it

522
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.090
comes back to that power,
right? You know, you want

523
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.070
to, you want them to
feel empowered that they can

524
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.860
shape and change their world.
You know, the world's it's

525
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.840
going to be, you know,
right now the world is

526
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.150
wide open to her. It's
a wide open campus, you

527
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.980
know, it's going to close
in on her at some

528
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.360
point, but I don't need
to be the one that

529
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.820
helps her close. Yep, absolutely.
So if I, you know,

530
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.280
the more tools I can
give her to feel empowered,

531
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.610
whether it's a blank notebook
or hopscotch, or take her

532
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.190
on a trip somewhere, try
trying, I liked your description

533
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.990
of all the different jobs
that you've had. I mean,

534
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.600
with a background in computer
science and an understanding about

535
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.190
how the world fits together,
you've moved seamlessly from marketing

536
00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.250
to front end development, you
know, throughout all the entire

537
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.690
spectrum, all with the power
of those skills. Yeah. Well

538
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.680
it's mean problems, you know,
business problems that things that

539
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.050
people are trying to solve
don't really live in a

540
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.330
silo of a particular discipline.
Right. You know what I

541
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.180
mean? It's like, it's, you
can't just have the engineering

542
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.460
part. You know, you can't
just have the business part,

543
00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.220
you can't just have the
design parts. They really have

544
00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.220
to all fit together. And
what I like about, you

545
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.310
know, now that I look
back and see the things

546
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.950
that I've, I've done, I
have a bit of empathy

547
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.570
for all those different disciplines
and I can kind of

548
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.180
speak all those different languages.
And so when I get,

549
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.760
you know, these different cross
functional teams in a room,

550
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.280
I can do a couple
of things I can help

551
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.610
translate between different things, you
know, create some boundary objects

552
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.050
that help one team of
language map to the other

553
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.600
team's language. And that can
also go to our development

554
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.610
team and say, come on.
I know you can really

555
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.520
do that. I just don't
want to do that. You

556
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.310
know, but look at bootstrap,
they've done a good job.

557
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.090
So maybe, maybe try that.
Exactly. That's fantastic. Well, thank

558
00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.310
you so much, Jerry, for
talking to me today. Well,

559
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.140
I really appreciate it. Thank
you very much. It's been

560
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.040
a lot of fun. Can
follow Jerry on twitter@twitter.com slash

561
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.130
F J Steele with an
E. And hopefully we'll see

562
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.190
more pictures of tally programming
and taking over the world

563
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.760
with her programming skills. Thank
you very much. This has

564
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.100
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

565
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:19.550
next week.
