episode, Scott talks with <inaudible>
and it sales manager from

10
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.940
Johannesburg. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman, and this is another

11
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.760
episode of Hansel minutes, and
I'm here down in South Africa

12
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.880
on vacation for the month
of December with the family.

13
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.600
We're actually staying in Johannesburg.
So rather than a bunch

14
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.380
of technical interviews and things
on Microsoft software, while I'm

15
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.600
down here, I figured I
would do man, on the

16
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.330
street interviews with folks in
Johannesburg that might have an

17
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.230
interesting perspective to share with
you. And today I'm sitting

18
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.170
down with a VC who's.
He is an it sales

19
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.800
manager for a large company
here in Johannesburg. Thanks Lucy

20
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.260
for taking a second to
talk to me. No problem

21
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.460
at all. Okay. So, so
you sell a it hardware

22
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.620
primarily, primarily. Yes, we are.
The company that I work

23
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.330
for is an it distribution
company, but mainly focusing on

24
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.180
hardware and has the earth
I can in the U

25
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.130
S the economy's kind of
really bad right now. There's

26
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.690
been a real slow down.
Have you noticed that slow

27
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.520
down significantly? Yeah. In fact,
today I was just marveling

28
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.030
at the facts of a
slowdown. So how to measure

29
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.130
that is obviously numbers. One
down two is the, the

30
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.320
level of activity in terms
of customers calling in. So

31
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.640
we've seen a significant cut
back in terms of incoming

32
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.300
call volumes from customers. Yeah.
So people just aren't buying

33
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.060
hardware. I mean, you sell
everything from networking equipment to

34
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.470
computers, everything, and they are
buying of course, but they're

35
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.850
not buying as much. So
people don't necessarily have cashflow.

36
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.370
Now. They don't have that
excess cash that they used

37
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.310
to have, perhaps I'd say
last year, at this time,

38
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.820
you know, so yeah, we're
seeing a significant drop in

39
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.800
revenues and we, you know,
we're having to, obviously I

40
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.340
just, the way our business
operates accordingly cutting costs in

41
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.530
laying off people and things
like that. Now in the

42
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.190
States, they always call it
a crunch. They're saying That

43
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.100
businesses run on credit, dude,
businesses run credit here. Do

44
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.140
people have to get a
loan to buy a computer?

45
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.500
They do. In fact, our
business is primarily run on

46
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.580
credit. So we do have
a couple of investors who

47
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.500
work within the company, but
above and beyond that, it's,

48
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.770
it's actually credited it's funded
by the banks. We do

49
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.140
have competitors within our industry
who are self-financed though. I

50
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.280
wouldn't expect that they are
feeling the effects as much

51
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.740
as we are, but yeah,
I think the credit crunch

52
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.600
is here as well. And
this may be an ignorant

53
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.720
question because I'm coming at
it from an American perspective.

54
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.780
But even though South Africa has
been a democracy for now,

55
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.700
maybe almost 15 years. Yeah.
Well, since 94, 14 years

56
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.810
Then, is it a, is
there still a distinction between

57
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.500
a black owned business and
a white owned business? In

58
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.560
fact, there's a program here,
which the government is trying

59
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.580
to push it's called B
E, which is black economic

60
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.920
empowerment. A lot of the
black businesses obviously severely disadvantaged.

61
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.790
So when you start up
a business for you to

62
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.170
secure a loan from the
bank to get your, you

63
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.010
know, your, your capital equipment
and things like that, banks

64
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.560
need some sort of security.
And a lot of the

65
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.350
black people obviously lack the
expertise in terms of running

66
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.220
businesses. They're not from rich
backgrounds, so they can't sustain

67
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.450
themselves financially. So businesses tend
to start up and fold

68
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.060
as quickly as they start
up. So government is trying

69
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.240
to empower black people to
own businesses, as opposed to

70
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.940
work, you know, waiting to
be employed by companies. So

71
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.480
there's a lot of focus
on that even in, in

72
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.660
established businesses, they're trying to
ensure that black people get

73
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.820
exposed at senior level so
that they get a better

74
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.000
understanding of how to run
businesses. So there's a rating

75
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.100
system, which is called the
bee scorecard, which really basically

76
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.310
looks at a lot of
elements within the business. They

77
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.450
look at the number of
black managers and the levels

78
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.580
within the business that they're
in. They look at the

79
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.210
corporate and social responsibility of
the company. They look at

80
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.990
training and development, all those
things that help him, you

81
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.410
know, bring about a more
competent black business or a

82
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.620
black manager that sort of
speak. Yeah. Now in the

83
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.720
States, that, that sounds a
little bit like a, what

84
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.820
they call affirmative action. Have
you guys heard about that?

85
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.250
Yeah. I mean, they, we
use that term as well.

86
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.080
Although here I'd say affirmative
action. It sounds more, it's

87
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.020
more, it's looked upon as
being a derogatory term because

88
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.680
it suggests that the individual
is less competent, but they're

89
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.020
just being put in there
for the sake of their

90
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.140
skin color, you know? So
yeah. Some people call it

91
00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.170
affirmative action, but a lot
of the, you know, they

92
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.480
call it B E, which
is really a softer way

93
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.020
of saying the same thing.
But lately, I mean, black

94
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.500
people have shown that they've
got the expertise, we've got

95
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.100
a lot more black people
who are graduating from universities

96
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.900
who hold quite significant qualifications
coming through becoming CEOs of

97
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.640
multinational companies and that kind
of thing. So yeah, we

98
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.940
do have that chair as
well. One of the things

99
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.590
that I've noticed in the
time that I've spent here

100
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.960
is that it seems to
me that the distance between

101
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.320
the people that have, and
the people that have not

102
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.620
is a little greater poor
people are very poor and

103
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.040
rich people are very rich.
And I, it makes me

104
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.490
wonder what would it take
for a, have not to

105
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.200
get a good job and
get a car and get

106
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.940
a house and move on
and become a part of

107
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.300
the middle class. Is it
simply a matter of education

108
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.620
and a nice suit for
that first job interview? Yeah,

109
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.460
I look, I agree with
you that the, I think

110
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.790
that divide between the haves
and the have nots is

111
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.650
quite huge. So the rich
are quite rich. And I

112
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.010
think in today's society here
in South Africa, you know, the

113
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.350
haves are not just white
people. You know, it's not

114
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.100
a mix. It's quite some
number of successful black people

115
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.060
who own a lot of
money who have some significant

116
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.260
businesses yet. You know, on
the other side, we've got

117
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.680
quite a lot of poor
people who are predominantly black

118
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.770
not to get ahead to
get into that middle class.

119
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.490
You have to have some
Forbes sort of education, which

120
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.130
a lot of them lack,
you know, their parents were

121
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:45.160
unfortunately victims of the previous
regime, which obviously a lot

122
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.230
of people are still angry
about. They blame that for

123
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.680
their circumstances. So a lot
of them find themselves unable

124
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.740
to get jobs because then
their parents couldn't afford to

125
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.910
put them through school. And
so they've obviously doing menial

126
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.340
jobs, which don't pay well.
So they have to find

127
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.210
other means of supplementing their
income and sometimes to crime,

128
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.460
you know, that's why there's
a bit of a hype

129
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.660
in South Africa, but the levels
of crime. But yeah, I'd

130
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.290
say yes, there is a
huge gap where there's a

131
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:20.350
huge difference between the poor
whom of, of which there

132
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.590
are many of those as
compared to the, to the

133
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.830
rich. Do you know how
to make the possible out

134
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.710
of the impossible? Well, the
dotnet ninjas at Telerik do

135
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.410
they just released a huge
pack of web controls, all

136
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.500
built on top of aspirin
at Ajax, that'll help you

137
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.440
build impossibly fast and interactive
applications in no time at

138
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.480
all. They've made the impossible
possible in desktop development. If

139
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.670
you think you can't have
a carousel component and wind

140
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.030
forms while you can, they're
windows forms, suite features a

141
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.090
super powerful grid view control
on 32 other crazy desktop

142
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.160
components. That'll give you a
dazzling WPF like features, but

143
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.740
in wind farms, they do
the same thing in reporting

144
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.170
solutions with a new design
service, like nothing else looks

145
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.190
just like graph paper, cause
you advanced page layout capabilities

146
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.860
makes it feel more like
a graphic design software than

147
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.310
a reporting solution. Go check
them out@telerik.com and be a

148
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.880
dotnet Ninja. Thanks for listening.
Do you feel that there's

149
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.910
an emerging middle class? Are
people finding a way out?

150
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.220
I mean, I don't suppose
that like, you know, you

151
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.470
manage a team of sales
associates. I don't suppose you

152
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.510
guys sit around at lunchtime
and talk about who grew

153
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.960
up broke in the States.
That's very common though. The

154
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.000
idea that we fancy ourselves
as a meritocracy, that you

155
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.570
can become president as, as
the, you know, the son

156
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.820
of a single parent on
food stamps, that, that kind

157
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.850
of idea that you can
pull yourself up and just

158
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.630
on merit, you can be,
do something great. And there's

159
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.850
not really a stigma. Like
you might be the CEO

160
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.670
of a big corporation in
the U S and you

161
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.160
would tell people, you know,
when I was growing up,

162
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.160
my dad was a coal
miner and no one says,

163
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.470
Oh no, you know, how
can he be CEO? He

164
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.420
was a coal miner. Is
there a stigma to have

165
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.940
grown up poor here? No,
I think right now in

166
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.670
today's society, it's, it's more
like those are the success

167
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.920
stories. That's what they're made
of a lot of people

168
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.330
who grew up studying in
candlelight, for example, you know,

169
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.290
working 20 Ks to, and
from school and today, you

170
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.510
know, they, they, they drive
the big cars. They sit

171
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.710
in huge air conditioned offices
with fridges and, you know,

172
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.670
Oak chairs and whatever you
call it. But I think

173
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.280
that's, that's really the story
of a lot of the

174
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.630
black, how can I put
it? A lot of the

175
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.290
successful black people in the
corporate world today have come

176
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.770
from those backgrounds. So there's
no stigma. It's more like

177
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.670
an expectation. There are a
few who've genuinely come from

178
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.370
enriched backgrounds, black as they
are, you know, but they're

179
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.010
are very few, a lot
of them are rags to

180
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.280
riches stories. So it's kind
of like very common here.

181
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.360
Is there any sense of,
of being threatened or any

182
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.710
of the white people have
a problem with that? I

183
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.630
mean the white minority is
really a, quite a small

184
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.190
minority. What is it? 10%
versus 90%. If I can

185
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.500
just make an example of
my own company where I

186
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:18.650
work currently, we, because of
that bee story, the company

187
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.020
needed to show that it
was, it was committed to

188
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:27.170
developing black people or black
managers or so-called blacks with

189
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.340
potential, not necessarily the expertise,
but the potential to learn.

190
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.700
And what they did was
they, we, we have what

191
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.910
we call a workplace forum
as well as an employee

192
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.240
ownership trust. So when you
join the company, you are

193
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.350
in fact obliged to take
a couple of shares out,

194
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.140
which you pay for monthly
in a salary deduction. So

195
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.590
those two bodies have chair,
people who obviously run them.

196
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.780
And it was a decision
of the company that those,

197
00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.160
those chairpeople would be black
people who then sit in,

198
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.700
in the, in the board
of directors, although not necessarily

199
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.610
equipped at that level, they
will be put there in

200
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.360
a development capacity. So there
was an outcry from the

201
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.560
white community within the companies
that look, the country has

202
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.230
turned. It's like, now, if
you are a white male,

203
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.970
you have far less opportunities
compared to a black male

204
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.870
up and coming, you know,
so it's, it's unfortunately yes,

205
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.790
there is a bit of
panic on the white side,

206
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.080
but I'd say by and
large, a lot of companies

207
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.560
haven't quite adopted that whole
bee scheme are very few

208
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.470
in government is obviously trying
to crack the whip and

209
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.350
punish in the way of
fines, those companies that it

210
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.430
perceives not to be taken
that seriously. Well, I would

211
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.820
think that, that I'm trying
to put my mind in

212
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.280
the mind of a white
South African, that if you

213
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.850
just look North to Zimbabwe,
to what Montgomery did, he

214
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.630
took a bunch of white
farms and redistributed them. He

215
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:02.400
took a successful large commercial
farms where maybe one white

216
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.640
family would own hundreds of
thousands of acres, and then

217
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.540
redistributed amongst a bunch of
farmers that may not necessarily

218
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.130
have had experience in large
commercial farming and took basically

219
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.960
all the white people's things
and said, Nope, we're taking

220
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.210
it back and we're passing
it out. I would think

221
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.950
that a South African would
be concerned that the same

222
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.580
thing could happen here. How
much does a South African

223
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.990
look North and look at
that as being either potentially

224
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.440
a potential future or that
may be spilling into, into

225
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.850
South Africa becoming a problem? Oh,
I think especially of late,

226
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.420
they are, they are looking
North far more than they

227
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.110
would have done, I think
in the past. So you

228
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.130
would be aware that South Africa
is obviously going through, going

229
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.230
to be going to the
polls next year, sometime in

230
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.520
April. And there's a great
concern around, you know, the,

231
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.180
the, the, the, the future
leader of this nation and

232
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.250
Jacob Zuma, who is the
president of the majority ruling

233
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.580
party in this country is
the ANC is perceived to

234
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.050
be scandalous. Obviously it's got
issues and stuff that's tugging

235
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.870
him from, from his past.
And the fear is that

236
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.230
he's going to run the
country down into Zimbabwe. You

237
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.210
know, so some of these
schemes that the government is

238
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.380
trying to put forward, you
know, scare people into thinking

239
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.630
that perhaps that's what he's
going to become of this

240
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:29.730
country. So CGL land, you
know, loss of jobs on

241
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.420
certain races within the country.
And so a lot of,

242
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.150
a lot of people have
decided that, look, they're going

243
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.330
to try their, like a
broadened. We've had quite a,

244
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.230
an Exodus of skilled people
moving away from South Africa out

245
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.890
of fear, more than anything,
going across to the UK,

246
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:52.940
to the USA and mostly
Australia and New Zealand. So they're,

247
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.840
they're quite, I think that
fear is real and more

248
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.540
so than ever cause a
lot of, and also there's

249
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.350
that threat of obviously, because
Zimbabwe has gone down, a

250
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.160
lot of those skilled people
who were working within that

251
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.190
country have left and they're
moving this way and jobs

252
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.010
are becoming more and more
scarce. And so people are

253
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:18.220
really, really panicking. Now, things,
you know, in 94, things

254
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.130
were really looking up and
everyone looked to Mandela. And

255
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.910
then after him, Tableau and
Becky who the kind of

256
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.700
the shine came off of
him, it turns out he

257
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.980
wasn't as great a guy,
as we thought, maybe not

258
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.320
as skilled as a worker.
And now this guy, he

259
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.530
said it was Jacob Zuma.
Well, the interim president at

260
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.540
the moment is Halima McClinton.
But Jacob Zuma is the

261
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.880
man who is tipped to
take over officially in 2009.

262
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.620
And his record is unfortunate.
You know, so I am

263
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.850
a black male in South Africa
as well. I'm, I'm registered

264
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.550
to vote next year. And
the question is, who do

265
00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.630
I vote for? We do
have a new political opposition,

266
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.050
black opposition that is broken
away from the ANC, which

267
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:10.000
is providing some sort of
viable opposition. But right now

268
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.180
they're still too new. We
don't necessarily understand at this.

269
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.370
So if I speak for
myself, I'm not quite sure

270
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:19.390
what they represent. So they're
here to really show us

271
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.450
what they are about because
there were a lot of

272
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.000
the people that have, you
know, that have moved into

273
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.900
this political party are X
agency does. And they're, they're

274
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.200
disgruntled with the way the
previous president was deposed, you

275
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.920
know, from his office. So
they had the opportunity to

276
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.320
fix things while they were
in power and they failed,

277
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:46.420
you know, so I think
ultimately Jacob Zuma will become

278
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.900
the president because there is
no real opposition. And the

279
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.840
one thing that I know
for sure is that it

280
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.690
will be a black day.
We find ourselves going back

281
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.670
to a white government. It's
not going to happen because

282
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.270
the masses are number one,
voting to keep that from

283
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.880
happening as well. If there
is nothing else that's on

284
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.990
offer, it will be just
skin color. You know, people

285
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.370
vote for the sake of
I'm voting for the ANC.

286
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.830
They fought for our independence.
They represent black people and

287
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:18.460
they'll vote according to that,
Which is interesting because it's

288
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.880
in fact that same attitude
that caused Robert Mugabe to

289
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.770
be consistently revolted back in
as the, initially in the

290
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.670
eighties, after he led deliberation,
people said, all right, I'm

291
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.730
going to vote for the
liberator. And I'm hearing you

292
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.260
say that they're going to
continue to vote for the

293
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.030
liberator's here in South Africa. And,
and I think that's one

294
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.660
thing that will be consistent
between, let me not even

295
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.840
say between Zimbabwe and South Africa,
I think in Africa, as

296
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.610
a continent, a lot of
our leaders, you that they

297
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.900
are liberator's, they are put
in power and they can

298
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.940
like lose the plot. And
they, they, they want to

299
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.150
stay in power and it
becomes morphic, dictatorship been a

300
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:05.520
democracy, you know? So Robert
Mugabe, yes, there was some

301
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:11.190
particularly in the mid nineties,
some significant opposition coming through

302
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.830
in the way of, if
I recall, because I have

303
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.850
lived in Zimbabwe, I am
from there, by the way.

304
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.530
So there was a party
which really, it was a

305
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.400
mixed party, both blacks and
whites, competent people in business,

306
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.970
in politics. But again, for
the same reasons, you know,

307
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:35.130
that party could not secure
any meaningful influence within the

308
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.610
politics of the country because
people merely voted on the

309
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.540
grounds of the liberator and
Robert Mugabe retained his position

310
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.420
and he thereafter he was
able to crush. I mean,

311
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.640
that part is, we've seen
with what he's doing now.

312
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:52.140
He's able to amend the
constitution, alter this and that.

313
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.270
And that's how the political
organization died Now in the

314
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.270
U S right now. And
again, supposedly for the last

315
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.400
200 or so years, there's
been a, what we call

316
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.760
a two party system. There
are, there are three, four

317
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.110
third, what they call third
parties, but they're really marginalized

318
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.760
at best, unlike places like
England, or like Canada that

319
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.150
have viable multi multiparty system
for basically a two party

320
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.510
system. Every time in, in
that I hear about governments

321
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.060
in Africa, I hear about
the majority and then the

322
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.940
opposition it's always referred to
as the opposition party. Is

323
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.640
it a two party system
here in South Africa, or is

324
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.320
it just one party? And
then a bunch of other

325
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.950
little guys that are against
them. Interesting. But I think

326
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.230
I'm speaking for South Africa and
my own assessment is that

327
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:44.840
South Africa is supposed to be
a multi-part multi-party system. However,

328
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.560
it's a, it's really circulation
of the same people who

329
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.440
are breaking away from their
same organization. So initially there

330
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.250
was the, the national party,
which, which ran well while

331
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.740
the, you know, the apartheid
system was still in place.

332
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.360
They went out with the
end of apartheid. The NC

333
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.720
came in. So in my
mind is really a one

334
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.010
party state with a bunch
of other smaller, you know,

335
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.920
opposition parties, which don't really
hold enough combined support to

336
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.060
really make a viable multi-party
system. I wonder if South Africa

337
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.560
forgets sometimes that it's such
a young democracy, Really very

338
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.780
young, there's a lot to
learn. And I think obviously

339
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.750
looking to the first world,
you know, the big nations,

340
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.540
like the Britains and the
USA is of this world.

341
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.540
Yeah. There's a lot to
learn and the way we

342
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.440
sing, the one thing that
I can say now really

343
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.700
made me proud is the
manner in which the country

344
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.500
was able to, to take,
well, let me say use

345
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.970
this. It's it's young democracy
quite openly and fairly in

346
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.340
the way in which a
taboo and Bheki was removed

347
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.700
from office. You know, there
was no gunfight, there was

348
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.050
dope crew. There was nothing
it's all done legitimately through

349
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:16.930
dialogue and policies and procedures,
you know, and we had

350
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.580
a new president come in,
effectively chosen, you know, by

351
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.510
people in parliament, which included
opposition members, by the way.

352
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.200
And the guy's there today,
and he's doing a hell

353
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.090
of a good job for
now for the, for the,

354
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.980
for the one or two
months that he's been in

355
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.650
office. But I think the
democracy's young, there'll be a

356
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.310
lot of mistakes that will
be made. And especially now

357
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.530
with the, you know, with
the new elections looming, it

358
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:46.300
was easy back from 94
to two once Mandela left

359
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.460
office, because it groomed Taiwan
baking, but Taiwan, bakery doesn't

360
00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.910
seem to have done a
great job of finding a

361
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.980
successor, kind of like what
I see in Zim as

362
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.980
well. Robert GABA has been
the man all his life,

363
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.270
but he's no chosen successor.
And even if there was

364
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.100
right now, I think the
country has gone down the

365
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.110
tubes. You know, that person
would have a hell of

366
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.350
a difficult time. So I
think we can like strike

367
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.960
parallels between Zimbabwe and South Africa
in a sense. Yeah. Thank

368
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.000
you very much, Lucy, for
sitting down and chatting with

369
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.340
me today. I really appreciate
it. Thank you very much.

370
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.070
And I hope you enjoy
South Africa and you get to

371
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:27.780
experience the hospitality of the
country. <inaudible> this has been

372
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.510
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'll see you again

373
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.340
next week, recording from South Africa.
