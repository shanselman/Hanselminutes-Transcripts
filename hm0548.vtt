00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.300
From Hansel minutes.com it's Hansel
minutes, a weekly discussion with

2
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.250
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

3
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.990
show number 552. In this
episode, Scott talks with Sandy

4
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.850
Metz about the art and
science of teaching. Hi, this

5
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.250
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

6
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.850
Today. I'm talking with Sandy
Metz. She's a software developer

7
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.910
and author focused on writing
flexible object oriented code in

8
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.010
Ruby and rails. I'm good.
How are you? I'm getting

9
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.100
there. Yeah. I'm between trips
right now. And it's getting

10
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.370
a little overwhelming. Nothing nicer
than being home though. Yeah,

11
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.340
absolutely. Are you between trips
as well? I'm I, you

12
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.100
know, the life I live
is always between trips. Yes.

13
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.760
The short answer is yes,
Because the life you lead

14
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.060
is one of being a
teacher and putting the knowledge

15
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.510
out there. That's okay. That's
an excellent, that's a very

16
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.820
flattering way for you to
put it. But indeed, I

17
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.730
teach, I travel. I go
to conferences, give talks. What

18
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.100
is an unflattering way to
put it? I don't know.

19
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.490
I think it, I think
I said that because I

20
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.720
am really pleased about the
idea of being a teacher

21
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.570
and the teacher teaching us
something to which we should

22
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.840
aspire. Right. And so being
called, the teacher is flattering.

23
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.460
Well, you deserve it. And
I, I just decided I

24
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.300
was a teacher, so I
just took it. You know,

25
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.880
people say, are you a
programmer? Are you a speaker?

26
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.800
I don't like the professional
speaker thing. I'm not a

27
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.790
professional speaker, but I realized
that if you boil it

28
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.200
down, removing it all, I'm
a professional amateur and a

29
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.440
professional enthusiast and a teacher.
The thing with teacher though,

30
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.870
is it implies, you know,
you have the answers, so

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.410
maybe I'm a learner. Oh
my gosh. So yes. So

32
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.120
we don't have like, what,
what does it mean to

33
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.420
have learned all your life?
You've just learned if you're

34
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.630
anything like me, right? The
more you it's. I know

35
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.260
it's trite, but now just
about know enough to understand

36
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.320
how little I know. Yeah.
I figured that out last

37
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.510
week, see you catching up.
So are you saying that

38
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.970
you are a learner or
a teacher or both? Or

39
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.880
are they the same thing?
I think the best teachers

40
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.600
are learners. Like, like, okay.
So for the last three

41
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.810
or four years, I've been,
I teach a short course

42
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.000
and Oh, I've been teaching
it. I've taught it a

43
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.560
number of times. And so
I went from being a

44
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.280
programmer, making a living by
writing code every day, which

45
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.080
is so much fun to
go into people's offices and

46
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.680
teaching groups of people, how
to write code in, in

47
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.580
what became really to me
right away is that teaching

48
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.530
is a real art and
there's a lot of ways

49
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.680
to do it badly. And
so in some ways I've

50
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.380
been learning about teaching and
the students have taught me,

51
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.610
does that make sense? My
students have taught me about

52
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.300
how to teach them. Do
they know they're doing it?

53
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.080
Or are you just, is
it your observed observation? No,

54
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.910
I talked to them about
it, you know? Oh, okay.

55
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.860
So I'll give you a
little spiel. I give them

56
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.050
early on the morning of
the first day of class.

57
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.380
Right? What do you think
is the best way for

58
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.550
people to learn? You're asking
me, I'm asking you well,

59
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.330
without there's research about this
research without over analyzing, I

60
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.600
feel like there's, there's seeing
stuff. There's hearing stuff and

61
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.470
then there's physically moving stuff
around. Right? Okay. I think

62
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.810
those are good. Those are
all excellent answers. If I

63
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.590
told you that you there's
a research study, of course

64
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.450
I'm terrible at attribution. So
I'd have to go find

65
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.580
it. Don't ask me where
I got this data, but

66
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.650
I didn't make it up.
I promise you that. So

67
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.200
if I told you that
there was a research study

68
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.360
where they took fifth grade
students and looked at their

69
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.280
math scores and they did
a regression analysis about how

70
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.280
the teachers, the teaching styles,
and they got to where

71
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.820
they could identify the single
one thing. They can look

72
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.130
at a kid's math score.
And for the kids who

73
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.860
did well in math, they
knew how the teachers taught.

74
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.800
They knew the one, they,
there was one specific technique

75
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.910
that the math teachers used
that caused the kids to

76
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.840
have high scores. Can you
guess what that is? Feel

77
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.010
no pressure. I do not
know. Okay. And so I've

78
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.050
been doing it to you.
Oh, shoot. Asking questions. Can

79
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.200
leading me down the Primrose
path. Yeah. And I can

80
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.280
tell you that when you're
like the teacher role is

81
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.300
one that has so much
status associated with it, that

82
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.420
it is really tempting to
just talk Nat on to

83
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.600
people just to tell them
things. But you know that

84
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.260
feeling when you're writing some
code and you you're pairing

85
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.750
with someone and they have
an idea and you don't

86
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.270
get it yet and they
try to explain it to

87
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.790
you instead of letting you
figure it out for yourself

88
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.340
and how annoying it is
when you just want to

89
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.190
stop and think, and someone
keeps trying to tell you,

90
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.200
they tell you over and
over again, they tell you,

91
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.540
they tell you. And that
feeling is so different than

92
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.410
the feeling of discovery. That,
that thing that happens in

93
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.500
your brain, when you figure
it out for yourself, those

94
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.580
are like vastly different experiences.
That slightly annoying. Please leave

95
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.290
me alone. And let me
think about this, go away.

96
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.090
And let me think versus
the feeling of that boom,

97
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.940
that sudden burst, whatever that
happens in your brain, that,

98
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.310
that burst of explosive understanding
how different those are. Yeah.

99
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.890
If you ask people questions
and let them figure stuff

100
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.560
out, it's a really different
learning experience than telling things.

101
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.290
And so then what I
have to do with my

102
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.540
classes, I have to tell
them, I'm gonna only ask

103
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.590
you questions. And in order
for the questions to work

104
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.290
for you, they have to
start out like very broad

105
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.150
and not helpful and then
narrow in. And so that

106
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.240
the questions can make you
feel like you're being you're

107
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.800
stupid because by definition, the
first question often be very

108
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.290
helpful. You know, I'm realizing
as a, as I'm thinking

109
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.600
about this and how I,
I, cause I was just

110
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.920
teaching at a conference yesterday
and I was thinking about,

111
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.710
I think that I do
this, but you're making me

112
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.310
realize I'm not doing it
that well. I'm asking the

113
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.350
harder questions too soon. And
then I ended up looking

114
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.050
at a room full of
people, staring at me. Here's

115
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.520
what I tell them. I
tell them. Okay. So I'm

116
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.560
only gonna ask you questions
and I have to ask

117
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.980
you hard core, the broad,
less helpful question first, because

118
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.590
someone might get it. Like
you, you don't want the

119
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.480
question to be too leading
too soon, but so I

120
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.890
just tell them, I'm going
to ask you a really

121
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.220
broad question and it, and
it's designed to not be

122
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.200
very helpful. And when you
don't get that, I'm going

123
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.750
to, I'm going to narrow
the questions down. So I'll

124
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.820
ask you a more helpful
question than a more helpful

125
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.950
question in a more helpful
question. And in the end,

126
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.200
like my last question might
be a question that it's

127
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.840
w it is weird, Scott,
like even a question that

128
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.590
tells him the answer. If
you say, I might want

129
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.890
to send us and they
say message for, for an

130
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.750
object oriented class, right? Having
them fill in the blank

131
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.600
is really different than saying
you might want to send

132
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.080
a message. And so I
just warn them in advance.

133
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.400
I tell them, I'm going
to ask you questions. The

134
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.990
first questions you hear are
not going to be very

135
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.040
helpful. Does it doesn't mean
anything about you they're designed,

136
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.020
right? I'll just ask you
more and more questions. And

137
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.810
if I get to the
point where I cannot, if

138
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.070
I'm not good enough to
phrase a question such that

139
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.140
you can figure out what
I want you to answer,

140
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.570
then I will tell you.
But at that point, the

141
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.160
next thing I'm going to
do is ask you what

142
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.730
I should have asked you.
And so I tell that

143
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.920
to students in the morning
of day one. And so

144
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.800
I have a really very
focused set of increasingly specific

145
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.680
leading questions for everything I
want the students to learn.

146
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.110
And most of those questions
have been suggested by past

147
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.560
students. And so that's the
way in which they've taught

148
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.420
me Now, how much of
this is becoming intuitive and

149
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.460
built in, and you're doing
it without thinking versus how

150
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.550
much it are you actually
having to write down and

151
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.290
think about like, here's how
I'm going to take them

152
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:32.140
from point a through C
D Zed. The more I

153
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.110
teach, the more familiar I
am with the idea that

154
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.190
I want to get across
to the better the, like

155
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.860
I have a stock set
of leading questions for a

156
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.310
series of ideas that I
want to transfer some pretty

157
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.120
good at those. Every class
is different and the people

158
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.860
will have different questions and
they want to do different

159
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.620
things. And so the further
I get from stuff I've

160
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.330
taught over and over again,
the worst questions are. And,

161
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.490
but it's just a matter
of, don't tell them, you

162
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.570
know, don't like, I just,
you know, for awhile, the

163
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.190
whole sort of social, the
wisdom of the crowds ideas,

164
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.730
right? What I find in
my classes is that like

165
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.470
very often let's say I'm
trying to get someone to

166
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.260
think of something. And it's
an idea that I'm, don't

167
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.750
teach a lot. It's just
specific to the course or

168
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.200
specific to their code. Very
often, there's a person in

169
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.630
the class who already knows
what I'm trying to say,

170
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.050
trying to get them to
think of it for me.

171
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.710
Like I have to keep
up their, their classmates want

172
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.860
to tell them the answers.
Like some of the worst

173
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.650
classes are where there'll be
like a boss typing their,

174
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.640
the, the CTO will be
in there and they will

175
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.710
know the answer to the
question and they want to

176
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.890
help. And so very often
what I tell all the

177
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.380
other students is you can
help me teach, but you

178
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.570
may only ask questions yourself
and it's enormously hard for

179
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.940
people, but, but if they
know, sometimes I can get

180
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.450
them to suggest a question
to me, what questions should

181
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.060
we ask that will help
them figure it out because

182
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.410
of the whole point is
for the people to learn

183
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.890
by figuring things out, to
solve the problem themselves, instead

184
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.760
of beat hold the answer
does it For based on

185
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.010
the size of the class,
because as you're describing this,

186
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.220
of course, I'm imagining myself
kind of walking around in

187
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.010
a class, having this conversation
and worry that I'm losing

188
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.200
somebody and that they're just
quiet in the corner. And

189
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.380
they're being slowly as everyone
else is being brought forward.

190
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.940
They're falling farther and farther
behind. It's interesting how it

191
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.460
depends on size of the
group is the short answer

192
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.390
of, for small enough courses.
I'm there by myself. I,

193
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:46.340
I take extra instructors for
courses like every group of

194
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.970
six people. Well, I start
with 12 is just me,

195
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.410
but 18 is two instructors.
25 is three instructors. So,

196
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.510
so there's a lot of
help. The other thing is

197
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.440
that it's an issue. So
the problem of some people

198
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.020
being willing to speak up
either to say they know

199
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.260
the answer, or to ask
a question and other people

200
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.600
being less comfortable speaking up
in a group like that

201
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.150
is a really interesting one
because as a teacher, like

202
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.820
our job, your job, my
job is to get everyone

203
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:25.310
to participate. Right? And I
taught a course in a

204
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:30.950
workshop like in one of
the Scandinavian countries where there's

205
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.670
a little bit of a
cultural difference between the rules

206
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.130
about speaking up. Then there
are here in the U

207
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.830
S and, and I, man,
I couldn't get anybody to

208
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.890
participate. It was horrible. Yeah.
I always, I always tease

209
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.440
the Belgians. I said, I
took them to, well, I

210
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.850
took it to the bar
that night and bought them

211
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.270
alcohol and asked them what
I should have done because

212
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.730
they know it's the wisdom
of the crowd sings, right?

213
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:59.050
Like they, how, what we
should do. And so they

214
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.480
suggested the thing that I
do in all my classes

215
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.080
now, which was narrow the
focus. So let's say there's

216
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.440
a group coding exercise, and
there's 20 people in the

217
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.160
room. We just get a
token. And the token it'll

218
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.040
be some idiot thing like
that stuffed animal. I'll take

219
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.190
a stuffed animal and it'll
go to a small group,

220
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.640
like a pair or a
group of four. And so

221
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.710
the rhetorical questions get asked
to the class as a

222
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.520
whole, but the responsibly for
answering get to narrow to

223
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.640
a smaller group. And then
the token passes. And it

224
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.480
doesn't depending on the group.
It's not always perfect. But,

225
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.880
but what I noticed when
I, when I first started

226
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.970
doing this, is that not
only did the, not only

227
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.600
did it make everybody, even
the quiet people, it empowered

228
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.950
them to participate, but the
whole class pays more attention.

229
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.180
And the first time I
did this side, This was

230
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.910
it. Cause you've made it
a game. I just asked

231
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.530
him, I told him I
was going to try it.

232
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.300
It was in the U
S I tried it at

233
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.860
the first, the first time
I did it after the

234
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.120
right people in that quiet
while we gave Scandinavian country,

235
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.590
told me to do it.
And so I told them

236
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.210
I was going to run
an experiment and we tried

237
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.140
it. And then afterwards, I
asked him because we'd been

238
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.050
doing it without the token.
And I asked him, it

239
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.020
seemed like you were all
more engaged, everybody. Even the

240
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.140
people without the token. What
w how did that, what

241
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.360
was it? Am I right?
First of all? And they

242
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.680
said, Oh yeah, you were
right. It was much more

243
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.190
interesting. And I said, why?
And they said, well, we

244
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.540
just wanted to know how
it would come out. They

245
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.190
were just interested. Do you
want him to see you

246
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:43.380
fail each other? Yeah, they
were, it made it. I

247
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.380
don't know. I was very
surprised, but so many ways

248
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.300
That was interesting. And this
is the thing now, like

249
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.610
you're making, this is the
way it is. I did

250
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.510
it in every one classes
and it doesn't always work

251
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.920
with every group. Partly it's
either. Sometimes I fall down.

252
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.320
Like, it's very tempting as
an instructor just to go,

253
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.230
like, when I get tired,
I let the people who

254
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.730
talk, who are comfortable talking,
do all the talking, because

255
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:13.770
that's the easy route for
me. Doesn't that, doesn't that

256
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.630
kind of, I'm thinking of
you, you described it as

257
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.960
a token or a totem.
I like the conch. Oh,

258
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.050
this is kind of like,
now you're letting now you're

259
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.610
letting people talk. Don't have
the token, the RCU describing

260
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.330
the Lord of the flies.
Like you've turned your a

261
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.990
pecking order. Okay. So here's
what, here's what can happen.

262
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.600
Here's, here's a fail as
a teacher, right? That you

263
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.740
say, I'm going to use
a token. We're going to

264
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.870
pass it around. The questions
are meant for everyone to

265
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.990
think about, but the answers
that everybody hears can only

266
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.360
come from the people with
the token. And then there

267
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.400
might be other people in
the class who cannot stop

268
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.830
themselves from, from calling out
answers. And I have to

269
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.650
stop them. Right. Right. I
have to stop that in

270
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.600
a nice pleasant, socially agreeable
way. Even if they are

271
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.180
people who can hardly stop
themselves. Right. I've had that

272
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.610
conversation with them in front
of the group. It's like,

273
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.160
okay, you don't have a
token member tokens come to

274
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.900
you next. Right. And so
there's, you know, the social,

275
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:20.240
all the social issues of
managing it's a weird power

276
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.190
thing, right. I don't want
to be in charge. I

277
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.650
want them to think, but
I am absolutely in charge

278
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.810
of the, sort of the
social dynamics of the classroom.

279
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:31.640
Right. And some classes are
easy and some classes require

280
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.490
more effort on my part.
And when I failed them,

281
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.440
it's because I get tired.
And I quit putting that

282
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.610
effort in, I forget almost
right. I start going with

283
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.060
the flow. I want to
take a moment here and

284
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.570
just thank Pearl auto for
supporting our podcast this week.

285
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.600
Now they make a set
of rear view cameras that

286
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.300
fit around your license plate,
and they sync with your

287
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.090
smartphone. Now, you know, I
like gadgets, but I like

288
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.870
useful gadgets even more. Now
my car has an integrated

289
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.360
rear view camera, but my
wife has a car that

290
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.420
was made in the early
two thousands that doesn't, she's

291
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.510
always wanting to have a
rear view backup camera with

292
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.290
Pearl auto. I can just
install that camera frame around

293
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.990
the license plate with just
a screwdriver. And then I

294
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.050
plug in this cool kind
of wifi, Bluetooth car adapter

295
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.980
into the onboard diagnostic port
that all cars have. We

296
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.310
mounted her iPhone, the iPhone.
She carries with her anyway,

297
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.850
on her dashboard with a
magnet. And then we have

298
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.920
the Pearl app that we
just download from. The app

299
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.310
store, works with iOS, works
with Android, and now she

300
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.500
has a backup cam. And
it's not just a backup

301
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.880
cam. It's two high definition
cameras with a fisheye lens

302
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.080
that has audio and visual
alerts. It warns her of

303
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.510
obstacles that are in the
way, and she can even

304
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.120
see around corners and it
works in day or night.

305
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.750
So really like this idea
that you can retrofit any

306
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.980
car with a rear view
camera and it's solar powered.

307
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.440
So it stays charged on
its own. You don't really

308
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.630
have to do anything. There
was no complicated wiring. I

309
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.700
just, I literally plugged this
thing in, in 10 or

310
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.400
15 minutes with my eight
year old. And, you know,

311
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.520
soon rear view cameras will
be mandatory on all cars

312
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.240
and being able to retrofit
any car and drive safely

313
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.910
with it is really great.
And it's getting updated both

314
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.000
the firmware and the software
over the air. So I

315
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.540
was really impressed and she's
pretty happy now because you

316
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.750
know, we already added Bluetooth
audio to her car, and

317
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.770
she has now a dashboard
Mount for her GPS. She's

318
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.500
got a car that was
made, you know, 15 years

319
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.550
ago, she's getting upgrades, she's

got this rear view backup
camera that in full HD,

325
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.640
thanks again to Pearl for
supporting Hansel minutes. I feel

326
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.970
like people who do not
teach regularly, like, and I've

327
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.380
been doing, I've been teaching
since 90, 94. Am I

328
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.630
teaching? I mean, let's just
be cool. We should be

329
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.250
clear also, right. There are
tenured professors, professional teachers, you

330
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.680
know, I was an adjunct
professor at a state school,

331
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.540
which is semi, I guess
semi-professional and my ex, but

332
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.700
then there's also the kind
of like corporate training, which

333
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.960
we did. Like, I did
that a lot in the

334
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.450
nineties where it's like, you
know, go to Intel and

335
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.090
teach them web programming for
a week in a room.

336
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.240
And you do get a,
it's a, it's a little

337
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.150
microcosm of you've all met
each other. And then by

338
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.920
the end, you've bonded. I
mean, if you do it

339
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.020
right, the whole thing is
quite the adventure. But I

340
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.990
think that a lot of
people don't realize it really

341
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.920
is a dance with 20
or 30 people. As you

342
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.700
try to get them to
gel as a team, it's

343
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.790
all very intense. It's this
relationship you have for either

344
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.030
X hours or X days.
And if you just let

345
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.610
it happen, it might work.
It might not. But you're

346
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.230
describing being a little bit
more thoughtful about it. A

347
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.330
little bit more planned to
make sure that it goes

348
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.160
well, you're manipulating the system
in the best way. Yeah.

349
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.190
Yeah. I mean, manipulate manipulation
is a word I try

350
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.030
to avoid using, but it's
only because it comes to

351
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.320
me. Yeah. I guess that's
a good point. I mean,

352
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.740
managing what's, what's the word
it's not manipulating or managing,

353
00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.560
but I hear what you're
saying. There you go facilitating

354
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.880
And facilitate. I mean, there,
there is a way in

355
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.020
which, you know, I show
up at a place I've

356
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.420
never been in there and
I get in for a

357
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.140
room of 12 or 18
or 25 people. And I

358
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:47.210
have them for three days
and that the issues that

359
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:51.290
caused them to bring me
there could be that they

360
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.750
actually want the thing I
purport to do, which is

361
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.380
to learn something about object,
Toni and design. But it's

362
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:04.100
also true that very often
I end up doing well,

363
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:08.780
some form of in depth
therapy for three days, you

364
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.720
know, they, they call me
because they're, they're unhappy with

365
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.420
the code that they're producing,
but the reason they're not

366
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.270
able to, to do the,
do their best work, to

367
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.860
do the work they want
to be able to do

368
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:27.290
may be technical, or it
might not be technical. And

369
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.940
I would say a half
the time, maybe not that

370
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.210
maybe not that much, a
third of the time, they're

371
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:41.630
sort of social systemic problems
that are more important for

372
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:46.340
me to say, Hey, there's
an L you know, that

373
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.110
whole elephant in the room
thing, right? I'll be, I'll

374
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.090
have to say, wow, this
doesn't seem to be working.

375
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.860
You don't seem to want
to pair with one another.

376
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.380
You don't, you don't have
a style guide. Why don't

377
00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.670
you have a style guide?
You, the, your teams don't

378
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:07.060
right. Like their social problems
that very often people don't

379
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.250
have. They don't feel, they
don't feel empowered to talk

380
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.590
about them. Or maybe they
have tried to talk about

381
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:19.810
them and it's caused so
much social dissension that they

382
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.990
were unable to resolve things
and that gets reflected in

383
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.330
the code. And then when
I go there, I feel

384
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.100
like, you know, they're paying
me the big bucks to

385
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.570
come in for three days.
Sometimes we just talk about

386
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.160
ways to fix those Problems.
I think that the fact

387
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.740
that you said it out
loud, but we were thinking

388
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.440
is that it may not
be technical. That's the problem

389
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.040
here? You know what I
mean? You're as much a

390
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.080
relationship counselor as you are
a professional And, and it,

391
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.600
yes. In part of that,
you know, I'm a woman

392
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:58.470
of a certain age. And
so I feel comfortable just

393
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.810
say in straight out to
people while you guys don't

394
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.470
seem to be getting along
or the right, like this,

395
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.950
this seems tense. Why is
it tense? What is the

396
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:12.060
history of this? What I
think this is your problem,

397
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.680
not code, unless these firms
are resolved, learning more about

398
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.170
object oriented design is not
going to, I don't think

399
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.720
it's going to fix the
problem that you have. And

400
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.240
I mean, I really do
feel it's serious obligation when

401
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.310
they get me in there
to be brave enough myself,

402
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.840
and sort of be it's
that whole thing about not

403
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.060
about being humble enough, to
be honest in an openhearted

404
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.960
way and deal with trying
to deal with social problems

405
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.490
without making people feel defensive
or being accusatory or making

406
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.470
the problem worse, like, like
trying to be in a

407
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.860
generous hearted way, make it
better. Right. Right. But you

408
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.840
also need to ask, you're
asking for lack of a

409
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.800
better word, a provocative question
in order to, in order

410
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.720
to promote or to provoke
them, to think about something

411
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.940
in a way. And it
may be provocative questions that

412
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.250
they've all been asking themselves
privately in the hallway, but

413
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.790
no one had the chutzpah
to go and ask it.

414
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.010
And It feels like you
don't, they don't all talk

415
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.340
to each other. Like there'll
be cliques, right. There'll be

416
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.430
a group that's mad at
another group. And the dynamics

417
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.620
will play out in the
class. If they get the,

418
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.890
you know, they all get
in class together. And then

419
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.320
when I see that, I
have to say, is this

420
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.690
what you get? Let's talk
about what this problem is.

421
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.450
I mean, I've had people
cry. I've had people cry

422
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.720
in my classes. I've had,
I've taught classes where in

423
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.670
the end they decided they
were going to have mediation.

424
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.600
They were going to seek
mediation help for the group,

425
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.250
which to me felt like
a huge success is counseling

426
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.890
Though. Like you found that
there is like resentment or

427
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.660
whatever, deep seated problem within
the room. But one question

428
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.730
I wanted to back up
on, because I think you

429
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.980
said something that may or
may not be interesting or

430
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.710
controversial, which is, you said
you're a woman of a

431
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.340
certain age. So you feel
comfortable, you know, asking these

432
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.610
questions. Do you think if
you were 19 or a

433
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.750
super talented 22 and teaching
the exact same class, if

434
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.970
you came and asked questions
like that, you know, a

435
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:19.480
corporate teaching client would not
be as receptive? Hmm. I

436
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.090
don't know. I don't know.
I think that there's a

437
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:27.940
way in which students, all
the students I see who

438
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.640
are by and large, younger
than me in mostly guys,

439
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.260
but I get a fair
amount of women in my

440
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:39.340
classes. It's more, it skews
younger. Well, but they're skewed

441
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.270
both ways. I mean, there,
there's an, like if you,

442
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.080
if you were to take
the 20 year old hot

443
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.330
shot programmer, despite the fact
that I, I arrive at

444
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.810
a, I arrive in their
life as soon as the

445
00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.050
out of town expert. Right.
I'm generally like I come

446
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.890
in with ready-made credentials, but
also in a way that

447
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.340
I am not threatening to
them. And so I can

448
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.360
say things to almost any
student in my class that

449
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:16.180
they may not accept very
well from their peers, Because

450
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.840
you are because you are
other, you are not part

451
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.290
of the group. I, I
think S I think that's

452
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.080
it, but I'm other, you
know, other like their mother,

453
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.180
like it's like having your
mom and your aunt in

454
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.540
there, who's, who's known to
be an expert in advance.

455
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.620
It does. It does. So
I'm asking, I asked before,

456
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:41.680
if, if age matters, does
gender matter? I think in

457
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.080
so far as I'm going,
I'm totally making this up,

458
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.450
right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
I'm up to, right. And

459
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.220
this is the great thing
about being a teacher learner

460
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.320
people. Neither one of us
has any idea what we're

461
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.060
doing. My sense is that
like, okay, let me, let

462
00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.950
me back up. One thing
before I answer that question,

463
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.910
I'm gonna rewind one bit.
I am so genuinely fond

464
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.980
of the students regardless of
their age and regardless of

465
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.640
their gender. And I like
them, whether they're easy or

466
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.370
hard, I like them, whether
they have foibles or they

467
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:18.700
don't, you know, the only,
the only students that ever

468
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.770
sort of make me grumpy
are the ones that seem

469
00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.290
like they're not happy to
be there, like, which happens

470
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.780
in private courses now. And
then like, their boss told

471
00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.460
them to come and they
don't want to come. Like

472
00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.540
those students. Aren't very interesting
to me, but almost everyone

473
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.720
else, whether they get it
quickly or whether they suffer

474
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.380
and try to learn. And
so that fondness, I think

475
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.550
is apparent to them. And
so combination, like, I am

476
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:49.800
not challenging them, even though
I feel completely not only

477
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:55.140
obligated, but comfortable saying the
hard thing and finding a

478
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.920
way to say the hard
thing without seeming like a

479
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.670
jerk about it can be
tough. Right, right, right, right.

480
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.090
But I, you know, I
just, there's some way in

481
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.360
which I feel like I've
been through all those things.

482
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.060
I've been through that age
in my life where I

483
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.280
thought I was the hot
shot, best programming around it.

484
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.260
Everybody else was an idiot.
Like, I don't remember that.

485
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.090
I remember being that guy.
Right. And so I look

486
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.640
at, if someone comes into
my class and they present

487
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.030
that way and they're making
it tough on their peers,

488
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.150
there it's a conflict with
working with their peers because

489
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.260
of their attitude. I feel
like, I don't think they're

490
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.890
evil. I kind of like
them, but I'm happy to

491
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.040
tell them. I think that
the thing that you're doing

492
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.760
is getting in the way
with, is interfering with your

493
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.340
ability to work well with
your peers. What do you,

494
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.910
what can you do? How
can we resolve this? Right.

495
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.470
And so part of it
is because I, like, I

496
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.900
try really, really, really hard
not to make people feel

497
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.050
picked on. I'm sure I'm
not always successful, but it

498
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.230
is my goal. And so
because of that, there's so

499
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.490
what do you know what
it is? I think now

500
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.650
that I've walked, talked around
in circles for five minutes,

501
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.160
I do not want to
have the fight. I'm uninterrupted

502
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.990
in the fight, what I
want to have the communication.

503
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.430
And I express that in
every possible way. And it

504
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:21.690
means, and it turns out
that people who might otherwise

505
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:26.100
be primed to fight, if
they felt criticized, are often

506
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.740
grateful for the chance to
communicate. That's well said, I

507
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.110
think you're right. So how
long are you going to

508
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.530
do this for? I don't
know, you know, I'm, the

509
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:41.270
travel is wearing, but I
love the Yeah, exactly. I've

510
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.160
always joked about like, you
know, like, Oh, I joked.

511
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.780
I mean, I know for
a fact, whenever I'm done

512
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.140
where I'm at now, I
will teach, but it's a

513
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.110
different kind of wearing, you
know, I mean, standing up

514
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.250
and facilitating like that and
being on. Yes. Thank you

515
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.800
for saying that. Being on,
like I just was in,

516
00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.730
I was in Atlanta on
Monday. I did a talk.

517
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.690
I was on for 90
minutes. It was exhausting. I

518
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:10.070
went straight to the airport,
went to Minnesota, was on

519
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.490
the next morning. And because
I wanted to get home

520
00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.730
to see my kids, they,
they, the conference was very

521
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.310
kind to court and organize
the talks, such that I

522
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:26.360
gave three separate talks on
three separate topics. Back-to-back in

523
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.460
the same room. So I
was basically on for three

524
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.030
straight hours and you know
what happen? I had like

525
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.840
hot flashes or something. I'd
like legit overheated. And I

526
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.240
don't, I know that I
was actually breathing while I

527
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.790
was presenting, but I, at
the end of it all,

528
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.200
I had to sit down.
I just went like, Oh,

529
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.440
tell me I need some
water. Like I just overheated.

530
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.750
It was crazy. And there
was like, the body was

531
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.330
telling you don't do that.
Probably not the smartest thing

532
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.250
Or blood sugar thing. Right.
You can help me, like,

533
00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.640
I mean, think about this.
Imagine that you're on Shakespeare

534
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.170
and you're onstage, right? Imagine
you're Romeo and you give

535
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:08.730
that like, there's an audience
and you it's, it's this

536
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.970
huge amount of emotional and
physical energy. And then you

537
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.800
do it again the next
hour. And then you do

538
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.740
it again the next hour,
like, like the obligation, like

539
00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.590
I suspect I'm gonna speak
for you for a minute.

540
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.830
Like the, will the obligation
that you feel when you're

541
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.700
giving a talk to a
room full of people is

542
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:34.320
huge, right? You're supposed to
you there, your, it is

543
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.860
unfair. If you don't give
them your, all, it is

544
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.900
not fair for all the,
if you add up the

545
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.910
hourly rate of all the
people sitting in that room,

546
00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:45.690
that's what you owe them.
And it's a huge amount

547
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.730
of energy that you have
to give. And then if

548
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.020
you do that back to
back to back to back

549
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.900
to back, right, you get
on a plane, man. It's

550
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.040
exhausting. Well, it's, it's interesting
that you put it like

551
00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:01.440
that because I am absolutely
even all these years later,

552
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.060
I am absolutely conscious and
constantly conscious of, I do

553
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.760
not want to waste these
people's time. Like, there's a

554
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.590
lot of people here, you
know, and I just like

555
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.990
pick a number 50 bucks
an hour or whatever, some

556
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.780
huge number. Cause they're all,
you know, cool engineer people.

557
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.020
And I think to myself,
you know, there's actually a

558
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.440
website called the expensive meeting.
Calculator. You do that for

559
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.310
your doc. I absolutely do
that for my talk. If

560
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.020
you go to the expensive
meeting calculator, like, Oh my

561
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.980
goodness, a $15,000 meeting, these
people do not need their

562
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.880
time wasted. So it's a
constant balance. Yeah. And so,

563
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:40.470
yeah, so, well, so teaching
is fun. Talking is fun.

564
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:46.200
Yeah. Travel is brutal. Some
people seem to like it,

565
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.360
but I'm really not me.
Travel is a tough one

566
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.540
because it sounds glamorous the
first couple of times, but

567
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.110
then it's just like the,
the, the holiday Inn is

568
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.690
the holiday and everywhere. The
inside of that hotel looks

569
00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:06.030
the same everywhere. Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah. And so, you know,

570
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.100
I don't know I'm going
to do as long as

571
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.280
I have the stamina to
do it. I think, I

572
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.140
think as long as it
feeds your spirit and it

573
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.630
makes you happy and you
feel like it's making you

574
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:20.370
a better person and that
you're not doing damage first,

575
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.280
do no harm. Yeah, exactly.
But yeah, it's interesting. They

576
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.020
shouldn't be a teachers. What
is the, They call it.

577
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.780
Yeah. Hippocratic go through teachers.
You betcha. It's probably that

578
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.750
we could probably just borrow
that one. Totally steal that.

579
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.380
That's cool. So as we,
as we kind of wrap

580
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.220
up here, where can we
point people to, to learn

581
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.440
more about what you, what
you care about, what you

582
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:47.440
value Website that has everything
on it. Sandy, Sandy, I

583
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.240
met met, so it's Sandy
metz.com. Okay. And people can

584
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.270
buy your book and You
can buy books. They can

585
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.550
read blog posts few and
far between, but they are

586
00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.760
there. I haven't, there's a
newsletter that I sent you.

587
00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.220
It's weird. You know, newsletters
are people who sign up

588
00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.830
for your newsletter seem like
they've already agreed to read

589
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.220
your thoughts. So I'm generally
pretty open on the newsletter

590
00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.220
more so than even on
stage or in blog. So

591
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.230
that's also a place, but
it's all on my website.

592
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.680
Yeah. All right. Well, thank
you so much for chatting

593
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.200
with me today. Thanks Scott.
I appreciate it. It's been

594
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.200
my treat. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

595
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.370
we'll see you again next
week.
