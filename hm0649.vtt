Hey friends, we have a
new sponsor today, and I

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.530
want to make sure that
you support them because they

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.450
make Hansel minutes possible. Raven
DB, it's a document database

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.980
that's non-relational and fully transactional.
It's available for windows and

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.750
Linux with official client API
APIs for.net, the JVM go

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.620
Ruby, no JS and Python.
Raven DB is designed for

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.220
high performance handling tens of
thousands of requests. Even on

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.580
a single node. Raven DB
is capable of on the

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.080
fly optimization, dynamic indexes, and
much more. It has a

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.930
fully loaded gooey, which means
it's simpler to operate and

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.840
you don't need, you know,
arcane incantations on the command

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.170
line. It just works. It's
fast and it's right. Download

it out. I am Scott

15
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.720
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

16
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.930
I'm talking with VM restore.
She is the vice president

17
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.360
of the open source initiative,
and she's got 20 years

18
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.790
in the business of software
and 30 years with free

19
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.370
and open source software. And
it's currently an open source

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.450
policy and strategy freelancer who
just wrote a fantastic book

21
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.020
called forge your future with
open source that I was

22
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.330
very happy to do a
little quote about a little

23
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.390
blurb to hopefully support your
book. Thanks for chatting with

24
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.970
me today. Thanks for having
me. And thank you so

25
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.130
much for the blurb. I
do appreciate that it takes

26
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.290
a fair bit of time
to do those sorts of

27
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.140
things. Well, it's, it's, it's
also nice for me because

28
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.760
I got, I get to
read a book because the

29
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.610
publisher will email you and
say, Hey, this great book

30
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.310
is coming out. And you
know, this happens a lot

31
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.140
where someone says, there's a
great book coming out and

32
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.470
we all say, yeah, sure,
there is right where there's,

33
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.150
I'll give you a PDF
of it and then you

34
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.400
go, Oh, here's a topic.
Oh, there's a, and the

35
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.130
next thing you know, I've
read the book. It's funny

36
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.070
how those things work. So
I'm thrilled to have gotten

37
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.290
a free book and I
will now have to, but

38
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.790
when it comes out, I'll
go and buy a copy

39
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.940
as well. I don't feel
like there's a book that

40
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.620
is as clear and concise
and as prescriptive as, as

41
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.140
your book, when it comes
to open source, as it

42
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.760
relates to one's future one's
own career That's because there

43
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.450
isn't a book about this
at all. This is as

44
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.970
far as we can tell,
and we've done some pretty

45
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.000
extensive searches now, and I
obviously would have known about

46
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.420
it professionally. This is the
first and only book on

47
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.720
how to contribute to free
and open source software. And

48
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.520
it was very important for
me to look for it,

49
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.910
not just to be the
mechanics, because let's, let's face

50
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.060
it. You can read a
document and learn how mechanically

51
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.390
to contribute to a free
and open source software project.

52
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.520
But why do you want
to do that? And how

53
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.250
do you do it in
a way that best benefits

54
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.030
you and your career and
the entire community all at

55
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.900
same time. It's very important
that we cover all of

56
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.120
those because you got to
get something out of this

57
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.040
beyond just warm fuzzies. And
it's interesting that you use

58
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.830
the word, the mechanics of
it, because like you said,

59
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.690
there are certainly like, here's
how you do a pull

60
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.380
request. You know, that's been
written a thousand times and

61
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.990
I recently had April winds
along the show, and we

62
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.460
talked about what is sometimes
called soft skills or squishy

63
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.100
skills. And she said, well,
these, those are not, that's

64
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.450
not a good way to
phrase it. Those are not

65
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.900
terms that we should use.
There's the practical realities of

66
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.140
how to interact with the
community. There's no reason to

67
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.260
call it soft. It's certainly
as hard as anything interacting

68
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.350
with community. Well, what I've
found is that the technical

69
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.510
stuff is, is actually the
easiest part because the technical

70
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.740
stuff doesn't really come from
quite as entrenched, a place

71
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.440
of culture and history and
background and personalities. I mean,

72
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.610
obviously that's reflected in the
technical parts in any community,

73
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.000
but it's the people side
of things. That's very, very

74
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.590
difficult. I can't like drop
a Docker file into a

75
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.310
team and have it instantly,
you know, perform like the

76
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.540
team I had on my
other department. It doesn't work

77
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.760
that way. People are different.
And so you have to

78
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.420
learn how to interact with
the people. And that's very

79
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.080
complicated, Our open source communities
and open source people, any

80
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.430
different than, than any other
thing, like a committee to

81
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.910
do something around your neighborhood.
Or sometimes it feels like

82
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.670
it's just harder. Is it
because we're all engineers and

83
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.980
we all like our things
to compile and humans just

84
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.140
don't Well, humans definitely don't
compile every group is going

85
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.710
to be different. So to
that extent, the answer is

86
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.430
going to be, yes, each
free and open source community

87
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.930
will be its own special
thing that will approach things

88
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.930
differently from another free and
open source community. But on

89
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.830
the other hand, they are
all composed of people. And

90
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.100
because of that, you have
to respect the humanity of

91
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.630
each individual. So regardless of
whether you're working with your

92
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.470
PTA group, whether you're working
with say a karate class,

93
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.800
or whether working with free
and open source software, you

94
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.920
have to respect the individual
ality of each of those

95
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.520
people and learn to work
with them on their terms.

96
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.850
But they obviously should be
doing the same thing in

97
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.760
the other direction for all
of the other community members

98
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.170
that doesn't always happen, obviously,
because, you know, we're, we're

99
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.350
people and things are difficult,
but that's the best case

100
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.710
situation. I like how practical
this is. I'm looking at

101
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.370
chapter seven, which talks about,
you know, you're giving a

102
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.910
contribution and now what, and
there's even, there's even a

103
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.460
section where you say like
what to do while you

104
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.060
wait, you've done your PR.
And I've seen people do

105
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.640
a pull request. And then
like every hour I think

106
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.250
should check it. They looked
at my pull request, have

107
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.560
you reviewed this? I, can
we get this done? Like

108
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.800
what, what do you do?
Maybe your contribution isn't accepted.

109
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.830
It's very realistic. This book.
Well, I think one of

110
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.740
the things that not just
free and open source software,

111
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.950
but humans in general, but
I'll just scope it down

112
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.530
to technologists. We're very bad
at setting up expectations. And

113
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.670
because of that, we set
up technological methods around that.

114
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.250
So we don't have to
set up expectations. You can

115
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.890
just go out of your
way yourself to go check

116
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.800
over here for status. You
go check on status. We're

117
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.710
not going to tell you
when it might change. So

118
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.130
setting up expectations for people
in advance and saying, well,

119
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.740
yes, it might be declined.
And here are some reasons

120
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.040
why, yes, it might take
a while. And here are

121
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.570
some reasons why we'll really
help to, I think, diminish

122
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.230
some of the anxiety that
people can have from being

123
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.580
a first time contributor. And
just, we're really excited when

124
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.090
we contribute and landing your
first patch feels so good.

125
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.560
So if we can get
people to understand that you

126
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.410
will learn your first land,
your first patch, but it

127
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.830
might take a little while.
So be patient. And here's

128
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.930
why it will take a
little while. I think that

129
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.290
can help keep some of
the excitement up. And we

130
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.820
really would love to maintain
that momentum of positive emotion

131
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:28.120
when contributing to an accepting
open source contributions. Yeah. There's

132
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.360
a whole section about when
you're participating in discussions, you

133
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.570
call out that in the
free and open source software

134
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.880
contribution process. Communication is where
the unwritten rules hide, right?

135
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.970
There's no, there's no document
that there's documents that tell

136
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.460
you how your pull request
should be formatted. But there

137
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.500
isn't one that says how
you should interact with the

138
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.370
community and the fact that
those habits and those expectations

139
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.630
vary from community to community.
Yeah, the expectations will vary.

140
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.140
And that's why it's always
important. When you are contributing

141
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.040
to read the contributor guide,
it's there for a reason,

142
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.920
please. Don't just go your
own way. So read the

143
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.810
contributor guide, listen on whatever
chat rooms people have and

144
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.870
see how they interact, you
know, lurk on the chat

145
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.760
rooms, lurk on the mailing
list and see how people

146
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.650
interact to try to understand
the cultural mores of that

147
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.150
particular community. Because otherwise you
might just go in there

148
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.480
like a bull in a
China shop expecting that the

149
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.990
way you were interacting in
one community will work the

150
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.800
same at another community. And
there is not a direct

151
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.730
mapping there. It just doesn't
work. Yeah. And you call

152
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.670
out important things that I
think once you've said them,

153
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.950
I think are obvious, but
they need to be said,

154
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.300
like you say, comprehend than
act rather than react. It

155
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.070
seems like on the internet,
there's so many people who

156
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.490
are waiting for their turn
to speak, which is different

157
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.280
than listening. Yeah. For whatever
psychological reasons, which will be

158
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.270
individual. But as a culture,
we seem to be very

159
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.240
reactionary right now. We want
to be heard. And there's

160
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.940
a lot of value in
wanting to be heard and,

161
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.170
and particularly in being heard
itself, but there's even more

162
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.070
value in listening and understanding
what people are looking for,

163
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.940
what people would like to
hear, how you can interact

164
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.970
with them in a way
that will benefit both you

165
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.760
and trying to land your
patch, but also the community,

166
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.570
because again, bull in a
China shop might be fun

167
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.550
for the bull, but not
for anyone else. Yeah. And

168
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.400
it's also interesting to me
that we are contributing source

169
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.640
code, which is text which
compiles and does exactly what

170
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.890
it's supposed to. If we
wrote it correctly. But then

171
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.550
we choose to communicate in
text, which is like of

172
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.460
all the communication mediums, the
one that offers the least

173
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.880
context, it's like the great
equalizer, but I can't see

174
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.910
your tone. I can't see
your subtle face movements to

175
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.070
tell if you're joking or
not. I mean, sarcasm and

176
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.580
texts. Don't often go side
by side. What a challenge

177
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.510
to communicate both with code
and with pros, but a

178
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.510
text is maybe not the
right one for, for the,

179
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.480
for the communication part. It
can be very difficult, which

180
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.870
is why I do mention
that. Sometimes you, you have

181
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.240
to get together. Sometimes you
have to be in the

182
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.500
same place. Sometimes you just,
everyone hop on Skype or

183
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.340
Google Hangouts or something, just
so you can get slightly

184
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.450
more high definition communication, but
it's also worth noting that

185
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.350
code. Isn't the only way
to contribute. And this book

186
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.060
is not purely for programmers.
It's has some examples that

187
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.100
use code contributions, but it
also has examples using documentation

188
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.690
and marketing and you know,
just lot, there are lots

189
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.300
of different ways to contribute
to free and open source

190
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.700
software. So if you don't
feel like you are a

191
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.170
strong programmer yet, it's okay.
We need you anyway. I

192
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.450
really appreciate that. You said
that. And I appreciate that.

193
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.950
There's in fact, an entire
chapter on making a difference

194
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.560
without making a poor request,
because people seem to think

195
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.130
that it's all about, you
know, the, the, the most

196
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.100
complicated change you could make
or the most sophisticated code,

197
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.240
but designers and documentation and
community building, all of these

198
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.490
things have huge value, particularly
documentation Documentation is that force

199
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.020
multiplier of any software, but
particularly free and open source

200
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.840
software projects. You know, I
can keep this information in

201
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.070
my head, but I don't
scale. Whereas a well formatted

202
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.480
piece of documentation does scale.
Now documentation is slightly problematic

203
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.780
because a lot of people
suggest it as your first

204
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.800
free and open source software
contribution. And for some people

205
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.920
that could be good. And
if the contribution is very

206
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.800
small, say a typo or
something like that, that can

207
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.490
be good. But the problem
with is to make it

208
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.180
good to make it effective
for the end user. You

209
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.960
have to know a lot
about the project itself. So

210
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.080
often documentation is not the
best place for you to

211
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.170
start, unless you are already
familiar with the project because

212
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.940
you use it at work
or you use it in

213
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.080
your own private hobbies or
something like that. But documentation

214
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.930
is not always going to
be the best place for

215
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.780
everyone to start when contributing
to free and open source

216
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.130
software, You call it a
couple of places for starting

217
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.730
for new programmers that I
didn't see coming. For example,

218
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.950
you had a comment, you
have a section here rather

219
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.680
about code reviews, where you
say that, and I love

220
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.780
this. You don't have to
be a rockstar Ninja, 10

221
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.170
X unicorn diva programmer with
years of experience to have

222
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.660
valuable insights. And I never
thought about that. I would

223
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.240
assume that the code reviewers
should be the most experienced

224
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.730
people, but it's not always
the case. It's not always

225
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.430
the case. I mean, for
the very complicated issues or

226
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:52.410
for the more nuanced issues
of we didn't do it

227
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.330
that way over in that
module. So we have to

228
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.850
do it in this module.
You know, those obviously require

229
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.730
a great deal of experience
with the code base and

230
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.870
with the project, but just
anyone can look at a

231
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.810
piece of code and go,
huh? These don't line up

232
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.740
properly, or, huh, I'm a
new programmer. And I can't

233
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.620
figure out what you're doing
here. If a new programmer

234
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.710
can't understand what's happening in
a method, it's probably too

235
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:22.350
complicated. So asking questions is
a great way to provide

236
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.580
feedback because it's something that
somebody does not understand is

237
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.570
not very maintainable. So you
can learn a great deal

238
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.710
about the project, about programming.
Even if you don't know

239
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:39.120
a lot about programming, just
by reviewing the contributions. Now,

240
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.600
obviously you won't be able
to merge them because you

241
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.720
don't have the access for
that, but your comments still

242
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.020
have value, but don't do
it. If the project doesn't

243
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.420
want you to do it,
there are some projects such

244
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.540
as OpenStack. For instance, one
of the first things new

245
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.170
contributors would do would be
to review issues as they

246
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.100
come in and to review
patches. And that was encouraged,

247
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.570
but it's not encouraged in
all projects. So check before

248
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.050
you do it. And we
talk about testing and we

249
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.380
talk about docs, but you
also call out testing the

250
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.500
docs, which is another great
opportunity for someone to come

251
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.690
in as a new developer,
to come in with fresh

252
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.280
eyes and see if they
can get started. So this

253
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.130
is something I would encourage
with all of my new

254
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.420
developers up prior to going
freelance. I led software engineering

255
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.780
departments at the director and
VP level. And when I

256
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.940
would have new people come
in as part of their

257
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.020
onboarding, if you find anything
wrong with the documentation, let

258
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.600
us know. And or if
the processes were there to

259
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.390
support that, fix it, you
know, make it better for

260
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.810
the people going forward, because
it's only with really fresh

261
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.490
eyes that you can see
whether the documentation is effective.

262
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.240
So if you're setting up
your new developer environment and

263
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.630
the docs don't mention that
you require a certain dependency,

264
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.530
that's really valuable information. And
if you find that and

265
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.680
update the docs or open
a, an issue for it,

266
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.250
you will have saved several
people, many hours of work

267
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.820
when they hit that problem.
So you yourself become a

268
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.510
force multiplier and saving other
people's time just by fixing

269
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.490
a document. And that idea
that you're saving people time,

270
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.220
that you're helping other people,
that empathy, that one develops,

271
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.820
whether it be testing or
reading docs, it all comes

272
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.790
down to the reminder that
that it's humans behind all

273
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.040
of this. We did make
this software for people to

274
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.890
use and for people to
experience, But he is a

275
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.760
very, it's becoming a buzzword
lately, which is a great,

276
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.810
but B I'm afraid people
might get too used to

277
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.200
it and start glossing over
it. So empathy is very

278
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.100
important in everything we do
in your day to day

279
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.610
life in your professional life
and in con contributing to

280
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.900
free and open source software.
So being aware of the

281
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.190
circumstances that other people might
be going through actually using

282
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.490
open source as well. So
if you need a fix,

283
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.070
and if you currently aren't
at a place where you're

284
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.770
able to make that fix,
and so you open a

285
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.580
bug about it, don't go
bashing on the poor maintainer

286
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.290
because they don't get back
to you in a day,

287
00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.010
a week, a month, they
have lives. They're trying to

288
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.970
do their own thing. They're
trying to raise a family

289
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.030
to, you know, get through
university. You know, so being

290
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.050
aware of the fact that
other people are involved and

291
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.980
that they have complicated issues,
just like you have complicated

292
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.910
issues and being sensitive to
that is very important for

293
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.850
really accomplishing what you want.
Yeah, it is tough. I

294
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.730
hear what you're saying, that
the word empathy is sometimes

295
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.740
it gets used so much.
It's you people, you hit

296
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.680
people over the head with
it, but in all things,

297
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.870
to just remember that you're
a person in front of

298
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.150
a keyboard talking to another
person in front of a

299
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.230
keyboard. So for example, you
talk about triage issues and

300
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.000
figuring out whether or not
it's, you know, why isn't

301
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.400
my pull request happening and
why isn't this issue? The

302
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.220
number one issue, because it
might be crucially important to

303
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.250
you, but you may also
not have visibility into the

304
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.300
release cycle of this particular
project. We have issues on

305
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.400
our project where people are
mad and they don't understand

306
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.860
that like, well, we're not
actually writing code right now.

307
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.750
We're in the testing phase
or we're in a different

308
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.110
part of the sprint and
not ready for you. Yeah.

309
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.330
And that's why I do
recommend, I mean, I would

310
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.050
love it if project maintainers
read this book as well,

311
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.270
so they could get a
better sense of what are

312
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.450
the contributors even expecting, because
if they, you know, what

313
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.660
your contributors are expecting, then
you can anticipate that a

314
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.620
little better and maybe make
the entire process more pleasant

315
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.220
for everyone. But I do
recommend that they publish some

316
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.100
sort of roadmap and put
that in their contributor guide

317
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.850
and say, Hey please, this,
because that can set up

318
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.470
expectations within the contributor. Oh
wait, they can't look at

319
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.600
my bug right now because
of that. Right? A big

320
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.730
thank you to our sponsors

I k.com/hanselman pivoting a little

336
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.480
bit to more of the
career side, because this, this

337
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.780
book really is about forging
your future, as well as

338
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.360
helping the community. It's not
just a book about how

339
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.900
to contribute to open source.
You, you point out that

340
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:16.190
every project has tedious tasks
that no one likes doing,

341
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.260
whether it be data cleanup
or things that are repetitive,

342
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.020
things that could be scripted.
And you point out that

343
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.050
those are opportunities for someone
to jump in and move

344
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.330
their career forward is a
good opportunity for someone who's

345
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.650
new to a free and
open source project. Absolutely. I

346
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.380
mean, we all want to
do these things if we're

347
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.960
a maintainer of a free
and open source software project,

348
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.480
but because we do have
so many pulls on our

349
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.650
time, we don't get the
chance to follow through. So,

350
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.880
you know, just changing a
variable. So it's standardized across

351
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:53.180
the way, updating tests, updating
documentation, you know, reformatting the

352
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.590
docs to be safe from
ASCII, dr. Mark down. These

353
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.110
are things that for one
reason or another, a project

354
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.420
might have on its roadmap,
but it just doesn't get

355
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.730
to do because it's a
real pain in the butt.

356
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.030
And it's just a lot
of tedious work. But if

357
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.640
you jump in there and
you start doing just little

358
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.380
things here and there, people
will learn that you're reliable,

359
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.980
they will learn that you
care about the project and

360
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.620
you will learn a great
deal about the project. So

361
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.720
you, you will be able
to level up within the

362
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.350
project a lot more quickly.
You'll be super helpful to

363
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.200
the entire community, not just
the project, but all the

364
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.980
users and you yourself will
gain a lot out of

365
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.720
it. And that visibility, that
idea, that software is as

366
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.140
much showing up as it
is writing and contributing code,

367
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.510
that visibility is going to
help your career as well.

368
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.680
People will know you, you
are that person that shows

369
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.580
up and tries to move
the ball forward. Yeah, it

370
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.640
just showing up, showing up
is one of the biggest

371
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.330
things, being reliable, making promises
and following through on them.

372
00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.470
That's how you learn. That's
how you earn trust, right?

373
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.520
Is by showing up and
being reliable and following through

374
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.850
on your promises. And then
once you earn trust, people

375
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.720
will start to trust you
with larger projects or with

376
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.590
leading teams with leading features.
But you have to earn

377
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.020
the trust before you get
to that stage. You can't

378
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.630
just jump in no matter
how great of a programmer

379
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.360
you are. You still have
to earn the trust of

380
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.950
the community. And you actually
show a hierarchy kind of,

381
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.220
of experience and responsibilities that
you represent multiple times in

382
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.610
the book as an onion.
So a series of concentric

383
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:40.800
circles with users on the
outside, and then moving inward

384
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.400
into smaller circles, users, new
contributors, contributors, core contributors, or

385
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.840
then founders and leadership. And
you really, you can't leapfrog

386
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.800
any of those steps. You
really can't. And I forget

387
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:59.580
exactly which, which academic came
up with. The onion model.

388
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.610
Their work is referenced in
the book, but I don't

389
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:03.900
keep it off the top
of my head. But what

390
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.060
I do keep on the
top of my head is

391
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.280
thanking Sage sharp of outreaching.
They and I had coffee

392
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.620
several months ago and they
asked, Hey, do you cover

393
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.110
this in your book? And
I was like, well, gosh,

394
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.710
I, I don't, but that's
just because it never occurred

395
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.840
to me. It's just been
so obvious to me that

396
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.600
I wouldn't have thought to
ask that, but they did

397
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.000
because they hear it all
the time from all of

398
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.810
their mentors and mentees in
the outreachy program. They don't

399
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.980
know that there's a hierarchy.
They don't know that well,

400
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.260
not in all projects, but
almost every project has a

401
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.410
hierarchy. So I was really
grateful to them for, for

402
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.470
suggesting that I include that
in the book. Thank you,

403
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.070
Sage. Yeah, absolutely. Sage has
been very thoughtful and giving

404
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.770
me feedback on how interactions
with the community can be

405
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.650
made better. And the, the
academics that you're referring to

406
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.490
are Walt scotchy and Y
ye and K cause. And

407
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.590
you referenced that. And there's
a lot of actually really

408
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.830
good references. Even beyond the
book, you've done your homework

409
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.860
and you've got the footnotes
and end notes to the

410
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.440
point where I can go
off and find other resources

411
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.350
to learn about. Well, I'm
glad you liked that because

412
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.540
footnotes are not really part
of the standard style guide

413
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.690
for my publisher. Yeah. Yeah.
But there's a bibliography with

414
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.600
like, do you go through
a review of general psychology?

415
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.640
Like there's psychology behind being
successful on opensource? Absolutely. Because

416
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.040
there's some psychology around being
successful in life, in work

417
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.460
in just about anything you
accomplish, at least studying some

418
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:40.170
basic psychology and group dynamics
can help you a great

419
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.140
deal in your career. And
it does work just as

420
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.370
well in free and open
source software. You also Talk

421
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.580
about the difference between free
and open source software or

422
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.500
FOS and OSS and a
little bit about, about licensing

423
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:59.080
Licensing. Yes. So the very
first thing most people consider

424
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.810
when we talk about free
and open source software is

425
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:06.100
licensing. And frankly, I believe
it's the very last thing

426
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.670
we should consider. And I
do make sure that there

427
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.160
is a chapter in the
book on how to release

428
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.800
your open source project, because
a lot of people just

429
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.930
don't know really there's a
better book on that by

430
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.680
Karl Fogel. And that is
referenced in my book, but

431
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.410
it was not proper for
me not to even address

432
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.380
it. And the very last
thing I cover is licensing

433
00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.200
because there's so many other
things you have to get,

434
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.730
right? Frankly, the license usually
does not impact the success

435
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.940
of your free and open
source project. Everything before that,

436
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.480
the documentation, the contributor guide,
the code of conduct, you

437
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.200
know, all of that, that
matters, but the license pick

438
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.830
one that's OSI approved and
meets your specific case, you

439
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:52.300
know, and you're fine. That's
a great point. I've actually

440
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.560
had an interesting situation happened
recently with a license where

441
00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.310
a large company with a
name that everyone would recognize

442
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.510
copied a bunch of code
from a smaller company of

443
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.270
two or three people that
was built on top of

444
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.630
some open source software. You
know, how people built consultancies

445
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.390
on top of their open
source software. And if you

446
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.080
look at the commits, it's
basically a copy paste, a

447
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.840
rename of a bunch of
namespace and the removal of

448
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.200
a, of a copyright. And
we thought it was gonna

449
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.290
be a lot of what
we call mustache twirling. Like

450
00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.930
there was an evil villain
in the background somewhere, but

451
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.490
it turned out. It was
just someone who was not,

452
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.520
not really educated. And even
though it might look malicious,

453
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.310
it was just a matter
of, of, you know, for

454
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.670
lack of a better word,
junior engineer is learning the

455
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.950
process, but it was really
difficult to have the community

456
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:47.980
not see evil versus seeing
a misunderstanding. Yeah. The first

457
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.730
thing you should always do
in any sort of situation

458
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.300
where you feel some sort
of a front is to

459
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.860
always assume ignorance, not malice,
you know, start with ignorance,

460
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.500
particularly where copyright and intellectual
property law is concerned. I

461
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.240
mean, I am not a
lawyer. I'll just get that

462
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.730
out there right now. But
I have spent a lot

463
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.840
of time around a lawyers,
intellectual property lawyers, but also

464
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.940
free and open source software.
And what you have to

465
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:20.680
remember is that copyright is
so important. It's if you

466
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.130
mess with copyright at all,
you are very likely to

467
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.100
get yourself into a world
of legal hurt that will

468
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.870
cost you endless hours, months,
days, years of your life

469
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.650
and more money than you
care to consider. So think

470
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:39.250
about copyright before you go
changing it. And I respect

471
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:44.280
the want, the desire to
quote, clean up the code,

472
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.080
but you can't do that
because that copyright shows who

473
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.260
owns well, that copyright statement
shows who owns the copyright

474
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.490
over that particular piece of
software. If you develop software,

475
00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.270
you instantly have copyright over
it in the vast majority

476
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.390
of countries in the world.
Anything that any country that

477
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.660
is a signatory to what
is called the burn convention,

478
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:11.610
they all do copyright pretty
much the same. So it's

479
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.950
very important not to mess
with it. And I talk

480
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.810
about copyright and intellectual property
law several times throughout the

481
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.470
book, because it is important
that you understand the basics.

482
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.320
You don't have to be
a lawyer, but you have

483
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.820
to understand the basics of
copyright of licensing and of

484
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.790
not messing with that sort
of stuff, because it'll get

485
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.590
you in a lot of
trouble and even worse. It'll

486
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.360
get your company in trouble
and then you get fired.

487
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.680
That's not good for your
future. And speaking of your

488
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.620
company, you have a whole
chapter as well on contributing

489
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.400
open source software while you
are employed. So looking at

490
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.120
your employment agreement, what are
your company's policies? Cause your

491
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.210
employer support free and open
source software. Do they have

492
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.960
their own software? Or what
about moonlighting and all of

493
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.120
those things, the potential pitfalls
that you could bump into,

494
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.760
if you decided to be
an open source person and

495
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.490
perhaps not working for an
open source company. Yeah. That

496
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.670
one gets pretty complicated because
if you're working for a

497
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:12.350
company, the work you do
that copyright belongs to your

498
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.500
company, Right? If you're working
on their machine, on their

499
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.350
network and you're sitting in
their chair on their time,

500
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.990
you made it for them,
You made it for them.

501
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.770
And there are some companies
where your employment agreement will

502
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.980
say that even if you're
not on company time, if

503
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.220
you're on your own time,
it doesn't matter. We own

504
00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.090
your stuff. If you're on
your own time and on

505
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.310
your own computer, okay, that's
yours. But if you're doing

506
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.950
it on our computer, then
it's our stuff. So it,

507
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.630
there is various permutations of
this. And it's important to

508
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.920
be aware of that before
you just casually toss off

509
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.740
a contribution to a free
and open source software project,

510
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.340
that there are plenty of
situations where you don't have

511
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.760
the right to give that
contribution to a project because

512
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.710
it belongs to your company
and you have to get

513
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.790
their approval. So thinking about
that in advance will save

514
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:08.720
you so many headaches. Yeah.
We ended up encouraging this

515
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.950
particular company and this young
developer to bring the binary

516
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.530
in and use the library
as a binary, rather than

517
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.440
trying to bring the source
in. And, you know, the,

518
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.770
ultimately the crisis was averted,
but it would have been

519
00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.200
nice to have a book
like this, to, to share

520
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.700
with the young people and
make it a part of

521
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:31.280
the larger companies, open source
education process. Yeah. That would

522
00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.070
be very nice just to
get people a little more

523
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.190
aware of it. I mean,
in a perfect world, I

524
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:43.240
can wish for companies to
educate their on basic matters

525
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.260
of, of copyright and intellectual
property, but you know, in

526
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.270
a perfect world, I can
also ask for a pony,

527
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.600
but that doesn't mean I'm
going to get it. Indeed.

528
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.670
The last thing I wanted
to say that I really

529
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.070
appreciated about the book is
that you actually have an

530
00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:00.420
appendix that's not caused, not
called glossary. You called it

531
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.080
jargon. You put in all
the jargon that one drops

532
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.900
or it's pages and pages
and pages. When, when, when

533
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.990
people throw things out phrases
that might, I might not

534
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.410
understand, you made sure that
we all understood that. And

535
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.830
that was really cool If
you've ever done any traveling,

536
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.020
even just to the other
side of the country, your

537
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.680
own country, you'll find lots
of terms that people are

538
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.290
using and you don't understand
it. Like you go to

539
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.280
Pennsylvania and what even is
a scrapple, you know, there's

540
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.700
lots of things like that.
And it's very uncomfortable. So

541
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.880
learning the language of the
new environment you are going

542
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.610
to participate in is one
of the best ways for

543
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.820
you to feel comfortable. And
then you will perform better

544
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.080
and you will give much
better contributions and people will

545
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.460
like you better because you're
speaking their language. Well, your

546
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.550
book is called forge your
future with open source. And

547
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:57.390
it's under the pragmatic programmers
imprint, and folks can go

548
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.600
up to the pragmatic programmers
and purchase that, right? Yes.

549
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.740
It's available in early release
beta right now, it's available

550
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.460
in print in mid October.
It's, we're going through all

551
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.780
the pre-publication sort of hoops
right now. But if you

552
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.250
order it now in a
early release beta, then when

553
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.200
it does come out in
print, you get an email

554
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.120
saying, Hey, would you like
to buy the print copy

555
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.480
at a significant discount? So
I do encourage you to

556
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.330
go out and get it.
And, and there's an erotic

557
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.840
section in the book where
if you find any bugs,

558
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.940
you know, this is free
and open source software. Please

559
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.070
let me know what to
fix and that we can

560
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.650
work on it in the
next version. Very cool. Well,

561
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.380
congratulations to you. And thank
you for letting me read

562
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.610
your book. And I hope
that the folks that are

563
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.040
listening will check it out.
I will include a link

564
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.170
in the show notes, so
you can pick that up

565
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.620
and you can connect with
VM on Twitter. I'll put

566
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.720
a link there as well.
Thanks so much for chatting

567
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.030
with me. This has been
great. Thanks so much for

568
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.210
taking the time. This has
been another episode of Hansel

569
00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.010
minutes, and we'll see you
again next week.
