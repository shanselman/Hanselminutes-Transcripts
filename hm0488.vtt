11
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.360
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

12
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.080
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with Abby covert. He's an

13
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.550
information architect and a president
of the information architect Institute.

14
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850
How are you? I'm great.
Thanks so much for having

15
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.600
me Scott. So I know
about software architecture. I know

16
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.160
about building architecture, but what
is information architecture? Well, if

17
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.430
you know about software architecture
and building architecture, then you're,

18
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.640
you're part of the way
they're already information architecture is

19
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.920
the way that we arrange
the parts of something to

20
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.620
make it more understandable as
a whole. So you might

21
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.290
think about that in terms
of software, it would be

22
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.770
deciding the way that we
divide the screens or States

23
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.450
or menus into a language
that is easily understandable by

24
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.060
our users. If you're thinking
about a book, it would

25
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.790
be the way that we've
divided the pages, chapters, the

26
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.300
indexing methodology we've chosen. So
whatever the pieces are for

27
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.570
the particular material that you're
working in, Where does, is

28
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.870
this a part of information?
Science is just like library

29
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.860
science Information architecture is actually
really related to a lot

30
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.740
of different disciplines, which I
think actually highlights how important

31
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.430
it is to sort of
a human newness, a library,

32
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.820
science being one of them,
graphic design, being another software

33
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.140
architecture, being another also you
see it in a kind

34
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.160
of fields like content strategy,
user experience. Yeah. So library

35
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.200
science happens to be one
of the ones that information

36
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.030
architecture has quite a healthy
home in. Is it like,

37
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.920
like I know about the
Dewey decimal system was a

38
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.600
big deal when I was
growing up and they would

39
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.020
explain that is it classification
is that subfield Classification is

40
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.630
a big part of information
architecture work. But I would

41
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.580
say that the understanding of
language Instructure in general is

42
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.980
sort of the, the more
zoomed out perspective on what

43
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.930
it is as a whole.
So it's not just the

44
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.920
way you classify things. It's
also the way that you

45
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.650
organize them in, in other
vicinity is as well from

46
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.020
the, the menus that you
described, the labels that you

47
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.610
choose. And also just the,
the object definitions that you

48
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.160
might go into the description
of a product or service,

49
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.370
You know, it's, it's funny
that you say the object

50
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.850
definitions, because I've always, when
I started in software, I

51
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.390
started in object oriented software.
And one of the first

52
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.730
things that they teach us
is that it's really hard

53
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.580
to name things, but if
you really, really put the

54
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.000
work in to naming them
and organizing them, well, something

55
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.940
will click and then things
will kind of open up

56
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.010
in front of you. So
sometimes we'd sit around and

57
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.140
try to name an object
and people would say, why

58
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.610
is this, why are we
doing this? This is a

59
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.140
waste of time. We're spending
too much time trying to

60
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.630
name this. And the, the
main architect would say, no,

61
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.760
no. If we get this
part right, then everything else

62
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.000
will we'll hang off of
it. Yeah. And the more

63
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.210
people that you get into
that room, having that conversation

64
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.400
about language, it turns out
the, the harder that it

65
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.610
is. So if you're working
in a team of one

66
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.130
and you're trying to define
objects, it's hard enough to

67
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.980
give things names, but when
you get into large corporations

68
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.190
and you try to define
the object names across departments

69
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.100
and across, you know, billing
centers and all these other

70
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.920
things, it turns out that
it can be quite complex.

71
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.780
And I do hear from
people a lot, like, Oh,

72
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200
that's just a semantic argument.
And I'm like, yeah, it's

73
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.600
just a semantic argument. It's
like one of the most

74
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.200
important arguments you can have.
So yeah, it's, it's pretty

75
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.440
interesting to work with companies
on their information, architecture, lots

76
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.920
and lots of arguing. So
you said just twice, I

77
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.820
said just, why do people
just want to put things

78
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.470
in a box like that?
Is this a way of

79
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.560
us classifying information that we're
receiving? Oh man, I think

80
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.870
we could, we could go
pretty deep on philosophy at

81
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.020
that point. I think that
people are not necessarily comfortable

82
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.740
with the lack of true
objectivity in the, in the

83
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.780
world. I mean, we want
to believe that there is

84
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.320
one right way, one wrong
way. One word that is

85
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.650
correct for whatever we're talking
about. And often what we're

86
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.710
actually talking about is what
is correct in our brains.

87
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.740
So our, our mental models
and the language that we've

88
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.700
structured in our own kind
of brain affects us quite

89
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.860
deeply in terms of the
way that we accept other

90
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.980
people's version of the world.
So, yeah, I think that

91
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.470
it is just as an
interesting word. It's one of

92
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.540
the most evil words that
you can use to describe

93
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.090
what somebody else is doing,
especially for a living, I

94
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.940
think. Yeah. It's so it's
such a diminutive. I mean,

95
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.340
it's just, you, you've taken
your entire life's work and

96
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.590
now you're chatting with someone
at a cocktail party. It's

97
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.650
like, Oh, that's just categorizing
stuff. Thank you for, Yeah,

98
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.140
it's just categorizing stuff, guys.
No bigs. Now you mentioned,

99
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.810
I think design there for
a moment. There's a lot

100
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.530
of people talking about UX,
like as two letter acronyms

101
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.620
go, UX seems to be
the hot one and everyone,

102
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.200
just a lot of people
let's just be real, have

103
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.010
jumped into, you know, user
experience and declared themselves user

104
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.820
experience experts. Their qualifications might
be a design degree or

105
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.760
work in this field. Their
qualifications might also just be

106
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.470
that they're really empathetic. What
do you think that UX

107
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.700
has kind of captured the
imagination? Well, I, you know,

108
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.540
maybe hasn't as much. It's
interesting. Actually, if you go

109
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.780
through and look sort of
historically at the rise of

110
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.870
the acronym UX and the
rise of that as a

111
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.870
job title in general, it
has a very close relationship

112
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.630
with IAA. Many of the
people who have been working

113
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.570
in what's now called UX
for more than about seven

114
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.150
years used to have a
job title that was either

115
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.830
web designer or information architects.
And one of the, the

116
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.300
sort of ruptures that happened
really early in that history

117
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.890
was a discussion that began
about something called big IAA

118
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.810
versus little IAA and little
IAA is the classification of

119
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.230
things at the smallest level.
So, you know, deciding a

120
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.850
meta-tags sequence, discussing the metadata
attributes that are going to

121
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.620
be on a particular object,
taking an existing taxonomy and

122
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.240
classifying existing documents, according to
it. So very much more

123
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.990
in the librarianship kind of
vicinity, but big IAA was

124
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.590
this idea that you were
strategically thinking about language and

125
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.050
structure. And I think that
a lot of people in

126
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.950
the information architecture industry got
really into this idea of

127
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.230
big IAA as sort of
our future and how we

128
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.750
could get a seat at
the business and design tables

129
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.300
that were starting to set
up in, in companies and

130
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.380
consultancies and agencies. So over
time there was, you know,

131
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.940
kind of this belief set
that users were really the

132
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.890
differentiator that we were bringing
because other people knew how

133
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.620
to talk about words and
structures, but we were the

134
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.930
ones saying, Oh, you should,
you should be testing these

135
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.990
with users. You should be
doing research strategically and to

136
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.600
what to call things and
how to structure things. So

137
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.930
user experience was really very
much emergent from that school

138
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.940
of thought. And many of
the leaders in the UX

139
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.530
field actually were information architects
to start Interesting. I seem

140
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.060
to remember an article on
dating myself here somewhere in

141
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.950
the early two thousands where
a designer named Jesse James Garrett talked

142
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.830
about big guy in LA.
He was a user experience

143
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.010
person and a designer and
an IAA fans Still is.

144
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.520
Yeah, Jesse is great. He,
he actually gave a keynote

145
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.750
presentation at the information architecture
summit in 2009, which is

146
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.910
sort of, I guess, considered
by many, to be the

147
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.210
moment that we changed from
IAA to UX. And there

148
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.930
was definitely an, an earthquake
of movement after that people

149
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.030
standing up and saying, I'm
going to change the name

150
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.340
of academic programs. I'm gonna
change the name of my

151
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.830
company. I'm gonna change the
offerings that we have in

152
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.010
our agencies. And he's sort
of famous for saying, there's

153
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.650
no such thing as an
information architect or an interaction

154
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.770
designer. We have always been
and will always be user

155
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.130
experience designers. So that was,
that was the wave that

156
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.830
began much of what's been
going on for, you know,

157
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.400
the last decade And for
the techies that are listening

158
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.620
just as an, as an
aside and as a point

159
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.260
of note, Jesse James Garrett also happened
to be the individual who

160
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.550
coined the word Ajax to,
to some of the ways

161
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.300
that we do things with
JavaScript today. Yep. So you

162
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.240
said that that was a
change towards UX, but why

163
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.010
am I having you on
the show as an information

164
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.010
architect and why is there
an information architect Institute and

165
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.720
why are you an <inaudible>
person? Is it it, was

166
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.880
it a split or was
it a refinement of a

167
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.960
particular aspect of information architecture?
So I think that that

168
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.330
was about the time that
we all started to consider

169
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.470
the effect of generalist versus
specialist. And some of us

170
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.410
went off to become very
comfortable as generalists and wanted

171
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.130
to learn as much underneath
the user experience umbrella as

172
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.040
possible. So learning to do
usability tests, learning to do

173
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.230
interaction, design, learning, to code.
So you could build your

174
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.160
own interactive prototypes, kind of
the whole kitten caboodle. Some

175
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.090
of us, myself included have
instead decided to specialize. And

176
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.930
by specializing, we tend to
work on the larger projects

177
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.780
that are specialized in general.
So I don't work on

178
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.780
projects that don't have user
experience people. It's just that

179
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.780
the user experience, people that
I work with understand that

180
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.390
when it comes to semantic
arguing, they would like an

181
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.410
expert to come in to
facilitate that conversation. Is it

182
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.400
hard to sell oneself as
an expert or to even

183
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.990
sell the concept of something
as initially vague as information

184
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.660
architecture, to someone who isn't
immediately familiar with the term?

185
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.550
It's interesting. Cause it's, it's
simultaneously hard to explain and

186
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.340
impossible for strangers to not
be able to explain to

187
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.950
me. So if I ask
a cab driver, like, what

188
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.380
do you think information architecture
is? They almost always can

189
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.770
come to their own definition.
That's pretty darn close just

190
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.950
by thinking it out. Right.
But for whatever reason, I

191
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.550
think that there is a
lot of stigma around selling

192
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.890
specialty in a world of
generalism. You know, like we've

193
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.400
been talking a lot as
an industry about concepts like

194
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.090
being a design unicorn and
designers should code and, you

195
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.400
know, everyone should be testing.
And all of those things

196
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.400
I think are true in
the right context. And as

197
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.660
an information architect, I still
do prototype. I still do

198
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.330
talk to users. It's just
at a different level. My

199
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.680
understanding of those things is
always directly related to structure

200
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.680
and language, as opposed to
interfaces. Would you see people

201
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.920
on the, the interaction design
side go to, So to

202
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.220
see if I understood the
big, a little IAA debate

203
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:15.740
correctly, then little IAA, the
more narrow view is applying

204
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.750
concepts of information science to
web design, web application development,

205
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.980
things like classification and, you
know, pulling information. And then

206
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.780
big guy a is a
bigger, a bigger tent that

207
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.440
includes UX and usability. And
all of those things, as

208
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.320
it relates to the design,
I would say Is the

209
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.400
consideration strategically about what things
should be called and how

210
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.110
things should be structured. So
for example, if you, I

211
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.120
recently worked with a company
that was a midsize startup

212
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.420
that had recently acquired two
other midsize startups, right? So

213
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.820
all of a sudden they
had three languages that were

214
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.750
on table across the 250
people that all of a

215
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.990
sudden worked under this one
company name. And they had

216
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.840
all these applications that slowly
over time have to be

217
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.890
migrated towards a consistent vocabulary.
Otherwise they're going to have

218
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.310
all sorts of efficiency, efficiency
problems, as well as communication

219
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.700
problems with their, their customer
service staff, their customers, you

220
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.310
know, the marketing departments, everything.
So when it comes to

221
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.030
a task like that little
IAA would be listening to

222
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.090
the direction of what's been
decided and helping the team

223
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.790
to reclassify things on a
piece by piece basis and

224
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.350
saying, okay, well, this is
going to get called this.

225
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.360
This is going to get
called. That big idea is

226
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.560
having the very difficult conversations
at the top level of

227
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.230
an organization to get them
to even understand that a

228
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.190
single vocabulary is necessary and
then going through all of

229
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.280
the vocabularies that might exist
trying to get to okay,

230
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.070
what's the right way forward.
What's the directionality that we

231
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.660
should actually be taking as
a group. Okay. So then

232
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.940
with little IAA, you could
have been brought in by

233
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.250
some middle manager to work
on a project. And big

234
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.020
idea is going to have
you having a conversation with

235
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.040
the CIO and maybe the
CEO about why this could

236
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.150
be huge for the whole
company. Oh, okay. And I

237
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.330
remember a couple of years
ago you were having a

238
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.900
chat with me and selling
me on IAA before. And

239
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.600
what popped for me was
a story you had about

240
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.290
reorganizing a menu for a
large, a large food company.

241
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.970
Would you mind telling me
that story again? Because it

242
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.360
was, it all snapped together
for me that day. Sure.

243
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.410
Yeah. I worked for a
large fast food restaurant chain

244
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.260
a couple of years back.
And the big problem statement

245
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.260
that they had was that
even though the name of

246
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.780
the food that they are
most famous for is in

247
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.960
their name, people were asking
their staff over and over

248
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.690
again. What should I order
here? It had completely gotten

249
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.930
lost in sort of the
cruft of their menu system.

250
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.390
And I'm not talking about
their online menu. I'm talking

251
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.600
about like the paper menu
that's laminated, you know, in

252
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.060
the restaurant itself. And when
we looked at it, what

253
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.820
we found was that because
they had a focus on

254
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.030
that one item that item
had become kind of watered

255
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.500
down over time and with
franchisees and different stakeholders and

256
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.410
different agencies getting involved to
run things like campaigns for

257
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.590
different holiday seasons, et cetera,
they kind of lost their

258
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.440
way. So I helped them
to reduce their menu by

259
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.430
about 40%. And we also
reorganized it from a taxonomy

260
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.970
standpoint and kind of messed
with the labeling system and

261
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.550
the way that that users
would interact with that menu

262
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.970
to focus on that core
item. But then also focus

263
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.420
on the idea of adding
sides. And the result was

264
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.990
a 4% increase of sales
in the stores that implemented

265
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.000
that menu just in the
first year alone. So it

266
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.440
was a, it was a
really great case study for

267
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.440
me to just understand that
the information architecture work that

268
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.500
I do, isn't just applied
in the digital world. It's

269
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.240
actually quite applicable in things
like print design. And this

270
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.380
was like absolutely measurable. This
isn't statistically insignificant. This isn't

271
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.420
a small thing that corporate
w you know, when, when

272
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.110
this new change has been
made measurable, fundamental change in

273
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.000
our company, our business and
our fundamental bottom line. Yeah,

274
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.820
no, it was definitely covered
by places like the Atlantic

275
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.640
and business insider and a
couple others publish the case

276
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.860
study as well. I don't
have to make you feel

277
00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.440
really great. Yeah. I wish
that I wasn't known as

278
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.680
the restaurant menu expert, not
to be named in the

279
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.010
articles, but you know, that's,
that's contract negotiation for you.

280
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.140
Oh, wow. So you're actually
not even mentioned in the

281
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.220
articles. So you're kind of
like an information architecture Ninja,

282
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.990
right. You just get into
the place and you do

283
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.200
the job and then you
fly out and no one

284
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.840
ever knows you. Yup. Always
behind the clipboard. Oh, that's

285
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.020
all right. I mean, certainly
it's unfortunate because they, I'm

286
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.700
sure the articles pigeonhole you.
But the, the idea though,

287
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.770
that you can kind of
flip big IAA switches, flip

288
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:48.550
little IAA switches and transform
an entire supply chain is

289
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.430
pretty, pretty significant. To be
honest, it wouldn't even be

290
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.260
my name that I'd be
wishing for the article to

291
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.200
mention it would be information
architecture in general. I did.

292
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.050
One of them said the
word taxonomy and I almost

293
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:03.250
fell over. So that was
pretty good. That's a word

294
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.190
that they've been using at
work a lot lately. And

295
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.020
I'm, I get a little
bit of an Inigo Montoya

296
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.830
moment sometimes when people use
taxonomy, you know, you keep

297
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.680
using that word. I don't
think the thing that means

298
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.570
that what you think it
means. Yeah, no taxonomies get

299
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.720
used a lot to mean
navigation systems on websites, which,

300
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.870
you know, I mean, taxonomy
is just the classification system

301
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.710
of something. So the manifestation
of a navigation menu could

302
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.950
be classified as a taxonomy,
but it's sort of like

303
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.110
the thought that you can
go across the street and

304
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.060
look at a building and
really understand it from an

305
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.240
architectural standpoint, you might see
the facade, you can see

306
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.130
what the building looks like
on the outside, but you're

307
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.610
not actually looking at how
it's constructed. So to say

308
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.010
that you can even see
a taxonomy is, is kind

309
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:50.560
of flawed. This episode of
Hansel minutes is brought to

310
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.700
you by Braintree code for
easy online payments. If you're

311
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.860
building a mobile app and
you're searching for a simple

more. And for your first

322
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:41.050
$50,000 in transactions fee free,
go to brain tree payments.com/hanselman

323
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:50.730
that's Braintree payments.com/hanselman. How many?
And this might be a

324
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.640
wrong question, but I guess,
I suppose information architecture, there

325
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.750
are no wrong questions, but
how many people leap into

326
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.470
IAA as a career with
really no, no background, no

327
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.020
business doing it. They just
think that they are clever

328
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.600
and they talk their way
through. They talk their way

329
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.420
into being an information architect,
as opposed to looking at

330
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.380
it from the science perspective.
Interesting. Well, I definitely wouldn't

331
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.480
classify it as a science
and I think by your

332
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.780
definition, a lot of people
probably do, but I think

333
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.760
that there's probably a lot
of people like that in

334
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.560
any industry. You know, I
could ask you the same

335
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.800
thing about software development. Well,
I've been coasting on charm

336
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.620
for almost 20 years now
joined the call. I shouldn't

337
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.560
have, the reason I ask
is that you've got this

338
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.000
great article on your blog
at <inaudible> dot com called.

339
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.090
So you want to be
an information architect and you

340
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.510
talk about these kind of
prototypical emails that show up

341
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.450
where it's like, you know,
I have this job and

342
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.580
it's not really working out
the way I planned. I'm

343
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.800
hearing about information architecture. And
that seems like a job

344
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.810
I should do. And you
kind of go through the

345
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:55.250
motivations for why one would
do this. And all of

346
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.560
them seem like great motivations,
but you tear them down

347
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.170
one by one. I mean,
I think that in order

348
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:04.130
to really become an information
architect, you have to be

349
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.530
ready. You know, back to
that restaurant example, you have

350
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.360
to be ready to be
behind the scenes and you

351
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.210
also have to be ready
to have a job where

352
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:15.140
it is your sole purpose
to make other people agree

353
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.040
on language and structure, which
generally means leaving your opinions

354
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.770
of the door and not
bringing them into the boardroom.

355
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.150
Even if you think that
that's going to make you

356
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.310
look really smart. And I
think that a lot of

357
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.610
people struggle with that understanding
when they first hear the

358
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:34.100
term because of, I guess
the starchitect mentality that physical

359
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.590
architecture has taken on where,
you know, Oh, I'm going

360
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.020
to, I'm going to be
the head designer on a

361
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.620
large building. That's what an
architect is. And in reality,

362
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.320
you know, I think 98%
of architects are not doing

363
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.510
that kind of work. They're
doing the work that no

364
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.930
one ever knows about. And
it's really important work because

365
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.660
it's how the structures we
dwell in don't fall on

366
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.780
our heads, you know, but
it's not the most glamorous

367
00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.510
of, of circumstances. So I
do feel the need to

368
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.200
kind of tell people that
when they email me, if

369
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.200
that's your motivation to like
make more money and be

370
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.750
really well known, then like
you're barking up the wrong

371
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.680
tree, for sure. Interesting. So
it isn't as much coming

372
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.620
in and saying, all right,
I'm here, habeas here. And

373
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.800
I have a plan. And
then you impose that plan.

374
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.310
You really are coming there.
There's a amount of consensus

375
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.820
building. Yeah. Yeah, no. And
agreement is the medium that

376
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.920
I work in the most
because you know, back to

377
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.220
the idea that there is
no one right way. I

378
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.590
mean, if you look at
something as simple as a

379
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.640
grocery store website classifying their
produce, right? We could have

380
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.690
an argument for 12 minutes
about how Linnaean taxonomy puts

381
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.450
tomatoes and zucchinis as fruit,
but we're not going to

382
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.490
classify them that way on
our grocery store website, because

383
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.730
nobody would be able to
find the dang things. So

384
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.990
I find that having, you
know, the smarts to understand

385
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.420
what you think you understand
about the world is actually

386
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.150
not enough when it comes
to information architecture, you need

387
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.280
to be the one that's
willing to set all that

388
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.720
aside and listen to people's
mental models, get voiced, and

389
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.850
then be the one that
can compare those and draw

390
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.610
out the distinctions and say,
okay, when you say this

391
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.520
word, this person over here
does not hear the same

392
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.400
thing that you're hearing. They
hear this completely different concept.

393
00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.800
So let's talk it out.
And I, I happened to

394
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.730
be good at, at that
particular thing, That must be

395
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.820
really difficult for people who
are large businesses. I imagine

396
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.570
you going into a said
food place with the menu,

397
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.550
talking to some older, you
know, I've been in this

398
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.590
business for 50 years and
this is how we've always

399
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.190
done it type of an
individual. Who's now being told

400
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.130
that the way that they
clap, they categorize things isn't

401
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.040
working and here's the science
behind it. You don't know

402
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.860
anything about their business, right?
They grew up in their

403
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.410
business, maybe they're their mom
and dad gave them the

404
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.540
business and then you have
to come together. And then

405
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.180
at the end, everyone has
to agree and be happy.

406
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.030
Yeah, that's it, that's the
most difficult part of my

407
00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.550
job I would say, is,
is dealing with the emotions

408
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.340
behind people letting go of
their one way of doing

409
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.580
things and moving towards a
new way. It seems really

410
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.700
simple, but it's actually not
people go through like all

411
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.220
of the defined stages of
grief when it comes to

412
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.490
letting go of their way
of organizing things in my

413
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.090
experience, In, in your, so
you want to be an

414
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.020
information architect blog, one of
your motivations says you want

415
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.730
to be an information architect
because you're in love with

416
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:28.310
the idea of spreading clarity
and understanding. Somehow I somehow

417
00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.940
just thought that you would
just kind of like, ah,

418
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.380
I'm here. Oh, I'm such
a hippie sometimes. Yeah, totally.

419
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.660
No, but, but, but you,
you know, it's not, it's

420
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.840
not quite that glamorous. No,
it's not. I mean, spreading

421
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.330
clarity on understanding. I don't
think I've ever been glamorous

422
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.100
for any person who's ever
tried it, you know, it's

423
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.640
a pretty thankless job, but
it's also really necessary. I

424
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:52.050
mean, I think that having
bold dreams for what one

425
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.900
can accomplish in the world
is important and mine would

426
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.670
be that I want to
make the world a clearer

427
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.250
place, but I also understand
that I'm only ever going

428
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.590
to be a very small
part of doing that. So

429
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.630
that's why I spend so
much time talking to other

430
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.080
people about information architecture. So
if we have names for

431
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.270
these things, we can learn
more about them. And I

432
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.490
think that I is one
of those things that a

433
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.680
lot of people don't have
a name for. They're sorta

434
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.770
like, well, it's really good
looking. And it meets all

435
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.160
of our business goals and
it's still not really doing

436
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.750
the thing it's supposed to
do. It still doesn't make

437
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.990
sense to our users. And
I think that with words

438
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.860
we can have conversations about,
about things like that. So

439
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.110
you modestly said that you
would be a small part

440
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.210
of that and you can't
really make the world a

441
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.640
better place, but you do
have a thing you're working

442
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.120
on right now called world
I a day that people

443
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.360
can see at <inaudible> dot
org A day has been

444
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.040
an amazing experience for me
to understand. There are a

445
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.130
ton of people in this
world that really do believe

446
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.890
in those words and want
to further them in their

447
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.160
local communities. So world AIDS
day is sponsored by the

448
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.880
information architecture Institute, which I'm
currently the president of. And

449
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.090
we started world AIDS day
five years ago, at which

450
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:07.010
point we had 14 locations
in 14 countries. Now in

451
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.390
2016, we were looking at
73 locations in 39 countries

452
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.270
across six continents. So all
we got left now is

453
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:18.320
Antarctica. So if there's any
information architect, enthusiasts listening from

454
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.540
Antarctica, please let me know.
I would love to talk

455
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.760
to you about 2017. Yeah.
I'm looking at this here,

456
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.780
a call for cities, the
one that's now closed. And

457
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.060
anytime I hear that, there's
something going on. I look

458
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.610
for Portland where I live
and I'm like, well, surely

459
00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.430
there won't be a day
in Portland and then boom,

460
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.100
there Portland's GAF. Portland's been
great. We've had one in

461
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.780
Portland for the last four
years. It's one of our

462
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.770
most beloved events. Oh, okay.
Well then Portland is, as

463
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.230
far as I'm concerned, is,
is the central location of

464
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:53.020
this event. Yeah. I'm going
to check that out. And

465
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.300
then you've got a book
that is really got a

466
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.850
great title. I'm I'm, it's
called how to make sense

467
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:03.040
of any mess. Yep. As
of last November, I considered

468
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.210
myself an author. So that
was pretty exciting. Was it

469
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.240
hard as, as you've been
doing this forever, right. You've

470
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.480
been an information architecture architect
for a long time. Was

471
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.200
it hard to organize the
information in a book? Was

472
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.300
that like, did you just
do your job? And it

473
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.010
was fine. It was a
book just came together or

474
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.260
was it more difficult? It
was very, very difficult. Yeah.

475
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.510
It was probably the most
meta IAA task that I

476
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.330
have assigned to myself in
my career. It was a,

477
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.790
it definitely did not just
come together. It went through

478
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.690
many, many revisions. It did
not have that particular name

479
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.170
until pretty late in the
game. Actually, the story of

480
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.510
the name was that I
was avoiding the words table

481
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:45.760
of contents and the chapters
were all very actionable. You

482
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.370
know, we have identify the
mass state, your intent face

483
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.860
reality. And they were all
like steps of this process.

484
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.590
And so when I was
naming the process, I named

485
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.420
it how to make sense
of any mess. And I

486
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.060
used that as the header,
instead of saying table of

487
00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.980
contents. And I was showing
it to a good friend

488
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.610
of mine, Carl Collins, and he
famously ripped the cover of

489
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.010
the book off and was
like, this, this is the

490
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.530
name of the book. And
so I went with it

491
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:10.660
and I'm really glad I
did cause this it's the

492
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.640
kind of name that people
stop you in an airport

493
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.100
and ask like, what's that
book about, which I never

494
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.440
would have expected on a
books on something that I

495
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.930
was starting to consider to
be a pretty dry topic.

496
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:25.150
Yeah. A cover design definitely
matters. And, and, and I

497
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.180
don't mean to gush. I
don't usually gush with, with

498
00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.820
guests, but not only is
the, the title good, but

499
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.730
when you flip it over
as a, as a programmer,

500
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.900
I like because you have
the seven steps, you have

501
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.720
these words in red. So
it's like, identify the mess

502
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:45.420
where identifies in red state,
your like, it's, it's systematic.

503
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.880
And without even opening the
book, you're like, wait a

504
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.520
second. This is actually like
a planned, organized this isn't

505
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.880
some fufu, you know, way
of thinking about the world.

506
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.850
This is like, here is
a way to think this

507
00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.660
works for us. You should
get involved. It's very actionable.

508
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.990
It's a very verb. You
know what I mean? Thank

509
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.460
you very much. Yeah. I
think a big part of

510
00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.760
information architecture is breaking the
world into nouns and verbs

511
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.830
and the relationship that they
have to each other. So

512
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.340
the, the back cover design
definitely reflects that methodology as

513
00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.170
well. Yeah. And it's also
got a 42, five star

514
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.430
reviews, so you're doing pretty
well And incredibly proud to

515
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.920
see the movement since the
book came out. It's been

516
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.160
great. One of the other
things that I was surprised

517
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.120
as I started researching information
architecture is not only defined

518
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.550
people like Jesse James Garrett, who I
thought of as being a

519
00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.600
UX person, but also a
person named Richard Saul Wurman.

520
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:43.400
Oh yeah. Ricky, he's one
of my heroes. So I

521
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.680
think about things like, you
know, like there's this like

522
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.430
legendary character who like created
and then, you know, Oh,

523
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.830
Ricky, I sure. I assume
you have him on speed

524
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.380
dial he's in your favorites.
I do not know. I

525
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.840
love nicknames for people. And
that is the one that

526
00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.840
I've associated with him for
the longest. Yeah. I think

527
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.520
I'm Richard Saul Wurman is,
is absolutely by far number

528
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.610
one hero of my career.
He just has this way

529
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.670
of writing about things and
talking about things is no

530
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:13.790
nonsense completely to the heart
of the point. And he

531
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.360
really cares about making the
world clearer. And I find

532
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.120
that there's not a lot
of people that have that

533
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.550
as their sole intention. And
I, I feel like I've,

534
00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.090
I've copied that from him
for sure. And he's been

535
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.720
doing IAS the, since the
early seventies. Yeah. He's actually

536
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.240
the one who coined the
term for the first time

537
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.660
at a conference for physical
architects, which is what his

538
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.000
background and training is in.
So he was the one

539
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.380
that introduced the world of
physical architecture into the world

540
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.770
of graphic design and using
the term information architect to

541
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.520
describe the people that would
wrangle these kinds of, you

542
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.960
know, battles of misinformation, a
book that he wrote in,

543
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.990
I think the late eighties,
early nineties called information anxiety

544
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:59.720
is one of my favorites.
I would definitely recommend for

545
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.640
anybody out there to, to
pick a copy of that

546
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.600
up. And for, for people
who may be listening and

547
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.180
thinking that we're just throwing
cool names out. I point

548
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:13.280
out not only did Jesse James Garrett
do the term Ajax, but

549
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.180
Richard saw a woman also
created the Ted conference. So

550
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.220
you may be familiar with
that if you're not familiar

551
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.560
with all of his other
work, That that is one

552
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.310
of his, his greatest calling
cards, That'd be pretty slick

553
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.630
to be able to do
something like that. If you

554
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.490
can just say, Oh yeah,
you ever heard of IAA?

555
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.680
Well, no. Well, what about
Ted? Oh, Ted do the

556
00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.590
Ted. I do use that
a lot actually to lend

557
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.380
credibility to the term. Cause
people you would like to

558
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.150
ask, where did it come
from? When did it start?

559
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.040
I think it's really interesting
because I think a lot

560
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.670
of people assume that it
was invented, you know, sometime

561
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:46.000
in the late nineties because
of web design, but not.

562
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.580
And interestingly, if you look
at it, it's an extremely

563
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.600
organized website with a large
group of a large Corpus,

564
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.610
that one has to find
their way around and I've

565
00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.190
never had any problem finding
my way around there. Yep.

566
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.790
The other thing that I
wanted to ask you about

567
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.880
is that you've got a,
on your blog on Abby

568
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.570
DIA. There was this one
post, I think it was

569
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.300
earlier this year, that was
called, this is the work.

570
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.420
That's one of my favorites.
I wrote that from my

571
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.570
sister. Okay. I'm glad would
you, would you share that

572
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.060
with us share what that's
about with, with, with me?

573
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.510
I think that especially when
you get into the academic

574
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.110
environment, that idea of right
and wrong and correct and

575
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.830
incorrect and there being one
right way really comes pretty

576
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.850
clear. I mean, students, especially
students who are trying to

577
00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.950
work their way through an
immense amount of work in

578
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.500
a graduate degree program in
their final year, which is

579
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.360
what my job is, is
to take them through that

580
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.660
final semester of their final
year. They can get really

581
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:50.790
overwhelmed with this idea of
having conversations about semantics and

582
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.520
structure with themselves. They can
think that it's a waste

583
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.680
of time. They can think
that they're kind of circling

584
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.660
the bowl a little bit
more than they should be.

585
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.570
But I find that time
and time again, what's really

586
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:05.010
happening is procrastination and distraction
from getting real about those

587
00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.950
topics is what is holding
them back. So I encourage

588
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.880
my students to sit down
and put away the computer,

589
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.100
get out a piece of
paper and think about the

590
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.620
words. And that can be
really difficult for them to

591
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.260
understand that like that's not,
that's not an act of

592
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.430
post-it theater, right? That's not
like a design theatrical exercise

593
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.720
that we're having you do.
So you look like a

594
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.410
designer. It's actually where the
work happens. The work does

595
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.380
not happen in making, you
know, wire frames for the

596
00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.080
final thing that some of
the work. But if you

597
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.140
don't do that upfront piece
to understand what it is

598
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.050
you're making before you decide
how to make it, you

599
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.710
can get yourself into a
pretty big, I think that's

600
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.410
a really good reminder to
everyone. I mean, I have

601
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.500
been over the last 20
years in front of giant

602
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.870
whiteboards with a stack of
post it notes on a

603
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.800
problem and a room full
of people and had an,

604
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.820
a number of instances, them
say that that wasn't useful

605
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.120
what we were doing right
there. That's when I that's,

606
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.890
when I felt the most
useful, like I like we're

607
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.320
really getting into it right
now. Like we've been, you

608
00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.700
know, like, I like what
you said, post it, note

609
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.640
theater, although that's going to
make me wonder if I'm

610
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.880
really doing it right in
the future, but it does

611
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.860
feel like the work, like,
I feel like that's like,

612
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.080
aren't we all agreeing, aren't
we moving towards agreement? Are

613
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.010
we getting in that general
direction right now? Well, a

614
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.130
lot of times I think
when those objections come up,

615
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.550
it's because their mental model
of whatever's being discussed is

616
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.040
so far off from the
model being drawn on the

617
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.380
post it notes or on
the whiteboard that they're not

618
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.950
yet comfortable with this idea
that they might not be

619
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.100
part of the solution. They
might be part of the

620
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.150
problem. So you may Be,
you may have touched on

621
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.650
the moment where they felt
like they were being left

622
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.250
behind. Exactly. Like going back
to that person who has

623
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:47.170
had this, the business, and
this is the way we've

624
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.660
already always done things. I
mean, that's the person who

625
00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.760
stands up in the meeting
when I'm at the whiteboard

626
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.160
myself. And it's like, I
don't know why we're wasting

627
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.470
our time on this particular
step when we could just

628
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.600
be going back to our
desk and doing our job,

629
00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.610
we hired you. You're the
expert, figure it out. And

630
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:04.060
I'm like, okay, that's, that's
not, that's not what's happening

631
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.520
right here. Like what we're
working on is agreement. We're

632
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.980
not working on, you know,
my drawing skills at this

633
00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:13.480
white board. Like that's counter
to the point. The best

634
00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.060
part about that blog post
is the way you talk

635
00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.020
about what words do you
not want used to describe

636
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:24.220
your work? You basically force
people to lean in and

637
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.470
face the uncomfortable there is
criticism about the work, or

638
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.990
people may disagree with your
work. So let's just talk

639
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.670
about that right now. Like
what are the words that

640
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.040
you don't want people to
say? Yeah. And sometimes those

641
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.480
are things that can be
avoided. Other times you struggled

642
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.530
to come up with what
those words are, and that

643
00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.990
tells you that maybe the
fear is much bigger in

644
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.570
your head than it is
in reality. And I think

645
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.140
that getting people to have
conversations in simple terms like

646
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.720
adjectives, you know, it's just
like, let's just put out

647
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.780
some adjectives right now. What
would be the adjectives you'd

648
00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.730
be proud for your work
to be described as, and

649
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.370
then what are the opposites
of those things and does

650
00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.740
the opposite make you less
proud? Or is it something

651
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.160
that you should actually just
accommodate for? I've had students

652
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.270
have a lot of breakthroughs
through activities like that. Well,

653
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:12.490
I really appreciate you chatting
