and gets his response to
the fluster over show one

10
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.030
45. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

11
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.220
of Hansel minutes, a little
bit of an unusual show

12
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.620
this week. We've uncle Bob,
back on the show from

13
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.360
just a couple of weeks
ago. How are you, sir?

14
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.580
We had some interesting response
from the show on solid

15
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.910
principles. I thought it was
a pretty straightforward show and

16
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.910
I didn't think it was
particularly controversial, but there were

17
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.580
a number of interesting developments
since since that show. Yeah,

18
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.570
there have been quite a,
quite a fuss got raised.

19
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.480
Why was that controversial? So
I guess I'm one of

20
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.080
the followers of your show
is, is Joel Spolsky and

21
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.390
it was listening to it
at some point. And I

22
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.970
think he had heard us
talking about the solid principles

23
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.230
and it, it somehow triggered
something in his mind. It

24
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.200
didn't resonate really well because
he went on stack overflow

25
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.060
podcast, number 38 for those
and made some rather startling

26
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.010
statements, which by the way,
he has apologized for it.

27
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.150
He is a gentleman. He
was very respectful about it,

28
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.350
but he said at the
time that, well, my goodness,

29
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.510
these principles sound awfully bureaucratic.
And frankly only somebody who

30
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.560
doesn't code a lot could
say something like that. And

31
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.200
you can imagine that I
didn't take that particularly well.

32
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.780
That was, that was something
that pushed my button. So

33
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.660
after that there was a
blog war and then, you

34
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.380
know, Twitter was all about,
you know, all this stuff

35
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.610
that was going on. And,
and the blogosphere of our

36
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.050
particular blogosphere was quite activated.
So I contacted Joel and

37
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.260
we did a pod stack
overflow, number 41 together. And

38
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.730
that was, that was a
lot of fun. We had

39
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.900
a great time today. Okay.
So it's, it's all genial,

40
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.040
but I noticed in your,
in your comments, there were,

41
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.220
It was widely varied. There
were some people that were

42
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.000
saying that that user were
out of touch and were

43
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.090
not being practical. There were
people on the other side

44
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.020
that were saying that the
stack overflow website was, you

45
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.260
know, slapped together with no
principles at all. I give

46
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.080
a lot of respect to
people who, who, who I

47
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.120
basically, I like to use
success as a metric. So

48
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.770
I have no idea what
the code for stack overflow.

49
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.350
It looks like, but he
did get it live. We'll

50
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.650
see if it's maintainable or
not. How do you reconcile

51
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.920
these different and very polarized
opinions on each side? Oh,

52
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.940
I didn't know. Did you
watch the election? I mean,

53
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.880
I just, I'm surprised there's
controversy at all. I mean,

54
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.380
the principles are not commandments.
No, the principles of course

55
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.230
aren't commandments and, and, you
know, I think Joel kind

56
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.570
of took it from, from
the point of view that,

57
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.000
Oh my God, people listening
to this might actually think

58
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.340
that they have to do
this all the time. And

59
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.740
that's certainly not the same
are mystics. They are, they

60
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.700
are guidelines. They're an attempt
to categorize things, things about

61
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.570
code that in general are
good, but it would be,

62
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.980
it would be awful if
someone took those principles and

63
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.000
just practice them by rote,
without giving any thought to

64
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.930
them. And I really think
that was the thought that

65
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.690
Joel was following you. Can't
just follow principles. Although it

66
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.890
did annoy me that he
thought that I had too

67
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.410
many codes again, he apologized
for that. So I think

68
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.200
that you're okay with it.
And you're right. I mean

69
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.530
the, the stack overflow site,
I haven't seen the code

70
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.660
for the site and I
was very taken aback by

71
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.060
Jeff's statement that, you know,
quality just doesn't matter. But

72
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.180
he explained that well, and
then went on to say

73
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.760
that while there are actually
the quality of it so

74
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.900
forth, the point is, is
that he recently, he recently

75
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.670
moved that site moved all
the servers and the, the,

76
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.530
the exercise went particularly well,
which implies that there's some,

77
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.310
some high degree of quality
involved with that, the engineering

78
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.890
of that site. So I
don't actually think that he,

79
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.290
you know, slapdash and code
together in a kind of

80
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.240
hackers paradise. I think that
stack overflow is probably done

81
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.610
very well. I'm sure that
bod bugs has done very

82
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.930
well. Also. I think these
guys really do feel like

83
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.060
quality is important, but in
their statements, they captured a

84
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.830
mindset which somehow rubs me
the wrong way. And that

85
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.450
that mindset is that the
most important thing is to

86
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.680
get done. I'm not sure
they believe bad, but I

87
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.020
think the most important thing
is to get done. Well,

88
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.180
I actually think that getting
done well is faster than

89
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.440
getting done by an E
O is the best to

90
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.850
get them is to make
sure that the code that

91
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.320
you produce is the best
possible that the designs are

92
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.400
as robust as they can
be, that you have put

93
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.570
the thought into it that
that really matters. And that

94
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.180
way you will get done
faster than if you got

95
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.130
done, if you rush. And
this is something that software

96
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.330
developers really need to internalize
because we're, we are often

97
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.350
caught by the need to
move quickly. And so we

98
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.840
will make a mess in
the name of moving quickly

99
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.690
without realizing that the is
the thing that makes us

100
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.970
place. Well, there's always that
sense of I'll get back

101
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.580
to that. I'll get back
to that. And even 20

102
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.060
years in, I'm still, that's
such an attractive concept that,

103
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.490
Oh yeah, I'll just, you
know, to do. And then

104
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.100
I'll, I'll be right back.
I never seem to come

105
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.120
back though. And you know,
this isn't an age old

106
00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.600
problem. People have been rushing
through things probably since people

107
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.390
were. So we have old
adages that say, you know,

108
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.870
slow and steady will re
instead of stashing as fast

109
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.230
as you possibly can. So
it, you know, ancient history

110
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.620
will tell us that. And
there's something to be said

111
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.770
for taking your time and
doing things well, another old

112
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.240
adage, anything worth doing is
worth doing well. There's a

113
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.660
reason for that. If all
things equal, who's got burned

114
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.750
by taking the shortcuts and
then come back at the

115
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.020
Y you know, probably just
better to do it right.

116
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.660
Instead of rushing that. Now
there was a, an interesting

117
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.420
blog post by one of
my team members named Rob

118
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.820
Connery in response to this
whole thing. And before Rob

119
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.000
was a geek, he was
a geophysicist. And he kind

120
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.220
of talked about how he
went from being an apprentice

121
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.870
to being a journeyman and
kind of moved his way

122
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.020
up. And there was a
really excellent comment within his,

123
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.460
his larger post, about another
apprentice who went through the

124
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.880
process and he spent eight
years as an electrician and

125
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.410
had some very interesting anecdotes
about how he avoided basically

126
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:19.120
getting killed by listening to
his, you know, his mentor

127
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:26.050
and the formality of this
apprentice journeyman process. Well, pretty

128
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.510
much anybody can jump out
of school and whip out

129
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.650
code. Is there a, is
there a direct analogy between

130
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.720
that? I mean, I know
that there's an excellent book

131
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.410
called the software architects profession
that draws an absolutely direct

132
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.050
allegory between software, software architecture
and building architecture and people

133
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.170
find using building codes and
things like that. A very

134
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.210
attractive parallel story to tell
is, is it that simple?

135
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.500
I think simple is a
very loaded word in case.

136
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.270
I do think, however, that
we have a big problem,

137
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.030
which is that people do
come out of school, they're

138
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.190
from the room and expect
it to be able to

139
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.020
write really great code. And
there's very little, very little

140
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.940
of the mentorship or apprenticeship
or guidance given where it

141
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.480
is given. It's proven to
work extremely well. If you

142
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.430
have a group of, of
young developers or students, and

143
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.580
you put them under the
care of, of a senior

144
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.530
mentor, senior programmer, and they
program together and they work

145
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:37.740
together, those, those students will
learned a tremendous amount and

146
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.880
become much better software developers
and software engineers, because of

147
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.430
it. We see this all
through various kinds of industries,

148
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:52.830
the doctors, practices, lawyers, practicing
martial artists, practicing. We have

149
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.850
not yet internalized that as
part of our profession, but

150
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.250
I think it's something that
will have to happen. Did

151
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.960
you read Pete Green's book
from Oh, gee seven, eight

152
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.620
years ago called software craftsmanship
where he proposed the whole

153
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.760
apprenticeship model. Yes. And, and
that, that model is something

154
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.730
that I'm having trouble getting
my mind around, because if

155
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.090
you, if you draw the,
if, if you, if you

156
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.430
kind of draw a parallel
again, let's just say somebody

157
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.800
and I, and again, I'm
not mean to impugn people

158
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.410
who didn't go to college,
but let's just take this

159
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.410
to its kind of ridiculous
conclusion guide drops out of

160
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.250
high school decides to become
an electrician as shoes, the

161
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.340
apprenticeship program, doesn't talk to
the union, decides to just

162
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.700
start putting wires in houses.
You know, eventually he'll get,

163
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.960
he'll get caught up with
same thing, applies with lawyers

164
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.840
and doctors. I can't just
decide that I'm going to

165
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.470
be a doctor. And then
when another doctor with 20

166
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.870
years experience says, Hey, you
didn't go through a residency.

167
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.800
You didn't take, you didn't
get your PhD. The young

168
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.410
doctor doesn't get to go
and say, Hey says you

169
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.320
I'm awesome. I have natural
talent. School's not for me,

170
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.200
man. That same story works
in the software industry except

171
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.730
it's allowed Well, it isn't
loud. No one, I, we

172
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:20.570
haven't really internalized the, the
idea that that software development

173
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:25.820
skills are acquired over a
long period of time. And

174
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.620
part of the reason for
that, I think is that

175
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:33.140
writing your first program, it's
just silly for some of

176
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.250
us. Some people are just
born with this skill where

177
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.380
they can string logical, logical
statements together and can write

178
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.460
programs that do things, but
they don't recognize that it

179
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.200
takes a good long time
to figure out what a

180
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.510
good structure for software and
how to subdivide systems into

181
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.380
modules and how to manage
the dependencies between those modules.

182
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.140
There's a lot of skill
involved and there's a lot

183
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.250
of skill involved with the,
the negotiation with customers and

184
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.030
the, the vexing of requirements
and the writing of tests.

185
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.450
There's a huge body of
knowledge and a set of

186
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.870
skills that needs to be
acquired. College doesn't even begin

187
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.720
to approach that. And in
fact of most of the

188
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.040
graduates are just barely able
to survive in a corporate

189
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.730
environment and certainly should not
be put thrown into the

190
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.940
fire of building huge systems
without appropriate guidance. Yeah. I

191
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.580
agree with that. I, I
taught, I was a professor

192
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.470
at a state school for
awhile and I taught a

193
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.160
400 level C-sharp class. And
I was pretty surprised regardless

194
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.900
of the age of the,
of the students. So I

195
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.110
was pretty surprised that they
had really no background in

196
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.140
much of anything other than
the syntax of the language.

197
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.390
And then a couple of
theory classes on operating system

198
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.000
design and, you know, they'd
practiced mimics, but when it

199
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.390
got time to start doing
TDD and, and thinking about

200
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.660
software holistically, it was not
within their makeup. They were

201
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.320
not the, the, the whole
entire Scholastic system had failed

202
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.250
them. At least at the
state level. I, you know,

203
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.810
you can say that it
failed them. And I think

204
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.100
in, in many cases, the
Scholastic system does fail in

205
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.960
software development in particular. But
on the other hand, how

206
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.490
is a college to post
to give the requisite experience

207
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.510
to a set of students,
this experience that you need

208
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.660
to be a really good
software developer is, is not

209
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.890
something you can acquire over
a curriculum, a four year

210
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.550
curriculum, especially if you're taking
other courses at the same

211
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:43.800
time, the knowledge to become
a good software developer involves

212
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.700
holding in your hand, the
fate of a project or

213
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.720
the fate of a company,
dealing with decisions that are

214
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:57.300
going to be very consequential
to the project, to the

215
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.630
company. We usually don't get
that kind of experience working

216
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.530
in a large team, coordinating
a huge software efforts and

217
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.460
seeing the problems of deploying
a system and then watching

218
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.700
as the crashes and burns
and all the field service

219
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.800
people go crazy. And they're
coming to you and looking

220
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.170
at you like what the
hell just happened, and you've

221
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.430
got to solve it. That
kinds of things I'm usually

222
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.720
at school. So don't approach.
Hi, this is Scott coming

223
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.150
at you from another place
in time. Are you looking

224
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.970
for an object relational mapping
tool for mission critical projects

225
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.320
using lincoln.net? I wanted to
share with you genome specifically

226
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.740
designed for developing dot and
enterprise applications. Genome is a

227
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.160
mature link, integrated ORM tool.
It's been employed in numerous

228
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.190
large scale projects over the
last six years, genome was

229
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.040
created for the.net platform as
opposed to being a port

230
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.660
from Java. And it's thrived
on platform innovation since dotnet

231
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.040
1.0 genome is supported links
since its CTP release in

232
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.310
may of 2006, it offers
several unique features that just

233
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.850
encapsulation and reuse of link
queries and expressions. You can

234
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.520
really fully harness the power
of link while benefiting from

235
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.020
your database platforms. Unique features,
compose complex link queries, decompose

236
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.930
the query logic and your
domain model link supports all

237
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.020
the major database platforms you
find in enterprise environments like

238
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:22.070
SQL server, but also Oracle
and IBM DB too. And

239
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.950

genome integrates tightly with visual

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I hope you enjoy it.
Are we missing a sense

244
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.670
of, of, of stewardship, of
respect for the power that

245
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.650
software engineering kind of provides
us? Oh, certainly. I think,

246
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.830
yeah. And so the analogy
I draw very often is

247
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.100
the analogy of a doctor.
You would not take someone

248
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.110
out of medical school and
ask them to remove an

249
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.170
appendix right off the bat.
You know, they'd better watch

250
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.170
somebody do it. They'd better
a shift, someone do it.

251
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.160
They should probably do that
kind of assistance several times.

252
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.800
They should see what can
go wrong. They should see

253
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.820
the demeanor of the professional
and how you respond to

254
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.330
issues and crises. They should
see the process and the

255
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.110
way, the way the people
work in the LR and

256
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:26.260
eventual should pick up a
scale, but not right off

257
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.350
the bat. So for the
software developer, it shouldn't be

258
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.380
the same thing that you
come into a team where

259
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.310
the team is supporting a
large and significant project and

260
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.280
no way should the person
be given the module and

261
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.080
responsibility for a module that's
critical to the operation of

262
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.720
that. Every line of code
that the new person at

263
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.170
right should be looked at
by the, the more mature

264
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.620
members of the team and
guidance should be provided in

265
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.680
my world. A fair bit
of pair programming should be

266
00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.480
done step by step. You
should walk through with the

267
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.690
new people, how to build
the system and how to

268
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.480
debug it. And how's your
run, the tests where to

269
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.000
go to get this information
and who to talk to,

270
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.720
to get that information so
that they are gradually brought

271
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.130
in and give them the
expertise to actually work in

272
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.310
the team environment projects. Well,
I have two questions then

273
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.500
my first one is that
when I, when I have

274
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.190
dealt with talented young people
and I, when I say

275
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.010
young, I don't necessarily mean
age. I mean, young in

276
00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.310
the career, they might be
55 and have three years

277
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.070
into the business. So when
I deal with talented, you

278
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:40.030
know, programmers, I get into
what I call says, you

279
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.890
architecture discussions, where one who,
one who believes that they

280
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.710
know myself or someone who's
a fairly senior guy says

281
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.980
something. And the other guy's
like Knapp. You, you know,

282
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.010
I don't think so. It
seems like the discussion between

283
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.440
you and Joel and Jeff,
all people who have been

284
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.310
doing this for a non
trivial amount of time, he

285
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.910
kind of fell into a
ass as you kind of

286
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.930
a situation. Well, with more
concrete things like medicine and,

287
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.860
and electricity and being electrician,
it seems like there's a

288
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.100
little bit less of that.
Are we just being elitist

289
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.370
old dudes? Well, I certainly
Just trying to hold the,

290
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.040
hold the kids down, you
know, There's something to be

291
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.210
said for the youngsters going
off and burning themselves in,

292
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.510
in less critical environments. But
I don't think, you know,

293
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.850
I don't think we're just
elitist old, do try to

294
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.760
hold the kids. Well, I
mean, I worked at a

295
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.850
company and a young man
wanted to know why he

296
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.010
wasn't a senior developer. And
I asked him how long

297
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:44.360
he'd worked here. He'd worked
there three years, you know,

298
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.540
and that's, and that's a
very common, very common story.

299
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.550
Hey, if you, I mean,
think about it in software

300
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.030
engineering, because of the speed
of the, the iteration of

301
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.490
the technology. If you've got
five years in any technology,

302
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.550
you're probably very good, or
you've at least been slapping

303
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.180
the keyboard for awhile. People
don't have the patience to

304
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.720
wait through an apprenticeship. Somebody
told me once, and it

305
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.590
was a very long time
ago that the, the, the

306
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.060
break point for being experienced
where you can use the

307
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:19.490
word experience with authority is
five years. I think that's

308
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.680
probably true. If you would
have been in a, an,

309
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.520
an industrial or a professional
environment for five years, you

310
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.570
can then say that your
experience prior to that, not

311
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.110
really very experienced. You may
have had some experiences, a

312
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.590
bunch. You probably haven't faced
enough issues to really be

313
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:41.300
all with something effectively on
your own East. Certain people

314
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.430
get through it faster than
that. And certain people never

315
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.950
get through it. But I
think that's probably a good

316
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:51.290
average. Our industry does a
disservice to people because there's

317
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:56.900
no, no consistent dual ladder.
In a lot of cases,

318
00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.950
you, the career path is
a couple of years slinging

319
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.380
code, couple of years, leading
a team. And after that,

320
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.800
I'm a manager. And once
you're a manager, you never

321
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.010
ride it again. I think
this is general, and I

322
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.730
think it's the wrong approach
for our industry altogether. But

323
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.960
if you are, if you
are really serious about your

324
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:24.590
profession, you're going to be
standing for 34 years. Doctors,

325
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.750
surgeons, state, surgeons, lawyers, they
lawyers, some of them go

326
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.940
out into a management track
for most of them keep

327
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.560
their craft, but we burn
out. I haven't, I mean,

328
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.510
I don't know about you,
but I mean, this is

329
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:42.950
a year 17 for me,
my hands hurt. Yeah. You

330
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.020
can carpool phone. Well, I
mean, I don't know if

331
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.250
it's carpal tunnel, but I'm
just saying that that surgeons

332
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.010
have the same problem. It's
just slap on the keyboard

333
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:55.750
for 20 years is painful.
And there's also the, there's

334
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.540
a certain amount of kind
of self objectivity. One has

335
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.020
to develop otherwise they can,
they can become the old

336
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.510
dude with the beard who
thinks that everything needs to

337
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.040
be done the way it
was done in the seventies.

338
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.930
Well, maybe there is a
new technique or some new

339
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.680
revolution that's happening. That I'm
just not seeing because of

340
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.780
I'm letting my years of
experience blind me. Yeah. Well

341
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.240
then that's clearly an issue.
And then certainly that does

342
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.570
happen. Of course, a professional
does it too. It's a

343
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.260
very interesting point. You're pulling
out the word professional and

344
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.990
kind of capitalizing it verbally,
that, that the difference between

345
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.690
software professional and maybe just
a, a code Slinger might

346
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.020
be what we're talking about
here. Well, sure. You know,

347
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.320
someone who is dedicated to
his craft is going to

348
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.140
stay up with all the
latest technology to the best

349
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.310
of his ability. So, you
know, guys, my age are

350
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:51.360
still learning Ruby and still
learning Scala and F sharp

351
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.670
and all this stuff that's
coming out. Now, I'm trying

352
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.950
to try and get their
arms around all this new

353
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.850
technology, because it's important. You
have to stay with it.

354
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.240
And, you know, you can
imagine the doctor doctors better

355
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.580
be keeping up with the
latest technology. They better be

356
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.280
learning the newest techniques. Otherwise
their patients are going to

357
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.190
go somewhere else. Well, and
ultimately they have to care.

358
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.170
And I think that's the
number one thing when I,

359
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.750
when I want to pick
who I'm going to work

360
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.960
with, I want someone to
care. And that's the difference

361
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.080
between a craftsman and, and
someone who's just not, I

362
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.600
mean, I think the same
thing applies with, with, with

363
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.950
woodworking. You know, if someone
just wakes up excited about

364
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.050
what they're going to do
that day, what, what project

365
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.820
they're working on. I think
they're more likely to be

366
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.800
a craftsman than, than not
Well, and that's certainly in

367
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.590
my case, right. I I've
been writing code for over,

368
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.810
I don't know, 40 years,
but I wake up in

369
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.310
the morning and think, okay,
I got to get this

370
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.850
feature into fitness now. And
then just, you know, dying

371
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.890
to get my hands on
the keyboard so that I

372
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.150
can add more functionality and
more code and see that,

373
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.090
see that system grow into
something better than a BS

374
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.390
on it. Okay. Well, so
let's take what we've talked

375
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.430
about and try to apply
it back to the situation

376
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.820
with, with Joel and with
Jeff. I mean, Joel has

377
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.210
a successful and, and, you
know, non trivially, large company.

378
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.090
So he has, he could
definitely point at him and

379
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.130
say, there is a person
who has built a successful

380
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.640
software company. We may not
agree with some of the

381
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:21.060
decisions he's made. Technically Jeff
appears to be in the

382
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.300
direction of a successful software
startup he's put together something

383
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.950
that is definitely a game
changer of some kind again,

384
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.890
in both cases, we don't
know what, what techniques and

385
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.110
what code Joel used nor
do we really know what,

386
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.490
what Jeff used, but if,
if they issue some of

387
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.180
the principles that, that you're
kind of espousing, but they

388
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:47.230
have measured business success who
we to criticize. Oh, I

389
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.660
mean, I wouldn't criticize them
at all. As long as

390
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.550
they're maintaining that, that success,
I was concerned by Jeff's

391
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.940
statement. The quality doesn't really
matter all that much. I'm

392
00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.120
still actually concerned about that
one. I'm not quite sure

393
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.030
I can get my arms
around what is justification for

394
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.730
it, but I honestly don't
think he believes it that

395
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.600
way. And I hate cause
because he's developing a system

396
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.570
that seems to be very
high quality. I've looked around

397
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.900
stack overflow. It's pretty cool.
Well maybe that's just talk,

398
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.900
show banter between, you know,
two guys that like kind

399
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.980
of shooting the shooting, the
poop. Yeah. Well I think

400
00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.580
that isn't, they certainly do
the stack overflow podcast that

401
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.670
way. And it's two guys
in a bar just sitting

402
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.120
and you happen to have
a camera on them. And

403
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.220
then they don't even know
a microphone. There's a risk

404
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.330
in there because foreign banter
can get a little, a

405
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:45.190
little far field, which happens
in those. Well, certainly, I

406
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.690
mean, making, making a small
kind of political parallel, almost

407
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.930
all of the political talk
shows get into trouble when

408
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.300
it goes from being analytical
to being just kind of,

409
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.060
let's just chat and in
the banter kind of builds

410
00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.350
up and it builds up
and builds up and then

411
00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.450
somebody says something stupid and
then they apologize for it

412
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:06.250
the next day. Yeah. Although,
you know, soon those cusps

413
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.420
interesting things happen, so we
wouldn't be doing this. Right.

414
00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.140
Yeah. That is true. Although
my favorite, my favorite Quintin

415
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.890
Tarantino quote, is that he,
who is most likely to

416
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.200
make declarative statements is most
likely to be called a

417
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:26.320
fool in retrospect. Yeah. Well,
So I don't know a

418
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.510
one doesn't want to necessarily
equivocate too much, but at

419
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.530
the same time it seems
like the solid principles. Well,

420
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.270
not right for every single
moment of my life seem

421
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.710
to be a fairly straight
forward kind of thing. I

422
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.990
might want to laminate and
put on the wall along

423
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.480
with a series of, of
other principles that I've learned

424
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.650
over the years. Did you
see that motivational posters? Well,

425
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.710
but at the same time,
Jeff made a kind of

426
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.750
a, I think it was
kind of a link bait

427
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.010
inflammatory post about Frankie programmers,
making a reference to that,

428
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.640
making reference to the fringes
of star Trek, who used

429
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.100
to have hundreds and hundreds
of rules that would guide

430
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.730
their behavior. And I'm not
quite sure how he took

431
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.340
the five rules of solid
and a couple of sub

432
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.610
rules and turned it into
the 285 rules of acquisition.

433
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.000
I thought that was kind
of a yelling fire in

434
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.540
a crowded theater. Yes. It
was an interesting post. I

435
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.870
read that one in particular
and he, he made the

436
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.700
point to be a painter.
You don't read the rules

437
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.800
on the paint cans or
bottles on the paint cans.

438
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.110
They don't teach you how
to be a good painter.

439
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.410
It's true. Right. I mean,
the rules on the paint

440
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.320
can, don't give you any
calories. On the other hand,

441
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.270
I think all good painters,
know the rules on the

442
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.460
painting. Exactly. I mean, my,
my mother Was a house

443
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.770
painter and the very first
time I helped to paint

444
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.840
a house. We read the
rules in the bank candidate.

445
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.420
It doesn't actually mean you
need to obsess about them

446
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.850
for 40 years, but it
does mean that you need

447
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.330
to know them day one,
step one, read the rules

448
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.730
in the pancreas. So did
you see the, I don't

449
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.030
know if this happened because
of the podcast, but someone

450
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:10.430
has done motivational posters for
the principal. Oh yeah. They're

451
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.370
pretty good. All the solid
principles are there and they're

452
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.310
in the form of, you
know, those funny pictures hanging

453
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:21.500
on the wall. It's people
climbing rocks and motivate people

454
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.960
to do a good job
Up here. It is Derek

455
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.140
Bailey at Lowe's techies, and
let's take this.com nice solid

456
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.970
software development, kind of Jenga
game with some failed Jenga

457
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.290
here. Wow. The single responsibility,
picture a principal with a

458
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.410
pretty intense looking Swiss army
knife that is wider than

459
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:46.760
it is long. Then there's
the open closed principal with

460
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.140
open chest surgery is not
needed when putting on a

461
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.280
coat. These are, these are
really good. I need to

462
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.610
make t-shirts of these. Would
you sold, would you solder

463
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.040
a lamp directly to the
electrical wiring and the wall

464
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.600
dependency? Inversion principle. That is
absolute brilliance. I'm going to

465
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.390
link to that from the,
from the, from the show

466
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:12.170
side. Absolutely. Yeah. I thought
this was pretty good stuff.

467
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:18.650
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. He's
going to, he says he's

468
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.410
going to do high res
versions. I think that, that

469
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.640
it would be a crime
if he did not. You

470
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.770
should put these in your
next book or, or make,

471
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:31.220
make licensed some, what are
they called? Postcards. Oh yes.

472
00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.570
Yes. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Oh,
wow. Well maybe it was

473
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.750
this just a Tempest in
a tea cup then I

474
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.320
think so. Yeah. And I
doubt it would have really

475
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.140
gotten to the level that
it did if Joel had

476
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.240
some guy who hasn't written
a lot of code, that

477
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.870
one pushed my button. Yeah.
All right. Well, I feel

478
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.570
like we've pushed them a
little bit today then. Oh

479
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.940
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I
bet the whole episode, I

480
00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:04.430
think turned out very well.
I'm pleased that Joel and

481
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.440
Jeff and I were able
to, I have a very

482
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:11.450
respectful and fun conversation. Well
turning dramatically in a different

483
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.040
direction. You said there's something
about deployment you wanted to

484
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.130
talk about. Well, one of
the issues that came up

485
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:20.510
in in fact overflow 41,
Joel was asking me now,

486
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.190
why would you do the
single responsibility principle? What's so

487
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.800
great about that. And I,
I said to him, well,

488
00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:34.370
you don't want to have
modules, which are attractors for

489
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:38.420
many dependencies. So single responsibility
principle says that a module

490
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.560
should change for only one
reason. You put your, you

491
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.780
push out of it, things
to change for different reasons.

492
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.910
You gathered into it, those
things to change for the

493
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.970
same reason, because why would
you want to do that

494
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.490
as well? If you don't
do that, you have all

495
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:57.130
of these dependencies impinging upon
this one module. And if

496
00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.520
you change that module, many
other modules have to change.

497
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.380
And he asked me this
question, what do you mean

498
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.810
change, change at runtime time?
And I said, no, change

499
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.990
it file sizes. If the
source code changes, if the

500
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:13.000
features change, then if, if
you have a module that

501
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.870
attracts many different dependencies and
many different kinds of feature

502
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:21.070
change will force you to
modify that module. And that's

503
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.250
a problem because that module
thrash or have to get

504
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.420
rebuilt all the time, you
will have to read it

505
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.810
all of them. And he
said, well, what's the matter

506
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.870
with that? And I said,
well, if you read employing

507
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.820
it all the time, that
means you've got to rerelease

508
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.100
it really test it. And
if it's in its own

509
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.410
separate jar file and needs,
you've got to redeploy the

510
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.750
jar file. I probably should've
sent the ELL in his

511
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:46.450
case. And he said, well,
when I ship a project,

512
00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.450
I just bundled all the,
all the stuff together and

513
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.310
ship it as one big
package. I said, well, yeah,

514
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:56.470
that's true. In many cases,
we will do that. In

515
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.300
fact, I do that with
fitness. I just take the

516
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.580
whole thing and put it
together as one package. But

517
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.650
that doesn't mean I don't
want to be able to

518
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:08.380
independently deploy the individual pieces
while I'm developing it. So

519
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.560
for example, if I had
a team of, or, or

520
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.060
an organization of say five
teams, I would like those

521
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.610
teams to be able to
work independently of each other.

522
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.240
So I would like them
to, to have the dependencies

523
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.690
between them, the dependencies between
the modules that they work

524
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.680
on, very tightly controlled so
that each team can deploy

525
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.400
its own stuff very independently
of everybody else. And then

526
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.190
incidentally, at the end, I
can package the whole thing

527
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.240
up and ship it. But
the whole development environment has

528
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.750
been made much, much easier
because these guys can independently

529
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:49.990
deploy their own. COVID even,
even when we can bundle

530
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.690
it all together into a
single unit and deploy it

531
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:58.360
it's much nicer. If we
can deploy the individual fits

532
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.230
within our environment, instead of
having to rebuild the whole

533
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.110
thing and recompile the whole
that's the whole thing. Every

534
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:09.490
single time, it also provides
for a good plugin structure.

535
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.150
So you can create a
base module with a whole

536
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.690
bunch of plugins and those
plugins can be independently deployed

537
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.720
from the base structure. So
we're seeing a lot of

538
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:26.650
these kinds of plug in
applications now that, that enjoy

539
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:32.370
this kind of single responsibility
principle. Well, and then when

540
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.410
that gets larger, when, when,
when it does all of

541
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.020
the things that you described,
you're looking at using all

542
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:43.040
of the principles in tandem.
Yeah, Yeah, yeah. Well, if

543
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.620
you're following those principles, what
you're really doing is you're

544
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.460
managing dependencies. All, all of
those principles are about the

545
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.220
management of dependencies. And did,
did y'all find this controversial

546
00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.650
or did this explain, did
this help answer his question?

547
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.680
No, no. It kind of
just rolled off, rolled off

548
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.300
his back and went on
to the next point right

549
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.340
away. And I, I wanted
to bring it up here

550
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.990
because I thought it really
hadn't been completed. Hmm. Okay.

551
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.530
Interesting. Someone on Twitter earlier,
I mentioned, we were doing

552
00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.430
this show and this is,
I've heard this from a

553
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:19.390
loud majority loud minority, but
if we spent as much

554
00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.540
time discussing these principles, as
we did coding dot, dot,

555
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:29.020
dot that that folks are
John too much about these,

556
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.300
these principles when they need
to be, as I said

557
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.210
before, slapping the keyboard. That
makes me feel like the

558
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.840
stuff we were talking about
at the beginning where, and

559
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.300
actually Jeff is the expert
about this. Jeff, Jeff Atwood

560
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.040
actually has asked the question.
Is it more fun to

561
00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.770
talk about software than it
is to write software? No,

562
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.840
not for me anyway. Not
for you. I better get

563
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.890
you out of bed to
let you let you get

564
00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:55.990
back to writing software then.
All right. Well, uncle Bob

565
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.730
Martin, thanks so much for
taking the time to sit

566
00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.530
down and chat with us
here again on Hansel minutes.

567
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:03.070
Oh my pleasure. And you
can follow up Bob on

568
00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.470
Twitter and I think your
Twitter name is uncle Bob

569
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.710
Martin. Is that correct? That
is correct. All right. This

570
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.290
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

571
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.100
you again next week.
