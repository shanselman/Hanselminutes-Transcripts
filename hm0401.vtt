10
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.530
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

11
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.010
Hansel minutes. And I'm talking
with Shanelle Henry. She's a

12
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.310
founder. Co-founder at Pavo and
the director of UX at

13
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.360
blue Wolf. How's it going?
It's going. All right. So

14
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.780
you just came back from
San Francisco. You're now in

15
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.350
Philadelphia. That's correct. You can
find yourself traveling a lot

16
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.460
for, for consultancies, don't you?
Yeah, I never thought it

17
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.700
would be this much, but
it's definitely, really awesome. Yeah.

18
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.680
Was this the first time
you'd ever been there and

19
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.670
met that team? No, this
was actually my third time

20
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.980
there. I believe there was
a couple of other times

21
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.270
I was in Southern California,
like around Newport beach and

22
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.580
then most of the times
I'm up in New York. What's

23
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.530
that like that first time
when you, you, you kind

24
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.270
of get off the plane
and you like either you're

25
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.310
met there or you come
into the boardroom for the

26
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.890
first time and you're like,
Hey, I'm Chanel and the

27
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.250
consultant, you know, like the
guy and I'm in pulp

28
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.020
fiction, like, you know, he
comes in in the, in

29
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.330
the, in the tuxedo and
he's the Wolf I'm here

30
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
to help you just start
telling people what to do.

31
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.660
Yeah. I mean, you know,
this time around, it wasn't

32
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.890
that bad because it's my
team. So they know that,

33
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.060
you know, they know me,
but I believe like the

34
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.240
first time when it happened,
I was on this, this

35
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.870
campus out in Southern California.
And I think they were

36
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.110
shocked that I was the
person that, you know, was

37
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.890
heading the whole, you know,
user experience, information, architecture, realm.

38
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.380
I think they were expecting
someone else that kind of

39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.870
looked like the rest of
my team. Why would they

40
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.010
be shocked? Well, I think
one, because there's not a

41
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.450
lot of women in tech
or women in that particular

42
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.240
space, what I've noticed is
that there was a lot

43
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.220
of women that are designers
or yeah, mostly like designers,

44
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.930
like, cause I usually work
with a lot of them,

45
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.480
but when it comes to
like the more technical positions

46
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.990
such as like UX or
even, you know, developers or

47
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.770
information architecture, I think it's
always like an initial shock.

48
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.950
And then the fact to
being a black woman too,

49
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.160
I believe, I guess that
had another type of interesting

50
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.400
response as well. So, but
it's always fun. Do you

51
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.490
think that those things stand
out more than like choices

52
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.590
that one makes about how
they choose to dress or

53
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.530
what glasses they wear or
piercings or any other things

54
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.720
that might make someone look
different? Yeah. And that probably

55
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.080
could have been it too.
So I'm not your typical

56
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.610
corporate, you know, worker. I
do have a septum piercing

57
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.800
and then I have some
tattoos and then some days

58
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.830
I dress like a hipster.
So, you know, walking in,

59
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.620
it's like, Oh, it's okay.
She come to Portland and

60
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.180
would be like, you'd be
the CEO. Exactly. I think

61
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.150
they're just always really shocked
that like, cause you don't

62
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.040
know what to expect. You
don't know what it is

63
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.570
that I know or what
I'm going to say next.

64
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.090
So I think that was
it's ad to me it's

65
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.460
fun, you know, because like
when you first walk in,

66
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.380
they're just like, Oh, what
did, what did, what is

67
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.620
she doing? Like, is she
like admin or is she

68
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.770
just the intern? It's like,
Oh, she's actually like a

69
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.640
director. Okay. What is she
doing? Oh, she's designing everything.

70
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.960
Cool. So, you know, it's,
it's definitely a fun time

71
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.750
though. Is it, but is
that the goal though? I

72
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.460
mean, you're not certainly you
just dressing, like you want

73
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.890
to dress, you're just being
you. Right. Do you think

74
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.920
people would try to do
there? There are those that

75
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.730
dress to shock. Yeah, definitely.
Definitely. I'm not one of

76
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.360
those. I mean, of course
I would love to, to

77
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.300
push it every so often,
but I'm, I'm the type

78
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.520
of person where I'm just
so focused in my work

79
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.950
and that might, it's a
very, I'm very much a

80
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.330
nerd. So anything I do
is usually not intentional, but

81
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.310
you know, just coming through
with my thick glasses and

82
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.250
the, and then my, my
dreadlocks as well as also

83
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.340
like, Whoa, we have a
hippie on board. So it's

84
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.150
like, you never know. I
dunno. How much do you

85
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.580
think the tech is a
meritocracy? Cause I think that

86
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.400
as a, as a regular
kind of random straight white

87
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.040
guy, I think to myself,
well, I mean, if the,

88
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.430
if the work is awesome,
then problem solved. Right. And

89
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.890
I've worked with a lot
of people, particularly like we're

90
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.140
talking about appearance right there
initially, but I've worked with

91
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.070
people I've never met. Probably
never will meet. No, that's

92
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.000
true. I believe that like,
I think it's only because

93
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.990
of the whole tech, the
tech thing. I did work

94
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.300
with an email address. Once
we worked together for a

95
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.370
year, right. Turned out there
was a 17 year old

96
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.120
kid in India with a
satellite hookup. And he was

97
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.010
the only, like he was
the only technical person in

98
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.950
his village. And he has
since turned his village into

99
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.980
like a UX Mecca. Wow.
But I had no idea.

100
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.390
All I know is that
I would send, I would

101
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.600
pay her PayPal, him money
and Photoshop files would appear

102
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.230
in my inbox. Okay. So
you know what I mean?

103
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.290
Yeah. No. And I think
it's different when, when I

104
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.770
was in India, like working
independently as a freelancer, a

105
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.110
lot of the times I
could tell that it wasn't,

106
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.420
it was really just about
the work. It was about

107
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.910
the output. It wasn't about,
you know, like what I,

108
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.030
what I look like or
there wasn't a lot of,

109
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.150
I guess, expectations there. But
when I guess the switch

110
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.250
corporate, because to be honest,
like I haven't worked in

111
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.950
this type of environment ever
in my life. Like if

112
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.140
I did, it was always
for about a couple of

113
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.630
weeks or so like, but
never, I think I've been

114
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.140
with blue for about eight
months now. And that's a

115
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.420
long time for me just
because I usually like, you

116
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.390
know, switching it up and
all that. But I feel

117
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.150
because it is so front-facing,
I have to go in

118
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.760
the office sometimes I have
to, you know, obviously face

119
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.000
clients and, you know, because
of the fact that no

120
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.280
one else, I don't look
like a lot of the

121
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.890
people on my team. I
think that's the only time

122
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.350
where I noticed certain expectations,
but it's still never as

123
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.660
big. I think as a
lot of people would make

124
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.380
it to be. I think
also that there's a difference

125
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.670
between like under, under 30
year old kind of startup

126
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.570
culture and which, which is
kind of a general bucket,

127
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.660
then you've got like Bay
area startup culture, which is

128
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.560
another whole thing. Right. And
then like corporate America, like,

129
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.260
you know, you, you're kind
of by coastal, right? So

130
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.920
you've probably been in like,
you know, corporate jobs in

131
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.720
the East coast and you
know, that they're very different

132
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.340
than corporate jobs in the
West coast. Like I was

133
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.990
at a big meeting in
New York recently and it was

134
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.400
just like suits and suits
and suits. And I've, I

135
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.820
can't remember last time I
saw a suit on the

136
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.510
West coast. No, that's true.
I mean, I even, I

137
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.630
was out there during Dreamforce
and Dreamforce is like one

138
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.170
of the biggest conferences that
Salesforce holds in San Francisco.

139
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.840
And I think those were
the most amount of suits

140
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.840
I've seen ever like in
San Francisco at one given

141
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.130
time, there's just this culture
around, I believe the world

142
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.900
about the East coast and
specifically New York and yeah, just

143
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.270
New York, a little bit of
Philly. Like a little bit

144
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.850
of residue goes down there
too, but we are just

145
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.800
like a very like cutthroat
down the business. Oh. You

146
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.530
know, always rushing, always being
looked at as like, why

147
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.210
are they rushing so much
and why are they so

148
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.040
serious? So it it's funny
because it is so different.

149
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.360
But at the same time,
New York and California are, I

150
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.970
guess like the two, even
in business, you don't know

151
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.680
what you're going to expect
in terms of what the

152
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.140
person, you know, is going
to look like. And it

153
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.780
just varies so much as
opposed to I was working

154
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.230
corporate, you know, in North Carolina
for a project once. And

155
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.570
it was very, as much
as I would have expected

156
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.630
it to be like suits,
everything stops at this time

157
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.080
after work drinks, everything must
go like segmented, you know?

158
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.440
Like it was very, yeah,
very structured Work drink. See

159
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.990
what I think of after
work drinks? I think about

160
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.440
the legends and the stories
of like Japanese salary workers

161
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.650
or salary mans, they call
them where that's part of

162
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.340
work. Like having drinks with
your boss is also like

163
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.890
a shift it's required. You
can't be like, no, I'm

164
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.900
going to go hang out
with my kids. No you're

165
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.170
having drinks. And that's how
I felt like I was

166
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.270
away on the project. And
we had, it was like

167
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.900
mandatory dinners with your team
and mandatory drinks. I'm like

168
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.080
how that team building Men,
you will have dinner. You

169
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.660
will bowl with us. We
are bowling and you will

170
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.340
bowl. Exactly. It was like,
it was weird to me,

171
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.770
but I weaseled my way
out of it a lot

172
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.980
because I had to do
work like, so this is

173
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.640
though, yeah, it was, it
was crazy. One of the

174
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.580
things that, that I impressed
with some of the stuff

175
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.500
that I've seen in your
portfolio, and then you also

176
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.550
work on this project called
Pavo. Your, your startup is

177
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.330
this theme of inclusion. You
seem to have a theme

178
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.190
of inclusion like you, you
of course want to be

179
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.560
included, but you want other
people to be included. And

180
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.240
I've had a couple people
on the show we've talked

181
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.490
about women's issues and color
and things like that. But

182
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.730
there's other more subtle issues
when people are either being

183
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.080
included or excluded, right? Like,
I mean, there's, there's, there's

184
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.350
gender issues and their sexuality
issues. And there's just, Hey,

185
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.450
this is a per, like,
I know a guy who

186
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.390
paints his nails, black he's
he's generally, he's pretty much

187
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.720
a regular white guy, but
he pays his nails black.

188
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.190
I don't know why You
never asked her Because I

189
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.450
don't want to be the
guy that asks why you

190
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.190
paint your nails. I got
to get to that point.

191
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.080
You know what I mean?
But the point I'm making

192
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.110
is that, are we at
an edit? Is this a

193
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.420
Renaissance for inclusion? Are we
getting to a point now

194
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.090
where we're getting past some
of the, the bullying and

195
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.770
the hate, or are we
just the same way it's

196
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.740
been all the time? You
know, that's a question that

197
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.750
I get asked and I
feel like I talk about

198
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.170
like on a, on a
pretty regular basis. I don't

199
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:26.060
know if I'm the type
of person that I don't

200
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.860
want to say is blind
to a lot of what's

201
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.110
going on because I know
that that's not it. I

202
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.100
grew up in a predominantly
Jewish neighborhood and a Jewish

203
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.670
school. So, you know, coming
out of, of course there's

204
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.700
a lot of issues that
arose from that. Some good,

205
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.860
some bad, of course, like,
you know, I've, I've had

206
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.370
such a respect for different
cultures because I was a,

207
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.680
you know, vice president of
the multicultural society in high

208
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.200
school. So it's like one
of these things where I'm

209
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.390
always noticing what could be
in terms of trying to

210
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:02.630
understand more about like race
issues or, you know, even

211
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.310
gender issues, which are starting
to also take, take a

212
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.880
place in a lot of
conversations. What, what I, with

213
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.050
the rise of a media,
I guess more people are

214
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.530
talking about it, more people
are sharing and it's becoming

215
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.380
more prevalent in technology. The
technology, which I think is

216
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.760
the thing that I'm focusing
most on. Right? So Paavo,

217
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.510
that was actually born out
of a need to have

218
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.510
something that already was existing,
but just not for a

219
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:38.570
specific like cohort of people.
So it's a fashion discovery

220
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.420
app, but a lot of
fashion discovery apps that are

221
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.640
out there now in which
you can also purchase the

222
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.590
things. And this is, you
know, somewhere that we're trying

223
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.560
to go, like e-commerce through
the application. A lot of

224
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.410
them were geared more towards
Asian and white women from

225
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.470
the ages too. Like for
the ages of like 18

226
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.010
to 34 and who, where
it's like even gets more

227
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.480
specific who were mostly like
into chic in boutique, where

228
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.720
now looking at me, I
don't fit. I remember trying

229
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.380
to pop in a photo
of myself and like androgynous

230
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.530
wear with my lax and,
and all that. And of

231
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.450
course, no lights have been,
and it looked like a

232
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.900
sore thumb standing out amongst
all of the, the Asian

233
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.850
community was this, this was,
It's just like, are you

234
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.920
hot or not kind of,
It wasn't a hot or

235
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.590
not. I think it was
posed the app pose. No,

236
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.120
I don't know about this.
I mean, I'm into fashion,

237
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.250
but I'm not that into
it apparently. Yeah. Yeah. There

238
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.130
is like over 20 different
apps and they all were

239
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.340
good. Like they are all
for the chic boutique white

240
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.950
woman or white or Asian
woman. And, and that's all

241
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.830
I would see. So the
reason why we made Paavo

242
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.530
was because, Hey, what about
the men? There's a lot

243
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.290
of studies that show that
men are actually the top

244
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.120
purchasers of things. Whether, you
know, it's clothes, food, whatever

245
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.290
off their mobile device, you
know? So, So to put

246
00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.490
this into context for some
of the people who are

247
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.420
listening and wondering why we
went there, there's, there's lookbooks

248
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.480
and there's outfit of the
day. And these are all

249
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.100
like, you know, like, you
know how there are people

250
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.290
on Instagram that take pictures
of their food and their

251
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.970
foodies and you go through
their Instagram and it's just,

252
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.370
Hey, there's my food for
the last year. Yeah. People

253
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.770
do these outfits of the
day and fashion blogging is

254
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.130
huge, huge, and an easy
way to take a picture

255
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.610
and share your personal style
is, is, is, is a

256
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.690
big industry. Right? Exactly. Yeah.
And, and those were the

257
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.530
trends that we were noticing
seeing on Instagram. So it's

258
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.740
like, I don't know, based
off of what we saw

259
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.110
there and just kind of
based off of like all

260
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.450
the other apps and all
the other trends that are

261
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.670
happening, I feel like T
to, you know, come back

262
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.970
to your question. I feel
like the answer is like,

263
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.730
we were becoming more conscious
of everything that we do.

264
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.030
I don't know if it's
getting better or I dunno

265
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.040
if it's getting worse either.
I just know that it's

266
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.370
just becoming more, more of
like a conscious effort every

267
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.060
day. Yeah. Yeah. When I'm,
when I'm Marina, I'm raising

268
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.330
my, my, my little boys
are six and eight and

269
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.150
anytime already at this age.
Right. You know, you can

270
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.390
assume that they're not, they're
not racist presumably, and they're

271
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.210
not, but they are accepting
whatever they're learning and they're

272
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.440
absorbing everything that they see.
And they see when they

273
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.490
see someone who's different, they
know right away. And for

274
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.710
the, when they were younger,
it was mostly like wheelchairs,

275
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.710
you know, missing limbs. That's
what the little kid like,

276
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.340
Hey, that person is different.
Now they'll notice things like,

277
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.220
Oh yeah, those are bright.
Look, personnel, bright red pants.

278
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.170
That's the only person here
with red pants and my

279
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.970
wife. And I always think
to ourselves like, okay, well,

280
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.460
this is where it's beginning,
right? This is where you

281
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.520
either grow up. You either
raise a child, that's going

282
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.890
to be tolerant and you
go, wow, isn't that, isn't

283
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.800
that cool. Do you want
to wear red pants? Isn't

284
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.230
that kind of weird? Or
you see like a little

285
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.130
boy in like a ballerina
dress or a little girl

286
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.010
who's just like a football
player or whatever. Right. You

287
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.610
know, we, we do our
best to kind of, to

288
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.750
do that. I, I questioned
though that that's not probably

289
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.850
not happening anywhere else. Like
I don't, you know, for

290
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.190
every one of me and
my wife, they're just trying

291
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.780
to try to be inclusive.
It's not major. This is

292
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.120
just little stuff like, Hey,
isn't that cool? Isn't it

293
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.910
neat that people are different.
Right. I'm assuming that there's

294
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.100
like a thousand people that
just don't sweat it. And

295
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.200
that means that if the
nail sticks out, people are

296
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.950
going to hammer the nail
down. Right. Yeah. I'm just

297
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.080
wondering, do you, do you,
do you think that, that

298
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.030
we're moving in a direction
where people are going to

299
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.850
be more inclusive and more
tolerant of being different? Because

300
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.230
it seems to me like
it's bigger than race and

301
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.750
gender and gender identity. It's
about confirming. Right? Exactly. I

302
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.350
think it's a, I think
we have no choice. It's

303
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:47.530
like, because, because of so
many signs telling us to

304
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.600
be different, I mean, I
remember being in kindergarten and

305
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.520
that was like the main
message, right? It's like be

306
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.310
different, be different, be different.
But then by the time

307
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.550
we got to first grade,
it was like, no, no,

308
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.370
no, just kidding. Just kidding.
Don't be different. Like just

309
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.770
fit, just fit in. And,
and that's kinda, you know,

310
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.990
where we were trying to
do for the rest of

311
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.050
like our school years. But
I think it's taking a

312
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:10.840
different turn now. Like the
more different you are then

313
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.810
almost like you get kind
of rewarded for that in

314
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.910
some way. You know? Like,
and I, I feel that

315
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.150
that's showing up a lot
in technology, even because you

316
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.700
know, people with like the
most YouTube hits, like based

317
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.300
off of their differences or,
you know, certain people that

318
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.440
stand apart. And then they,
they, I don't know, like

319
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.110
create a stand from that
or show other people like,

320
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.210
Hey, this is why I'm
different. And you should be

321
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.050
different too, when we're all
different and Different than it's

322
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.960
kind of ridiculous. Like as
someone who's not that different.

323
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.280
I got to say, when
everybody looks, looks crazy, you

324
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.950
know, and again, I live
in Portland, right. So people

325
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.560
are always punching holes and
stuff. That's not supposed to

326
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.080
have holes in it, whether
it be their pants or

327
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:59.320
their face, you know, You
know what I'm saying? Yeah.

328
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.730
And like, I'm thinking to
myself, I'm trying to be

329
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.950
open minded, but like, if
someone's got one of those

330
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.580
things in your ears, they're
like plugs. No, but like

331
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.350
yours are normal size. I'm
talking about the one. Yeah.

332
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.650
So you're the ones that
are like, yeah. What is

333
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:18.940
that going to look like
when somebody's like 70? Is

334
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.160
that a very conventional attitude
for me to have like,

335
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.930
gosh, I mean, I want
you to be different, but

336
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.920
you're hurting yourself, not you,
but I'm just saying one.

337
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.020
No. And, and it's funny
that you say that I

338
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.020
remember being on Instagram and
seeing a photo of like

339
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.110
an 80 or 60 or
80 year old man. And

340
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.900
he had like a sleeve
tattoo and they were like,

341
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.780
we're going to be the
craziest, like tattooed pierced, like

342
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.080
older generation ever. And I
just started cracking up cause

343
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.000
I'm working on half a
sleeve now and one of

344
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.220
my arms and you know
that I have these piercings

345
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.210
in my face and like,
Oh man, like, this is

346
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.060
kind of crazy. Like how
much is too much. Right.

347
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.460
But see, the thing is
when everyone has tribal tattoos

348
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.280
just leave and plugs in
their ears and a septum

349
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.040
piercing then does that just
become standard. And then we

350
00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.640
have to do something crazier.
Yeah. That's and that's the

351
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.330
thing too much, if everyone's
different than everyone's the same.

352
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.070
And then it becomes one
of those like philosophical questions

353
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.370
that you hear about in
college, right? Like, like what,

354
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:25.250
at that point, what, what
really sets you apart? I

355
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.350
think, you know, I hear
what you're saying. I think

356
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.460
that the, from the perspective
of a fairly conventional individual

357
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.340
was, is my perspective. I
just want people to feel

358
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.500
included and I want people
to feel okay. And this

359
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.640
is actually where raising kids
like change that. Like, I

360
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.390
don't really care before I
had kids. You know what

361
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.140
I mean? Like I cared,
but I didn't like deeply

362
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.290
care, but I want my
kids to feel included. Right.

363
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.570
So I don't know, one
of them is going to

364
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.430
paint their nails black or
do something crazy I'm going

365
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.950
to, but I'm going to,
I want to be unapologetically

366
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.100
inclusive. Like I'd rather not
do anything destructive physically, but

367
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.880
Yeah. And I feel it's
like, I almost had to

368
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.700
be that way to myself
growing up because of course,

369
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.230
you know, images, everything. Right.
And the more that apparently

370
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.560
the older you get the
better you're supposed to feel

371
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.090
about that and how false
it is, and then become

372
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.880
like one with yourself. Like
I think, and this is

373
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.980
something that I guess, like,
I've been trying to figure

374
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.710
out, like in like the
past couple of years where

375
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.650
it's like, how can I
bypass all of like the

376
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.120
craziness of being okay with
yourself and just be okay

377
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.880
with myself so that I
can be my best self.

378
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.460
Right. That Oprah speaks about
all the time. So it's

379
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.080
like, I think it's one
of those things where we're

380
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.220
starting to, to, I don't
know, I guess, except the

381
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.730
idea of our skills and
talents rather than our outside

382
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.380
appearance, some right. Like especially,
yes. It's like, especially in

383
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.520
like the tech, the tech
space, which is very, very

384
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:07.430
competitive. It seems, we think
it's a meritocracy, right? The

385
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.850
tech, the, the, the white
male tech, you know, Roddy,

386
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.390
we, we, we think it's
a meritocracy. Do you think

387
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:20.630
it's a meritocracy? It's, it's
hard. Like, because some days

388
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.580
I do some days I
don't like to, to be

389
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.220
completely honest and I feel
like the only way that

390
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.250
it starts to shift, and,
and this is hard because

391
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.840
I don't know this is
a personal thing. Or if

392
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.590
it's just other people like
in, in fields, in which

393
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.100
you're expected to have an
output every day, like whether

394
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.610
the output is like a
working product or a product

395
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.400
nonetheless, or a design or
this or that, it's almost

396
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.340
like my validation is based
off of my output. Right.

397
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.470
So, and that's not how
it's supposed to be. Oh,

398
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.650
is it supposed to be,
if not that I think

399
00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.110
you should be able, at
least with my therapist is

400
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.720
I think you're supposed to
be able to Cause that's

401
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.390
an East coast thing. Yeah.
I think you're supposed to

402
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.330
have your validation coming from
yourself and only yourself. Like,

403
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.810
you're not, you're not what
you, this is, this is

404
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.190
kind of hard to say,
you're not what you put

405
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.680
out. Right. And it's probably
sounds kind of odd too,

406
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.580
but it has to be
something where you know who

407
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.790
you are. Like, it's almost
like the reading rainbow special,

408
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.550
like, you know who you
are, you accept it. And

409
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:24.450
then everything past that is
okay. Did you, you remember

410
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.170
the Saturday night live with
I'm good enough and I'm

411
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:32.280
smart enough and gosh, darn
it. People like, yeah, Exactly.

412
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.430
It's like we laugh, but
it's so true. You have

413
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.090
to say that There was
a, there was a thing

414
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.010
in the eighties, seventies and
eighties, when I was growing

415
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.790
up in, in the mid
seventies called warm, warm fuzzies

416
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.400
and cold pricklies. And it
was, it was the beginning

417
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.780
of like, it was that
it was that a warm,

418
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.120
fuzzy thing to say, or
was that a cold prickly?

419
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.880
And the, the general idea
was, you know, say positive

420
00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.530
things, be positive if you
don't have anything nice to

421
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.550
say, don't say it. But
at the same time we,

422
00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.780
we, we raised, I feel
a whole generation more so

423
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.800
now with millennials have kids.
And now, now adults that

424
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.230
are feel entitled. Like they,
they, they come out of

425
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.620
college, like where's my hundred
grand a year. Right. Where's

426
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.560
my awesome job. And I'm
gonna take a mental health

427
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.880
day. Is that okay? Because
ultimately isn't it your output?

428
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.310
Yes. You're a great person.
You're a nice person and

429
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.230
your family loves you, but
ultimately you do have to,

430
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.870
Right? No, no, you're right.
You're right. You're right. And

431
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.300
I was reading an article
similar that just talks about

432
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.410
how, you know, our, our
parents raised us to think

433
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.260
that we could do anything.
And because of that, you

434
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.530
know, we see the rainbow
unicorns, this leg, or can't

435
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:45.300
do anything. Right. And that
every time I like really

436
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.820
think about that, it's like
depressing, wait it's depressingly like,

437
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.560
okay. And is relieving. Yes.
It's a relief and depressing

438
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.440
at the same time, because
quickly, by the way, I

439
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.350
know. Right. Depressingly okay. Dot
com. I mean, that's like,

440
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.450
that's a tumbler. Yeah. It
actually is really good. Let

441
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.150
me write that down, But
we'll get that before we

442
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.930
go, before we go live
with this show. Depressingly okay.

443
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.910
Yeah. Just cause that's what
that is. Right. I mean,

444
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.100
like the thing is you
are not a unique snowflake.

445
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:18.420
Yeah. And that's like, that's
really sad. Right. But that

446
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.730
at the same time, it's
like, okay, so I don't

447
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.180
have to be another Gandhi.
Okay. Who, because I don't

448
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.030
really know how I'm going
to get there. Like I'm

449
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.920
like 31 and I'm trying
to figure out, all right.

450
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.200
How can I, how can
I get the guy and

451
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.590
he's level? And like, what
four years? Like, that's a

452
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.240
lot of pressure. It's already
enough pressure to just be

453
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.960
in myself. So I feel
like that when I travel,

454
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.600
like when I go to
New York, which is kind of

455
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.490
like the New York for me
is the road not traveled.

456
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.820
It's like, we're, it's like,
it's where I was when

457
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.210
I was 22 and did
not stay. And, you know,

458
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.500
cause I'm on the West
coast now and I've got

459
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.360
a family. My family is
great. Wife's great. Kids are

460
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.780
great. But I'm like, man,
if I could be 22

461
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.840
again, what would this brain
like a 40 year old

462
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.270
brain, a 22 year old
body, I would destroy New York.

463
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.740
You know what I mean?
I would just take over

464
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.440
and I walk around. It
was just so many people

465
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.000
who are, and they, and
the thing is though, you,

466
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.720
you, you attribute things to
people that go walking by

467
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.580
my friend, who I just
had on the show a

468
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.880
couple of weeks ago, Chris
dancy called it attribution bias,

469
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.510
where you're assuming that everyone
is as smart as you

470
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.000
and as competent as you
and has the same values

471
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.690
as you, you attribute your
personality to these different people

472
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.970
and you assume they must
be awesome. Their life must

473
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.380
be amazing. Look at that.
They're in a suit in

474
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.330
New York, you know, and you
don't realize that they got

475
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.770
up at three in the
morning, took the train to

476
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.020
get into town and get
their jobs they to live.

477
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.990
Yeah. That's like, it's like
one of the biggest things

478
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.570
that I always talk about
too, like, because like, you

479
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.060
know, I majored in psychology
in college along with like

480
00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.690
10 other things. And one
of the, one of the

481
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.330
things we learned is this
whole concept of the invisible

482
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.540
audience. So, you know, as
a kid, we think that

483
00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.930
everyone is looking at us,
but not realizing that once

484
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.330
we realize that, then we
know that everyone else thinks

485
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.640
the same thing. We should
take us out of the

486
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.400
spotlight. But as we grow
older, for some reason it

487
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.470
can either get really bad
or really good. And a

488
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.570
lot of the times we
still think that people are

489
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.750
still, we still have that
invisible audience thing. Like, and,

490
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.290
and that's what I feel
a lot like that, that

491
00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.920
particular concept drives a lot
of people to either not

492
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.760
think they're so great or
always trying to change or

493
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.700
always trying to be something
that they're not. And that

494
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.280
actually led to a blog
post that I wrote, this

495
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.490
is a horrible shameless plug,
but it was a, is

496
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.590
it too late to be
awesome. And it was like

497
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.870
one of the top shared
because of the fact that

498
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.500
so many people could relate
to it so much. Like

499
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.710
it's a, there's a danger
in comparison. There's a danger

500
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.670
in even perfectionism and perfectionism
is someone a disease. And

501
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:50.890
it's like, if we could
like really be conscious of

502
00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.760
that, then, then it all
starts to come together a

503
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.250
little bit more. And then
this whole idea, or this

504
00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.540
whole thing of inclusion actually
becomes like, Oh, cause we

505
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.850
all really should be like
talking to each other. And

506
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.420
we all really should be
like, recognizing like awesome things

507
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.760
in one another, you know,
but we like set ourselves

508
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.770
in our own tiny planets
because we don't think we're

509
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.890
good enough. Yep. It was
in fact that blog post

510
00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.470
that I'll add to the
show notes that post, I

511
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:18.820
think it was on medium.
Is it too late to

512
00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.410
be awesome. That's why I
reached out to you in

513
00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.230
the first place, if you
remember. Yes, yes. Yeah. And

514
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.640
then we found out that
we knew the same people

515
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.760
and then Exactly like 15
of the same people. No.

516
00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.700
Yeah. And it's cool. Cause
it's actually going to be

517
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.030
a South by Southwest too,
as a panel. So Rocco

518
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.590
and I got, I finally
got, I got a panel

519
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.590
two turns out, so I'll
see you there. Yes, yes,

520
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.530
yes. Is it too late
to be awesome? They're like,

521
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.630
is that, is that an
unreasonable putting on a weight

522
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.660
to put on somebody, you
know? And is that about

523
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.180
ASAP? Is that too late
in age? Like, are you,

524
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.590
is it too late for
you to be awesome or

525
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.410
is it too late? Like
everyone else has already awesome.

526
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.330
And no one, none of
us can be awesome now,

527
00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.350
You know, originally I was
writing it as I'm, you

528
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.110
know, I'm 30 or I'm
this, I'm that like, is

529
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.080
it 31 a minute ago?
Yeah. Well, at the time

530
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.120
I was, I just turned
31 October, but, but yeah,

531
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.000
it was like, you know,
I'm 31 30, whatever. And

532
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.610
I feel like I'm not
where Kevin Rose's. Right. And

533
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:19.640
it's like, okay, like he's
Kevin. We're like, we don't

534
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.650
know what he went through
to get to, you know,

535
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.630
where he's at now. But
that, that's where it started.

536
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.360
It was literally like a
conversation with a coworker and

537
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.390
I'm like, I'll never be
great. I'll never be awesome.

538
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.810
And then that like spanned
into like just a whole

539
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.380
bunch of, of things that
I noticed that I was

540
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.760
putting on myself because I
was comparing myself to other

541
00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.660
people my age, but it's
crazy because a lot of

542
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.050
people look to me as
the same thing. And so

543
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.860
it's like, I'm someone else's
Kevin Rose, right? Yeah. Yeah. I

544
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.340
have that. I have that
sometimes where I'll have to,

545
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.860
I'm telling my wife about
this. Cause I'm, I'm famous

546
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.600
one or two days a
year at a specific town.

547
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.510
You see what I'm saying?
Like if I go to

548
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:11.450
like a conference in Wisconsin
where I'm the keynoter for

549
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.450
those two days, it's like,
Oh, you're Hanselman. Can I

550
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.850
get your picture? Right. But
then I go back to

551
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.310
Oregon or I go to
South by Southwest and I'm,

552
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.650
you know, I'm nobody, but
for a day or two,

553
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.930
I get to be famous.
And then it's like, wow,

554
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.750
you guys really think that
Mike I'm famous and my

555
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.810
life is awesome. Like, you're
insane. But then when I

556
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:34.580
was at South by Southwest,
I met Fred Armisen, you

557
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.650
know, Fred Armisen from Portlandia
and Saturday night live. And

558
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.940
by met, I mean, he
came out of the elevator

559
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.610
and I just freaked out
and then pointed at him.

560
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.060
I just pointed at him
like, and then, you know,

561
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.200
he did, he goes like
this, he points at me.

562
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.420
And then he walks away
and I was just like,

563
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.620
Oh, that was, you know
what I mean? And then

564
00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.240
the guy next to me
was like, what was that?

565
00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.200
Because he didn't know who
the guy was. I was

566
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.980
like, that's Fred fricking Armisen.
And the guy was like,

567
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.340
but you're Scott fricking Hanselman.
I don't think you understand

568
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.250
the pecking order here. This
guy was on Saturday night

569
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.250
live. I have a blog,
you know, like this isn't

570
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.260
even a thing. Like I
don't even know why we're

571
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.760
having this conversation. And then
of course all the depressing

572
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.660
Leo, okay. Stuff starts to
happen. I was never on

573
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.060
Saturday night live and I
really should be. Maybe it's

574
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.770
not too late. Maybe I
could still be honest and

575
00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:32.330
know. Yeah. And that's literally,
my brain thought it's like

576
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.700
every day, like this morning,
I was like, I really

577
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.270
need to do improv because
I'm funny. I know I'm

578
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.640
funny. I just need the
training and then I could

579
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.630
be an actress in like
my forties. It'll be awesome.

580
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.230
Like, you know, but, and
I read this really awesome

581
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.870
comic that basically said that
it takes like what, 10

582
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:53.170
years to master something. So
in our lifetime we can

583
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:57.670
actually, yeah. Someone wrote a
comic off of it and

584
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.780
was saying, we can have
like eight different different lives

585
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.980
within our life. So it's
almost like, yeah. So it

586
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.190
was almost like a reincarnation
while you're still alive. So

587
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.220
I know that for me,
UX probably won't happen in

588
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.260
five years. Like I know
I'm going to switch over

589
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.710
to something else just because
I just want to explore

590
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:21.210
everything. You know, That, that
is actually very true. Yeah.

591
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.270
Well, my, my mom got
her master's degree at like

592
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.120
55 and you can do
your, you can have a

593
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.300
career every 10 years and
on the thing about like

594
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.910
being famous and going to
like LA or whatever my

595
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.980
wife was like, alright, let's
go, let's go to LA.

596
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.630
She's like, let's go and
we'll get you out. We'll

597
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.790
get you some pilots. And
you know, do you know

598
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.870
why that didn't happen? Cause,
cause I was like, nah,

599
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:49.350
it's okay. See, this is
the thing. Am I going

600
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:53.040
to succeed with that kind
of attitude? No, but it's

601
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.170
like, why did you say
that though? Like, why did

602
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.870
you, We got kids and
they're in school and we

603
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.090
have a house and I
mean, who wants to go?

604
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.130
And you know, cause we
would go down to LA

605
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.690
and I'd do all these
pilots and then we would

606
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.870
limp back unsuccessful and all
I would come out of

607
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.650
it with is like with
an IMDP page. What did

608
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:14.910
you do? Well, I have
this IMDV page, which scheduled

609
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:20.280
for deletion. I think it's
a start. I mean, Yeah,

610
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.800
no, it's, it's hard for
me. Like, because I always

611
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.750
it's. So for me it's
always like, I'm not a

612
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.420
not good enough type of
thing or, or like I'm

613
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.840
not ready and that's, that's
something where I think a

614
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.420
lot of people can probably
relate to too. Like you

615
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.910
don't want to fail. So
you just wait like, well

616
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:37.620
let me, let me just
wait a couple more years

617
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.160
until No, but see everybody
who succeeds failed many, many

618
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.770
times, like everyone who we
think is an overnight success

619
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.640
was failing for year, like
Brad Pitt. Right? Like he

620
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.200
came out of nowhere and
then he was Brad Pitt.

621
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.200
No he wasn't, he wasn't
10 years of crap movies.

622
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.310
Exactly. Every comedian that we've
ever loved is done. 10

623
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.850
years of standup at dive
bars all through the Midwest.

624
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.810
Yeah. So it's like, what's
stopping us because maybe you

625
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:09.030
are that snowflake. Right? Like,
like bringing it back, like

626
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.970
you just never know. And
I think that, that's one

627
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.220
of the things that I
always think about every day

628
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.430
where it's like, how can
I do something closer to

629
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:22.410
my dreams today? Just so
many dreams that I have,

630
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.250
and then not knowing how
to approach it from my

631
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.420
position, whether that's, you know,
racially gender or whatever. Like

632
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.120
there's just a lot of,
a lot of things on

633
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.880
the, on the brain. Yeah.
Well ultimately it comes down.

634
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.840
Are you driven when you
wake up in the morning

635
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.330
to do whatever the next
thing is and is that

636
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.550
driven from a sense of,
I can do it and

637
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.990
I feel good about this
and let's give that a

638
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.300
try and if I fail,
I'll try something else. Right.

639
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.150
Or is it driven, driven
from like some self-loathing or

640
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.140
shame area and that's where
you get into trouble. Yeah.

641
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.840
And I think, I mean,
even to like being able

642
00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.660
to apply to South by
was one of those things

643
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.540
where it took me three
years to do. I remember

644
00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.900
the first time. Yeah. The
first time I went, I

645
00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.630
was on Kickstarter when Kickstarter
first came out to earn

646
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:13.060
money to go and I
raised enough money to go.

647
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.490
And it was my first
time ever. And it was

648
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:19.510
the first place that ever
like put a passion in

649
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.030
me the way that it
did in that I could

650
00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.670
be anything and do anything
and be amazing at it.

651
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.580
Like being the geek that
I am. And it was

652
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.850
like, from there, it just
like Mike, my whole career,

653
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:34.900
everything just shot up. Right.
But I still didn't feel

654
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.660
good enough to like actually
submit an idea like, Oh

655
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.980
my ideas are like sucky,
like whatever, after the blog

656
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.050
post went up and then
I saw how many times

657
00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.570
it was shared and it
became like one of mediums,

658
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.170
like top like top blogs
for the month of July,

659
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.170
I believe, or June, then
I said, okay, well since

660
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.720
it's the only reason why
I did it was because

661
00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.210
I saw that on, there
was a core of post,

662
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.730
like, and I found this
out after the fact that

663
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.030
was actually talking about a
similar subject, the person wrote

664
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.730
like I'm in my early
twenties, is it too late?

665
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.920
And I'm like, Whoa, like,
are you kidding me? Like,

666
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.540
you're like a baby. Like,
but, but everyone, like there

667
00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.970
was over 500 responses. So
I was like, okay, this

668
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:18.790
is, this is something I
have to do. So then

669
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.770
I did that and then
I snuck another one in

670
00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:24.820
another panel in about co-learning
and how Alec our education,

671
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:29.380
you know, will be changing.
America, both got accepted. Like

672
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.290
which one did you have
to pick? Well, I can

673
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:35.350
do both because the education
one is for South by

674
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:40.180
education, which is starts before.
Yeah. Cheater. You're only supposed

675
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.070
to have one, so that's
cool. So you get both

676
00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:44.650
cause the one's in a
different conference. Exactly. Yeah. The

677
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.210
education one I think starts
before interactive. So I'll be,

678
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.690
I'm doing both of them,
but I would have never

679
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:52.420
even thought to do it.
Had I not, it's always

680
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.130
the whole question of what
do I have to lose?

681
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:57.910
And I'm this, I don't
know if this is like

682
00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.910
going into a whole nother,
like racial driven topic, but

683
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.160
it's like a lot, a
lot of the times where

684
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.750
it's like, what do we
have to lose is like

685
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.140
one of those questions that
always comes up. So I

686
00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.980
always wonder why people aren't
risking more to get, to

687
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.920
get to their dreams. I
think it's fear of getting

688
00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:22.930
stomped on emotionally vocationally. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm just, I think

689
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:25.210
I'm so used to failure
and that's probably a bad

690
00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.650
way to put it, but
I'm so used to failure.

691
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:28.960
I'm not afraid of it
anymore. I'm actually more afraid

692
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.650
of success. That is actually
a good place to stop.

693
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.170
