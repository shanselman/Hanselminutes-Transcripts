00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.280
special holiday episode, Scott rolls
the tape as a technical

10
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.940
discussion with Chris cells and
Rory Blythe degrades. It's a

11
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.490
pure poem. Sit back, relax
and enjoy. Hi, this is

12
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.710
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes. This

13
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.140
very well may be the
worst episode of the year,

14
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.690
but since it's the end
of the year, that's okay,

15
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.660
we'll start next year. Fresh.
I'm sitting here in my

16
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.100
home office with Chris cells
and of, of Microsoft who

17
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.400
is laughing at me. I
feel so motivated to do

18
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.680
a good job now, and
I love the way you've

19
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.130
motivated your listeners to pay
special attention by lowering their,

20
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.660
their expectations early on in
the show. What does that

21
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.520
mean? W you were, you
were shaking the mic and

22
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.200
it was just, it was
distracting. And I think it's

23
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.470
gonna result in a poor
recording sound geeks. That is

24
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.130
Rory blood to my right
Roy formerly of Microsoft. Now

25
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.800
gainfully unemployed. I don't know
if gainfully is the right

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.390
word, happily unemployed. I think
it'd be the right way

27
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.440
to put it. I work
in my basement and I

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.380
spend pretty much all hours
of the day, writing, recording,

29
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.600
video, having a basement. Well,
I live in the basement

30
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.480
crest. And so it is
technically my basement. I can

31
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.800
dig a hole and get
lower down. It might be

32
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.320
a seller, but I do
live in a basement. So

33
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.720
I am now stupider for
having heard that exchange. Well,

34
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.370
we're living up to that
bar. You said at the

35
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.380
very beginning of the show,
it's a holiday, it's a

36
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.730
holiday show next week I'll
be interviewing my dad. So

37
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
how are you gentlemen? People
are thinking that this is

38
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.340
an episode of Carl. Franklin
is Monday, Mondays, as opposed

39
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.790
to Hansel minutes. Let's not
waste their time. I'm sorry

40
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.230
is like the McLaughlin group,
Rory most important thing in

41
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.190
technology today. It's wrong. It's
windows, media server next time,

42
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.420
right? Seriously. Are you coding
at all? Lori? It's not

43
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.760
exactly that I'm coding. I
start coding really professionally a

44
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.230
few years ago, but what
I am doing right now

45
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.400
is I've been my Mac
all the time and I

46
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.640
find objective C cumbersome and
irritating. I'm sure the Mac

47
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.100
guys love it because after
so many years of their

48
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.070
other messed up languages and
APIs, it's the greatest thing

49
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.330
in the world. But I've
been writing back and forth

50
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.510
actually with the Apple tools
developer team. And, and I've

51
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.400
been trying to urge them
to create a Python like

52
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.740
language so that people can
get a much higher level

53
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.220
access to a simplified abstracted
layer over the top of

54
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.220
cocoa. Isn't that what it
is, isn't that what Apple

55
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.980
script is? Do they already
have that Apple script is

56
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.530
like, you actually type it
in English, you know, could

57
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.060
you please go get me
a file? And it doesn't

58
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.620
make sense. I can't stand
it. It's like, it's like

59
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.170
SQL, but even higher level.
I don't like that. I

60
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.970
want a bit of structure.
And once I want some

61
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.220
meditation, I want some consistency
and I want access to

62
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.760
the Coca libraries or to
an abstracted simplified layer over

63
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.550
the top of the cocoa
libraries. And I'd like to

64
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.400
see a better GUI designer.
So now we're into the

65
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.490
Hansel minutes of it, but
what is the cocoa libraries?

66
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.150
Okay. The cocoa libraries is
the well they're called cocoa

67
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.850
now, but technically they are
leftover from the next step

68
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.320
days. So it's a framework,
not@allinlikethe.net framework through what you

69
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.250
access all the various functionalities
of iOS 10 and, and

70
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.990
each class actually begins with
NS going back to next

71
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.750
step. This stuff is old,
but a lot of Mac

72
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.360
developers don't seem to know
that. So they're very excited,

73
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.340
really hopped up about it
where I find it frustrating.

74
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.280
Sometimes I want to scream
and objective C is just

75
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.870
weird, although it's better than
C plus plus in my

76
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.630
opinion. So objective C is
the language that they're programming

77
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.400
and do they have, I
mean, they have a garbage

78
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.610
collector or what's the lifestyle
like, okay. So with version

79
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.680
two of objective C it's
only taken like 50 years

80
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.080
to get it. But with
version two, they've gone from

81
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.630
reference counting to garbage collection,
which I thought was a

82
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.880
nice little move because Chris,
he could probably correct me

83
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.650
all over the, all over
the map about this, but

84
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.290
it seems like reference counting
is not too far, or

85
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.210
I should say garbage collection
is not like a huge

86
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.530
long cry from reference County.
Well, so reference County is

87
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.380
one form of garbage collection.
I assume they're using some

88
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.340
variation of Mark and suite
garbage collection in objective C

89
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.070
2.0, but I don't actually
know In the previous version,

90
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.440
I'm talking about a fully
manual, of course, just reference

91
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.670
County. They didn't even track
object references for you. Right.

92
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.680
You had to do it
yourself, which was so pointless.

93
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.970
Yeah. So as Chris asked,
it is, it was manual

94
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.410
reference counting, which was frustrating
because you're sitting there, you

95
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.780
realize what you're doing. It,
it all happens in that,

96
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.840
you know, first in first
out kind of irritating way

97
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.550
where you just look at
it and you think this

98
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.130
should be happening automatically. So
when I went and I

99
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.680
was trying to mess with
objective C and Coco and

100
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.090
manual reference counting, I got
really, really irritated. Plus there's

101
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.370
a, there's a QE builder
that makes absolutely no sense

102
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.710
to me, everything everything is
done using what does it

103
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.460
model? I don't view controller
controller and the interface brother,

104
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.270
But for a simple app,
that's such overkill. It reminds

105
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.210
me of messing with swing
where you can't just have

106
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.550
a control. You've got to
composite everything yourself. You can

107
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.890
even have a fricking scroll
bar without adding it and

108
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.250
coding against it. It's irritating.
Well, this just sounds like,

109
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.830
I mean, this doesn't sound
like horribly controversial. This seems

110
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.650
like this was MFC and
you've got resources that have

111
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.960
dialogues and you've got the
document that talks to the

112
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.280
view. Well, I'm a C
was really, it was the

113
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.500
view in controller we're unified
and then we have the

114
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.200
document. So it was really
document, view document. Yeah, sure.

115
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.810
But I'm just saying that.
So, you know, they have

116
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.820
dialogue resources to worry about
and they have, you know,

117
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.730
that doesn't seem too much
like VC too much, unlike

118
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.480
visual C six, which was
not necessarily a dark time.

119
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.480
But So MFC was, was
actually built almost before C

120
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.780
plus plus, I mean, C
plus plus itself had a

121
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.300
bunch of features that were
still under development while they

122
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.440
were building MFC. So MFC
duplicated a bunch of those

123
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.320
features in as library features.
And so if you wanted

124
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.010
to use those features like
type information, right? If you

125
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.800
want to use type information
at runtime, that was elaborated

126
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.310
feature in MFC, as well
as eventually a C plus

127
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.780
plus feature as part of
the language itself. So it's

128
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.330
actually, it sounds like exactly
what you're talking about. There

129
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.470
that's an excellent analogy. It
also sounds a lot like

130
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.710
objective C on the Mac
with the next step stuff

131
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.890
sounds a lot like C
plus plus and comm, right?

132
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.770
You built a bunch of
layer classes and you, you

133
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.570
didn't program against the thing.
Cause the thing was too

134
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.790
ugly. So you programmed against
the layer on the thing

135
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.700
and what you're saying, and
of course this is always

136
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.670
better, right? You want to,
this is what happens over

137
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.000
time, right? We adoptive set
of features that we like,

138
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.910
and we first build them
in libraries to see if

139
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.730
we like them and the
languages don't support them directly.

140
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.150
And then we push them
into the language itself. I

141
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.840
mean, you can see that
in every actively developing language,

142
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.390
right? This is a good
thing. And eventually the, what

143
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.640
happens is the languages get
simpler. W w we get,

144
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.340
we moved from things like
a C plus plus to

145
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.430
C sharp. And then of
course C-sharp itself is evolving

146
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.660
over time and it's getting
better and getting more features,

147
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.450
right? For example, the link
stuff is, is a dream

148
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.970
it's a joy to work
with. And that was, that

149
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.490
was the thing that didn't
exist, right? That, that kind

150
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.970
of programming style functional programming
in, in that net didn't

151
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.670
exist until then On last
week's show, I had Paul

152
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.240
Vick on architected VB, and
I asked him, how was

153
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.110
it controversial for him to
get XML literal support into

154
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.240
the language? I mean, because
at that point you're taking

155
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.220
the pure, you know, the
quote unquote purity of some

156
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.670
programming language, and then tying
it to some thing in

157
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.820
this case, angle brackets and
the whole concept of XML.

158
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.030
And he thought it was
very pragmatic and he felt

159
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.170
like he was walking a
little bit of a tight

160
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.150
rope between a purist point
of view and a pragmatic

161
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.300
point of view, but always
leaning towards the pragmatist. So

162
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.790
I can, I can see
that. And I've heard just,

163
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.710
just be quiet for a
minute. I have to say

164
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.550
right to both of you
guys, you were talking about

165
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.590
Scott, how this is not
a total disaster. Those weren't

166
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.840
the words he used, but
the, the show or the

167
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.550
language, the language, the, the
problem is if I want

168
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.580
to write a quick, dirty
little app, just utility to

169
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.940
do anything, any little thing
I want, for example, use

170
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.010
stickies on your Mac, right?
Sticky is the little app

171
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.660
that lets me see post
it notes on the screen.

172
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.340
Right? Okay. You can't without
doing a manually have separate

173
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.680
stickies databases where I like
to have a bunch of

174
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.420
stickies that I save and
then I archive. And then

175
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.650
I started with a whole
new set of sticky. So

176
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.750
I wrote an app several
years ago that did this

177
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.040
for me. Right. But I
don't want to go back

178
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.720
and do it again because
just to do that was

179
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.840
so cumbersome. And I want
to see something where I

180
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.610
get to use the language.
Like I say, it's like

181
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.830
Python, I want to have
a simple high level language

182
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.450
that forces some sort of
aesthetic standard. Well, give me

183
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.630
the functionality and the simplicity
of being able to code

184
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.310
against the framework without having
to worry so much about

185
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.780
anything. I hate includes. I
hate them. I am so

186
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.550
sick of having to see
include a STD IO, anything

187
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.960
I don't want to see
this stuff. This is like,

188
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.370
so 1942, it's just, how
is that different than saying

189
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.360
using system dot XML? Because
using systems that XML makes

190
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.160
sense to me. It's okay.
So you've just completely obsoleted

191
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.370
the last 15 minutes of
this podcast, because max don't

192
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.340
make sense to you. That's
what you're saying. Well, that

193
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.870
actually that's exactly what I'm
saying. And I think that

194
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.540
that's why I haven't to
use your word obsolete obsoleted

195
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.850
the past 15 minutes of
this interview, the idea is

196
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.250
that I understand it makes
it makes sense to somebody,

197
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.140
but I want to see
a system that's modern. I

198
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.240
don't want to see a
system like any other weird

199
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.160
hacky C language. It's all
built on top of C,

200
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.440
right? It's all ultimately just
plain old C I hate

201
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.180
that. That just pisses me
off. I want to see

202
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.120
something new and simple and
pleasant and yeah, they've got

203
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.130
real basic out there so
that if you really want

204
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.100
to, you can, you can
use visual basic six style

205
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.740
language, which nobody wants because
it's that irritating mix of

206
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.880
procedural and an object based
programming that never goes away.

207
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.800
And you don't know where
anything's coming from. You have

208
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.320
no idea where these functions
lie. You don't know what's

209
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.480
an object. You don't know
what's a function that's sitting

210
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.600
in some weird library that
gets included automatically. Oh no,

211
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.090
hang on. I'm taking the
microphone away from you. So

212
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.670
I'm sorry. All I heard
there was that you don't

213
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.890
think objective C is a
good thing for Mac people

214
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.960
to build their platform on,
Oh, they can use mano

215
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.750
and C sharp and Coco
sharp or whatever, or whatever,

216
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.080
you know, C plus plus,
or Python or Ruby, or

217
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.680
I want to see a
nice, officially supported a dev

218
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.380
system from Apple. I don't.
And there's several reasons why

219
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.940
I think that might do
this. Might not do this

220
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.130
one. It's that it takes
a while obviously to create

221
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.670
a development. They have several
officially support gives me sales.

222
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.670
I'm talking here, sales, I'm
talking. So when is he

223
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.080
an officially supported a solution
out there and Oh, stop

224
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.710
it. So the, but the
problem is that I think

225
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.270
if there were an easier
way to develop apps, then

226
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.220
people might flood the market
with their third party apps

227
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.220
and, and wind up with
another. Totally. Yeah. I don't

228
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.400
think that's the reason that
the Macintosh isn't loaded with

229
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.560
third grade. I just want
to say, I don't think

230
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.410
that's the reason either cells,
but I'm just saying that's

231
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.900
something to think about because
the OSTP 10 community is

232
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.520
still pretty nicely done. And
if you want to go

233
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.960
to app, you can find
one. Okay. I don't want

234
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.670
to have to go out,
go to CNET and trudge

235
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.370
through thousands of applications to
find that one FTP client

236
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.980
that I think is going
to all right. Okay. There

237
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.470
you go. You can talk.
You can fetch. So with

238
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.380
all due respect to Rory,
and I feel that we've

239
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.590
now offended the format listeners
that are listening to this

240
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.840
show. Thank God that I
would like to say this

241
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.830
though. I pray. I will
go personally down to panic

242
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.700
headquarters. Panic is the maker
of transmit the greatest and

243
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.100
only FTP client. And I
will sit down and do

244
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.170
a podcast with my friend,
Steven, Frank, who I went

245
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.750
to college with, who is
the owner co-owner of panic

246
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.860
writer of transmit and statue
and Coda. And talk about

247
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.440
object. We'll do a magic
show by someone who actually

248
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.930
makes a living and has
a company of 11 people

249
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.090
working on Mac stuff in
objective C. And we'll see

250
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.940
if he agrees with the,
the, the pain and the

251
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.240
horror and the kind of
post-apocalyptic wasteland that you've painted

252
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.310
for us. Roy. One more
thing thing is though Matt

253
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.100
guys, and Chris could probably
tell you this, coming from

254
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.440
carbon, for example, anything is
going to look better, right?

255
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.990
So my guys think that
Coco is this wonderful dream

256
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.120
where they've got this great
modern language, but it's still,

257
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.690
That is the thing that
they, they call the old

258
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.790
Mac toolbox. Right? Right. Yeah.
And it was also the

259
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.840
bridge between nine and 10.
I programmed on the Mac

260
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.180
toolbox. And it was when
I, when I was moving

261
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:08.040
from the Macintosh as my
user interface and Unix as

262
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.070
my, as what I programmed
in for living and I

263
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:15.510
moved to windows 3.1, it
was a shock. Listen, to

264
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.230
bring windows 3.1, this historical
context, this is important for

265
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.570
right. You're only 12 years
old. You don't know these

266
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.750
things. And people, adults like
Chris and myself need to

267
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.630
talk about the historical context
in which these things exist.

268
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.970
Please, Chris, continue. I don't
know if I want to

269
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.060
be put into the category
of adult here, but what

270
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.900
I'm saying is that the
only thing I could stand,

271
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.200
the only thing I could
stand about windows was the

272
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.070
API. When 32 is an
API compared to do we

273
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.490
programming under Unix, compared to
gooey programming on the Mac

274
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.400
was at least 10 times
better. And the tools were

275
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.880
always better. And it's, and
now with C sharp and.net,

276
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.030
I don't know what they
have over there, but it's

277
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.230
hard to imagine it getting
too much better. I wouldn't

278
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.660
agree with that at all.
Like I said, it's still

279
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.390
feels like it still feels
like swing to some extent,

280
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.220
which drove everybody in Saint
over how to use it,

281
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.200
except for the diehard Java.
People who don't know any

282
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.080
better. And again, the other
thing I'm arguing is that

283
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.660
the Mac, people just don't
know the difference there. They've

284
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.060
been dealing with the old
messages You were agreeing. You're

285
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.420
saying the programmatic API to
the Macintosh Sox. I think

286
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.090
you agree. And I was
saying that I much prefer

287
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.880
the wind windows way of
programming, gooey to the max.

288
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.040
Okay. Well, here's the deal
though. I tend to discount

289
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.050
most of what you say
because I'm Chris sells. I

290
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.360
wrote calm with my pinky
and notepad. It's just, you're

291
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.940
not a really, you're not
a reliable source of information

292
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.830
about what's easy. What's difficult.
What makes sense? And what

293
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.870
doesn't you heard it here
for her folks, Chris, cell's

294
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:45.090
not a reliable source of
information about computer. Wow. I

295
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.490
went from adult to that.
I didn't think I did

296
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.560
Give me worse. I'm glad
that you've just kind of

297
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:54.830
most of what Christmas. Wow.
Let me see here. That's

298
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.620
15 minutes. I think It's
a little early to stop

299
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.900
the show. Well, we haven't
said anything. You haven't actually

300
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.960
created problem. This is really,
really the worst show of

301
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.840
the year. I think we're
still, we're still there. This

302
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.730
is what I specialize in.
This is what I do.

303
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.120
Leaving a trail of slime.
It's really destruction. I feel

304
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.580
like if people learn something
from me, then I haven't

305
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.010
done my job. And again,
I'm stupid here for having

306
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:23.260
heard no worry. And Chris
and I we're we're, we're

307
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.760
actually, we're not close at
all. We rarely see each

308
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:31.120
other. I still can't get
over that. Your first date

309
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.020
with your wife lasted three
weeks. It was a really

310
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.170
good date. I'd say, wow,
she's a really nice, I

311
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.660
like her a great deal.
I only did it last

312
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.790
three weeks. It's not like
you met. And then you

313
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.760
couldn't bear to be parted
for three weeks. No, you

314
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.520
planned it. You booked that.
You'd never dated before. And

315
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.790
he said, I know let's
take a three recut cross

316
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.460
country chip as our first
date. And then she said,

317
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.320
what a good idea. We
did not initially set it

318
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.080
up as a date. It
was just friends. See, we

319
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.450
went across the country. We
don't have a cross country

320
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:09.940
trip in Portland to Denver,
Denver to Arizona. We fell

321
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.860
in love around Detroit. Well,
you know, you're downtown Detroit.

322
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.990
You found them in Detroit
because all you had left

323
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:21.730
was each other like Detroit.
You're huddled under a pylon.

324
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.900
I love you. Oh, I
have dedicated listeners in Detroit

325
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.490
and I love them. And
I don't want those listeners

326
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.060
to feel anyway, because I'm
a nice guy. I will

327
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.040
never say anything bad about
lovely downtown Detroit. What's the

328
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.960
first thing anybody from Detroit
will tell you. They'll tell

329
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.090
you don't stop in downtown
for anything run. All the

330
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.670
red lights don't even stop
for the cops. They're dangerous

331
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.830
too. And these people just
as much as you and

332
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.750
your wife they've I mean,
these people were really fun.

333
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.300
Little tribes. It's like it's
beyond Thunderdome out. There is

334
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.550
what I'm saying. I was
actually, this is true story.

335
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.500
We were actually staying in
an 1897 old Victorian former

336
00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.610
crack house. Truett's actually in
Detroit, a friend of ours,

337
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.280
a Victorian Cracker From the
period, 1887 authentic period level

338
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.150
of track record. There's a
historical crack house. No, but

339
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.750
my, my, my wife's friend
would take these multiple houses

340
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.520
and basically buy them up
for like a dollar on

341
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.190
an auction, strip them down
and rebuild them up again

342
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.130
and turn them from crack
houses into Like heroin or

343
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.820
methadone. No, no. They would
put Areas and stuff in

344
00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.980
there. It was a, it
was a habitat for humanity

345
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.240
thing. And we were watching
sliding doors with Gwyneth Paltrow

346
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.290
and a good flick and
fell in love and got

347
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.590
married three months later. But
thank you for cheapening. My

348
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.410
first, my first date with
him. Oh yeah. If you

349
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.240
think I was cheapening it,
you just missed the hand

350
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.850
gestures that Rory was using.
This is so not where

351
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.670
I want my show to
be. I promise a fresh,

352
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.160
all new for 2008 is
sliding doors, Gwenyth Paltrow, and

353
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.360
Minnie driver. See what I'm
talking about? I don't even

354
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.700
remember her in that movie.
And I'm a mini driver

355
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.680
fan. I mean, I just
watched girls point blank the

356
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.710
other day. So I did.
I got it. Actually, I

357
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.840
got it on the Xbox
download movie thing. I'd never

358
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.610
seen it. It's that doesn't
move your rock. Thought it

359
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.060
rocks because of John Cusak.
And I actually have my

360
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.690
John Cusack say anything poster
inside that my wife would

361
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.670
let me put it out.
Now that I think of

362
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.290
it, the best semen that
will be in the closet,

363
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.990
the best, the best thing
in that movie. So reminds

364
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.950
me a him of, of,
of you, me, of you,

365
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.480
The best scene in the
movie reminds of me Scott,

366
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.040
of who? John Cusack. Because
John Cusack reminds you of

367
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.370
Scott Hanselman. Yes. In this
one scene because he's so

368
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.390
anal during the conversation. So
many drivers like, Oh, come

369
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:46.130
on. No, no, no. You
remember when anal is the

370
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:50.120
wrong word, I want to
say precise. Precise is Lloyd

371
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.540
dabbler. You're talking about, so,
so many drivers like, Oh

372
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.210
no, this just goes by
blank. Yes. How come there

373
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.030
are things that you didn't
learn that are wrong, right?

374
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.530
You just don't kill people
in a civilized society. He's

375
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.930
doing his job. And he
did it impassionately, dispassionately, I

376
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.240
should say. But I thought
he's a professional. This is

377
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.580
the woman he loves about
to walk up the door.

378
00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.620
And he has just has
to say the right thing

379
00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.570
to get her to stay.
Right. And what does he

380
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:20.090
do? He starts correcting her
historical perspective. Right? What societies

381
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.910
are we talking? What civilizations
are we talking about? You

382
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.250
know, governments are just a
PR theory at this point.

383
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.790
And she's, she walks out
the door. You think there's

384
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.860
one guy in this room
who would not do that?

385
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.380
You're right. It's that? Does
Scott think it's fair to

386
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.810
say that every one of
us would say, what's this

387
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.060
the Ottoman empire, what are
we talking about? Which of

388
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.100
us in this room could
possibly resist getting to correct

389
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.660
somebody on anything. We're all
pedantic. We're all precise. I'm

390
00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.690
still uncomfortable with your use
of impassionate earlier in your,

391
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.360
and your very quick changing
of that to dispatch it

392
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.920
and thinking that I'm somehow
going to edit that out

393
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.440
later, it's not going to
happen. Well, the fact is,

394
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.180
look, let's just establish something.
Here you go out to

395
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.680
Google and you search for
the smartest man in the

396
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.450
world. It goes to me,
okay. If I want to

397
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.640
make up impassionate, I can
do that. This is my

398
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.150
business. Like the Stephen Colbert
or the technical set. You

399
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.140
know, I am Cole bear.
And you can too. Speaking

400
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.050
of Stephens, Stephen Hawking is
number three in that search.

401
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.440
I am two places up
from Stephen Hawking. You searched

402
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.780
for the smartest man in
the world. And you're two

403
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.210
above Stephen Hawking. I am
number one, Stephen Hawking is

404
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.330
number three. Clearly. There's something
wrong with intercept net search.

405
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.970
Yeah. This just proves that
Google is not useful at

406
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:31.070
all. Now live search though.
I don't know. There's the

407
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.040
Microsoft's microphone, Florida. I'm only
allowed to use live search.

408
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.150
So while I was there,
I became sort of distantly,

409
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.110
theoretically aware of live search
and never quite got around

410
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.850
to I wasn't one of
those guys who searched everything

411
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.130
twice, Google and live at
the same time, domain insane.

412
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.610
Plus you search for Roy
on life. What am I

413
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.010
like bottom first page result.
And then that was crap.

414
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.530
Obviously broken. That's what I
thought that was broken. If

415
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.090
I'm not the number one
search result. And I was

416
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.500
not on Google for a
while, but I'm pretty sure

417
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.930
I'm back. Yup. And for
a while, a couple of

418
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.750
days ago, I was a
first page result for $20

419
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:07.650
bill. I'm so glad that
your ego, The level of

420
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.080
your, your kind of self
confidence and your general, like

421
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.820
the litmus test of how
good is role, how well

422
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.070
is Roy? You know, you
know what I just realized,

423
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.340
the only technical content we
had in this entire show

424
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:22.260
is talking about You. You
said, Oh, let's not have

425
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.300
that conversation right now. I'm
going to go talk to

426
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.240
somebody who really knows. And
then it's all been about

427
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.270
Ego. It's about an upset
by our fragile egos, our

428
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.450
inability to have relationships with
Correcting people. No, I don't

429
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.220
think that's going to Google.
I think all of us

430
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.970
have very healthy ego. I
agree. I agree. In fact,

431
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.510
the one thing that relieves
me, you're talking about big

432
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.930
egos. My ego just barely
fits comfortably inside of your

433
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.570
8,000 square foot house in,
in the, in the Roy,

434
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.210
in the Rory sphere. It
is amazing. I heard it

435
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.890
squeaking as I walked in
the door, as it tried

436
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.950
to get through the doorframe,
you, you rub on it

437
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.270
and get static and all
the other houses in the

438
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.550
neighborhood clean to it. The
problem is I have is

439
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.970
the echo So much space
in this house. There's just,

440
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.360
the echo is kind of
distracting. I'm sorry. I couldn't

441
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.440
hear you over the echo.
I liked my house. We

442
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.030
worked very hard for it.
We've worked very hard for

443
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.420
our house. It's also neat.
It is, it is more

444
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.370
done than the house I've
lived in for the last

445
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.410
two years. This was bizarre.
I came in this earlier

446
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.380
today and we fed you
and thank you for your

447
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.870
very much welcome. And, and
you've said to my wife

448
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.790
that in three weeks of
having, we just moved in

449
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.910
three weeks ago, it's unpacked.
And you thought that that

450
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.770
was strange. Cause your house
you've been in there for

451
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.650
about 20 years, It was
strange that you would live

452
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.170
like that. I was just
saying how much better you

453
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.050
live in Hawaii? Unpack yet
you live in your house.

454
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.660
How many years? Right? It's
been more than two. Wow.

455
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.730
Almost constantly re renovating the
entire time. Moving boxes for

456
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.760
less. Well, I like to
think of it as the

457
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.850
Winchester mansion, my own personal
Winchester mansion. So, And do

458
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.850
you have any doors that
open into Brick walls? Staircases

459
00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.220
that go nowhere we do
have right now, one door

460
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.100
that opens into a room
with no floor. Yeah. That's

461
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.920
awesome. I actually do have
a staircase that goes nowhere.

462
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.290
They've, it's a duplex. They've
sealed off this stairway to

463
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.510
go upstairs, to keep me
out of the Upstairs. Do

464
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.790
you like ever since somebody
upstairs to get something, Oh,

465
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.190
run upstairs and get me
That, you know, I would

466
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.020
do that if people would
come over, but people don't

467
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.760
come over. For example, best
friend Felix will not come

468
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.650
over because I didn't have
a couch. I had made

469
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.230
a sofa out of my
setup mat and my exercise

470
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.030
bench. And that wasn't good
for anybody. I couldn't have

471
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.010
anybody ever, but I did
remember I got my furniture

472
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.370
yesterday. I got a furniture.
Yes. Nice. He should learn

473
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.310
about slipcover. They're really nice.
I've got a CA I

474
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.990
can, if I want to,
I can take this thing

475
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.030
apart and make it pink
tomorrow if I want, if

476
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.930
I wanted to. So wait,
is it a sofa or

477
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.110
a loveseat? It's a, it's
a, it's a sofa with

478
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.140
a sheds lounge at the
end. So it's a two

479
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.910
cushion sofa, not a three
cushion couch. Wasn't it? It's

480
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.160
like two cushions of the
sofa plus the third cushion

481
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.940
that belongs. So it's a
Davenport. I don't know. I've

482
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.850
never had a furniture before.
I've never had one and

483
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.260
I'm, I'm new to this.
I just put, I put

484
00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.480
it together myself. I did.
I was manly. I used

485
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.750
tools. Yeah, I know. But,
but you said shows mainly

486
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.370
hang right out the window.
Doesn't it. You have a

487
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.880
shares though. Let's be fair.
This is the only country

488
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.040
in the world where people
try to avoid saying quest

489
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.010
song, everywhere else. Even if
they massacre, they would never

490
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.490
say croissant. That is the
ugliest word in any language,

491
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.750
croissant, croissant. That's how they
see it at the drive

492
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.460
through at burger King. I
love it. When I go

493
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.470
to like Chipotle and the
guy academies, like I'd like

494
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.640
a beef burrito with some
chimi Chavez and some Carnegie

495
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:38.260
Satta. Well, that's how it's
pronounced. It is pronounced croissant

496
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.990
though. I got, I'm going
to punch you as soon

497
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.630
as you speak French though.
Right? We need to Bethel

498
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:50.130
and say just we just
sweet. So I have no

499
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.910
nothing. I know it's because
you're turning me on over

500
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:59.800
here. <inaudible> I've never wanted
you more. That is now

501
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.390
my ringtone. Yeah. Get that
on my face. I got

502
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.000
nothing to say remote. Seriously.
You must have to do

503
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.460
some massive editing to pull
anything at all useful or

504
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.920
interesting out of this podcast,
afraid that this is the

505
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.940
93rd show and it is
just devoid of content. And

506
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.640
what little, what little technical
content is in here is

507
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.360
about objective C a language.
I still don't fully understand,

508
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.430
even though Roy took up
10 minutes talking about it.

509
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.460
Okay. Let's think about this.
Right? First of all, Roy

510
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.800
added the only technical content
to this. Second of all,

511
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.600
you think this is you
think this is useless. You

512
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.430
give me the raw files.
I'll cut you guys out

513
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.530
and I'll pull this out
on my side as a

514
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.500
soliloquy, just me talking to
myself about beautiful, wonderful things

515
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.140
in a French accent and
saying stuff that is interesting.

516
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.360
My readers, my readers and
listeners and watches my, my

517
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.170
crowd. They would love this.
It's completely worthless for your

518
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.360
podcast, Scott, but you should
definitely send it to Rory.

519
00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.250
Okay. This is very interesting.
I want to, I think

520
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.370
Rory just touched on something
very briefly. I want to

521
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.520
talk about, because I know
you, Chris, you have to

522
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.020
go, but we're you said
my readers, like, like a

523
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.170
possessive sense in the sense
of you are in some

524
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:06.610
way. What's the word? Awesome.
All right. That's the word

525
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:12.190
you're looking for past maybe
year completely. I've done my

526
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.730
best to transfer my, my
users from being, or convert

527
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.030
my user, my readers from
being technical, to being interested

528
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.130
in it, painful for them
at all. Have they had

529
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.310
to unlearn a bunch of
stuff or people get really

530
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:25.960
confused? Like if I, if
I do a post to

531
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.990
my all caps, idiot voice,
they think I'm going crazy.

532
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:30.550
Which happened a long time
ago. Of course, they obviously

533
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.010
didn't notice anything I'm schizophrenia,
which I'm not on bipolar,

534
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.890
which is totally different here.
Or watch the tick. Do

535
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.360
you remember? The tick was,
the show is like a

536
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.530
superhero show and the very
best superhero on the tick

537
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.740
was bipolar bear. And here
we go. This is their

538
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.780
second job for bipolar bear,
but I don't feel like

539
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.940
getting up today. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt

540
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.980
you rolling. Whenever I hear
bipolar, I think of bipolar

541
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.930
bear. That's fine. He pissed
me off. I go try

542
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.490
polar on you. I mean,
I got, I got some

543
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.490
problems with stance, but listen.
Okay. So I changed. My

544
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.740
readers is as best I
could from being technical to

545
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.960
being into the creative stuff,
because I want to be

546
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.470
clear. You didn't actually change
their new people. I thought

547
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.650
he converted the people like
the people who didn't care

548
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.670
about. Cause Rory, as a
blogger, isn't saddled with content

549
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.400
and he's got a ton
of content. Have you been

550
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.470
to his site? But by
changing his readers, he means

551
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.770
swapping them out for people
who care less. What I'm

552
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.480
doing is I'm trying to
build a, I'm trying to

553
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.710
build a reader base so
that I can go to

554
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.170
a publisher and take fruit.
I'm putting together a book

555
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.150
right now. I've assembled my
first book and I'm working

556
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.030
on a second and now,
well, that's what I've been

557
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.110
doing in my basement, right?
And when I go to

558
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.730
the publisher, I'm not gonna
be one of these little

559
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.370
English lit staring at my
shoes. I'm writing the great

560
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.710
American novel idiots, right? I'm
going to go in and

561
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.450
I'm going to use all
the negotiation skills. I picked

562
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.450
up as an independent at
Microsoft anywhere. And I'm going

563
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.710
to walk in there. I'm
going to tell me that

564
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.810
I don't need the money.
I'm going to basically spit

565
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.580
on the table. And I'm
going to say, you can

566
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.770
either make money off of
me or you don't. And

567
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.300
I'm walking this offers on
the table for the next

568
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:56.280
10 minutes. But as, as
the world self proclaimed smartest

569
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.070
man alive, that's Google that
proclaim that go ahead though.

570
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.700
As the Google proclaimed smartest
man alive, wouldn't it make

571
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.790
sense for your novel to
be called the great American

572
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.280
novel? I mean that just
just seem they seem to

573
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.380
go together that the smartest
man alive would write the

574
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.770
great American. And of course,
you know, the, the byline

575
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.990
is by the smartest man
alive, right? The great American

576
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.900
novel by the smartest man
alive. I haven't decided on

577
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.580
a title yet. But back
to the backs of the

578
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.170
readers, the point is that
when I walk in to

579
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.750
negotiate, I'm going to say,
look, I already have several

580
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.780
thousand people, you know, who
are very dedicated to reading

581
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.600
this stuff. And there's a
market there of a couple

582
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.040
of my readers have already
offered to steal it when

583
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.170
it comes out. So I've
got, I've got the market.

584
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.910
You have to do Abby
Hoffman. Is that what I'm

585
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.460
hearing? Who's having Hoffman. I
don't read books. I just

586
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.560
write. Okay. I don't know
what these people do. I

587
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.020
don't know any other. You
are the bipolar Stephen Colbert.

588
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:48.240
He's smart. And you're the
smartest. Stephen Colbert is really

589
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.080
quite smart. I know he's
pretty smart. Wow. I really

590
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.610
apologize. Sincerely. This has been
another very, very sad episode

591
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.070
of Hansel minutes. I think
this was episode 93. You

592
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.500
see the tear in my
eye right here. I'm I'm

593
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.520
actually a little nauseous. I
will hopefully next week interview

594
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.190
my dad. He's going to
talk about what it's like

595
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.360
to, to raise someone like
me. I think it could

596
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.310
be a nice Christmas show.
Actually. That would be pretty

597
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.530
cool. My dad's a really
cool guy. I will, I'll

598
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.890
have him over and we'll,
we'll do a show and

599
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.170
I will hopefully forget the
show. As soon as I

600
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.290
don't put this up. Horrible.
This would be bad for

601
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:30.450
you. Thank you, Chris cells.
And, and hello, Rory. Thank

602
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.050
you, Scott. All right, we'll
see you next week on

603
00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.650
Hansel minutes.
