8
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.320
Oh, weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.970
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 24. In this

10
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.140
episode, Scott talks with Len
bass about computer science Past

11
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.780
and present. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

12
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.390
episode of Hansel minutes, and
I'm here at the Saturn

13
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.200
conference at Carnegie Milligan conference
here in Portland, Oregon. And

14
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.150
I have the pleasure of
sitting down with Lynn bass,

15
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.030
who is a senior principal
researcher at the national ICT

16
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.970
Australia. How are you, sir?
I'm doing fine. Glad to

17
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.710
be here. Well, I'm glad
that I had a chance

18
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.040
to talk to you. I,
I read about your exploits

19
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.120
online and I have actually
have a copy of your

20
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.910
software architecture book, software architecture,
and practice practice, and a

21
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.640
third edition. I think I
have the second. Oh my

22
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.710
God. You need to buy
the third. Is it updated

23
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.400
with important things? Yeah. Yes.
I mean the second edition

24
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.740
was 10 years old and
we decided it was time

25
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.530
to refresh it. And so
we, the third edition is

26
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.090
I would say substantially better,
especially considering today's distributed systems.

27
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.120
So, so, so the third
edition deals with issues like

28
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.330
distributed systems, it deals with
issues like the cloud. It

29
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.310
deals with issues like programming
at the edge. I can't

30
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.290
remember off hand what else,
but yeah, there was a

31
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.660
lot of new material editor.
Okay, fantastic. Well, I'll be

32
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.190
sure to put a link
to that in the show

33
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.140
notes. So listeners can take
a look at that as

34
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.190
well. Excellent. So you've, you've
moved to Australia now and

35
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.040
you're working as a researcher
there, but you did some

36
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.320
work in the U S
that's notable as well. So

37
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.320
I was, I was 25
years at the software engineering

38
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.100
Institute. I was one of
the people that was involved

39
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.070
in the software architecture program
at the SEI, maybe a

40
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.140
little bit of a stretch
to say that's the best

41
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.360
collection of software architecture work
that, that existed. And I

42
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.380
was a portion of it,
you know? So, so yeah,

43
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.020
so you've been in the
industry for a long time.

44
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.120
You must have a number
of stories going back rather,

45
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.550
rather far, if I may.
So, so I got a

46
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.590
first job in 1964 when
I graduated. I had a

47
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.660
bachelor's in mathematics had essentially
never seen a computer before.

48
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.850
And I got a job
as a programmer because that's

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.850
what math mathematicians in those
days essentially had a choice

50
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.780
between it being actuaries and
being programmers for reasons. I

51
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.110
don't understand. I, I chose
programming and, and, and it

52
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.860
seems to have stuck. So
one of the stories, and

53
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.990
actually this is a story
that does have a modern

54
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.110
equivalent. One of the stories
is the first assignment I

55
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.690
was given was to calculate
some gravitational effects that involve

56
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.930
something called genre polynomials. So
you don't need to know

57
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.150
what it was John GRA
polynomial is, but it has

58
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.700
some factorial on the top
and some factorial on the

59
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.490
bottom and, and you divide
the one over the other

60
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.910
and you get a number.
So it turns out that

61
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.570
it took me about three
months to debug this. The

62
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.720
last, I would say about
six weeks of that three,

63
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.380
three months was trying to
find the same bug. So

64
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.540
it was at the time
for me, a difficult book.

65
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.370
And the problem was that
I saw factorial. I was

66
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.660
a mathematician of factorials and
endanger. You calculate the factorial

67
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.270
on the top, you calculate
the factorial on the bottom

68
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.280
and low and behold in
the computer world. The mathematics

69
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.920
is finite. And at the
time we hit 36 bit

70
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.560
words and you got to,
I think it was seven

71
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.860
factorial and it overflowed. So
it took me a long

72
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.170
time to do that, because
again, I'd never seen a

73
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.050
computer before. And so, so
I guess there were two

74
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.490
lessons from that. One is
that computer mathematics is finite.

75
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.310
You know, that the second
message is when you screw

76
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.220
up and you're young, it's
not your fault. And so

77
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.650
we had him and that's
still relevant. There was a

78
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.490
meeting between me and my
boss and my boss's boss,

79
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.030
and my boss's boss yelled
at my boss for not

80
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.000
taking for not managing me
better for not watching. And

81
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.940
so when you, when you're
a new employee in a

82
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.350
place and just out of
school or, or can plead

83
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.430
naivete the, then the, the
response is it's not your

84
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.350
fault if you screw up.
And so I screwed up,

85
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.950
it wasn't my fault. At
what point do you think

86
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.750
it would be your fault?
That's a good question. So,

87
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.780
so these days people get
responsibility more quickly than they

88
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.400
used to. So I guess
I would say it becomes

89
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.470
your fault the second time
you do it, you know?

90
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.010
Yeah, exactly, exactly. And so,
so, so that, that, that

91
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.730
particular machine was an IBM
70 94. And so that

92
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.930
was a 36 bit machine.
It had 32 K words

93
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.450
of 36 bits, and that's
not 30 to make or

94
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.200
anything. It was 32 K
and it was a single

95
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.240
threaded operating system. And so
the job flow was that

96
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.030
you sat down at a
key punch and you, you

97
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.210
punch some cards or maybe
you, you filled out the

98
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.930
key punch sheet, which was
punched by professional program. Key

99
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.190
punchers. One of the professional
key punchers had the little

100
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.100
finger of her left hand,
permanently bent backwards from hitting

101
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.440
the shift key. So I
suppose that would be an

102
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.120
occupational hazard. And then you
gave the cards to somebody

103
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.090
in the operation, staffs the
person on the operation staff,

104
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.300
stacked it, read it into
a card reader and a

105
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.040
card reader was attached to
the 70 94, 70 94.

106
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.980
When it was your turn
would read your cards would

107
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.600
process. It would spit it
out and then would generate

108
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.740
some printout. And the time
for this dependent on a

109
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.530
variety of things. But typically
it was on the order

110
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.070
of two, three hours. Okay.
So each card represented a

111
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.580
statement. Each card represented a
statement. So at the time

112
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.610
it was Fortran and, and
this, and, and it was

113
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.270
column oriented. So columns one
through five were a sequence

114
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.450
number where a, a label
that you could branch to

115
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.500
column six was in case
you extended past one card.

116
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.710
It was the continuation. It
meant that the two cards

117
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.240
represent one single statement, column
seven through 72 cups. Mason,

118
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.510
I remember this I'm impressed.
Yeah. Column 772, where the

119
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.320
text and column 73 through
80. And it was an

120
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.580
80 column card. It was
a sequence number because one

121
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.950
of the things that happens
with these cards is as

122
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.850
you drop them. So you
have a program that consists

123
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.860
of a hundred cards. You
drop them on the floor

124
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.950
and it's awfully nice to
do see programs that were,

125
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.510
the statements are the order
that you intended. And so,

126
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.750
and so the sequence numbers
were important. There was another

127
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.050
technique we use to, to,
to keep the cards in

128
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.620
order, which was, you wrote
on the top, which works.

129
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.890
Okay. If you have a
thick, this is better with,

130
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.850
with visuals, but it works
okay. If you have a

131
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.070
thick, thick occurred, you can
write on top, but when

132
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.290
you only have 10 or
20 Kurtz, how do you

133
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.720
get enough writing surface to
be actually to write it?

134
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.940
And the answer is you
fan them, you fan them

135
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.750
like you would fan a
card deck horizontally, and then

136
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.370
you would write on it
and then you would squish

137
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.020
it up. And it would
be a funny look and

138
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.150
fun, but, but you could
read it. So that was

139
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.420
another way of keeping them
in order The fact that

140
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.390
they were each a, a
statement is, is that equivalent

141
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.670
to a line of Fortran,
or would you have a

142
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.730
couple of cards represent a
line of text in that

143
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.670
there were multiple statements per
line At the time it

144
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.750
was at most one statement
per wine. It could be

145
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.140
multiple lines per statement. So
if you want it to

146
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.750
continue, if you had a
long one And dropping the

147
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.080
cards on the ground would
be effectively just a reordering

148
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.650
text file and completely randomly
reordering. Yeah. It's equivalent to

149
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.730
that. So, so one of
the interesting things is this

150
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.810
took about three hours to
get a compile airbag. So,

151
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.150
so, so you spent a
lot of time desk checking

152
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.710
to try and reduce the
errors. You also worked on

153
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.430
multiple projects because clearly Coley
management didn't want you to

154
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.620
spend three hours waiting for
your turnaround. So That's my

155
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.650
question. What are you doing
In the three hours? Yes.

156
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.290
Hanging out? No. So you
had multiple projects. So what

157
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:27.110
happened is that you, you
submitted something and you waited

158
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.240
for the output, and while
you're waiting, you move to

159
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.510
your next task. And, and
that's a different card deck,

160
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.210
if you will, a different,
a different program. And you

161
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.720
worked on that and, and,
and, and you had several

162
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.050
of these and you would
sequence through them through the

163
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.930
day. So one, one of
the modern complaints has to

164
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:52.010
do with, with the essentially
context. So just heard a

165
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:57.380
discussion and actually participated in
a discussion where peoples talk

166
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.690
about troubleshooting, the problem. And,
and one of the thrusts

167
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.720
of DevOps is, is that
the people that generated the

168
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.280
problem are the ones that
are notified immediately, as opposed

169
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.340
to going through intermediaries. And
one of the consequences of

170
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.370
that is you still have
fresh in your mind, the

171
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.550
tasks that you were working
on that ended up causing

172
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.890
the problem, because otherwise you
would have done a context

173
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.190
switch and, and, and lost
context. But when you're working

174
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.670
on three or four problems
at the same time, in

175
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.500
essence, then you're used to
doing context witches. And, and

176
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.900
so that was, would have
been a funny comment at

177
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.400
the time. Okay. So that,
that, that's the, that's one

178
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.670
story, two stories. If you
don't mind, I won't ask

179
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.360
a couple more questions about
punch cards. If you have

180
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.520
a 20, 30, 50 card
long application, and then you

181
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.950
have to go and debug
it, you have the sequence

182
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.650
numbers. What happens if one
statement needs to become 10?

183
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.390
Do you have to go
and re sequence the entire

184
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.930
deck? No. So, so first
of all, you didn't have

185
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.110
to have the sequence numbers.
Those were optional. Okay. Secondly,

186
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.140
there were things you did
in terms of sequence numbers.

187
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.770
So you would maybe sequence
a sequence from left to,

188
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.250
right. I'm sorry, right to
left. So, so if you

189
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.860
sequence them right to left,
you can add additional digits

190
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:24.110
without throwing off the sequence.
You could, you could sequence

191
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.490
them a hundred apart so
that when you added something

192
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.200
that might be, you know,
you would add them then

193
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.750
10 apart. And so, so
there were a variety of

194
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.630
techniques that you would use
in, in terms of utilizing

195
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.010
the sequence numbers. Mostly personally,
I didn't use the sequence

196
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.240
numbers because it was pure
laziness, I guess, you know,

197
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.800
you'd have to write them
down or you'd have to

198
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.590
punch him in or whatever
you have to specify them.

199
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.370
So there's another story that
has nothing to do with

200
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.240
computers, you know, but, but
it used to be that

201
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.500
telephones were big heavy devices.
And one of the problems

202
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.620
with mobile phones is that
a whole genre of mystery

203
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.780
stories disappears. I mean, I
can not pick up a

204
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.670
cell phone, hit you over
the head with it and

205
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.330
kill you. Maybe some sort
of, of, of, of metal

206
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.660
poisoning that were lingering really
kill you. But the old

207
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.600
phone court were, were quite
substantial and, and, and played

208
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.390
a large role in a
lot of old. Yeah. It

209
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.590
seems like in the movies.
Now, if you're going to

210
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.060
get bunked over the head,
that's with the blood of

211
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.220
a gun. Yeah, exactly. Back
in the day you hit

212
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.800
somebody with a phone, that
guy was going down. Those

213
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.620
were heavy Bakelite. Recently when
we moved to Australia, we

214
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.860
cleaned out our house and
had been there a long

215
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.210
time. And we had an
old Bakelite phone. So I

216
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.130
showed my grandson, the Bakelite
phone. He says, does it

217
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.590
still work? I said, yeah,
I had an adapter. We

218
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.480
plugged it in. He called
his mother and he says,

219
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.690
mother, Mom, guess what? I'm
talking to you on a

220
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.530
real old phone. I'm calling
you from the past. I'm

221
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.590
calling you from the past.
Exactly. There was a great

222
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.770
video on YouTube recently where
they showed some young kids,

223
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.230
eight, nine years old, a
rotary phone and they didn't,

224
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.050
it just was not intuitive.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. So

225
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.810
we had to show him
how to die. Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.220
We used to joke about
how we thought that nine

227
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.320
one one was a bad
idea, because think of all

228
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.470
the people that we lost
waiting for the <inaudible>, we

229
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.270
should have been one, one,
one, if you really cared

230
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.330
about people Actually is one,
is it one, one, one

231
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.850
in Australia, maybe it's zero,
zero, zero. I forget. Anyway.

232
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.050
Well, one of those is
going to kill people. So,

233
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.320
so Back to the stories.
So, so in 1968, I

234
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.170
went to graduate school and
I went to graduate school

235
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:33.840
at Purdue university. And in
1967, Purdue opened a new

236
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.250
mathematical sciences slash computer sciences
building. I was a computer

237
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.940
scientist and they had plans
to put an IBM three

238
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.260
60 slash 67 in the
basement. So the IBM three

239
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:51.000
60, 67 was the first
commercially available machine with virtual

240
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.360
memory. IBM let's just say,
IBM misjudged, how long it

241
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.870
would take them to build
and deliver this, this system.

242
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.300
And so when they, when
Purdue opened the building, the

243
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.060
IBM three 60, 67 turned
out to have been three

244
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.940
years away from the actually
the first delivery. So they

245
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.380
replaced it with an IB,
with a CDC 6,600. So

246
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.200
that doesn't sound like such
a big deal, except that

247
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.740
you have to remember that
they wanted the three 60,

248
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.250
67 in the basement and
the way they arranged for

249
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.530
it to get in the
basement was they built an

250
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.590
elevator shaft to take it
down to the basement. Okay.

251
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.240
And these were big refrigerator
size, multiple. These, these were,

252
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.000
these were room-sized machines. Yeah.
It turns out that the

253
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.310
CDC was two inches bigger
than, than the IBM machine.

254
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.930
And so they had to
read, dig the elevator shaft

255
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.030
in order to make enough
space to get the machine

256
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.480
in the basement. So these
days you get bored waiting

257
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.990
10 minutes for a, a
virtual machine to spin up.

258
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.110
So think about having to
dig another elevator shaft, you

259
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.720
know, and wait for the
construction crews and the cement

260
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.060
to harden before you can
even start to put the

261
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.860
machine together. So let me
ask a couple of, and

262
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.150
forgive me ignorant questions about
this, these machines that we

263
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.760
waited three hours for a
compile. And we waited for

264
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.720
holes to be dug, to
use them where they were,

265
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.310
they faster as slow as
they were, were they faster

266
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.860
than us? And it really
was still faster for you

267
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.840
to use this than to
figure it out yourself with

268
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.000
a slide rule and a
piece of paper, right? They

269
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.050
were more powerful at doing
arithmetic type of operations. They

270
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:45.040
were especially useful for repetitive
air clinic type of operations.

271
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.350
So, so the reason you
would write a program was

272
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.020
not so much that you
wanted to do a single

273
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.720
calculation. It wasn't like having
a calculator where you would

274
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.330
type in the numbers. The
reason you wrote a program

275
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.170
was because you wanted to
do either very complicated calculations,

276
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.280
like the gravity example I
gave you or repetitive compensations.

277
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.900
I want to do the
same thing again and again

278
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:09.340
and again. And I don't
want to have to type

279
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.100
in the numbers every time
and hit all the pluses

280
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.300
and the minuses. It also
is, is less error prone.

281
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.230
So, so if I had
a complicated calculation that I

282
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.580
had to perform, then I
would had to type in

283
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.400
all the numbers and, and
move them around. And actually

284
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:32.590
that's the story. I know,
but it wasn't personal. The

285
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.280
word computer comes from the
way that people used to

286
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.910
do computations back when they
had adding machines. And so

287
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.280
you had a room full
of people sitting in front

288
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.650
of an adding machine, they
would get a card with

289
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.560
a number from their left
and another card with it,

290
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.950
from a number from, let's
say, they're up above them.

291
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.950
And their job would be
to add these two numbers,

292
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.200
write it on a card
and pass it off to

293
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.800
the person on their right.
And that those, those people

294
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.190
were called computers. And they
ran each program if you

295
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.880
will, twice, because it was
a very error prone process.

296
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.330
So, so that I believe
comes that story comes from

297
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.740
the forties or maybe, Wow,
that's funny that you mentioned

298
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.570
that story because I was
thinking to myself, would it

299
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.730
have been easier to just
find someone with some kind

300
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.130
of an identic memories, find
someone who's in some kind

301
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.920
of savant and put him
in the basement That that's

302
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.020
probably possible, except even in
those days there were labor

303
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.010
laws. You probably could have
worked 24 hours a day,

304
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:38.410
Couldn't work 24 hours a
day. These machines cost $2 million.

305
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.290
So my first job, I
got a, again, that's funny.

306
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.530
I remember these things. I
was paid $138 a week.

307
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.320
That good money. It was
good money. It was more

308
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.470
than professors who were making
it you. So I had

309
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.780
some friends that were college
professors and I was a

310
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.180
fresh bachelor's degree and I
was making more than they

311
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.290
were, but the computers cost
several million dollars. And so

312
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.020
they took better care of
the computers than they did

313
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.430
of the people. And so,
for example, I, at one

314
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.300
point worked in an unairconditioned
office, whereas the computer was

315
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.640
air conditioning when it got
hot, you know? And so

316
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.530
then you go visit the
computer, you go see how

317
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.750
it's doing because it's air
conditioning. You know, you want

318
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.580
to see how your program
is doing. Have you gotten

319
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.590
to me just checking on
it, just checking on it,

320
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.240
right? So you would hang
out there for a while

321
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.830
til you cool off, and
then you would go back

322
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:27.260
to work. So, so, so
I've gotten so far as

323
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.560
Purdue. I did two things
at Purdue. One was, I

324
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.250
was a graduate student doing
research and theory of computation.

325
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.880
The other, I was a
programmer. I was an assistant

326
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.750
research assistant, I guess, as
a systems programmer in the

327
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:48.360
high energy physics department. So
one takeaway from that, is

328
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.940
it true? And that these
were in two different facilities.

329
00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.450
So one takeaway is that
it's really good to have

330
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.110
two offices. So if you
have two offices and people

331
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.210
can't find you in one,
they think you're in the

332
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.050
other. And so you always
have a built in excuse

333
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.230
for wanting to go lie
in the sun or just

334
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.200
take time off and go
do something else. And there

335
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.750
are various times throughout my
career. I've had two offices

336
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.160
and I've always thought that
was an ideal situation. I

337
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.830
think today, folks say I'm
working from home, working from

338
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.760
home, I think would be
the modern analog. So, so

339
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.890
the computer in the physics
department was an IBM three

340
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.480
60 model 44. And it's
what these days you would

341
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.460
call a risk computer and
that it did not have

342
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.700
a full three 60 instruction
set. So it needed an

343
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.180
additional that needed the operating
system. It had was very

344
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.380
limited. And so my task
with one other person was

345
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.560
to write a more modern,
which in those days meant

346
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.430
multi programming operating system. And
so you ask what I

347
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.550
took away from, from those
two jobs, the writing the

348
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.120
operating system has lasted a
lot longer than the theoretical

349
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.590
research that I did to
earn the PhD. So there

350
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.110
were a couple of stories
that come from that one

351
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.090
is they were showing me
how to use the computer.

352
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.850
So there was essentially a
power button on the thing.

353
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.790
And you had to tell
it the date and time.

354
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.750
So it didn't have automatic
date and time sequence. So

355
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.260
the sequence for powering up
was you pushed the power

356
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.380
button, you went over to
a typewriter kind of thing.

357
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.660
You typed in the date
and time and you hit

358
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.680
enter not too hard. Okay.
So, so they showed me

359
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.390
how to do it. They
said, okay, you try it.

360
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.910
So I pushed the button.
I went over to the

361
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.110
typewriter thing. I typed in
the date and time I

362
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.930
pushed enter the lights, went
out, bells went off and

363
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.660
I'm sitting there thinking, you
know, this is a multimillion

364
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.860
dollar machine. What did I
do? And it turns out

365
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.900
the power had failed at
exactly that instance. So, so,

366
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.420
so it was not my
fault. So, you know, my

367
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.330
standard response to things, it's
not my fault and this

368
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.300
case, it legitimately wasn't my
fault. You know? So, so,

369
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.430
so that happened. I don't
know what a modern analog

370
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.960
of that thing. I think
the modern analog is I

371
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.900
was, I was, my, my
dad is we're typing on

372
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.450
his computer and he's finished
his great treatise and he's

373
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.730
written his manifesto. And it's
just, as his finger comes

374
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.040
down hard on the enter
key with a satisfying and

375
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.340
finished blue screen of death.
Okay. And he calls me,

376
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.930
I did, I just pushed
enter. It's not my fault.

377
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.580
Assume it's your fault. You
take responsibility. He was ready

378
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.950
to fall on his sword,
but I'm pretty sure it's

379
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.260
the video driver don't think
it was. You could have

380
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:38.010
been you. So, so another
story this the late sixties

381
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.850
were during the Vietnam war
era. And so one of

382
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.010
the concerns in those days
was the United States still had

383
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.390
a conscription, still had a
draft. You got out of

384
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.660
the draft initially from being
a student and later from

385
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.660
having children. So I got
out of the draft because

386
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.430
I had children, but others
that were graduate students there

387
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.380
didn't. And so during that
period, there were a, radical's

388
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.310
not that much different than
today. Not so much in

389
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.350
the U S well, some
in the U S run

390
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.290
around blowing up things. And,
and there was a computer

391
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.440
room at the university of
Wisconsin that got blown up.

392
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.230
So, so that caused the,
the administration at Purdue to

393
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.260
worry about blowing up computers
in Purdue. And so they

394
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.380
put with you would call
an intrusion detection system in

395
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.650
the, in each computer. And
that was a reasonable thing

396
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.180
for them to worry about
that a computer might be

397
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.940
blown up by. So the
university of Wisconsin was in

398
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:44.100
Madison, Wisconsin, which was a,
a radical sort of place.

399
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.030
The universe Purdue university was
in the middle of Indiana,

400
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.170
a much more conservative type
of place. So the chances

401
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.830
of somebody at Purdue blowing
up a computer were much

402
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.400
less than, than at the
university of Wisconsin, but was

403
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.640
it reasonable? It was plausible
could hit, and people know

404
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.170
computers are a million dollars
or more, right? So if

405
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.870
you want to cause damage,
you blow up a dorm.

406
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.970
There's a million bucks. You
blow the computer. It's smaller,

407
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.070
it's still a million bucks.
Well, so the reason, the

408
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.640
reason this particular computer in
the university of Wisconsin was

409
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.700
blown up was because it
was doing defense work. And

410
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:24.090
so it was supporting the
war in Vietnam, nominally. And,

411
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.810
and so the, you know,
it was a target for,

412
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.710
for being blown up. I
mean, in reality, I suspect

413
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.520
it had nothing to do
with the war in Vietnam,

414
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.180
but you can't always choose
your targets. And so they

415
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.480
put this intrusion detection system
in one of the side

416
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.970
effects of using punch cards
is that they generate a

417
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.590
of dust. As every time
you put it through a

418
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.860
card reader, a little bit
get scraped off generates Dustin.

419
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.170
So there's a lot of
dust in the environment. And

420
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:58.790
so one of the preventative
maintenance activities that one would

421
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:03.560
perform is to have the
IBM repairman come in and

422
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.970
vacuum out the console. So
the intrusion detection system was,

423
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.380
was attached underneath the console,
and it was a silent

424
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.290
alarm in the sense that
you could push it. And

425
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.140
the intruder wouldn't know about
it. So the repair man

426
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.050
is lying on his back.
It's got a screwdriver in

427
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.990
his hand, he's taken off
the panel to get to

428
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.020
the innards of the computer.
He can't remove the panel

429
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.900
because there's this thing in
his way. And this thing

430
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.780
was the intrusion detection system.
So he unscrews the thing

431
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.270
which sets off the silent
alarm. He's sitting there with

432
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.760
his vacuum cleaner, going about
his business and buying. There

433
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.370
was this vacuum cleaner going
about his business. And all

434
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.980
of a sudden the riot
squad shows up in full

435
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.650
riot gear with sawed off
shotguns pointing at this guy,

436
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.720
lying on the floor, saying,
what are you doing down

437
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.170
there fella. So I guess,
you know, to, to, for,

438
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.720
for a, a modern analogy,
it's, you know, intrusion detections

439
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.480
have false positives and you
need to worry about false

440
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.460
positives as well as real
positives. There's a, there's a

441
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.630
great cartoon from called XKCD.
I'm sure you've probably seen

442
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.800
them the little stick figure
and a mother gets called

443
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.120
by the principal at the
child's school and says, I

444
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.430
wanted to talk to you
about your son. Is it

445
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.690
true that his name is
his last name is table's

446
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:29.290
semi-colon drop. And are you
sure that's his last name?

447
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.290
And she said, Oh yeah,
that little, little Bobby tables

448
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.100
we call them. And the
principal says something like, well,

449
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.290
you know, I think Bobby's
been up to some mischief

450
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.290
mischief lately. And the mother's
like, well, maybe you should

451
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:45.910
sanitize your database. So, so
that's another story that brings

452
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:51.970
to mind another story there
was a time at. So,

453
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:57.280
so in this era, computers
were centrally managed. And so

454
00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.100
there was a computer for
the computer room for the,

455
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:10.360
for the campus, the Cornell
university wanted to cleanse the

456
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.410
material that went through their
computer. And so they had

457
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:20.260
some lists of forbidden words.
There was a faculty member

458
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.400
named Fink. Yeah. You see
where this is going? Right.

459
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.830
There was a faculty member
named Frank who was unable

460
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.860
to get any jobs through
the computer center. And so

461
00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.560
finally they diagnosed it and
figured out because he was

462
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.460
on the list of forbidden
words. And, and so I

463
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:41.860
presume then they, they relaxed
some restrictions, but, but again,

464
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.080
this is a security kind
of issue. You're a privacy

465
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.370
sort of issue, I suppose,
these days, false positives, it's

466
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.660
just, they'll get you every
time. False positives are a

467
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.360
problem. And, and, and in
general, in, in the modern

468
00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:00.030
world, every time something goes
wrong in, let's say the

469
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.650
cloud, there's a bunch of
data that has been gathered

470
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.420
from various monitoring and logging
systems and diagnosing that is

471
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.900
an art. And, and one
of the research activities is,

472
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.220
is, okay, let's build a
variety of automatic diagnostic tools

473
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:21.690
that can look at these
sorts of outputs and, and

474
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.770
generate, you know, diagnosis at
least, or at least the

475
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.100
diagnosis. And the problem with
them is both false positives

476
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.450
and false negatives. No one
has been able to satisfactorily

477
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.400
find algorithms that don't generate
false positives and false positives

478
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.340
are like crying Wolf. And,
and so then no one

479
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.700
pays any attention to the
real positives or false negatives,

480
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.710
which means something went wrong
and you didn't, I didn't

481
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.860
even notice, you know? And
so, so that that's, that's

482
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.950
a, a, an active area
of research and be a

483
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.550
good thing to work on.
I was at a hackathon

484
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.910
in New York and I was
basically setting up about a

485
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.120
hundred young women to get
onto the cloud. And they

486
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.340
were signing up for the
cloud and everything was working

487
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.770
out great. And after about
the 30th one, they all

488
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:10.370
started getting denied. We, they
thought it was a denial

489
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.830
of service tech cause they
couldn't get their systems. Couldn't

490
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.560
imagine a hundred people from
a single IP address deciding

491
00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.120
to sign up at the
exact same time. So we

492
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.000
got blocked, made the entire
hackathon and of course makes

493
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.220
the product look bad. And
when it feels really guilty

494
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.170
and I had to go
and call and say, you

495
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.930
guys need to unblock this
IP address, which isn't a

496
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.480
big deal. You know, the
white list us for now.

497
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.540
Yeah, it's legitimate. And, and
there, there are a number

498
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:39.230
of security related types of
activities that generate false positives.

499
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.330
And so on one thing
I learned at this, I

500
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.760
heard it the second time
at this, at this conference,

501
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:53.660
one of the things that
organizations do to sensitize their

502
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.890
employees is a send out
their own fishing expeditions. So

503
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.710
it turns out that the
biggest security problem these days

504
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:05.600
is, is primarily fishing. That's,
that's where most of the

505
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.440
break-ins originate, not exclusively, but
an awful lot of them.

506
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:16.190
And so what organizations do
is they will, they will

507
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:20.120
fish their employees. And what
happens when you re when

508
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.560
you click a link is
that you get some sort

509
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.840
of, what's the reverse of
an attaboy, you know, you've

510
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.750
been poned okay. You've been
calling that, that phrase. I

511
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.700
hadn't heard. So, so that
you get some sort of,

512
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.200
of response saying this is
bad don't Yeah, absolutely. We

513
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.220
actually, I used to work
in banking and we were

514
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.610
warned that picking up stray
USB keys from the parking

515
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.430
lot, and then taking them
in and plugging them into

516
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.760
your computer was extremely bad
idea. And we had always

517
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.590
theorized that that would be
a brilliant way to do

518
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.520
kind of, yeah. Information warfare
is you just fly over

519
00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.660
an implant Place, drop a
thousand USB keys into their

520
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.030
parking lot, and then just
simply wait for the bad

521
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.770
guys to pick up the
keys and plug them into

522
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.040
their company. Are you familiar
with the Stuxnet? Is that

523
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.140
how we did that? That
is how we did that.

524
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.960
Right. That's how that was
done. I didn't do it.

525
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.040
Yeah. Yeah. And so the,
at least the theory that

526
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.700
conjecture is that the, that
the virus was introduced to

527
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.790
a network, which was off
the internet. So they couldn't

528
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.590
do it directly through a,
a USB port key that

529
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.800
was, was, or a memory
stick, rather that was inserted

530
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.930
into a USB port, many
organizations, poxy the USB ports

531
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.920
on the computers that they
hand out just exactly for

532
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.380
that. Oh, wow. Just cover
it completely physical again. Physical

533
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.250
Security, physical security. Yeah. So
I mean, security it's itself

534
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:52.250
is, is a multilayered multifaceted
type of activity in there.

535
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:57.510
Fizzles physical security, there's organizational
security, there's there's technical level

536
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.150
of security. So that's one
of the areas where there's

537
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:04.290
an interplay between what the
organization does, the processes they

538
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:09.060
use in, and the architecture
that you design a continuous

539
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.360
delivery, which is my current.
I don't want to say

540
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.910
passion because I'm too old
to be passionate. But my

541
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.490
current, my current active area
of interest is another one.

542
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.090
So there are a number
of problems. So continuous delivery

543
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:26.250
is, is a process whereby
the developers commit code and

544
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:31.620
it automatically goes into, into
deployment or into production. And

545
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.820
there are problems that come
up doing that, and the

546
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.540
problems can be solved either
by improving the process, yelling

547
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.960
at the employees, by employees,
improving the architecture, making it

548
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.070
resilient, or improving the tools
that you use to move

549
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:52.050
through the, the deployment chain.
And so solutions consists of

550
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.050
interplay between the three of
those and can, and you

551
00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.750
can trade, you can trade
off. So mostly when we

552
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:02.730
talk about trade offs, we
think about trading off one

553
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.000
runtime property against another one
time property, or maybe a

554
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.040
runtime property against a development
time property. But you can

555
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:16.350
also trade off or make
decisions as to where activities

556
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.880
get done and how long
and how they get achieved.

557
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.450
And so you can either
solve some problems with architectural

558
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.910
means. You can solve some
problems with tooling. You can

559
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.930
solve some problems with process
means or all three It's

560
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.480
always seems like the issue
of people is what it

561
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.570
comes down to. Well, people
will mess it up. If

562
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.430
the computers have been told
what to do correctly, it's

563
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.910
going to be someone a
mistake with social Engineering or

564
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.420
phishing or pushing the wrong
button. Well, I, I guess

565
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.990
so you can design systems
so that it's harder to

566
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.710
make mistakes. So, so, so
that's, that's a human factors

567
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.490
kind of issue. You can
design the tools so that

568
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.860
it's harder to make mistakes
in terms of input. You

569
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.950
can design the tools so
that they check, they verify

570
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:08.270
the input. So again, there
are a variety of different

571
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:13.620
ways that that solutions can
be and be achieved. And,

572
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.930
and as not a software
engineer, but as a system

573
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.360
engineer, I mean, that's part
of your task is, is

574
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.240
to decide on what is
the most appropriate and cost

575
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.170
effective method of solving particular
problems. And do you cover

576
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.940
some of these things in
the latest release of your

577
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.700
book? So I'm actually in
the process of writing a

578
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.630
new book and, and, and,
and I'm using social media

579
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.780
to get feedback on it.
So, so the new book

580
00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.480
is called DevOps, colon software
architects perspective. So if, if

581
00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.550
you're at all interested in
dev ops, there's a lot

582
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.880
of material that talks about.
So dev ops is, is

583
00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.570
a movement, which is intended
to make operations people. First

584
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:56.560
class citizens, as far as
software developers are concerned. So

585
00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.580
they have requirements they have,
then their requirements should be

586
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.040
fed in at the front
end, just, just as, as

587
00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.240
the cusp, as the business
facing requirements should be. And

588
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.940
there's a lot of material
on the it perspective for

589
00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.090
this, from the operations people.
There's a, a good book

590
00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:17.350
by a jazz humble, and
the other author will shoot

591
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.110
me. Cause I can't remember
his name of Valor a

592
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.230
no, no, but it's another
ThoughtWorks person. I had Jess

593
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.110
humble on the show talking
about continuous delivery. And so

594
00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.810
that's the book that gives
us the world from the

595
00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.230
project manager's perspective. Okay. So
what is dev ops from

596
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.410
our project manager's perspective? And
for me, there was a

597
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:38.950
perspective missing, which was the
architect's perspective, which is how

598
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:42.160
do you design these things?
Well, I'm a software architect.

599
00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.130
I'm told that I need
to learn about dev ops,

600
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.870
or I need to use
dev ops in, in my

601
00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:51.700
current, in my current job.
You know, what is it,

602
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.470
you know, how much time
do I want to spend

603
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:55.930
doing research? You know, it's
a lot of work. And

604
00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:59.590
so I decided that was
a gap that, that needed

605
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:03.100
to be filled. And I
volunteered myself until my colleagues

606
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.650
at Nikta to fill it.
So we've been writing a

607
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:08.500
book. So when we've written
the other books, the process

608
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.420
is you write the books,
you keep it to yourself

609
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.390
until you have a first
draft, you send it to

610
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.460
the publisher, they send it
out for review, you get

611
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.900
comments back. It's a very,
a time consuming and be

612
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.310
a limited set of review
comments. And arguably it's the

613
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.970
opposite of continuous delivery. Yes,
there are at least incremental

614
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.600
delivery. And, and so for
this book, we're, we're, we're,

615
00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.910
we're doing a different thing.
We are publishing the chapters

616
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:42.420
as we complete them on
SlideShare and people are welcome

617
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.120
to send us a comments,
comments. We've gotten some comments,

618
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.000
some feedback, some, some people
just say they like it,

619
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.280
which is nice to hear,
but it doesn't help us

620
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.910
improve it. And so we
have six chapters out there

621
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.330
at the moment the book
is projected to be, I

622
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.460
forget, well, it depends how
many case studies we have.

623
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.880
So, so there are, let
me say 10 or 11

624
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.930
chapters of material. And ideally
four chapters of case studies.

625
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.690
We've released one chapter of
case study. We have another

626
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:14.280
one where we have, I
think, negotiated with a company

627
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:18.570
to be the case study.
And we're releasing them one

628
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:22.890
chapter at a time. And
the, the book is, I

629
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.900
would say, half done, and
we will have the first

630
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.200
draft complete by the end
of the year. So where

631
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.180
can I send people where
they can give you feedback?

632
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.860
So, so, so I chair
collects feedback. So, so I

633
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.040
chair has, has a, an
option for comments. When we,

634
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.950
when we do a new
chapter, I posted on LinkedIn.

635
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.650
So you can put common,
most people put comments on

636
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.080
LinkedIn, few ones. So I
chair, okay, well, I'll collect

637
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.460
the links from you. And
we'll put them in the

638
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.890
show notes to send people
directly to read the current

639
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.560
chapters and getting feedback. So
we have a website that

640
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.920
links to the current chapters.
It has the, the outline

641
00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:00.390
and the preface and some
other material, but it provides

642
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.700
links to the current chapter.
So yeah, I encourage people

643
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.180
to read it and be,
to send us comments. Fantastic.

644
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.950
