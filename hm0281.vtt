Scott talks with Jeremy Kratz

7
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.290
about the design process. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

8
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.710
is another episode of Hanselminutes.
And today I'm sitting down

9
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.960
with designer Jeremy Kratz where
we talk a little bit

10
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.820
about some of the work
that he's done for me

11
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.950
on the recent site design
and some of the things

12
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.500
that he's been teaching me
about design, as well as

13
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.220
learning about mobile and doing
progressive enhancement. Thanks a lot

14
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.160
for taking the time for
me. Hey, thanks for having

15
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.990
me. I called you and
you do, you do design

16
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.300
work and I said, I
want to quote, how does

17
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.270
that usually work? I know
that, I mean, I'm a

18
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.400
little more technical than maybe
the average person that would

19
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.130
call you and ask for
a quote, do people call

20
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.980
and describe emotions or do
people call and give you

21
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.040
a picture and say, make
it look and feel like

22
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.220
this, or did they micromanage,
or did they paint a

23
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.530
picture? How do you, how
do you start that interaction

24
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.010
when a designer starts working
first with a new client?

25
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.070
Well, typically what I like
to do is I like

26
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.990
to schedule a time where
I can have a call

27
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.180
with them or better yet
even sit down with them

28
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.390
in person and kind of
get their, get their thoughts

29
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.750
as to what, what they
want their sites to do.

30
00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.080
Sometimes they'll explain that with
emotional words. Sometimes they'll just

31
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.420
have other sites that they've
seen, that they liked the

32
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.990
style of a and they'll,
they'll send me those. I

33
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.070
really depends on the client
and exactly how much thought

34
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.400
they may put into it
ahead of time, based on,

35
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.010
based on whether or not
they have a site already

36
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.920
and some changes they would
like to see, or if

37
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.080
they're just starting from scratch.
So it really kind of

38
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.920
depends on who I'm talking
to as to how much

39
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.670
information they give me a
broad, are there certain kinds

40
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.990
of people that, you know,
are going to be a

41
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.230
problem, just even in the
initial interaction that you say,

42
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.600
all this is going to
be high maintenance, and he's

43
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.030
going to tell me down
to the pixel. Sometimes, sometimes

44
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.610
it is very easy to
see that, especially if they

45
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.670
have, you know, just, just
one side and, and, you

46
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.250
know, bad, bad keywords in
my mind, or I want

47
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.830
it to look exactly like
this, or, you know, I

48
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.570
want it to be the
Facebook of something. So usually

49
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.890
if they have a very
specific design in mind, it's

50
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.380
kind of hard to convince
them that, that maybe they

51
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.280
don't want a site that
looks exactly like someone else's.

52
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.280
Did they give you inspiration?
I know that when people

53
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.480
are designing rooms and designing
and doing interior design, they'll

54
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.470
bring in like color squashes
and things like that. Yes.

55
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.560
Some people do do provide
cover swatches, and that's always

56
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.260
great because that gives me
an idea as to kind

57
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.360
of the, the style, the
aesthetic that they lie. So

58
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.070
I do appreciate having those
points to jump off on

59
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.910
With, with my site. I
think I, what did I

60
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.750
say? I think I was
looking for organic light fresh.

61
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.280
What was some of the
things that I said to

62
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.350
get you started? Cause I
want to understand what that

63
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.410
process was like for you.
And when you knew you

64
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.500
had it, You mentioned, you
know, organic, fresh, natural kind

65
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.240
of earth tones, as far
as colors go. That made

66
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.250
me kind of think, you
know, you're, you're wanting to,

67
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.420
to have a personal connection
to the, to the visitors

68
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.540
on your side, you don't
want something that's cold something.

69
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.790
That's, that's very corporate. So
I kinda took those colors

70
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.880
and kind of experimented. And
I thought one of the,

71
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.610
one of the ways that,
that we can try to

72
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.670
accomplish that was also kind
of through the topography of

73
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.730
your, your main title. So
your new logo that came

74
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.580
with the side, I tried
to find a font that

75
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.300
was professional that had a
little bit of personality with

76
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.160
it. And then you'll notice
that each line is kind

77
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.640
of a different style, the
same fonts at different sizes

78
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.310
in different weights. And it
kind of mixes it up

79
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.750
a little bit. Like it
gives it a little bit

80
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.460
of variety so that it's
not quite as stuffy. Yeah.

81
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.440
It's funny. One of the
things that I found was

82
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.680
that people will not tell
you how bad your site

83
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.080
was until you get it
redesigned. And then you're like,

84
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.900
Oh man, you had a
problem. That was it. That

85
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.810
was awful. Well, people are
very honest on the internet.

86
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.500
And especially when it comes
to, to a new look

87
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.830
for something that they're very
familiar with. So they, they

88
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.100
will definitely not hold back
when something changes. Yeah. I

89
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.170
think I was taking a
chance because of course, people

90
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.620
don't like you to move
their cheese. What was the,

91
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.990
what was the issue with?
There was a group called

92
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.120
Gawker that did a number
of websites and they went

93
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.980
through a recent redesign. I'm
sure that was big in

94
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.130
the design community. What, what
happened there when they went?

95
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.340
That was definitely huge. That
was a, I think what

96
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.090
happened is, is that they
saw, you know, the tablets

97
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.940
market really shoot up. And
I think that's, that's kind

98
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.850
of their goal was to
focus on that because a

99
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.590
lot of their redesign was
focused on interactions with, with

100
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.460
JavaScript. So they know all
the scrolling was, was not

101
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.610
necessarily handled natively by the
browser, but if they use

102
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.910
a builtin scroll and I
think that was the main

103
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.950
that people had was that
the site didn't behave like

104
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.210
a typical blog would, they
were trying to manipulate the

105
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.130
way that the site work
to sit on a tablet

106
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.170
device. And maybe people typically
expect, you know, when they

107
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.470
scroll to get a natural
scroll from the web browser,

108
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.200
but I think they're redesigned.
They approached it more from

109
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.140
a specific devices functionality, and
maybe, maybe their audience wasn't

110
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.090
really onboard with that. So
there's when you redesign a

111
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.240
site, there's the design, there's
the fonts, the look, the

112
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.400
white space, the way the
lot of things line up.

113
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.060
And then there's the interaction
design. The Gawker sites aren't

114
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.920
necessarily ugly. So it's the
interaction design that they really,

115
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.350
they failed on the interaction
model, the user experience. Exactly.

116
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.250
And if you look at
something like Google does several

117
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.410
progressive enhancements to their sites,
constantly that they made a

118
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.170
really big one for them
a few weeks ago, when

119
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.450
they, when they launched Google
plus, you know, the, the

120
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.500
title links across the very
top of the browser, they

121
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.780
changed that from like a
white background to a really

122
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.920
dark gray. They don't necessarily
change the way the site

123
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.060
functions as much as they
continually try to freshen it

124
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.450
up, try to improve the
user interface, but they're not

125
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.900
actually changing the way users
interact with the content so

126
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.680
often. So from, from that
viewpoint, I think their users

127
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.440
are more acceptive to change
because it's, it's slower and

128
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.500
it's not as jarring, but
once it's somewhat Gawker happens

129
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.210
when you just load the
site one day and it

130
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.080
is completely different, then people
are just completely lost and

131
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.590
they're more prone to, to
abandon the side or we're

132
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.800
trying to find another way
to get the content. Exactly.

133
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.680
Exactly. Now back to my
site, when you, when you

134
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.380
started designing some of the
things that were constraints were

135
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.840
that I wanted to use
my existing blog engine, I

136
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.800
had actually been putting off
doing this redesign because I'd

137
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.840
always thought that the only
log engine that was going

138
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.580
to give me the flexibility
to do a new and

139
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.690
fresh, you know, good looking
modern looking site was going

140
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.250
to be like a WordPress
or one of the new

141
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.340
asp.net blogs. You know, I'm
using DAS blog and toss

142
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.440
blog is based on asp.net
one. We've upgraded it since

143
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.380
to 3.5, but it's, it's
got some old thinking. It's,

144
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.280
it's less about the technology
and more about, you know,

145
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.950
just older thinking about how
stuff works. It had mobile

146
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.910
browser sniffing that I had
put in in 2006. So

147
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.420
it was actually swapping out
the markup for mobile. It

148
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.050
has some, some hard coded
tables, some interesting use of

149
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.530
inline styles. When I had
come to you and said,

150
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.450
I want to redesign the
site, but you have to

151
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.680
use this existing templating engine.
How often does a constraint

152
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.740
like that come along and
does it really oppress you

153
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.900
or do you not sweat
it when creating a new

154
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.080
design? I actually kind of
enjoy when someone comes to

155
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.540
me and says, we have
an existing system, we want

156
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.610
to use the existing system.
We don't want to rethink

157
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.190
the way everything works. We
would just like to kind

158
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.330
of reorganize the UI. I
kinda like those constraints to

159
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.400
sit in because then it,
the project is not quite

160
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.460
so broad. I can, I
can focus on making the

161
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.820
interaction with the system better
than trying to rethink of

162
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.340
how a system would be
built from the ground up.

163
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.370
So when you came to
me and said, you know,

164
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.560
I'm using gospel, I had
never actually worked with dos

165
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.440
blog before, but I, I
installed it, downloaded it. And

166
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.120
then I, the first thing
I did was, was stripped

167
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.700
out the same completely just
to see what the, what

168
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.990
the raw market looked like.
And luckily there is a

169
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.120
lot of flexibility. There wasn't
a lot of flexibility in

170
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.690
the templates. So it was,
it was pretty easy to,

171
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.440
to apply the styles that
we need the CSS and

172
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.920
to give it some new
flexibility. So, you know, I,

173
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.380
I think it works great.
And I think that it's

174
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.250
going to continue to work
great for as long as

175
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.540
you need that particular platform.
So let's walk, let's walk

176
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.960
through the process here together.
Cause I think what's significant.

177
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.280
What you just said was
that you, you stripped everything

178
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.920
out first, so you, you
installed us blog. I gave

179
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.140
you a couple of weeks
worth of my content so

180
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.540
that you were basically running
a local version of, of

181
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.240
my site, which meant that
you could change the templates

182
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.240
and work, you know, kind
of interactively right there on

183
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.760
your local machine. You stripped
everything out. So you made

184
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.610
like just a white background,
black text. And did you

185
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.130
apply reset style sheets or
what did, what did you

186
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.630
do to clear the pallet?
Sure. What I typically do

187
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.850
in a project, like I
said, is, is scripted out,

188
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.880
get rid of any existing
styles. I always use Eric Myers,

189
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.180
CSS reset, which is a
great tool. It just makes

190
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.540
sure that, you know, margins
and paddings, they're all consistently

191
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.840
reset. And then I just
kinda went from there. I

192
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.330
spent a few days trying
to sketch out ideas for,

193
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.630
you know, how you want
your hair to look how

194
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.070
I'd want the sidebar to
look, but I kinda ran

195
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.500
into a dead end. So
what I started doing, what

196
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.060
I typically try to do
in situations like that is,

197
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.250
is to kind of step
back and plan a little

198
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.740
better. So what I did
in that case for you

199
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.290
is I looked at your
old site and I wrote

200
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.690
down, you know, every link
that you had in the

201
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.660
header, every section that you
had in your sidebar and

202
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.030
then your footer. So I
tried to kind of focus

203
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.260
on what information you had
already and how I might

204
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.440
be able to better organize
that. So then from there,

205
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.380
I just kinda started trying
to group things, draw some

206
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.560
boxes around areas, try to
figure out how everything should

207
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.720
be categorized. One of the
issues that you brought up

208
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.900
in our initial conversation was
that maybe when, when new

209
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.410
visitors come to the site,
they don't immediately understand what

210
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.100
it is you do and,
and what all the content

211
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.940
you have available on your
site is. So to address

212
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.150
that, I just tried to
kind of group your main

213
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.920
navigation into the, the top
areas that you focus on.

214
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.320
So we kind of put
the, you know, the, the

215
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.520
about, or the info section,
and then we had your,

216
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.160
your list of podcasts and
your speaking and your books.

217
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.600
And then from there, it
just really naturally evolved into

218
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.880
that top navigation and then
putting in the search functionality

219
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.520
below that just really finished
it out and made it

220
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.460
line up with the logo.
And then from there, luckily

221
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.090
it was, it was a
pretty standard blog design with,

222
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.900
with the main column bar
and then a sidebar. And

223
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.580
it just really kind of
took off from there. So

224
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.950
there was that one, one
moment where it just kinda

225
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.190
clicked. And in your case,
that was with your, your

226
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.530
main navigation. Yeah. And I've
actually had interesting feedback. I've

227
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.300
had a couple of friends
call and say, they didn't

228
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.240
like the top navigation. They
said that they prefer these

229
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.540
kind of new style WordPress
sites where you show up

230
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.120
and they use a lot
of vertical space and they

231
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.480
have, you know, big evocative
photography or a giant picture

232
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.320
of yourself. And there are
many, many really cool blogs

233
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.580
that have a very minimal
style. You know, some, the

234
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.100
only bit of even remotely
negative feedback I've had on

235
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.140
the site was that, wow,
there's a lot of links,

236
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.620
but I just can't get
my self to let go

237
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.630
of the fact that if
I show up on a

238
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.910
blog and it's a white
background and black text, and

239
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.150
it's just like the latest
article, there's no sense of

240
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.090
scope. There's no sense of
depth. There's no, I don't

241
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.240
know if this person's been
here blogging for 10 years

242
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.210
or if they just showed
up last week. So it

243
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.420
was important to me to
show a sense of depth

244
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.710
to the, you know, to
the site. I agree. And

245
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.560
I, and in your case,
you write about a lot

246
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.890
of technical subjects. You've got
lots of diagrams, you have

247
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.880
lots of figures that you
referenced in your posts. And

248
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:44.070
I feel like the minimal
style works well, maybe more

249
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.380
for nontechnical posts without a
lot of diagrams. So, you

250
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.780
know, I think that, that
the, the solution that we

251
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.720
ended up with works well
for your audience and for

252
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.300
the, for the message you're
trying to get across. One

253
00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.450
of the things that we
started getting into also was

254
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.730
fitting all of this onto
the screen. For example, I

255
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.500
wanted it to look good
in an iPad. We actually

256
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.810
didn't talk about mobile until
later we had headed as

257
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.480
a, as a, as a
goal, but I'm on a

258
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.760
30 inch monitor, but I
did some research and I

259
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.250
actually have blogged about this
to find out who's on

260
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.620
my site, you know, and
there's enough people at 1280

261
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.340
or 1,024 resolution that I
wanted things to be, to

262
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.370
be flexible. When you were
sketching out your design, how

263
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.340
do you make a design
that is going to work

264
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.110
on a 30 inch monitor?
And I was going, gonna

265
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:37.230
work on a 400 pixel
wide phone. Well, luckily it

266
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.810
was really good timing. I
had just finished a book

267
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:44.910
called responsive web design by
Ethan Moore. And he in his

268
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.800
book steps through the process
of, of designing for those

269
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.090
three different areas where you
need to do more than

270
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.160
three, but three is the
typical example. You've got your

271
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.470
widescreen and you've got your
tablet, and then you've got

272
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:03.560
your, your phone device. And
really, I think the first

273
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.130
step that we we tried
to do was the tablet

274
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.230
sized device. And that was
as simple as just removing

275
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.460
the sidebar and making that,
that, that main content fill

276
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.770
the entire screen. And then
from there, it was really

277
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.800
just kind of, retweaking the
way the top menu worked

278
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.950
to work on, on phone
size devices. Cause there just

279
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.400
simply isn't enough screen real
estate. So for your site,

280
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.550
I really approached it first
from that widescreen perspective. And

281
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.130
here's all the information. And
then we thought about what

282
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.820
can we remove as users
screen sizes, scale down, Commented

283
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.520
on, on Twitter a while
back though that sometimes people

284
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.860
do the opposite. They start
with a mobile site and

285
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.400
then they add things. So
for example, this particular design,

286
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.670
well only 8% of people
who visit my blog use

287
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.970
mobile devices, which I think
is, you know, it's reasonable

288
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.430
that it's nice that we're
catering to those people. They

289
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.250
are going to have to
download some of that. Aren't

290
00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.350
they? I mean, if something
is said to display, none

291
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.460
are my video images and
thumbnails going to, to show

292
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.580
up and be downloaded, or
if they're not shown, are

293
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.050
they spending their mobile bandwidth
on that? Technically I don't

294
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.870
believe like your images or
your video will actually be

295
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.230
downloaded unless it's displayed. I'm
not, I'm not very well

296
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.750
be wrong about that, but
I don't believe that's the

297
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.380
case, but that being said,
there, there is a really

298
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.740
strong movement for doing mobile
first design, just to make

299
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.120
sure that at the very
lowest level, your sites is,

300
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.780
is very well thought out
in that you're, you're expecting

301
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.720
user experiences, you know, from
the phone tablet and, and

302
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.080
large screen on. So that's,
that's kind of an approach

303
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.560
where you want to, you
want to start small. So

304
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.150
the plan at every step.
So it's definitely a valid

305
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.950
approach. Hi, this is Scott
coming to you from another

306
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.250
place in time. Are you
using agile practices to manage

307
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.530
your software development? There's lots
of tools in the market

308
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.540
that manage the steps of
a project, but most of

309
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.780
them focus on individual roles,
get ready for a solution

310
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.210
that caters for the success
of the whole team guys

311
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:11.080
at Tellerik introduced team pulse.
It's an agile project management

312
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.680
tool. That'll help you gather
ideas, estimate plan, track progress

313
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.490
in a common workspace. Finally
companies, regardless of their size

314
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.470
can use a lightweight and
convenient tool that makes all

315
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.830
the stakeholders work as a
United team. Even if they're

316
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.190
in different countries by combining
intuitive user interface and the

317
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.980
power server light team poles
removes the roadblocks that you

318
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.280
typically face and applying agile
in an effective manner, no

319
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.700
more lost data, no disparate
systems, no lack of critical

320
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.780
analytics regarding the health and

do appreciate it. There wouldn't

325
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.140
be a Hansel minutes. If
there wasn't, Tellerik helping us

326
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.040
as a, as a designer
who is, who's probably getting

327
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.830
quotes to do mobile sites
and talking to people who

328
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.290
are interested in mobile, or
are you thinking that you're

329
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.020
going to switch from a,
I mean, our sites really

330
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.230
progressive, degrade meant are degrading
rather than it is progressive

331
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.140
enhancement. But do you think
that you'll switch and go

332
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.970
to a mobile only way
to do things? Is it

333
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.170
mobile that significant? Do you
think? I think it's definitely

334
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.450
that significant. The next site
that I do, I would,

335
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.050
I would love to try
the mobile first approach and

336
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.330
just kind of see how
that works with not workflow,

337
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.250
but from here on out,
I really don't see very

338
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.370
much of a reason to
ever do a site that

339
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.060
is, is not a scalable
on all devices. I think,

340
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.420
I think that's definitely the
way to go. How much

341
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.410
time did you spend when
you did your design, you

342
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.690
sketched it out and you
said that you then switched

343
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.420
in to, to a, to
a blank, a plain DAS

344
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.120
blog. Did you, did you
do other versions? You didn't

345
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.990
show me, I wanna understand,
like, did this progress or

346
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.760
once you found it and
you kind of found the

347
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.850
voice that you just kind
of ran with it? Well,

348
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.220
like I said, I had
an idea in my head

349
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.450
when I first started sketching.
I kinda mopped that up

350
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.690
a little bit in Photoshop,
but I just couldn't make

351
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.390
it work very well. So
I didn't move from Photoshop

352
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.070
into actual HTML and CSS.
At that point, it was

353
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.560
only after I kind of
grouped everything together, came up

354
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.190
with the idea for the
main navigation that I actually

355
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.420
started implementing that in the,
in the DAS blog engine.

356
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.300
And then from there, it's
just kind of the, the

357
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.180
one thing that I stuck
with, I kept tweaking what

358
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.450
already had on that layout.
And it just kinda grew

359
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.610
from there. And it seemed
to be the correct way

360
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.200
to approach it. I talked
a little bit about how

361
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:58.560
developers don't, don't do a
very good job of, of

362
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.910
designing. And honestly, the reason
that I came to you

363
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.800
and came said, I need
to go out there and

364
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.530
pay a designer to do
this. Is that I just

365
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.320
am not a designer. It
sounds like an obvious statement,

366
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.570
but I thought I could
do this. I said to

367
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.530
myself, you know, I may
not be a designer. You

368
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.550
know, I can lay things
out and make them make

369
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:21.110
them look pretty decent, but
it just never quite looked

370
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.120
right. And then I noticed
a comment in the, in

371
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.200
the initial blog post, when
I said here's the new

372
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.450
design. And it was a
compliment from another designer who

373
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.870
is saying that it was
more than just a background

374
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.200
image or header. They said
that it was consistency of

375
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.070
whitespace. It was lines. It
was, you used a bunch

376
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.680
of designer designer language that
basically said that there was

377
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:53.320
theory behind visual hierarchy, alignment,
consistency, balance, appropriate white space,

378
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:58.240
color choices. These are all
principles that you learn in

379
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.090
some school. Are these things
that you come built in

380
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.190
with that I don't have.
I think a lot of

381
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.190
it, you definitely can learn.
I think, I think a

382
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.880
good art school, a good
graphic design program will teach

383
00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.950
you the fundamentals of, of
alignment and spacing and, and

384
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.840
the very basics. But then
I think designers have to

385
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:25.050
develop their own sense of
style. So just because every

386
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.900
everything on your page is
properly lined and, and properly

387
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.920
spaced doesn't mean that there's,
there's not something else. Some

388
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.330
step that you can take
further, that's not necessarily written

389
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.710
down and you were in
a book. And I think

390
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.530
a lot of that has
to do with the type

391
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:46.350
of emotion that you're trying
to get across. So yes,

392
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.290
you can learn a vast
majority of it, but I

393
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:54.030
think there's always that, that
personalization that really makes everything

394
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.960
come together makes it, makes
the design more than just

395
00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.330
a series of rules that
you've, that you've tried to

396
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.660
follow. It makes it, I
guess, you'd say more than,

397
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.380
than the sum of its
parts, the whole, the whole

398
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.080
design. Just, there's always something
that you can add to

399
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.330
it, to kind of take
it a little bit further.

400
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.350
Do you do this stuff
in Photoshop? Cause you said

401
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.060
that you went to a
pencil first, you'd be where

402
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.420
you were designing and sketching,
but then did you, did

403
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.770
you mock up? Cause I
know that there are, there

404
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.800
are those designers that basically
do everything in Photoshop because

405
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.730
it releases them from any,
any constraints. But then I've

406
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.330
also heard some designers do
all their work in CSS

407
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.480
directly so that they don't
design themselves into a corner.

408
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.920
Sure. I actually start, you
know, with a legal pad

409
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.440
or just a notebook. And
I try to sketch out

410
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.040
the, the very basic UI
when I had an idea

411
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.290
of, in my mind of
where I want to go

412
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.500
next, then I'll typically you
want to Photoshop and do

413
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.960
a quick mock up, but
I try to get into

414
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.320
the browser as quickly as
I can just so that

415
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.260
I know that it's going
to look exactly like it

416
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.020
will look at the end.
So a lot of times

417
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.390
I've, I've gone on the
road of working in Photoshop

418
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.690
for, for several hours, getting
everything correctly. And then there's,

419
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.800
there's always something that's just
slightly off, like the anti-aliasing

420
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.760
on the fonts and Photoshop.
Isn't exactly as, as it

421
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.320
is, you know, in windows
or on a Mac, it's

422
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.180
not quite the same and
sometimes a small change like

423
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.420
that can really affect the
direction that you go down.

424
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.850
So I always try to
jump into the browser and

425
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.400
start coding as soon as
I have a general idea

426
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.660
of where I want to
go. There are a couple

427
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.950
of little tiny things that
you've done on the, on

428
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.490
the blog that, that surprised
me, the little tiny things.

429
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.490
Like, for example, I, I
had mentioned that I wanted

430
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.200
it to be personal, to
connect with the, with the

431
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.290
audience. So when you have
the comments box at the

432
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.940
below each title, you have
like a little, a little

433
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.330
tiny arrow as if, as
if it's a, a comic

434
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.760
book balloon as if it's
coming out of, you know,

435
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.140
coming out of our mouths.
When, when my, the little

436
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.480
tweet, my latest tweet that
is over on the about

437
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.690
Scott section also has that
little triangle kind of an

438
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.770
evocative arrow. That's implying that
this box is being spoken

439
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.920
by this person. Those seems
like the kinds of things

440
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.980
that I would design in
Photoshop or on pencil. And

441
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.620
then, and then give up
because they're, these, these are

442
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.320
probably like eight by eight
pixels. It's so subtle. It's

443
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.320
so small. I honestly wouldn't
even know where to start

444
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.510
to create something like that.
How did you, how did

445
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:36.910
you do that? Well, you,
you had, like you said,

446
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.750
you had specifically mentioned that
maybe comments, the comments link

447
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.980
was kind of getting lost.
So the first thing I

448
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.530
did was, was, you know,
make a box for the

449
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.070
comments and give it a
really bold color. And it

450
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.700
was just a one off
kind of glance. I noticed

451
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.110
that, you know, if I
had up put a tail

452
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.360
on this and it'll, you
know, it'll look like a

453
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.670
word bubble and, and that
works well with your comments.

454
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.230
So, you know, then jumped
into Photoshop and made the

455
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.500
little arrow graphic and, and
applied it. And then later

456
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:14.050
on when we integrated the
Twitter feed, it's I just

457
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.670
tried to repeat what I
had done in the main

458
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:17.860
bar to give it some
consistency. And that's not one

459
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.830
of those tenets of graphic
design is, is that it,

460
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.530
anytime that you can repeat
an element, you're going to

461
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.530
make it stronger. The design
as a whole will be

462
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.460
stronger. So I just used
the exact same graphic, added

463
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.630
an outline around it, flipped
it over and then, and

464
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.210
then moved it over into
the sidebar. So it, it

465
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.130
really wasn't planned from the
start. It was just one

466
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.980
of those things that cropped
up along as, as I

467
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.410
was working that I thought
would be a good idea

468
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.200
to try. And it, it
kinda stuck. Yeah. It looks

469
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.110
like you did it with
just as a background graphic,

470
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.760
basically a CSS rule that
said this element should have

471
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.430
a background graphic that's located
kind of roughly in this

472
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:59.440
area. That's right. It's, it's
just a little, a little

473
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.260
trick where the, the graphic
is actually a white and

474
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.910
bar. And then the, the
tail is, is just a

475
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:11.260
knockout of transparent pixels in
that shape. And then the

476
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.410
rule that we apply in
CSS is just to put

477
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.530
that background image at the
very bottom of whatever container

478
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.860
you're in and then whatever
background color that container has

479
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.860
that little arrow will show
through. So it's kind of

480
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.200
a, it's just a mask
image. And that gives you

481
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.290
the flexibility of changing that
comments color, for example, to

482
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.710
anything you want and always
work with the, with the

483
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.310
word bubble arrow. See, that's,
that's, that's really interesting because

484
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.340
my there's, there's two things
there that are interesting first

485
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.400
it's, it's a, it's a
clever design, it's a clever

486
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.140
element, but you didn't just
make an orange triangle, which

487
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.040
is totally what I would
do. You made a transparent

488
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.040
mask, basically. I mean, just
the fact that you said

489
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.710
I could change the color
later is really interesting because

490
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.060
in the other element of
the, the navigation bar, when

491
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.710
we came up with a
way for it to work

492
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.610
on a mobile browser, basically
if you resize the page

493
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.080
small enough, and you squish
that top navigation it'll collapse

494
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.660
into a dropdown, which is
more appropriate for a mobile,

495
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.650
you didn't just, hard-code the
menu again, and a dropdown.

496
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.260
You had a little bit
of JavaScript that would literally

497
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.510
take that menu and chop
it up. So then a

498
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.030
couple of days ago when
I updated the menu, I

499
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.130
did not have to go
and update that. So there's

500
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.330
some clever, not repeating yourself
kind of techniques and in

501
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:37.350
the design as well, that
I don't know if that's

502
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.720
your, you being a really
good designer or you being

503
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.640
a clever coder. I don't
think I would have done

504
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.130
that. I would've probably made
a little orange triangle and

505
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.680
I probably would have doubled
up and created the menu

506
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.730
in entire second time. So
good on you for doing

507
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.750
that. Oh, thanks. I think
that's, that's one of the,

508
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.850
it's one of the things
you get from, from doing

509
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:58.280
web design for a while
is that you're always trying

510
00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.090
to be as flexible as
possible. So, you know, using

511
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.670
CSS is great because we
can just have these rules

512
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.700
that, you know, and can
adapt. And any, anytime that,

513
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.420
you know, I use a
color or that I use

514
00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.700
a graphic, I always think,
you know, what, if the

515
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.250
client is going to want
to change this later, what's

516
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.990
going to be a less
work on me and the

517
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.840
less work on them. And
that's the, that's the solution

518
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.970
we want to go with.
So, so yeah, absolutely. I

519
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.820
always try to keep those
things in mind. So kind

520
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.970
of walking more through the,
through the process, you moved

521
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.280
into the browser as quickly
as possible. You started laying

522
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.820
out elements from your, your
sketches and your Photoshops. You

523
00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:38.510
chopped up graphics, and there's
actually surprisingly few graphics in

524
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.420
this particular thing. There's some
couple of lines. There's a

525
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.380
couple of triangles. There's the
logo. There's very little here.

526
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.630
It's mostly texts, which I,
if I remember correctly, that

527
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.270
was also one of our
design tenants. Was it to

528
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.570
be a type, a graphy
friendly template as opposed to

529
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:58.820
an image heavy template? That's
right. Yeah. So I always

530
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.820
try to use it as
few images as possible, always

531
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.580
like for the browser to
do the heavy lifting. So,

532
00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.310
you know, if I have
a border, I'll always try

533
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:12.860
to use the browser order
CSS property instead of, you

534
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.100
know, designing a border or
a fancier border in Photoshop,

535
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.320
and then trying to pull
that in. So I always

536
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.250
try to make my Mark
up as small as possible,

537
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.170
and then my CSS as
small as possible, and to

538
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.830
use as few images as
I possibly can. And that's

539
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.250
just from an effort to,
to make things more flexible,

540
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.310
to make things load faster
and, and to make maintenance

541
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.750
as, as low as possible.
And I've been trying it

542
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.180
on a bunch of different
browsers and I'm finding that

543
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.010
it looks surprisingly good on
browsers. I never even thought

544
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.320
about like this works in
<inaudible>. I don't even think

545
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.360
you went out of your
way to make it look

546
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.940
good on ice <inaudible>. Is
that as a result of

547
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.560
the reset CSS that you
use from Eric Meyer, or is

548
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.140
that a re as a
result of you avoiding certain

549
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.910
CSS tricks that, you know,
we're, we're, we're edgy for

550
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.720
lack of a better, That's
definitely a combination of both.

551
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.750
So the CSS reset definitely
make sure that, you know,

552
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.000
all the line Heights in
the Morgan and the padding

553
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.770
or consistent on all browsers.
But then I try to,

554
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.960
through a few years of
experience, I know certain, certain

555
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.800
CSS styles to kind of
avoid, because I know that

556
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.920
they're, they may be problematic
in older versions of IE

557
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:33.090
older versions of other browsers.
So I have a few

558
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.520
that I just kind of
stick with when I want

559
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.970
to accomplish something. And they
typically manage to scale down

560
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:43.680
pretty well as far as
going back to previous versions.

561
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.050
So that's just kind of
a goal that I always

562
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:50.940
have in mind is, is
to not necessarily do something

563
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.270
that may not be, may
not adapt properly to older

564
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:58.200
browsers. Yeah. It's, it's been
impressive. Actually, the things that

565
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.790
aren't working are some of
my older things like my

566
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.770
code blocks, I think we
talked a little about that.

567
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.840
I had to put in
a, a bit of a

568
00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.390
hack to force my code
blocks, which use a thing

569
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:15.210
called syntax highlighter, that converts
pre's into syntax, highlighted code.

570
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.570
It looks a little bit
weird on, on iPhones and

571
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.300
iPads. It ends up basically
they take the pre, they

572
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.850
parse the code, they color
it, and they squish it

573
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.070
back in as a bunch
of tables and stuff. It

574
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.140
looks great on a desktop.
It looks consistent on the

575
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.040
desktop. It looks weird remotely.
So there's little islands where

576
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.890
you can actually kind of
see Scott through Jeremy, if

577
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.690
you know what I'm saying,
like the site's clean, the

578
00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.130
site's clean, and then you
go and hit an old

579
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:42.570
post with some, some foolish
inline font that, that I

580
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:48.120
threw in and you go,
Oh, okay. There, Scott, You

581
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.880
can't necessarily account for anything.
Especially when, when users are

582
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.580
generating the content, they just
kind of have to, you

583
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.520
know, do your best. And
then if things like that

584
00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.630
crop up and you know,
no big deal. Well, one

585
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.220
of the things that we
talked about on the blog

586
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:07.680
was hiring a designer. Yeah.
People have said sometimes that,

587
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.910
that a famous bloggers are
quote, unquote, big bloggers will

588
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.750
put out a call and
say, Hey, redesign my blog

589
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.350
for free. And I'll give
you free advertising. And a

590
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.970
lot of designers, I used
to be a popular thing

591
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.950
in the nineties and early
two thousands. And when people

592
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.770
pushed back on that and
they said that that devalues

593
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:30.450
design, as like, as a
concept, like, like really will

594
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.450
design for food is somehow
appropriate. What do you feel

595
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:38.910
about that? That kind of
thing? Oh, I absolutely agree

596
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:43.730
with the holes, no spec,
no speculative work movement that

597
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.800
that being said, unfortunately, you
go to my site and

598
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.620
you'll notice that I've participated
in those earlier in my

599
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.730
career. And so, you know,
it's, it's something that I

600
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.340
don't really want to do
going forward. I think it's

601
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:04.150
typically a bad idea for
a, a company that, that

602
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.580
actually can hire a designer.
So they have the capability

603
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.670
of doing it, but they
just maybe don't see the

604
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.680
value in doing that. If
they can try to get

605
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.450
it for free some design
contests, you know, by nonprofit

606
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:23.000
companies that have, you know,
a good goal and maybe

607
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.610
don't have the funding that,
that may be a route

608
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:29.150
they want to go down.
But I, I don't agree

609
00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:33.620
with, with someone trying to
get speculative work just because

610
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.300
they either don't see the
value in it, or they

611
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.150
don't want to spend the
money. So I would say

612
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.060
generally I'm definitely opposed to
it, but there are certain

613
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.240
cases where, you know, that
might be appropriate for a,

614
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.880
for company to do. And
kind of in, in conclusion,

615
00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.550
what do you say to
people who are looking to

616
00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:55.300
engage with the designer about
who may not necessarily agree

617
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.190
that there's, that there's value
there? I mean, how do

618
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:59.440
you, how do you sell
your value proposition? Cause I'm,

619
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.010
I admit I'm the first
guy who went and tried

620
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.020
to do this kind of
work myself and I am

621
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.110
sold. I mean, I, I
will engage a designer earlier

622
00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:13.390
in projects now and early
and often. Well, I think

623
00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:17.500
it's, it's kind of convincing
someone that, that there is

624
00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.280
that element that they may
miss out on, unless they

625
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.650
hire someone to do it,
who has experienced do it

626
00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.780
and doing it. And who
does it for a living,

627
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:29.560
what Mikey said, you could,
you could spend all day,

628
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.520
you know, writing CSS or,
or designing a site that

629
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.920
you may not be happy
with the end result. And

630
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.970
I think really when someone
has a site, they have

631
00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:43.690
a product that they want
to take that extra step

632
00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.760
and they haven't worked with
a designer to improve it.

633
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.970
I think they'll instantly see
the value if they get

634
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:55.570
a professional to work on
it. So it's really kind

635
00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:00.460
of, you know, convincing them
that, that there are improvements

636
00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:04.000
to be had outside of
just these technical areas of,

637
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.570
of, you know, writing CSS
and laying out the HTML

638
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.390
that there, there is that
element that they can always

639
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:15.610
enhance whatever it is they
have. Definitely. Definitely. I am

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.860

641
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.610

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.790
talking to you. I've talked

designed one of the initial

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.820
layouts for stack overflow, Virginia,
and works at a cycle

645
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.790
flow as well. And both
of you now on the
