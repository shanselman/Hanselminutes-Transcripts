From Hanselman it's dot com.
It's Hanselman it's our weekly

9
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.720
discussion with web developer and
technologists. Scott Hanselman. This is

10
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.790
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number 523.
And this is episode Scott

11
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.600
talks with linguist, Nick farmer,
best known for developing the

12
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.290
belt or constructed language for
the Sidebuy television drama, the

13
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.880
expanse Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

14
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.490
And today I'm talking with
Nick farmer. He is a

15
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.340
linguist and is working right
now as the linguist, creating

16
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.820
the belt or Creole language
on the scifi show, the

17
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.240
expanse or expanse. How are
you? I'm great. How are

18
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.520
you doing? I'm pretty stoked
to be talking to you.

19
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.070
I am a, I like
to say I'm an amateur

20
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.420
linguist, which means that I've
taken like one class and

21
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.880
I like the feeling of
different words in my mouth.

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.070
So I'm afraid I don't
have any academic background, but

23
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.570
what, what's your background from
an academic perspective? So I

24
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.340
definitely took a pretty untraditional
route. It's kind of like

25
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.220
a family business for me.
My godfather was an MIT

26
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.520
linguist. My mother was an
MIT linguist. My dad was

27
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.040
a bit more of a
philologist, but also really involved

28
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.000
with language. And I actually
tried to avoid it. I

29
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.120
studied philosophy mostly in my
undergrad, but I couldn't achieve

30
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.610
a skateboard, but, and I
just fell back into linguistics.

31
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.410
Yeah. And is this, what
does a philologist again, forgive

32
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.770
me. So a philologist is
a, it was what people

33
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.590
used to do before the
modern study of linguistics. It's

34
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.880
kind of focusing on classical
languages like Latin and ancient

35
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.480
Greek in Sanskrit, and really
focusing on poetry and literature,

36
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.300
as opposed to a linguist
is just more interested in

37
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.250
everyday language. I mean, how
language is actually used rather

38
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.800
than how we would prescribe
it and a grammar class.

39
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.420
And I understand that you,
you speak varying levels of

40
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.120
varying languages, quite a few.
And I think that people

41
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.800
are always impressed by that.
You know, like, Oh my

42
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.770
God, he speaks a dozen
languages. And let me ask

43
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.840
you this because I, the
last person that I met

44
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.050
who said that they knew,
I don't know, 15 languages

45
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.560
is some famous person whose
name I won't on the

46
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.100
air. And the individual is
expressing how many languages that

47
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.900
you do. And sometimes people
do that. You've probably met

48
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.820
these people at parties and
they try to use it

49
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.880
as a way to impress.
Right. This person told me

50
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.970
that my friend told me
that if you say to

51
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.220
someone who says, Oh, you
want to speak Spanish? You

52
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.540
say, all right, well, tell
me, how do you say

53
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.410
flush the toilet? And they
will, they either know it

54
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.110
or they don't they'll go.
Cause they lived there and

55
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.600
they lived it, you know?
And in French it's like

56
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.570
pull the chain. So it's
a perfect example of an

57
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.500
idiomatic phrase that tells you
whether someone knows it or

58
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.480
whether they just speak, like
I speak Spanish, but I

59
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.540
don't really, I speak Chipotle
in Spanish. <inaudible> know what

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.810
I'm saying. Yeah. You know,
this is actually a really

61
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.190
good conference I have. And
part of the reason why

62
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.400
I think that it, I
try and avoid the question

63
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.770
as much as I can,
because there's so many different

64
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.500
ways that you can define
how you speak a language.

65
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.860
And they're the people who
never took a course. And

66
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.390
they just lived there for
a really long time and

67
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.390
they'll know that. And you
know, for me, I, I'm

68
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.090
mostly interested in, in the
grammars. And so I may,

69
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.210
you know, know everything that
there is to know about

70
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.190
how the language is constructed,
but I didn't necessarily pick

71
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.320
up that expression because I
can only be in so

72
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.730
many places at once. Yeah,
exactly. Yeah. I, I speak

73
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.360
chunks of a number of
different languages sometimes because I

74
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.560
had a girlfriend from that
country sometimes because I spent

75
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.010
a couple of months there,
like 10 years ago, I

76
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.870
had a pretty good grasp
of Ethiopian I'm Herrick. And

77
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.660
it lasted for the four
years that the relationship lasted

78
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.050
and now fast forward 10
years, I've probably got a

79
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.240
couple of hundred words and
I have a really good

80
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.250
understanding of the grammar and
how it fits into the

81
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.700
language tree. But, you know,
if I visited there, I

82
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.710
would probably only be a
couple of weeks ahead of,

83
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.120
of a tourist. Yeah. Well,
there's this expression that I've

84
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.360
heard before, which is there's
two, two ways to learn

85
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.000
a language. One is in
a, in the cradle and

86
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.530
the other is in bed,
but the, the image that

87
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.150
I use for how I
would categorize different languages. So

88
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.250
I have some that are
at my fingertips, so I

89
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.130
really can just jump in
and they're really fresh and

90
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.860
I can speak them without
too much effort. And then

91
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.930
maybe there are others that
are at like one joint

92
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.720
down or two joints down,
which like, I haven't spoken

93
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.970
in a long time, but
if you gave me a

94
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.220
month, you know, back in
India, I'd probably get my

95
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.620
Hindi back pretty well. I
was fluent at one point,

96
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.950
but it's been almost a
decade. Yeah, yeah, yeah. <inaudible>

97
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.690
And then Hindi and Hindi
both suck down. Yeah. My

98
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.960
bite bite come in. They
was like, yeah, a similar

99
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.700
kind of thing. I feel
the same way. My wife

100
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.550
lived in France for a
number of years and a

101
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.220
while she uses it. Occasionally
when she bumps into French

102
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.530
speaking people, she definitely says
she needs about three months

103
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.960
to get warmed up. You
know what I mean? Yeah.

104
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.910
For me, it really is
kind, I re it's an

105
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.870
addiction. I am kind of
like frog from wind in

106
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.970
the willows. I pick one
up and I love, I

107
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.970
fall in love with it.
I spend several months learning

108
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.580
it and then I discover
the next shiny new language

109
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.130
and I kind of drop
the others and I just

110
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.220
going on and it's great
for getting an overall perspective,

111
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.490
but I've never really tried
to get a job specializing

112
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.000
in one language versus another,
You know? And that, that

113
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.300
is a challenging thing because
people sometimes do expect us

114
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.850
folks, people who are interested
in languages to be fluent.

115
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.800
And I think I look
at it the same way

116
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.680
I look at it as
Xbox games, right. Like I'll

117
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.170
say, yeah, I played mass
effects. Mass effect is a

118
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.780
great game. Oh yeah. But
did you, you know, did

119
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.120
you complete it? Well, no.
I mean, I played it

120
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.920
for like 30 hours and
I, I get it. It's

121
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.870
cool. I enjoyed it. No,
no, but you have to

122
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.810
like finish it. Well, if
I have a stack right

123
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.450
here of games, I'm never
going to finish that are,

124
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.870
you know, I'm sure they're
wonderful, but I can't go

125
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.130
for the completest achievement and,
and still play the variety

126
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.750
of games or learn the
variety of languages that I

127
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.140
wanted to learn. Absolutely. I
mean, it really depends on

128
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.070
what your goals are. If
you want to become an

129
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.550
ex Pat living in Spain
and sounding like a Spaniard,

130
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.880
then you should really focus
on Spanish, but that's not

131
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.650
really what I'm interested in.
I mean, I, I just

132
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.540
want to learn as much
as I can about a

133
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.450
lot of different languages and
there's only so much time

134
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.280
in the day and my
brain can only do so

135
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.910
much. I mean, I have,
yeah, probably a great facility

136
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.890
in more languages than most
people have, but at the

137
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.600
same time, that's just because
I spend a lot of

138
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.870
time on it. Cool. Okay.
So you've got this tool

139
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.620
belt of languages that you
can pull from, and you've

140
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.710
got an understanding of linguistics
and linguistic structure and then

141
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.340
fast forward a miracle happens.
And now you're the linguist

142
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.310
that works on a, made
up language on a scifi

143
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.710
show. How do you even
interview for that? How do

144
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.620
you get the hookup for
that job? Yeah, there was

145
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.540
no, well, I guess there
was a little bit of

146
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.260
an interview, but mostly it
was just a serendipitous connection.

147
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.260
I was living in New York
in 2011 game of Thrones

148
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.810
season one just started airing
at the time. I didn't

149
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.310
have a TV. I went
to a bar called professor

150
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.280
Tom's on second Avenue and
I would, I would watch

151
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.960
it there because it had
a really nice, big screen,

152
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.710
good speakers, whatever. And I
think around episode four, as

153
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.830
the episode ended, I turned
around and sitting right next

154
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.500
to me was George RR
Martin. And he had just,

155
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.200
I guess he was in
New York at the time to

156
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.250
deliver the manuscript for the
fifth book. And he hadn't

157
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.040
seen the finished product. He'd
only seen, you know, bits

158
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.560
of raw footage, whatever. And
he wanted to see it

159
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.230
live the same as everybody
else. And you happened to

160
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.940
see this eight and a
half by 11 poster in

161
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.640
the window of the bar
decided, Hey, I'll watch it

162
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.470
here. And he went in
and I've met him and

163
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.830
I didn't want to just
gush and say, Oh, I'm

164
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.020
such a big fan. I,
let me tell you about

165
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.240
how much I love all
your work. I wanted to

166
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.820
really contribute to the conversation.
So I asked him if

167
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.230
he to talk at Google
because I have a connection

168
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.490
there who runs the talks
program and he was familiar

169
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.630
with it. And he said,
sure. So he went and

170
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.620
brought along his assistant Thai
Frank, who is one half

171
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:16.590
of James essay, Corey, the
authors of the expanse. And

172
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.720
then when that connection was
made with Tai, he learned

173
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.840
about my background with languages.
My having lived all over

174
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.680
the world. And when the
show, when the books were

175
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.340
option to the show, he
asked me, Hey, Nick, you

176
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.550
wanna make a language for
us? So I said, sure,

177
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.540
That's amazing. It's one of
those things where like, you

178
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.820
know, a half an hour,
either way, not going into

179
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.220
a particular bar and your
whole life would have been

180
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.960
different. Oh, completely. It really
is just a taught me

181
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.690
to not be afraid of
talking to people and to

182
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.550
just try and meet as
many people as you can,

183
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.520
because you never know who
you're going to meet, who

184
00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.200
can change your life. Yeah.
So the books existed already,

185
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.860
right? Did the language exists
partially in the books? Did

186
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.360
they make it up themselves
or did you work on

187
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.190
the language for the books?
What's the relationship with the

188
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.600
books, the language and the
tools. So the, in the

189
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.920
books, the language is mentioned
and it's sort of represented

190
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.000
in a kind of abstract
manner. They wanted to give

191
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.670
the effect of the language.
So they would use of

192
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:28.220
random words from different languages,
but the authors will readily

193
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.350
admit that they're not linguists
and they didn't know how

194
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.130
to go about making up
a language. So they wanted

195
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.200
to bring me on. And
they also gave me a

196
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.590
pretty free reign with what
I could do. So I

197
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.700
took certain individual words from
the books that were popular,

198
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.520
that they either show up
a lot in the books

199
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.310
or the fans had already
started adopting them. So things

200
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:56.960
like SASA and coping, I
incorporated those into my language

201
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.600
that I created for the
TV show. And the idea

202
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.620
of a Creole was present,
but not fleshed out. So

203
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.900
what is a, what is
a Creole from a linguistic

204
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.120
perspective versus a pigeon? So
there are many different theories

205
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.290
about what that distinction is,
but both are classified as

206
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:21.170
contact languages, which is, these
are languages that have occurred

207
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.470
when extreme, when an extreme
situation has put two languages

208
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.620
into contact where they don't
let the speakers of these

209
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.530
two languages don't have a
language in common. They don't

210
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.580
necessarily have enough time to
really learn the other language

211
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.440
or maybe not enough time
or not enough opportunity. And

212
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:48.140
so something just has to
come out a pigeon really

213
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.140
there's many cases of this.
Like a pigeon can sort

214
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.060
of form, even in like
tourist towns. Like there are

215
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.110
cases in Turkey, have a
version of like a mix

216
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.300
of Turkish and German where
a lot of tourists keep

217
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.780
showing up and they never
really learned Turkish. And the

218
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.680
local Turks kind of only
learn enough German. And so

219
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.280
they, they, they, the two
end up mixing. And what's

220
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.780
interesting is that no matter
what the mix is between,

221
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.840
if you have a Turkic
language in a dramatic language,

222
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.940
or if you have like
Zulu in English, or if

223
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.610
you have a, you know,
West African languages and French,

224
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.680
all of these end up
producing something really similar grammatically,

225
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.580
like there are certain commonalities
between all of the worlds

226
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.360
Creoles. I mean, Creoles are
the, the most fully developed

227
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.650
Contact languages. I mean, a
pigeon Is not quite as

228
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.320
grammatically consistent as a Creel,
a Creel as a fully

229
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.080
developed language. I mean, Haitian
Creole for example, is the

230
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.710
national language of Haiti. And
you can express everything in

231
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.720
Haitian that you could express
in any other language, you

232
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.090
know, differently. Things would be
lost in translation, but it

233
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.780
is Full language. So then
it is incorrect of us,

234
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.540
for example, as native English
speakers to think of them

235
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.410
as being simple languages or
simplistic, simply because it sounds

236
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:12.030
to us like a bunch
of English words, either modified

237
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.490
or twisted in some way,
it is a fully realized

238
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.500
grammatically there are grammar, you
could say something in it

239
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.940
and be wrong and people
will be like, that didn't

240
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.980
sound right. Oh, wow. Absolutely.
And it's just that we,

241
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:29.940
because of our Are History
of associating, a certain languages

242
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.050
with certain classes or races
that we have looked down

243
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.380
on that we will then
take those languages and think

244
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.600
of them as simple, because
it's just really another way

245
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.390
of denigrating those speakers. So,
you know, French speakers from

246
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:50.610
France hearing Haitian Creole, I
don't think they do this.

247
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.770
I mean, some people might
now, but traditionally let's say

248
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.530
200 years ago, they really
looked at the language of

249
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.780
Haiti and said, look at
these brutes in these barbarians

250
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.860
with these simple words, they've
lost all the conjugations and

251
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.680
they've lost all the grammar.
And what they didn't realize

252
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.100
is the grammar is just
as complicated, but it's complicated

253
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.700
in a different way. Right.
Right. Two, two examples. Also,

254
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.390
there's also borrowing words, like
when borrowed words become, like,

255
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.220
there's always the ongoing argument
with my parents and I

256
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.580
about whether it's four year
or four year, four year,

257
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.920
clearly a French word and
four years the English word

258
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.210
that's now officially a word.
Right. But thinking about my

259
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.090
wife who speaks in the
belly, which is effectively like

260
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.030
Zulu, and if they say
like, they don't have a

261
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.830
word for phone, so phone
becomes <inaudible> and they put

262
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.320
the letter I E in
front of any noun. So

263
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.920
then give me the phone
becomes maybe for now. And

264
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.690
then as an English speaker,
you're like, I heard phone

265
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.230
in there. Somebody said something
about the phone and then

266
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.970
an inherit, like a vehicle
or a is <inaudible>, you

267
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.060
know, it's like a mechanized
thing or a machine, but

268
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.300
then these, these, these get
lost hundreds of years later.

269
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.970
And it actually, it was
my wife and I talking

270
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.900
and discussing this topic before
she realized that, Oh yeah,

271
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.330
that is phone. Isn't it?
You know, because in her

272
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.970
mind, that's the word for
phone, which is not a

273
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:16.330
borrowed word. It's the word.
Yeah. And this is really

274
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:21.160
a, one of the mechanisms
for changing a language when

275
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.280
you, when they come into
contact is the, the board

276
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.840
borrowings. So if you have
a word that you recognize

277
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.090
as coming from a foreign
source and you treat it

278
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.440
differently because of that, it's
not necessarily going to change

279
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.890
your language or yeah. It's
going to change your language

280
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.430
a bit more than if
you don't, if you have

281
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.710
now fit it into your
own grammatical system. So like

282
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.330
you said with <inaudible>, so
now you can do all

283
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.930
the grammatical things with iPhones
that you could otherwise, but

284
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.240
if you didn't have that
E which is like a,

285
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.750
it's a classifier, right. So
if you didn't have that,

286
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.460
then there would be all
sorts of you wouldn't be

287
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.160
able to pluralize it the
same way you wouldn't, you

288
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.500
know, I'm not as familiar
with. Right. Right. So like,

289
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.310
you know, he is the
noun classifier. So then multiple

290
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.350
phones would be like, I'm
a phone, I'm a foreigner,

291
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.890
you know, and by, by
borrowing it and making it

292
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.820
their own, and then, and
then giving it a life

293
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.980
as its own individual word,
then it lives as a

294
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.510
noun. And then suddenly I
can do all this stuff

295
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.740
with it. Right. And so
in, in modern Hebrew, for

296
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.670
example, there's a lot of
words there, there was a

297
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.190
project for a long time
to just make up words

298
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:39.340
for modern things. So for
Trying to remember, you're making

299
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.530
me think about the French,
like Lee weekend, you know,

300
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:45.760
they hate rights. Yeah. They
really want to do avoid

301
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.220
borrowing words because the problem
is, is they have a

302
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:54.640
very particular morphological system. It's
the same concept in Arabic

303
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.610
and other Semitic languages where
they have three continent roots.

304
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.970
And then depending on how
you manipulate those three continents,

305
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.060
you can really do a
lot of different things. You

306
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.900
can get all these verb
conjugations, you can get nouns,

307
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.620
you can get agentic, et
cetera, et cetera. But it

308
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.860
really only works. If you
have a clear, you know,

309
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.340
three, sometimes two or sometimes
four, but really a consonant

310
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:22.960
root system. If you borrow
a word like technology, and

311
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.320
it's just, technonogy, it's not
as clear how you would

312
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.570
manipulate that. And so all
of a sudden with modern

313
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:33.310
Hebrew, they borrowed now so
many of these foreign words

314
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.420
that their morphological system is
starting to break down and

315
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.270
the language is actually starting
to become a little crystallized

316
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.330
because of Interesting. Yeah. That
happens also with borrowed words,

317
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.920
as it relates to gender,
you have to invent a

318
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.200
gender for a broad words.
And sometimes it's just the

319
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.410
gender that felt right in
your mouth because that's how

320
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.050
the word flowed Well, and,
and there's a theory that

321
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:59.870
the rapid change of English
over the centuries as compared

322
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.830
to other Germanic languages, is
because of the enormous contact

323
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.520
that English underwent, as opposed
to German, Dutch, Swedish, et

324
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.690
cetera. So, you know, Germans
still has cases. For example,

325
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.760
an English, English hasn't has
cases for centuries. And that's

326
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.290
because the Norman French words
and, you know, Gaelic words

327
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.980
and North's words that were
being borrowed into English didn't

328
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.730
fit into all these. They,
they didn't know how to

329
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.070
put a case ending on
these words. So they just

330
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.920
didn't try. And all of
a sudden, now you've got

331
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.250
English with no case endings.
And did it be clear,

332
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.850
can you explain case endings
to the blaming? Yeah. So

333
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.410
a case ending is currently
in English. If you want

334
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:51.100
to express certain things like
a relationship that a, a

335
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.100
noun has either with other
things in the sentence or

336
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.960
what the meaning that you
want to give it, you'll

337
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.230
use a preposition. So you'll
say on the table, or

338
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.090
you'll say, you know, by
the man, you know, the,

339
00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.260
the, that deed was done
by the man, the book

340
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.990
is on the table. I
hit the cat. We do

341
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.910
these things now in different
ways. So we either use

342
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:16.040
word order or prepositions in
with languages, with case endings.

343
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.040
It's essentially just a, there
will be something on the

344
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.660
end of the noun that
depending on what that ending

345
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.850
is, it will indicate the,
the function of that now.

346
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.110
Hmm. There's so many interesting
examples of stuff. That's just,

347
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.910
you know, if you come
from things in a very

348
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.540
ethnocentric, very English focused world,
and then you learn other

349
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.530
languages and like Ethiopian is
the example the way there's

350
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.810
no really way to say
no, there's just a way

351
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.600
to navigate the whole sentence
to do the whole thing.

352
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.540
And then it's like them,
that thing I just said,

353
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.640
that's totally not true. Or
whatever, you don't really find

354
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.190
out until the end, you
know? Or, and I've always

355
00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:01.520
been frustrated and confused by
word ordering in Spanish. You

356
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.280
know, it's like, I did
not understand that, which you

357
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.020
had said, you know, I
was like, Oh my God.

358
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.020
You know, and that's why
we struggle so much when

359
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.000
we were trying to translate
because English speakers, when we

360
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.160
learning another language, always put
things in our word order.

361
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.740
Right. You know, exactly the
way I think this person

362
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.970
would speak it. And also
English speakers were because we're

363
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.430
not used to thinking about
something like a case ending.

364
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.800
We're really just going to
be paying attention maybe to

365
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.020
the beginning of a word
and not as much to

366
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.970
the end of the word.
And so we'll hear just

367
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.940
a whole bunch of words,
like maybe four different nouns

368
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.340
and maybe all of them
have different case endings, you

369
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.690
know? And then with that,
you would know what the

370
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.430
meaning of all of these
nouns would be if you

371
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.230
knew the case endings. But
if you're not paying attention

372
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.360
to them, you don't know
what the heck's going on

373
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.340
between these different names. So
let's talk about the belter

374
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.010
language and the expanse there's
people who grew up on

375
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.540
the moon and people who
grew up on Mars, people

376
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.430
grew up in the belt
and the asteroid belt, and

377
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.940
they're the belters right. And
they're physically different. And they

378
00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.980
in there have been there
for a long, long time,

379
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:05.220
presumably hundreds of years. Yeah.
I mean, this timeline is

380
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.730
a little unclear and I
think it's left deliberately vague

381
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.090
because nobody wants to be
caught. Having made claims that

382
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.400
seem a little too unreasonable,
but let it's 200 years

383
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.890
in the future. The belters
have been there for a

384
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.040
couple generations, which is certainly
long enough to form a

385
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.310
Creole. I mean, there are
examples in the real world

386
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:31.260
of Creoles forming in one
generation and these people they're

387
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:35.400
living in space stations way
out in outer space. And,

388
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.550
you know, if you think
about the asteroid belt, you

389
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:43.050
have to remember that it's
not just the distance from,

390
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.460
you know, this asteroid to
the sun. If you're talking

391
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.860
about this culture, it's also
the distance of, you know,

392
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.690
the asteroid on one side
of the solar system, all

393
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.500
the way to the asteroid
on the other side of

394
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.410
the sun. So you can
really get long distances between

395
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:04.140
these people and with, you
know, the delay in communication

396
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.660
because of the speed of
light. I mean, you and

397
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.940
I are able to talk
from different States and for

398
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.850
all intents and purposes, we
can't tell that it's not

399
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.120
simultaneous, but if you're on
opposite sides of the solar

400
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.760
system, you're talking dozens of
minutes, possibly a delay in

401
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.520
your messages. And so you're
really gonna get, you know,

402
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.660
the isolation, in addition to
now, these people are coming

403
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.070
from different cultures around the
world, and also they are

404
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:42.930
exploited workers. So they are
not highly educated. They, you

405
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:47.190
know, if they're multilingual, they're
multilingual only in their local

406
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.190
languages and maybe like a
smattering of English, but not

407
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.310
a formal education in English.
And then they're just thrown

408
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.360
together on these space stations,
expected to mine, asteroids and

409
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:04.290
get along. And ultimately that's,
that's the impetus for creating

410
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.150
this Creel. I mean, they
don't, it's not something that

411
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.650
they do consciously. It's something
that just happens. You know,

412
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.010
if you're, if you're from
India and the guy next

413
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.510
to you is from China
and you both speak a

414
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.420
little bit of English, you
know, you'll be using that

415
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.730
little bit of English and
then you'll just maybe pointed

416
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.160
a tool and you'll use
your word for that tool.

417
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.450
And he'll use his word
for that tool. And like,

418
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.480
you'll, you'll come up with
eventually a word in between

419
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.020
or, you know, pick one
or the other. And then

420
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.990
you'll guys will start using
that word for that tool.

421
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.790
And if you do this
over and over and over

422
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.820
millions of interactions, eventually you
come up with yeah. Creole

423
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.700
And you just decide as
a, as a group collectively,

424
00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.380
like, yeah, that's the word.
Right. I think we all

425
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.260
pretty much decided that's the
word we're going to for

426
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.060
that. Yes. And of course,
you know, with, with any

427
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.010
language you have synonyms and
they all have, may have

428
00:23:55.010 --> 00:24:00.680
slight different implications. And so
maybe, maybe for something as

429
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.680
concrete as a very particular
tool, this isn't as big

430
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.320
an issue. But if you're
talking about more abstract concepts,

431
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:12.410
you could have, for example.
So in belter, the word

432
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.140
for good is just good.
I mean, it comes from

433
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:20.150
English and it's, it's just
your everyday, you know, run

434
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.820
of the mill word for
good. But if you really

435
00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:28.660
wanted to express something beyond
that, then you could, there,

436
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.220
there would be another word
which would be okay, the

437
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:37.130
coop, which comes from Persian
and means close it's it's,

438
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.120
it's stronger. It's more like,
excellent. And so it can

439
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.690
be that depending on, you
know, what the social status

440
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.680
of a particular speaker would
be, that that influences the

441
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.920
implications of any given synonym.
And this is, I think,

442
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.590
what is so interesting and
why I think it's important

443
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.030
for people who are listening
and why. I think it's

444
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.310
interesting for people to listening
to think about this is

445
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.400
a made up language, but
you just didn't think up

446
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.770
a bunch of words that
felt good in your mouth.

447
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.850
You thought about the, the,
the, the historic, the history

448
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.610
behind it and the feeling
that it would have. One

449
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.200
of the things that caused
me to reach out to

450
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.710
you was that I was
watching the expanse and I

451
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:19.450
heard someone referred to home
and they say even believable.

452
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.800
And I was like, that's
a Zulu word. They were

453
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.670
referring to home. But, but
do you remember what in

454
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:31.030
Bobo is in Zulu? Right.
So in Bobo and Zulu

455
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:34.420
means, Yeah. And that gives
you a sense of what

456
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.340
a belt or must really
feel about their space that

457
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.850
they live in. Absolutely. And
that's, that's one of the

458
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:44.050
difficulties, is it, it takes
a long time to come

459
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.780
up with each individual word,
because again, like you said,

460
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.930
it's not just whatever sounds
good. Although what sounds good

461
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.650
does play a part in
the ultimate decision making, because

462
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.000
it is a language for
this purpose of entertainment. So

463
00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.930
I always consider what sounds
good to an English ear,

464
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.650
and that's very subjective, but,
you know, it's gotta, it's

465
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:10.100
gotta have something that grabs
people, but even so the,

466
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.970
the most important thing is
that it has an etymology.

467
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.820
That makes sense, because if
somebody is really going to

468
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.360
be examining the language what's
going to excite them is

469
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:25.600
knowing that that everything was
thought out and make sense.

470
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.870
And if you're going to
talk about a language that's

471
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.990
spoken 200 years from now,
you're, that's, that's a short

472
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.730
enough period of time that
you should be able to

473
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.720
see the connections between the
words that they're using and

474
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.680
words that exist in real
life. And some of some

475
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.160
of the times it may
not change very, but sometimes

476
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.770
it could change in a
significant way. So like you

477
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.150
noticed with, in Bobo that
in Zulu, it means whole,

478
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.320
and you know, there's this
idea in linguistics of semantic

479
00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:01.200
drift that the way a
word is used can change

480
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.120
over time. And the meaning
of that word can change.

481
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.220
And it's always just like
a little step, a little

482
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.600
step, a little step. But
if you have enough of

483
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.610
these, you can get something
that's really different. It's the

484
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.510
reason why awful and awesome,
which used to be essentially

485
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.140
the same concept now. I
mean, opposite concepts. And so

486
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.590
that's the reason why a
word that originally meant whole

487
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.980
can now. Yeah. Yeah. And
we could go on about

488
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.630
Zulu a long thought because
that's the one that the

489
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.000
language I know the most
about, but you know, when

490
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:33.530
there's this another way to
express home in Zulu or

491
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.890
in, in the belly, which
is <inaudible> and at Kaia

492
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.030
doesn't just mean home. It
also means ancestral home, which

493
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.570
tends to be far away
from town. So when my

494
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.970
wife is saying like, Oh,
where do they live? And

495
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:52.700
she's like, Oh, she's saying
way out in the boondocks.

496
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.770
That's, you know, I mean,
they live far away, like

497
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.040
where, where we used to
live out in the Hills,

498
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.160
but we live here now,
but you could also say,

499
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.250
you know, see a <inaudible>,
we're just going home or

500
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.730
we're going in. And then
you, you express the distance

501
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.040
and the vastness of like,
remember a hundreds of years

502
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.190
ago where we used to
live. Yeah. That's a great

503
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.730
one because it's an, you
know, it's something that rep

504
00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.660
represents a lot of the
societal changes that, you know,

505
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.510
people who, you know, they
may have come from, you

506
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.830
know, a rural area and
now they've moved to a

507
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.670
city. And that's one of
the reasons why people love

508
00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.130
etymologies because you can really
learn a lot about a

509
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.250
culture based off of how
the meaning of a word

510
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.130
has changed. Definitely. One of
the things I think is

511
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.830
interesting about this language and
the belt or language, and

512
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.690
people can go out and
Google for belter language and

513
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.840
learn about it is the
enthusiasm people are having over

514
00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.250
it. And you're, you're starting
to tweet and different requests

515
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.830
from people about this language.
And I'm looking at this

516
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:58.280
article on our technical, that
just came out a little

517
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.280
article about you in the
comments, one of the actors,

518
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:07.070
Andrew roti, Leo, he played
Diogo in two episodes. He

519
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.980
worked, he said for weeks
on getting the language correct.

520
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.480
And one of the things
that he said here that

521
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.310
I thought was so wonderful,
the way he phrased it,

522
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:18.170
he says, I'm glad that
this oral wallpaper contributes to

523
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.590
the world building. I mean,
what a wonderful bit of

524
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:25.100
language they use, just to
describe that oral wallpaper, because

525
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.440
it does make you feel
more connected to the world,

526
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.070
in my opinion. Yeah. And
that's actually part of the

527
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:36.860
reason why the producers decided
not to have subtitles for

528
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.820
the language, because it w
they wanted to make it

529
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:47.590
that really there's no storytelling
distance between the audience and

530
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:52.050
the world that the distance
that you have is the

531
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.840
distance that you would feel
anytime that you're hearing a

532
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.510
language that you don't understand.
And this is a, this

533
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:02.260
is if you're living in
an urban environment where there

534
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.870
are immigrants, this is an
experience that you'll have all

535
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.010
the time. If you're living
in a rural place, maybe

536
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.710
not so often, but even
then everybody's had this experience

537
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.600
of a language that they
don't understand. And it's something

538
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.750
that is very real. And
if you just had subtitles

539
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.360
all the time, you would,
you would forget about them.

540
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.230
Yeah. Have you visited Chinatown?
And they were somehow augmented

541
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.720
reality subtitles below you, you
wouldn't nearly feel like you

542
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.110
stepped into someone else's neighborhood.
Well, I could, I could

543
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.720
totally imagine, you know, like
the Google glass, but that

544
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.510
it has like Google translate
going on in your translator.

545
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.120
Now that'll do the same
thing. It also makes me

546
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.040
think of two other great
movies that did not use

547
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:44.040
subtitles. Well, first the TV
show Firefly, they just rolled

548
00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.070
in and out of Chinese
and poorly pronounced Chinese and

549
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:51.030
English. And then also the
fifth element, they would have

550
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.850
LIMU go on for 30
seconds. And we have no

551
00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.860
idea what you're saying. And
that helps you feel more

552
00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.750
like what Corbin Dallas was
feeling. Absolutely. It's a complicated

553
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.980
thing with Creoles in particular,
because in any given situation,

554
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:11.010
Creoles have still a relationship
with their mother language. So

555
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:15.210
for example, Haitian Creole still
has this connection to French.

556
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.280
And on any given day,
a lot of these speakers

557
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.640
are bilingual. They speak Haitian
Creole and they speak French.

558
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.560
And depending on the situation,
they will use different levels

559
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.590
of some sort of mix
of the two. So you

560
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.620
can have pure Haitian Creole
if you're talking with your

561
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.340
friends and family, and that
is the most intimate level

562
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:42.690
of the love language. If
you are in a, in

563
00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.990
a court of law, however,
you would, even though it's

564
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:48.810
the official language, even though
Haitian-Creole is an official language

565
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:54.810
of Haiti, the more, the
more formal language is still

566
00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.760
going to be French. And
so you'll be speaking in

567
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.520
French at that point, but
let's say you're talking to

568
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:04.470
a shopkeeper that you don't
know, it's not as formal

569
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:05.940
as a court of law,
but it's someone that you

570
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.240
don't know. So there'll be
some level of mixing of

571
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.470
Haitian Creole and French. And
we even, I mean, a

572
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.810
familiar example, I think to
a lot of English speakers

573
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:18.630
will be a Jamaican because
there is a Jamaican Creole,

574
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.730
which is distinct from English.
And you can hear that.

575
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.120
So the harder they come,
as, you know, a classic

576
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.740
classic movie with Jimmy cliff,
I think, and there are

577
00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.160
parts of that that are
in just full on, you

578
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.530
know, Jamaican Creole. But then
there are other parts where

579
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.910
it's English with this Jamaican
accent with a lot of

580
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.090
words tossed in. And so,
because of this relationship, we

581
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.160
could do this in the
show too, where there are

582
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.630
times where the characters are
speaking English with belter mixed

583
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.270
in or belter with English
mixed in. And it was,

584
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.990
we would always come up
with multiple levels of this

585
00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:01.670
mix. So that at any
given moment, we could figure

586
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.830
out what exact, like, how
much did we want the

587
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.530
audience to understand how much
did we not want them

588
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:11.630
to understand? And it's that
also made it easier to

589
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.940
include a lot of the
language without subtitles, because there

590
00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:18.230
are large parts of it,
which are still understandable, but

591
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.900
just foreign enough, Right? Context,
enough context, where you can

592
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.330
figure it out. One of
the things I want to

593
00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.370
encourage the listeners to check
out is that there's this

594
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.700
kind of this up and
coming concept of the Khan

595
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.450
Lang or they constructed language
and more and more appreciation.

596
00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:37.600
I think since the creation
of cling on so many

597
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.090
years ago and enthusiasm around
that are getting more and

598
00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.960
more people to get excited
about consciously constructed languages, whether

599
00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.850
it be the belts or
Creole, or whether it be

600
00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:50.950
Dothraki or whatever. And there's
also the language creation society.

601
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:54.610
So if you're into created
or constructed or consciously constructed

602
00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.920
languages, there's community out there
for you to explore isn't

603
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.850
there. Yeah. And it's, it's
something that I'm aware of,

604
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.460
but I haven't participated in
too much. I mean, this

605
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:09.010
is really is my first
professional con Lang. And before,

606
00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:14.110
you know, I I've done
some work on how people

607
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:19.840
have consciously manipulated language, usually
in the form of standardization.

608
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:25.270
So for example, you know,
all the official grammar rules

609
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.790
that you find with French,
I mean, that is not

610
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.200
as extreme as Dothraki, but
it is the same kind

611
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.620
of concept that we're going
to, we are going to

612
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.490
prescribe how people are supposed
to speak, right. Regardless of

613
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:43.180
what they actually want to
say. Well, according to people

614
00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:46.390
who are on Khan, lang.org,
you are now a con

615
00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:49.720
Langer, so, or con Lander.
I'm not sure which way

616
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.520
it is pronounced. I'm assuming
con Langer, I think online

617
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.200
Langer. Yeah. And there's a,
I guess if I, if

618
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.790
you don't mind me tossing
a little bit of a

619
00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:01.630
linguistic explanation for why that
may be sure, but so

620
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.290
you have this suffix, like
the R suffix, which is

621
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.500
an agentic. So it basically
turned, it means that you

622
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.750
have a noun and then
you have someone who does

623
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.180
that. So if you have
sing, then you have a

624
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.090
singer. And so if you
have Conline, you have a

625
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:21.250
con liner and that suffix
won't necessarily change the sound

626
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.700
of the word before. It,
it's the reason why you

627
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.350
have this English just to
sing. It's not singer, but

628
00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:32.740
it is finger A singer
on some accents, but you're

629
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.620
right. It is, it is.
I, yeah. I always have

630
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:40.830
to be careful to not
Long Island. Well, people can

631
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.550
check out constructed languages by
looking at the Twitter, hashtag

632
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.070
Khan Lang, and they can
check you out at end

633
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.040
farmer linguist on Twitter, and
they can see you talking

634
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.040
about the expanse. If they
follow the expanse hashtag they

635
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.810
can learn about the belter
language. And I must say

636
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.300
knowing a little bit about
the language, it makes me

637
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.950
just that much more likely
to want to watch the

638
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.970
show. I really appreciate you
chatting with me today. Yeah.

639
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.970
Thank you for having me.
This has been another episode

640
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:15.290
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week. <inaudible>.
