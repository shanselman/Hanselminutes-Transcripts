<inaudible> Hi friends. This is

8
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.410
Scott, and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes. Today.

9
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.290
I'm talking with Thomas hap.
He is the developer of

10
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.590
Axiom verge. People call it
a Metroid Venia application, but

11
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.040
I think that that is
frankly, doesn't do it justice.

12
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
I've enjoyed it so much
and I could even call

13
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.800
it the spiritual successor to
Metroid. It's done everything that

14
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.720
Metro did in so much
more, and it's just been

15
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.420
a joy to play. Thanks
so much for coming on

16
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.650
the show. Oh, thank you.
So the thing that seems

17
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.750
to it seems to be
what people talk about when

18
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.550
they write articles about Axiom
verge is that you started

19
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.750
it as a side hobby.
You, you just decided you

20
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.530
are a game developer during
the day, and you wrote

21
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.390
this at night. That's correct.
Is that kind of a

22
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.490
silver simplification as soon as
much more complicated than that?

23
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.260
No, that's pretty much what,
it was just a hobby

24
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.620
project that I did at
nighttime while I worked on

25
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.230
other things during the day.
Did you think it would

26
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.970
take as many years as
it would? I mean, you

27
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.040
were a dev, you were
a game dev during the

28
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.320
day, so I assume, you
know what you were biting

29
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.810
off. I thought it would
take as long as it

30
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.740
did or even longer really
there was. So you had

31
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.770
no concerns about it being
something you could bang out

32
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.800
in a year or two?
No, I definitely didn't think

33
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.680
it would take a year
or two, just because of

34
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.970
experience in these things. You
know, even, even if I

35
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.570
had had a team probably
a year or two would

36
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.760
be close to optimistic, so
I figured on my own,

37
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.030
it would take many years.
Five was the number that

38
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.240
I thought of, but I
wouldn't have been surprised if

39
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.150
it had been longer. Oh,
wow. Do you think that

40
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.250
people who aren't game devs,
like I'm a dev, but

41
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.820
not a game dev don't
really understand how much thought

42
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.150
goes into games, even, even
simple games. Certainly Axiom verge

43
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.520
is not as simple game.
There's probably some where you

44
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.260
overestimate and some where you
underestimate, I, I know the

45
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.760
general populous, like the non
developer at all populous. They

46
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.250
definitely think games are easier
to make than they are,

47
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.610
but you know, I've not
been a normal developer, A

48
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.700
game developer developer to really
understand, you know, that perspective.

49
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.340
I would imagine it's kind
of, you know, similar to

50
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.050
a software project, just that
there's that creative element that

51
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.070
kind of stymies all of
your efforts to make an

52
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.660
effective schedule because it requires
iteration and doing things not

53
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.610
according to plan Right now,
you were a programmer during

54
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.550
the day, but you were
the program or the artist

55
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.830
that designer, the composer, the
level designer on Axiom verge.

56
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.100
Did you know that you
had those skills that make

57
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.580
music and draw the art?
I did. You know, he

58
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.290
was, it was something that
was a hobby for me.

59
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.200
You know, each of those
separate things for many years,

60
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.350
I knew I could write
music. I had, I wasn't

61
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.620
artists. I'd actually been an
artist on other games before

62
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.160
I was an engineer and
I'd even made my own

63
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.010
little games before. So I
knew I had the capacity

64
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.810
to do it that, you
know, sort of the question

65
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.640
was, did I have the
resilience to keep on with

66
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.740
it for as long as
it would take to finish.

67
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.610
That does make you wonder
how many other Axiom verges

68
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.750
are out there inside someone's
head or 40% done and

69
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.420
have been stuck there. It
really somehow is about the

70
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.310
sticktuitiveness and the, the deciding
that on this random Tuesday

71
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.410
night, I'm going to work
on my side project because

72
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.970
I believe in it, I
think that's very correct. I

73
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.350
think a lot of it
is that, you know, we're

74
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.460
not built to think on
the timescales of five years,

75
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.530
you know, we're built to
think on timescales of like

76
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.240
a few months, that sort
of thing. And you don't

77
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.520
know to trust that, Hey,
if I just keep on

78
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.090
working on this, it will
be finished. And to try

79
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.640
to stay focused on what
you're just going to be

80
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.920
doing in the next couple
of weeks and not be

81
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.210
overwhelmed by the fact that
there are multiple years after

82
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.930
those couple of weeks. Yeah.
I also wonder if, because

83
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.570
you had worked on teams
where people could do things

84
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.810
in parallel, but with Axiom
verge, for the large part

85
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.840
of it was just, you're
all by herself. The, The,

86
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.160
the, the Lack of better
word, the serialization of things,

87
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.170
the fact that there's one
person with two hands that

88
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.420
can only do so many
things at a time, did

89
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.480
you compartmentalize and say, all
right, this summer I will

90
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.320
work only on music or
did you Context? Yeah, that's,

91
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.350
that's very much actually what
I did was, you know,

92
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.730
try to avoid as much
context switching as possible. You

93
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.700
know, even as an engineer,
you realize, you know, every

94
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.430
time your boss comes to
you with it, you know,

95
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.830
an interruption or a task,
which, or even just to

96
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.120
tell you some work, you
know, unrelated to work gossip,

97
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.640
how long it takes for
you to stop working and

98
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.800
then start again. So a
lot of my methodology based

99
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.690
around batching, everything so that
I never had to get

100
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.850
out of the mindset of
doing one thing and into

101
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.090
the other. And that I
always knew, okay, I've been

102
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.750
doing, you know, this thing
for the past couple of

103
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.640
weeks, and I'm still going
to be doing it tomorrow

104
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.420
without having to get off
that task and start back

105
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.570
up again afterwards, What was
task number one, was it

106
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.450
opening something and saying file
new project, or was it

107
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.380
a napkin or a piece
of paper Task? Number one

108
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:38.050
was definitely making the overall
game world map. Maybe that's

109
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.780
because of the type of
game, you know, Metroid mania,

110
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.860
is it like a semi-open
world with a very labyrinthine

111
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.510
designed to it, but the
map also tells you how

112
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.560
much you need to do
in terms of like duration

113
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.310
and how many you need
to make in terms of

114
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.330
individual parts and individual items
and individual tasks. So that

115
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.880
was where I began with.
So I had something to

116
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.550
just get a grasp of,
you know, the very broad

117
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.130
strokes of what I would
need to do later on.

118
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.270
So I began with that
and not even knowing what

119
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.540
specifically, what abilities and items
and features were going to

120
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.460
be in the game. I
had that map and I

121
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.030
had like a numerical list
of like, okay, this will

122
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.640
be when you get item
one, item two, item, three

123
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.360
key points. And I looked
at other games, you know,

124
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.820
I looked at super Metroid
a lot, not to look

125
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.700
at the, you know, the
small scope of like what

126
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.430
the features, you know, how
the jump worked or anything

127
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.490
like that, but more to
get an idea of like

128
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.550
the pacing, how many things
needed to be in the

129
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.220
first area, how many things
in the second for it

130
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:59.500
to feel like it was
a fleshed out world and

131
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.010
not, you know, empty corridors,
you know, so to speak

132
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.160
and to have it be
something that when it was

133
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.310
done, I could expect, Hey,
the player will probably take

134
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.240
about 10 hours or so
to finish this, Are you

135
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.300
okay with that description? Are
you like, I don't want

136
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.810
someone to think that this
is a derivative game. It

137
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.050
is like, you can go
and say, Oh, it's Metroidvania

138
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.860
because that fits in a
tweet, but it becomes as

139
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.670
someone who's played Metroid, many
times it becomes something else.

140
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.640
And you realize that maybe
inspired by it would be

141
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.560
a wetter, a better way
to I'm more or less

142
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.990
okay. With Metroid, Virginia, maybe
partially because even before making

143
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.340
Axiom verge, I was a
fan. So to speak of

144
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.000
Jeremy perish, not the inventor,
but certainly one of the

145
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.580
popular Verizons of the term
Metroid Venia and it succinctly

146
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.500
described to me what I
was going forward encompasses that

147
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.470
range between symphony of the
night and super Metroid that

148
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.500
are both pretty different. But
if, you know, like once

149
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.830
you go past those ranges
and get into the mega

150
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.240
man, it's no longer the
same thing. So I'm okay

151
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.570
with that. I think the
difference is that the word

152
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.760
means different things to different
people and do a lot

153
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.580
of people. It means Metroid
clone. And I don't know

154
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.580
if the solution is to
find another word or if

155
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.780
the solution is to use
Metroid vignette until it means,

156
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.830
you know, something different than
just Metroid clone to people.

157
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.390
Yeah. Well maybe in five
or 10 years, people, someone

158
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.130
else will come up with
a game and someone will

159
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.720
call it, you know, an
Axiom verge clone. Because if

160
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.380
you think about like Mario
someone of a certain age

161
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.140
might say, well, it's just
pitfall, you know, except with

162
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.290
better strolling. And I funny
your character. Yeah. Someone very

163
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.950
much reminds me of, you
know, whenever you first person

164
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.920
shooter was called a doom
clone. And at some point

165
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.620
people got tired of calling
them doom clones, even though

166
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.740
to this day, they are
sort of like, there's a

167
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.590
gun in the bottom center
of the screen. And the

168
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.930
primary activity in the game
is shooting things at the

169
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.700
center of the screen. Yup.
Which, which, which is a

170
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.260
really good way. I'm sure
to upset the destiny two

171
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.900
team who I'm sure put
a nontrivial amount of work

172
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.710
into their game, which is
ultimately just a doom clone,

173
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.340
which we, which we certainly
won't say to, to insult

174
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.850
them. One of the things
that struck me, because I

175
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.140
was playing this game, having
read the narratives that You

176
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.220
did it all by yourself.
And I think for lack

177
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.110
of a better way of
phrasing it, that knowing that

178
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.480
you did it yourself, and
it wasn't a team of

179
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.740
20 people made the experience
better for me as a

180
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.820
developer, because I felt like
I was playing almost against

181
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.700
you. If you ever played
those games where you're like,

182
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.410
you're, you're, you're in a
puzzle in the game. And

183
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.030
then you go and you
put yourself in the head

184
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.250
of the programmer rather than
in the head of the

185
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.910
game. Maybe it ruins the
fourth wall of the game,

186
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.360
but you were there playing
with me and against me,

187
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:27.020
I was there. We, we
must not, you know, rule

188
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:34.550
out telepathy other, you know,
extra sensory perceptions. That's, that's

189
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.650
going, you're, you're a creep.
I was there as now

190
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.520
my re my ringtone. There
was a time I can't

191
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.560
remember the name of the,
the, the level, but you'll

192
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.720
know what I'm talking about,
where I'm, you know, maybe

193
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.690
a couple of hours into
the game. And I jumped

194
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.580
off to the right. And
then I wanted to return

195
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.970
to the previous one to
three areas. And there was

196
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.070
an impossible jump. And I
probably tried to make that

197
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.760
jump back to the left
for an hour. I was

198
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.970
pretty frustrated with you because
I assumed that it was

199
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.000
a glitch. I could not
understand. I needed to go

200
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.820
back over there. And then
when I finally came to

201
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.690
grips with the fact that
you did that on purpose,

202
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.510
and you know, it wasn't
a physics glitch, then I

203
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.300
realized that going to the
right was my only option.

204
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.810
And ultimately it was my
fault and then became so

205
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.150
impressed with the idea that
it was always planned that

206
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.410
way, how, how I'm trying
to get my head around

207
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.210
how you think about those
things and what happens if

208
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.910
someone glitches you and makes
it back into the left

209
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.770
there, They can actually glitch
me and make it back

210
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.840
to the left. It's, it's
a, there's a way to

211
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.310
do that. It is, you
know, I know the part

212
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.090
of what you speak. And
I think in many ways,

213
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:56.220
what makes that feel makes
you feel like at first

214
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.830
I did something wrong and
then you did something wrong.

215
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.620
Is that it's not apparent
when you make that jump,

216
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.130
that you can't go back.
If this were another game

217
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.930
that might have been something
obvious, like, you know, there's

218
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.880
a cave in, or there
is a bottomless pit that

219
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.130
you know, that when you're
jumping in, you're not going

220
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.100
back, but I made that
jump just high enough. You

221
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.220
cannot go back. And I
think, I think that is

222
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.700
what, what's the difference there.
And that's why it through

223
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.380
so many people, but there
is, there are ways to

224
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.160
circumvent that, and the game
does do its best to

225
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.260
account for that contingency. Yeah,
it's it was, I would

226
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.630
say it was an emotional
roller coaster because you're just

227
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.200
going about your business and
you are not thinking to

228
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.600
yourself, I better prep before
I make that jump that

229
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.640
I will never come back
from. I don't know if

230
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.740
I got the stuff I
needed. I don't know if

231
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.510
I'm prepared to make this
jump. I don't know if

232
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.720
I'm physically or emotionally prepared.
It really got me thinking

233
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.470
at that moment in the
game, it went from being

234
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.660
a, a Metroid clone to
being a, an Epic battle

235
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.800
of wills against me, the
average mediocre gamer. And I'm

236
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.640
quite mediocre. And, and, and
you, the, the, the genius

237
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.520
level designer, because I realized
that it was wait a

238
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.060
second. This thing was designed
with a capital D, which

239
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.250
made me wonder how much
time you spent doing that

240
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.780
level of design. And it
sounds like, as you said,

241
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:30.210
it was step one. It
really was, you know, and

242
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.450
I guess it's a very
program where he way to

243
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.530
think of things, but the
way I, the way I

244
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.590
thought of that was to
initially design that, Hey, there's

245
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.990
an obstruction that once you
get past it, you can't

246
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:48.120
return. And I even made
a notation of that on

247
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.400
my map with like a
one way arrow saying, you

248
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.680
can't go back without even
knowing what I was going

249
00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:00.560
to put there. So it
feels more organic when you

250
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.480
see the final design that
it happened to be a

251
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.840
jump. But as I said,
I could have gone, you

252
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.550
know, a number of different
ways I could have made

253
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.630
there, be a cave in,
or, you know, a monster

254
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.960
that you can't get past
that chases you from behind.

255
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.060
Sure. Any number of things.
So Those things seem so

256
00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:23.540
obvious though. The cave in
is such a cliche. Yeah.

257
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.110
You spend a lot of
time when you're developing, trying

258
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.660
not to do the same
cliched thing over and over

259
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.640
again. I don't know if
it seems like a cliche

260
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.880
to you, but I'm always
trying. I always find myself

261
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.810
finding pits. The character falls
into a pit and he

262
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.750
can't get out of it
until he finds the item.

263
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.120
That's in the pit. And
I keep on thinking, is

264
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.940
there another way I could
do this, then, then putting

265
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.340
the pit. But I think
I put the pit that

266
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.430
you can't get out of,
like at least three times

267
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.360
in that game. And it
just seems to keep coming

268
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.560
back. Yeah. The games to
the pit, you can't get

269
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.280
out of the difference. Flavors
of obstacles you put in

270
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.250
front of us though. We're
like creatures that we are

271
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.130
initially in like, fear of
like, I can't kill this

272
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.840
thing. This is horrible. I'm
going to freak out every

273
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.970
time I see that too.
The, Oh, now that I

274
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.340
have this tool, I figured
out how to deal with

275
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.130
that creature. And that's not
a huge deal or, or

276
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.740
the even more annoying, like,
how can I get up

277
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.080
there? I think it was
the number one experience that

278
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.630
I've had playing this game,
which is the there's cool

279
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.760
stuff up there. I don't
see any way I'm going

280
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.230
to get up there. Oh,
I have a grappling hook.

281
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.690
Now I can get up
there. You know? But even

282
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.340
then it took me about
an hour and a half

283
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.040
to figure out how to
use the grappling hook, to

284
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.760
go laterally. Like it, wasn't
initially obvious to do that.

285
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.580
I could go up and
then I'm hanging there and

286
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.380
I'm like, now, what do
I do? And then I

287
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.630
could go, Oh, I can
go to the side. And

288
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.160
the, the sense of, of
just enough frustration to keep

289
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.040
me from dropping the game
entirely, which I think must

290
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.080
be a thing that you
do, right? Like, I'm sure

291
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.750
you'd be sad if people,
everyone got 40% through and

292
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.490
then just set out, forget
this, they got frustrated. They

293
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.990
stopped. I think a lot
of people actually get frustrated,

294
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.970
you know, in the first
area they get past the

295
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.030
first boss or they get
up to him and they

296
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.310
just kind of give up.
Then I would say he

297
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.500
was, if people are going
to quit, that's when they

298
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.050
quit. Isn't in the first
area. Oh, Oh. And then

299
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.550
everyone who makes it past
that is in it for

300
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.900
the long run. Right? Yeah.
And I know this, you

301
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.840
know, this is more like
when, when I'm at conventions,

302
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.270
you know, I'm sort of
only seeing the people that

303
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.700
are gamers and will have
played every game. They owned

304
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.090
a completion or not played
them at all. Cause they're

305
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.520
in the backlog. But when
I talked to my friends

306
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.950
and family, it always seems
to be like, they got

307
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.710
up to the first boss,
they got up or they

308
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.680
got up to the second
boss and then they stopped

309
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.030
and they, they always say
something like, can you make

310
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.360
next game easier? But I
assume that you didn't make

311
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.220
the game for them. Do
you feel bad about that?

312
00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.860
Do you have telemetry that
it phones home into some

313
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.950
mobile app back in, You
don't have tell them telemetry

314
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.290
or anything like that? I
have friends who have that

315
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:08.540
and I may ask to
borrow that code. Yeah. Just,

316
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.520
you know, so I can
get a better handle on

317
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.450
things and Oh my God,
I can't tell you too

318
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.550
much. But you know, the
chasm team, I'm, I'm friends

319
00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.550
with them and they, they
literally have a graph with

320
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.990
spikes showing where people like
die the most and, or,

321
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.770
or have spend the most
time on combat. And they

322
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.230
use this graph. That's like
a, basically, if you could

323
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.740
imagine the zero on the
left, half of the graph

324
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.260
is the start of the
first low one, 100 is

325
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.360
like the end of the
last level and all these

326
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.880
spikes in between. And they,
they use it to try

327
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.970
and get it to be
the cadets that they want

328
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.440
it to be at. And,
but I'm, I'm more like

329
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.920
I just try to generally
get it to feel good

330
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.620
and watch people play at
conventions or wherever I can,

331
00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.150
you know, get feedback. Do
you have any sense that,

332
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.300
that There is some percentage,
like it's a sales funnel,

333
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.890
right? They've bought the game,
but now they're in the

334
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.220
game, do 3% of people
win and make it to

335
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.730
the end. You know, I
don't know. You know, how

336
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.410
you could find would be
to hop onto, say steam

337
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.490
and look at the trophies.
They usually have a percentage

338
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.970
and Sony PlayStation has the
same, same thing. That's interesting

339
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.280
that you say that because
there has been some, a

340
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.770
new kind of achievements on
Xbox called rare achievements, and

341
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.310
you'll find yourself going and
saying, Oh wow, 4% of

342
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:44.330
people got this. And that's
a small, a small number.

343
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.880
Here we go. I'm looking
at the Axiom verge global

344
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.630
gameplay stats. And it looks
like 77% of people make

345
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.340
it past the first boss.
And it just goes all

346
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.570
the way down to the
end, 0.7% speed, run it

347
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:04.220
0.8% completed in under four
hours. And a 3% of

348
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.520
people make it through in
hard. That is pretty, I

349
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.550
guess, trophies as telemetry works
pretty well. Well, it doesn't

350
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.090
it. And it does. And
you know, when you consider

351
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:18.920
like just how this is
kind of hidden from the

352
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.210
consumer, but especially for consoles,
doing any kind of networking

353
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:27.920
is always just this to
me, it's this like headache

354
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.760
fiasco. Cause you have to
set up everything on the

355
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.770
back end. It isn't like
you just make your server

356
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.680
and it does what it
does. It's more like you

357
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.740
have to register different things
with the, you know, with

358
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.900
the, with the Sony or
Nintendo or Microsoft and set

359
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.170
up things on their end.
So they know about your

360
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:54.040
server and it's authenticated with
them somehow. And trophies and

361
00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.920
achievements are one of the
easier things, because even though

362
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.630
they are networked, they, they
want you to use them.

363
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.100
So they make that barrier,
the easiest for you to

364
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.970
pass. So me not having
to do extra work like

365
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.200
that is always a bonus.
That makes sense. So that

366
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.560
brings up an interesting question
from a development perspective, when

367
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.540
you sat down and you
wrote this, what is it

368
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.260
written in C sharp. So
it's written in C sharp.

369
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.340
So it uses unity. No,
he uses a thing called

370
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.970
mano game. Mm. Mano game.
Okay. And mano game gives

371
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.160
you quite a bit of
reach Moto game, lets you,

372
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.050
you know, as an open
source project and use his

373
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.620
motto in the runtime, lets
you basically go anywhere you

374
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.950
could. How do you ultimately
pick that last percent and

375
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.750
say, all right, I've written
a motto game. I'm going

376
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.850
to compile, it runs on
windows. Now I want it

377
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.080
to go on PSVT or,
Or switch or whatever. So

378
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.320
it's an interesting long convoluted
tale because I originally I'd

379
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.550
written Axiom verge for X
and a for the Xbox

380
00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.150
three 60. But you know,
around the time that I

381
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.530
was like trying to shop
the game around, that was

382
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.930
when the Xbox one came
out in the PlayStation, four

383
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.550
came out and Microsoft sort
of disavowed X and a,

384
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.930
and they wouldn't support it.
But Sony had worked out

385
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:21.690
a deal with the, the
mano game developers as well

386
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:26.580
as the mano develop owners,
I guess, Xamarin, I think

387
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.350
they're now owned by Microsoft,
but at the time they

388
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:33.150
were separate and came together
with a solution to ports

389
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.800
X and a games for
the PlayStation four. And that's

390
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.980
how I ended up using
mano and it's inter or

391
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:45.990
mano game. And it's interesting
because mano game right now

392
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:51.990
like supports many platforms. But
at the beginning, you know,

393
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.250
it's only like PlayStation four
was the only console that

394
00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.060
it supported. And I was
one of the very first

395
00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.900
to ever use it in
that capacity. And it, it

396
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.410
kept on going like that.
Like Axiom verge, I believe

397
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.950
was the first mano game
game to be on Vita.

398
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.670
And for that solution, you
know, just for Axiom verge,

399
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.390
the mano game team made
a special cross compiler that

400
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.720
would cross compile from C
sharp to C plus plus

401
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:25.110
for Vita. And then the
same thing happened for the

402
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.620
Xbox one when it came
to be to, or Xbox

403
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.000
one, Axiom Berge was the
first or one of the

404
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.410
first to use model game
on Xbox one. And then

405
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.780
the switch, it was the
first or one of the

406
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.990
first to come out there
using mano game. And at

407
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.650
step Tom Spillman and his
team at CIC head games

408
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:52.460
basically had to make another
port. You know, I poured

409
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.680
it, they poured, it actually
emerged, but they also had

410
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.860
to port their in their
library's mano game to each

411
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.840
of these consoles. And now
it's very versatile and it's

412
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.390
something you can say, yeah,
this is definitely good. It's

413
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.580
one of the few that
works on everything, you know,

414
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.610
unity being the other and
C plus plus by itself

415
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.580
being of course usable and
everything. So it sounds like

416
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.520
in the process of developing
Axiom verge and pushing mano

417
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.730
game to the, you know,
you bust basically broke the

418
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.220
door open for other people
who are now able to

419
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.560
use it on switch and
all these other things. I

420
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.260
think it's, it wasn't just
that it was me. It

421
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.380
was also the knowledge that
like, Hey, you know, there's

422
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.750
Axiom Berg, and then there's
all these other developers that

423
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.540
started off with X and
a, and this system, you

424
00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.410
know, Stardew Valley helped a
lot with that too. I

425
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.500
think that they were sort
of the Genesis of the

426
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.980
switch push. Cause I remember
I can probably say this

427
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.130
now like way back a
year ago, even I think

428
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.800
Tom's like was, was saying
to me like, yeah, we've

429
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.410
we have to port to
switch because of Stardew Valley.

430
00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.590
And I don't know what
went into that, but I

431
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.290
know that, you know, once
you have so many people

432
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.630
using the engine, it's just
like, you need to get

433
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.780
it just for the sake
of profitability of your marketplace.

434
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.820
So that was how that
happened. And I think the

435
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.330
Genesis of that probably goes
back to Sony taking that

436
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.490
risk and saying like, Hey,
we want to bet on

437
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.650
Indies and this is how
we're going to do it.

438
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.570
Yeah. It seems like this
is like the, there's a

439
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.750
Renaissance in gaming right now.
And the Indies, like after

440
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.150
a couple of false starts
are actually starting to get

441
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.600
the respect and the reach
that they deserve. And we,

442
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.060
as the gamers and as
someone I'm a huge fan

443
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.110
of the switch, like the
switch is awesome. Right. It's

444
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.930
fantastic. And I just didn't
even imagine that it was

445
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.880
going to get as fantastic
as it did so quickly,

446
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.950
but we were, I remember
when we first bought it,

447
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.590
we're like, Oh, there's only
five games. And now there

448
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:54.040
is a huge library and
I would say 60, 70%

449
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.510
of it is indie games.
Yeah. It's, it's definitely been

450
00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.630
a race too, because I
think even before the switch

451
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.470
came out, if you were
in any developer, you were

452
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.210
like, this is going to
be the thing for me,

453
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.630
you know, triple a developers.
I don't know what they

454
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.700
were thinking, but I know
all my indie friends were

455
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.630
like, yeah, this like portable,
giant screen Vieta basically, you

456
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:21.250
know, that also works on
a TV is what I

457
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.350
want to be on. And
I think there was even

458
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.240
like a large degree of
so many people trying to

459
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.200
get in so quickly that
it actually slowed things down.

460
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.150
Like, you know, the, the
chip production, I recall they

461
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.870
were having issues like actually
getting the factory to produce

462
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.970
them fast enough and you
for the ROMs and then

463
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:54.600
like getting everyone, you know,
approved. And like whenever we

464
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.140
go through the QA process,
it seems to take, I

465
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.840
feel like it's been taking
a lot longer than for

466
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.080
other platforms. And I think
it's just because there's so

467
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.570
many big games like coming
through, you know, start you

468
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.930
in and Sonic and whatever,
like are all like, yeah,

469
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.910
we've got to get it
out before black Friday. But

470
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.220
yeah, it's definitely the thing
in November is going to

471
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.400
be the time that all
these awesome games, you know,

472
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.690
marry you. But in addition,
like so many indie games

473
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:31.010
will, will be out by
then. I'm sure. So it

474
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.800
sounds like you have had
a fantastic experience with mano

475
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.170
game in general. Like you
have no complaints. And do

476
00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.850
you think that that is
if you want the widest

477
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.220
re release for a game
like that is a framework

478
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:51.320
you can bet on? I
think so. I'm probably the

479
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.830
one for the widest release
at this point is unity.

480
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.020
I mean, if you're not
going to do C plus

481
00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.660
plus I think for an
India, I think C plus

482
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.200
plus isn't as worth it.
Unity would probably be the

483
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.300
one I would do if
I was like starting from

484
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.770
scratch. But when you think
back to like 2009, when

485
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.380
I started coding, actually unity
was not the same thing

486
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.180
that it is now. So
it wasn't an option for

487
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.480
me. Right. But in both
instances, you're using C sharp

488
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.360
and.net. So when you're writing
Axiom verge, are you thinking

489
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.630
about memory management? Are you
thinking, Oh, I'm not gonna

490
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.960
be able to do this.
And I switch is not,

491
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.870
doesn't have enough power Or
I'll never be able to

492
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.530
port it to whatever, because
memory, I do to a

493
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:37.070
degree, you know, I had
a friend, you know, also

494
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.750
a game developer and he
said the way to think

495
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.200
about C-sharp for games is
to pretend that it C

496
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.360
plus plus allocate everything you
need. Like at the time

497
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.610
you need it, like allocate
all your particles and everything

498
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.360
in a big batch in
advance, and then have a

499
00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.710
manager that doles out the
all already allocated memory in

500
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.680
your game and then release
at the end of the

501
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.910
stage kind of thing, because
it, it does come up.

502
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.850
You definitely don't want there
to be garbage collection in

503
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.370
the middle of a stage
of a game. You know,

504
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.640
while you're shooting monsters, you
don't want your bullets to

505
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.330
accumulate gradually. And just that
one bullet pushes it over.

506
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.220
And then all of a
sudden, the game pauses for,

507
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.520
you know, a few frames,
wild, garbage collecting, and the

508
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.240
player is gonna blame that
for why they died and

509
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.300
probably be right. Yeah. That
makes sense. I see. So

510
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.400
that moment where you switched
to the next stage or

511
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.920
the next cut scene that
fade to black, that's your

512
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.920
perfect time to go. Yeah.
And you, you, you need

513
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.430
to be more and more
careful of that. You know,

514
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:44.920
the garbage that comes that
you get on say the

515
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.460
PC version of sharp is
much better than the garbage

516
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.080
collection that comes with Xamarin
mano game, for instance. And

517
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:57.520
so once you start putting
the consoles that garbage collection

518
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.600
hits you longer and harder
than before, so you become

519
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.500
much more aware of it.
And for Vita was definitely

520
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.740
the biggest challenge of all
of them because it had

521
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:14.740
the least memory and Tom
Spillman, the person who did

522
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.770
that, that port for me,
ended up doing a lot

523
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.700
of optimizations to how I
stored level data, how I

524
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.890
stored this and that. And
then I ended up making

525
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.280
changes to the PC version
and then, you know, helping

526
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.770
him to merge my new
code over, just so that

527
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.150
I think I rewrote the
whole projectile engine just to

528
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.410
do that thing where everything
is allocated in advance in

529
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.650
memory. And I just Dole
out say the index to

530
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:46.750
the next thing, as opposed
to actually using something that

531
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.950
the garbage collector would see
When you say something like

532
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.650
rewrote, the whole projectile engine,
I think to myself, well,

533
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.660
how do I know as
a gamer, or do you

534
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.460
ever have to think about
it as the developer? Like

535
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.880
it behaves differently on you
than it does on PlayStation

536
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.610
four or the gameplay or
the physics or the jumping

537
00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.720
or whatever is X number
of pixels different because of,

538
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.720
you know, you're standing on
top of this framework and

539
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.390
you're counting on this language,
in this runtime to do

540
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.960
stuff for you, how complete
is the layer of abstraction

541
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.940
that you sit on and
how reliable is it that

542
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.000
it, that Axiom verge has
the same feel and the

543
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.040
same vibe on every platform.
I'd say, you know, due

544
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.930
to the miracle of object
oriented programming, that's, it's, it's

545
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.570
very hidden from, from the
player. You know, you have

546
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:38.670
your, you know, your physics
object, your, you know, projectile

547
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.900
class and it is the
black box that always behave

548
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:49.080
the same way, regardless of
how well, how we had

549
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.830
to change the implementation underneath.
So, you know, even though

550
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.740
for example, the, we, you
version was actually done by

551
00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.360
different porting company, completely converted
to C plus plus, but

552
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.880
it looks identical to the
switch version that was done

553
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.010
by a different person with
different, you know, different coding

554
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:15.230
language. I think you just,
as long as you're, you're

555
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.950
careful and you did, you
know, you encapsulated everything properly,

556
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.120
you should be okay. Higher
level game concepts tend not

557
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.480
to be the things that
are affected are where the,

558
00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.620
the physical hardware of the
system, how many buttons it

559
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.590
has, whether it needs a
touch screen, whether it has

560
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:39.180
a secondary screen, those are
the things that really change

561
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.380
and can, you know, throw
a wrench in your gears.

562
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.980
So you've been working on
this since 2009, 2010. And

563
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.220
now here we are seven
years later, you're on PlayStation

564
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.030
four windows, Mac, Linux, Vita.
We, you X-Box one. And

565
00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:01.070
my favorite port, the ultimate
port is Nintendo switch. What's

566
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.340
next? Are you gonna just
spend time with the family

567
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.010
and or is there an
Axiom verge to coming someday?

568
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.480
Yeah, there's, there's an Axiom
verge there. Well, there's another

569
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.900
game coming in in the
pipeline. I'm not sure I

570
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.400
can say what it is.
Dan Aleman is always threatening

571
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.530
to kill me. If, if
I talk too much about

572
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:23.960
it, but I'm, I'm working
on the other game, you

573
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.660
know, I can never stop.
I don't know how much

574
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.920
your, your listeners would have
followed the history, but my,

575
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:36.920
my son is disabled and
his livelihood depends on, on

576
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.380
me. Somehow being able to
come up with the millions

577
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.590
of dollars that will be
needed for him to live

578
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.690
to a ripe old age
of 90 long after I'm

579
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:50.780
gone. So I can never
really stop working w which

580
00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.220
is, you know, it isn't
a bad thing. I would

581
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.580
go insane if I did
that anyway. Yeah. Well, people

582
00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.510
can check out Axiom verge@axiomverge.com.
You can buy it on

583
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.310
the humble bundle. You can
buy it on steam. It

584
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:05.540
is everywhere that games are
created. And I think that

585
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.210
I cannot recommend this game
enough. It is a joy

586
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.220
and I wish you all
the best in future success

587
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.470
or no, thank you. This
has been another episode of

588
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.840
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
