Hi everyone. This is Scott

8
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.380
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today. I

9
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.500
am lucky to have Gary
Nissenbaum on the show from

10
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.880
GD and law.com. Gary is
a managing attorney and the

11
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.940
principal of the initial bond
law group. And he's an

12
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.490
internet law attorney. We have
a lot of programmers on

13
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.440
the show, but I haven't
had a lot of people

14
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.470
to come on and really
explain how things work from

15
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.500
a legal perspective. So I'm
very happy to have Gary

16
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.680
on the show. How are
you, sir? I'm very well.

17
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.390
Thank you. And thank you
for having me. I'm really

18
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.270
looking forward to this. Yeah,
I, you know, we are

19
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.630
all developers who listen or
we are it people or

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.950
me, or maybe advanced users.
And even though I consider

21
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.620
myself an advanced user, you
know, I tend to just

22
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.270
click, I agree on the
website terms and conditions, and

23
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.490
I'm starting to worry that
maybe I need to read

24
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.970
it like completely Well, everybody
keeps telling you to be

25
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.940
more agreeable in life. This
is one of those situations

26
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.790
where it might not make
sense to do that without

27
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.460
looking at it a little
closer. So we'll talk about

28
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.130
that. Yeah. I mean, what
are the rights that are

29
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.310
affected and between a website
terms and conditions or when

30
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.280
I hit, okay. On my
iPhone with every app that

31
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.230
I installed, well, People automatically
assume, I think is that

32
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.370
the terms and conditions are
about payment. They're about utilizing

33
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.960
your credit card there about
being able to gather information

34
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.400
about you. But there are
other very important rights that

35
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.970
are being scaled back to
one extent or another that

36
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.080
you have. And though they're
important. So when you click

37
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.420
those terms and conditions, generally
speaking, you may be waving

38
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.760
your right to Sue your
you're waiving your, the liability

39
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.740
for utilizing the website. It
may be that you are

40
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.220
making a representation that you're
not infringing on anyone. So

41
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.610
if you are infringing and
the website gets, the website

42
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.370
gets sued. For some reason,
you may be indemnifying. The

43
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.320
people who own the website,
you may be consenting to

44
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.010
jurisdiction or, or a choice
of law in a state

45
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.400
that in which you don't
reside and you have no

46
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.140
other connection to. So these
sorts of things are rights

47
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.280
that are being either waived
completely, or at least changed

48
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.490
in some fashion that you
may not be immediately thinking

49
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.580
of when you sign, when
you click in the one

50
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.670
we're going to talk about
today, which is one of

51
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.980
the really important ones is
waiving your right to Sue

52
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.950
in a court of law
or to file a class

53
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.540
action. We part of a
class action. And instead relegating

54
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.030
you to an arbitration. What
is the difference between an

55
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.670
arbitration and suing? I mean,
ultimately I want someone to

56
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.650
hear my problem and I
want them to hear me

57
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.100
and either they win or
I win. Well, that's another

58
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.850
really interesting part of this
is that people generally think

59
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.390
that arbitration is a, is
a wonderful development because you

60
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.330
don't have to go through
the crowded courts. You're not

61
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.110
dealing with the lengthy delays.
You're not dealing with a

62
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.790
judge who may know nothing
whatsoever about the digital world.

63
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.720
And you have far more
control about scheduling and other

64
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.210
things, but few people who
aren't in this world, the

65
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.930
world of, of law and
the world of dispute resolution

66
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.670
are aware or, or think
of the fact that you're

67
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.330
waiving your right to a
jury trial, your, your almost

68
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.970
getting rid of your right
to an appeal you can

69
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.230
appeal. But the appellate rights
are very, very difficult to,

70
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.520
to assert. Usually it's whether
what was done by the

71
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.920
arbitrator was arbitrary and capricious,
you're scaling back the tools.

72
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.730
You have to subpoena witnesses
and get discovery. You can,

73
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.090
you can do it, but
it's not the same robust

74
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.150
discovery of facts and documents
that you would have in

75
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.210
a, in a lawsuit. And
I guess this is an

76
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.560
important point to make as
well, which is I'm speaking

77
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.880
in generalities because I don't
know the state in which

78
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.840
your listeners are listening to
this. I certainly don't know

79
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.060
when they're going to be
listening to this. These are

80
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.690
all evolving areas of the
law. So nothing I'm giving

81
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.970
you shall be relied on
as legal advice. But on

82
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.880
the other hand, I'm trying
to give you general principles

83
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.620
that I think are applicable
to most situations on some

84
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.980
level. That's a great point.
As we like to say

85
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.950
on the internet, I a
N a L I am

86
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.020
not a lawyer and well,
I am not a lawyer.

87
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.110
And while you are a
sir, neither of us are

88
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.230
giving any kind of advice
that someone should take action

89
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.630
on. Just like when I
talk about open source licensing,

90
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.230
I speak in generalities, from
my opinion, the same thing

91
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.660
applies. You may be listening
to this show tomorrow or

92
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.470
five years from now, things
change, but the general, the

93
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.750
general structure that you're outlying
here will at least give

94
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.910
the listeners an opportunity to
go and research this on

95
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.270
their own. That's right. It's
not hard to find this

96
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.950
stuff on the internet. If
you just want to look

97
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.260
at some of the cases
that I'm talking about in

98
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.440
the reference materials, they're easily
accessible. So I'm hearing a

99
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.690
little bit that going into
arbitration is a bit of

100
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.230
a dice role, more so
than having a formal lawsuit,

101
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.050
because you used the word
capricious, like you just don't

102
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.490
know who the arbitrator is.
If they've received appropriate discovery,

103
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.440
if all of the things
that you need to make

104
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.890
your case to the arbitrator
have been made available to

105
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.070
them. One of the great
things about arbitrations, let's talk

106
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.790
about it. The upside is
that you could pick somebody

107
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.080
who's, for example, the former
general counsel of a major

108
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.440
it company, and have that
person be your arbitrator, they'll

109
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.230
know the lingo, they'll understand
the concepts. They will have

110
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.170
managed these kinds of projects.
And so whatever the dispute

111
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.760
is, if it's that hyper-technical
there, they're already there. They

112
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.300
don't have to be educated
on the basic information. They

113
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.820
just have to learn about
the case. So that's an

114
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.840
example where it works really
well, but the downside, and

115
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.490
you do have some, some
volitional control over who the

116
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.040
arbitrator will be. You, you
get to pick from a

117
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.510
list, you know, usually it's
done consensually. There are times

118
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.110
when the arbitrators name is,
is thrust upon you, but

119
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.190
that's a rare situation. But
the, the more important thing

120
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:30.790
is that you don't have
the levels of protection, the

121
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.630
level of the structure of
the court system. And when,

122
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.610
as you know, I mean,
as you know, from the

123
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.460
world of being a developer
and, and being in the

124
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.870
digital world, when you take
shortcuts through, through a complicated

125
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.990
system, to a cut, to
achieve a goal, sometimes it

126
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.270
works. Sometimes it's a disaster.
And so it's it's, as

127
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.240
you said, you're taking more
of a chance in arbitration

128
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.930
because there's less structure. It's
a little surprising to me

129
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.730
that there isn't some kind
of a requirement, like, I

130
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.520
don't know how it works
in, in medical arbitration or

131
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.920
medical cases, but you would
assume that you'd want maybe,

132
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.410
I don't know, an arbitrator
who was also a doctor

133
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.630
or had some expertise, but
it seems like in all

134
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.880
of these areas, there is
no requirement that the arbitrator

135
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.420
be it experienced or a
developer themselves, they could just

136
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.650
be anyone. Well, actually you're
describing the court system. When

137
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.500
you think about it, there's
no, there's no requirement that

138
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.740
a judge know anything about
your particular industry. And in

139
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.120
fact, you don't get to
choose your judge. So if

140
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.750
anything, this is more in
that direction where the two

141
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.140
parties are splitting the costs.
Most of the time of

142
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:43.600
the arbitrator, they're deciding which
organization to use and to

143
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.330
supply the arbitrator and which
rules to use. So you

144
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.990
do have some control over
that. And assuming both parties

145
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.730
want someone who has industry
experience the likelihood is that

146
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.090
you'll somebody with at least
some industry exposure. Hmm. Interesting.

147
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.310
And it is, it is
a thumb war as they

148
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.960
go back and forth. And
if you did go to

149
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.470
a lawsuit and there was
a jury involved or people,

150
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.250
those people are either pro
or con and they're during

151
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.340
discovery, they're trying to figure
out whether or not, not

152
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.170
discovery, whether during jury selection
and trying to figure out

153
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.000
whether the person is going
to be beneficial towards one

154
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.030
side or the other, right.
That's right. They're there, there's

155
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:25.460
a whole career path for
people who evaluate juries and

156
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.250
get an a they're called
jury consultants. And they help

157
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.050
lawyers pictures. It's never clear
who you're going to get

158
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.690
on that jury and what
their predispositions are. You get

159
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.110
the chance to ask them
questions, but frankly, how many

160
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.600
questions can you ask? And
how much can you learn

161
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.170
about somebody in that, in
that quick situation where you're

162
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.170
just asking a few questions
in a public forum. So

163
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.350
in, in, in a situation
where there's no jury you,

164
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.840
the, the result you might
get might be more predictable.

165
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.470
However, the other side of
that is you may have

166
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.760
a lawsuit in which you
are a sympathetic plaintiff. In

167
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.870
other words, you're an employee
suing an employer, and there's

168
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.480
a lot more people on
that jury who are employees,

169
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.380
then our employers, there might
be somebody who was injured.

170
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.550
And so there's a sympathy
factor. So the idea is

171
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.440
there are certain lawsuits, certain
disputes in which juries are

172
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.220
very, very beneficial for one
side and are a real

173
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.540
problem for the other side
because of likability. Interesting. So

174
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.080
that actually brings me to
the larger question of why

175
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.970
businesses want terms and conditions
that prevent lawsuits. Why do

176
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.600
they want to push us
the users towards this arbitration?

177
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.820
Are they doing that because
arbitration is fundamentally pro-business or

178
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:52.440
better for the businesses? Well,
some people say that I

179
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.570
think it's more nuanced than
that. I think that generally

180
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.960
businesses want predictability. And that
predictability means that the subset

181
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.060
of information and education that
one person has is the

182
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.300
same as the general subset,
as the other people in

183
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.130
the process, the person who
started this business as running

184
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:21.260
this business is the representative.
This business may have a

185
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:27.050
similar orientation toward business that
the arbitrator has, which doesn't

186
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.720
mean they're going to win.
It doesn't mean the arbitrator

187
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.170
is going to always decide
in favor of the business.

188
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.390
But what it does mean
is that we're speaking, we're

189
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.150
talking about apples and apples.
We kind of under, we

190
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.470
have similar assumptions and we're
not going to necessarily who

191
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.500
knows, but we're not going
to necessarily have these outlier

192
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.790
decisions, these decisions that don't
seem to have a rational

193
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.920
basis, or that seem unpredictable.
And don't what I said

194
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.810
originally, which is that the
appeal process generally speaking, is

195
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.140
you can appeal on the
basis that the award was

196
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.730
arbitrary and capricious. Now, those
two words are pretty extreme.

197
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.340
I mean, if you, it's
very hard to show this

198
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.240
something that somebody did was
totally arbitrary and completely apprentice.

199
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.990
That's unusual. So again, the
idea is that you're, you're,

200
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.870
you're putting yourself in someone's
hands. You want to know

201
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.760
that, that their orientation toward
the dispute up or down,

202
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.580
whether you win or lose
is of a similar nature.

203
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.680
How do the, how could
the law enforce these terms

204
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.890
and conditions? If I just,
I don't know, bumped agree

205
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.040
or I didn't speak English
and I clicked degree. Did

206
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.440
they put in a database
somewhere? He clicked, agree on

207
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.320
this date from this location,
at this IP address at

208
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.530
this latitude and longitude, or
do they just say, well,

209
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.300
he made it this far.
He must have clicked degree.

210
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.970
How is it binding at
all? I didn't sign anything.

211
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.360
What's so interesting about this
is that it goes back

212
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.310
to believe it or not.
1925 that's seems to be

213
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.260
so 1925, there was a
law that was passed. It

214
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.700
was called the federal arbitration
act. And essentially what this

215
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:15.330
said was that the United States
wants to promote capitalism. And

216
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.370
in order to do that,
it wants disputes to be

217
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.890
resolved rapidly, fairly with people
with some level of expertise.

218
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.470
And so it gave a
thorny to two arbitrations that

219
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:34.140
arbitrations had jurisdiction, arbitrations were
binding. However, for purposes of

220
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.100
what we're discussing today, there
was a countervailing concept in

221
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.350
the same law, which said
that in a contract, you

222
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:50.250
could waive your right to
a lawsuit and force an

223
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.800
arbitration. So it wouldn't be
a decision that you would

224
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.140
make consensually the way I
was just saying the way

225
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.380
the law was meant to
be. You could literally force

226
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.220
somebody into arbitration. If you
could show that they waived

227
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.910
their right to go to
court and that they affirmatively

228
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.200
agreed to go into arbitration.
And in fact, the courts

229
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.180
use the term, there's a
liberal federal policy, favoring arbitration

230
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.630
agreements. So the very agreements
I'm talking about are favored

231
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.540
by the courts. The courts
want us to arbitrary if

232
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:26.010
we can. Hmm. How is
it enforceable though? How, from

233
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.310
a, from an app developer's
perspective, I just, I talked

234
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.380
to a lawyer, I get
some paperwork. I put the

235
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.730
paper, you know, I put,
I paste it into my

236
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.330
dialogue box. I put agree
and disagree. Couldn't I just

237
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.390
argue, I never pushed degree.
Well, there, there was a

238
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:46.350
case that was recently decided
concerning Uber's terms and conditions

239
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:52.370
and the placement of the
clickable link so forth. There

240
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.850
was another case that was
recently decided with Amazons. And

241
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.480
another one that was loosely
decided with Airbnb and this

242
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.610
group of cases really illustrates
the trend of what we're

243
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.430
talking about. But to go
to your question in particular,

244
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.060
there was an interesting analogy
in the Amazon case, these

245
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.830
are all federal cases in
the Amazon case, the court

246
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.090
said that it's like a
basket of apples being sold,

247
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.780
and there's a wall behind
it, filled with signs. Some

248
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.560
of those signs contain information
necessary for the purchase, such

249
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.340
as price, method of payment
delivery details and so forth.

250
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.770
Others you disregard because their
advertisements and among all those

251
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:42.650
different signs, there's additional terms
and conditions possibly waiving the

252
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.200
right to go to court.
The question is, has the

253
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.880
Apple stand owner provided reasonably
conspicuous, notice that you're waiving

254
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.480
your rights, and we're going
to talk today about the

255
00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.000
fact that it's a 51%
49% decision. And there's a

256
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.540
lot of factors as to
whether these terms and conditions

257
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.080
are in fact enforceable, whether
you can force somebody to

258
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.590
waive their right to go
to court. And what's interesting

259
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:14.510
about that for developers is
that it resides not so

260
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.870
much in the law, not
so much in these ancient

261
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.940
concepts of contract, that's only
where it starts, but where

262
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.480
the decision really resides is
in how you configure the

263
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.310
website, the graphical interface, where
things are, how they're clickable,

264
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.160
and that is why I'm
on the air with you

265
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.000
today, because it's really more
of a developer's expertise that

266
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.390
you need to make your
way through this thicket. Then

267
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.810
as well as legal ability
and illegal understanding of what

268
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:49.480
a contract is about. Interesting,
I would probably guess or

269
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.290
argue that most developers don't
give it much thought they,

270
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.460
there is a thing in
the developer community though, that

271
00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.170
is called a dark user
interface concepts, where one goes

272
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.080
out of their way to
obscure things like, I'm sure

273
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:08.890
you've gone to download a
file before download some application,

274
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.960
and you clicked on the
button that looked like it

275
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.380
was download, but it was
really an advertisement that had

276
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.060
a download button embedded. These
are those dark user interface

277
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:23.110
styles where someone has maliciously
coded something or written something

278
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:27.040
and, and, and counted on,
you know, nontechnical parent to

279
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.500
go and click on something
like that. I would presume

280
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.410
if I want to have
an enforceable terms of service,

281
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.940
I would want to go
out of my way to

282
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.160
make it the opposite of
that to make it very

283
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.880
obvious that there's no question
that this is, is clear

284
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.400
and obvious and the, that
the user has the opportunity

285
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.300
to understand those terms or
condition That's right. It, the

286
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.710
example you gave is the
easy one, because if clicking

287
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.500
something that you think is
one thing, and it's deliberately

288
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.310
meant to mislead, it's very
likely that won't be enforceable,

289
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.120
but in this world, there
were really four terms. And,

290
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.060
and if we have a
takeaway today from this podcast,

291
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.950
these are the four terms
we have to talk about,

292
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.860
which is a click wrap,
a browse wrap, a scroll

293
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.820
wrap, and a sign in
rap. And the reason they

294
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.610
keep saying the word rap
is that it goes back

295
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.100
to what used to be
called shrink wrap when they

296
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.890
would put plastic around something,
and then you would open

297
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.020
it up. And when you
opened it up, the terms

298
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.180
and conditions would be right
there in the shrink wrap.

299
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.720
So the idea is click
wrap is when a person

300
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.960
goes on a website and
the user has to click.

301
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.130
I agree in a certain
box after being presented with

302
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:43.050
the terms and conditions, that
is a strong and robust

303
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.900
website, disclaimer, and terms and
conditions are generally enforceable. Browse

304
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.370
wrap is where you post
the terms and conditions via

305
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.460
a hyperlink at the bottom
of the screen, but you're

306
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.020
not required to expressly click
them. You're not required to

307
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.590
expressly consent to them. There
isn't an actual link that

308
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.680
forces you to say, I
agree or don't agree. Scroll

309
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.170
wrap is where you have
to scroll through the terms

310
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.240
and you have to indicate
your assent to them by

311
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.260
clicking. I agree again, strong
because they did look through

312
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.180
them. And then the final
one is a sign in

313
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.410
wrap where you're notified of
the existence of the terms

314
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.550
and conditions. But instead of
providing an I agree button,

315
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.690
you're basically advised at a
later point in the sign

316
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.710
in process or the purchase
process that you are by

317
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:45.000
purchasing this item, agreeing to
the terms and conditions as

318
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.850
well. It's not a separate
button for terms and conditions,

319
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.730
right? Those are four different
things and they have four

320
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.380
different levels of enforceability. It's
interesting that I would think

321
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.080
that we, I remember, so
I couldn't tell you the

322
00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.840
year that it happened, but
I remembered when I saw

323
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.700
a squirrel rap for the
first time, I was like,

324
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.000
Oh, okay. I guess I'm
going to hold page down

325
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.030
and then actively not read
this and then hit, you

326
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.490
know, then the agree button
will light up. When I

327
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.360
get to the bottom, I
suppose I would have some

328
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.210
amount of plausible deniability, but
it's such a much more

329
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:22.070
significant action to actively scroll
past the, the, the terms

330
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.950
of services. And then click
agree. Certainly hard to prove

331
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.080
that I didn't do that
or that I, you know,

332
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.380
other than having apathy towards
it. And just to show

333
00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.940
you how, how close a
call all this is the

334
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.160
main case that just came
out. There was a case

335
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.310
decided in August of 2017,
that's how recent it is.

336
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.320
The lower court, the federal
district court for the Southern

337
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:51.580
district of New York decided that
the Uber terms and conditions

338
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:57.210
were not enforceable. And the
second circuit court of appeals,

339
00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.510
which is the appellate court
that heard the appeal of

340
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.210
that same case. So it
went up on appeal. It

341
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.840
overturned that and said that
under the same under these

342
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.080
facts, it was enforceable. So
you have two different courts,

343
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.320
very well respected coming to
different conclusions with the same

344
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.090
facts. And if you want,
I can go into some

345
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:20.610
of the sort of characteristics
of, of the Uber situation.

346
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.580
And maybe this might be
interesting to your listeners to

347
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.790
kind of hear how that
was parsed. Yeah, please do.

348
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.150
I'm on the, on the,
in the Uber case, it

349
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.840
was a, a man named
Kalanick, K a L a

350
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.410
N I C K a.
This is a 2015 case.

351
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:43.110
And basically riders of Uber
were, they had a first

352
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.470
screen. They clicked next, go
to the second screen. The

353
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:50.520
second screen has a registration
process and various fields for

354
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.910
credit cards and so forth.
And beneath the field is

355
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:59.070
a large prominent button that
says register beneath that button

356
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.850
in very, very small font
or the words quote, by

357
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.100
creating an Uber account, you
agree to the terms of

358
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.380
service and privacy policy. And
so that is in there,

359
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.060
but it's not highlighted in
a way that that would,

360
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.820
that would make the person
kind of see it in

361
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.380
all the clutter of these,
of the screen. I'm a

362
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.490
potential user. Here's the key
may click on the register

363
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.930
button without clicking on the
terms of service button. So

364
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.990
you don't have to hit
terms of service in order

365
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:38.820
to finish the transaction. You're
just advised about it. There

366
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.420
was a point in the
case about the fact that

367
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.650
the letters were small, that
you're looking at this on

368
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:51.540
a cell phone, so it's
wasted. And that even if

369
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.330
you, you did click the
hyperlink for the terms of

370
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.750
service, you're not taken to
the actual terms and conditions

371
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.630
you're taken to a screen,
a screen that contains a

372
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.020
button that then you have
to click again to get

373
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.630
to the terms of service.
And it's only by clicking

374
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.150
that, that you get there.
So my point is that

375
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.900
this was a situation in
which you were going over

376
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.070
and over and over this
one, one screen, after another

377
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.160
screen, after another screen to
finally get to the terms

378
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.050
of service and the court
basically said that there was

379
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.290
a problem with this, you
cannot assume. And here's the

380
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:32.670
key that a reasonable smart
form user, a person who

381
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.840
is a reasonably prudent smartphone
user is aware of the

382
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.630
likely contents of the terms
of service under these cases,

383
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.400
additions. And it is requiring
a breath. I'm quoting now

384
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.110
a breath of the range
of technological savvy of online

385
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:53.540
purchasers that may not exist
here. And so that's really

386
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.110
the key to the lower
courts saying this, this cannot

387
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.930
fly. The person is not
agreeing to it. What was

388
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.750
interesting is that the, the
court of appeals, when it

389
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.100
went on appeal, the second
circuit disagreed, and they said

390
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:12.710
that this was reasonably conspicuous
given. And this is a

391
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:16.400
quote that modern cell phones
are now such a pervasive

392
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.660
and insistent part of daily
life that the proverbial visitor

393
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.270
from Mars might conclude. There
were an important feature of

394
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.720
human anatomy, two thirds of
American adults own a smartphone.

395
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.130
And that the idea of
even going on Uber means

396
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.950
that you have, have been
able to download an app.

397
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.700
You can't do it without
downloading the Uber app. So

398
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.040
the very fact that you've
gotten here to the point

399
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.440
of using the app means
you've downloaded it, which means

400
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.580
that you understand the process
of downloading an app, and

401
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.190
that you've already seen that
there's a terms and conditions

402
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.180
that, that accord with that
app. And you also understand

403
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.700
that text that is highlighted
in blue and underlined means

404
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.100
that it's a hyperlink and
that you can click on

405
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.990
it. And that there's another
screen you're going to go

406
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.560
to. And so putting all
that together, the court said,

407
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.740
yeah, perhaps in 1995 or
2005, even we might've decided

408
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.760
this differently. But now with
the fact that this is

409
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.850
just the way life is,
and people use these apps

410
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.850
as part of their daily
life, that there is a

411
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.320
heightened standard of technological savvy
that we're going to accord

412
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.220
to reasonably prudent people. Therefore,
we're going to assume that

413
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.480
they understood what they were
doing. Yeah, that is a

414
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.320
tough one. I mean, I,
you know, never underestimate though

415
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.860
the ignorance of the human
condition. I honestly, I, I

416
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.260
could, I could totally understand
both ways. And that's why

417
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.690
it's so interesting that this
was then ruled and then

418
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:52.150
overturned. Certainly do all people.
I always use the term

419
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.670
nontechnical parent does. Non-tech no
parent know that there's a

420
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.730
terms and conditions, honestly, unless
they had a scroll wrap

421
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.180
or something that blocked them.
I would probably argue that

422
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.180
my parents would not know
that there were terms buried

423
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.180
in the terms and conditions
that would in any way

424
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.550
hurt them. Here's the interesting
thing about that. The courts

425
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.370
talk about that and they
discuss the fact that there

426
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.660
is a level of willful
ignorance that, that if the

427
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:25.210
law law only requires that
you make a reasonable effort

428
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.710
to make this conspicuous and
to give your user a

429
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.250
reasonable opportunity to utilize it
so that you're not tricking

430
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.100
anybody and you're not making
it so complicated that it

431
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.310
just the right has no
value. But if you have

432
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:44.100
somebody who uses an app
and understands their terms of

433
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.010
service understands that they, that
they are probably a great

434
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.640
to them because that's why
they're there. But as refused

435
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.550
to read them neglected, to
read them, the court has

436
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.030
very little sympathy for that
person. You had your chance.

437
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.570
You didn't read them well,
okay, they're enforceable. And you

438
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.720
kind of know that and
you're taking your chances. So

439
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.540
it's an, it's an interesting
dynamic because there's two sides

440
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.910
to it. And by the
way, there were two other

441
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.080
cases in the last two
years, one for Amazon, and

442
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.860
one for Airbnb that went
two different ways on this,

443
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.620
which if you want, I
can talk a little bit

444
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.370
about that. Do we have
time to just breathe One

445
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.590
minute before you start that
for people who want to

446
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.740
learn more about the Uber
case, just to make sure

447
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.340
that names are clear. Travis
Kalanick was the former chief

448
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.880
executive officer, former CEO stepped
down the individual. On the

449
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.510
other side, there was a
mayor, M E Y E

450
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.270
R. So you'll look for
Spencer mayor and Kalanick. You

451
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.370
can learn about that. And
it's, it's playing out in

452
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.920
the news. This just happened
in August, the overturning and

453
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.310
the second Board of appeals.
That's right. And, and remember,

454
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.340
if you are looking at
this online, there were two

455
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.760
different cases. There's the Southern
district of New York case. That's

456
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.580
the lower court. It was
overturned by the second circuit.

457
00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.710
So you got to see
both to really get the

458
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:05.480
full picture. The, let me
just briefly talk about two

459
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.910
other cases that your listeners
might find interesting along these

460
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:12.080
lines, Selden, S E L
D E N versus Airbnb.

461
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.800
There's a 2016 case, and
this is in the DC

462
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.360
circuit, meaning Washington DC. And
this was basically a situation

463
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:26.270
in which an African American
wanted to get a, a

464
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.570
residence on Airbnb in order
to go on vacation or

465
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.530
whatever. He was turned down.
He, as the court said,

466
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:37.220
smelled a rat. So he
went in and made it

467
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:42.170
appear that he was Caucasian.
And immediately the answer was,

468
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.570
yes, it's available. You can,
you can have this. And

469
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:49.250
so he sued for racial
discrimination. And the question was,

470
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.280
do you, do you have
to go to arbitration under

471
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.030
the terms and conditions and
what the court there found

472
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.240
was that arbitration was required,
that the terms and conditions

473
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.990
would be enforced. And here's,
again, we're got to get

474
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.000
into the detail here, because
this is what your listeners

475
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.060
need to know when they're
creating websites and applications and

476
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.050
so forth by signing up.
I agree to Airbnb's terms

477
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.410
of service. That wording is
very conspicuous. It's in the

478
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.570
middle of the page next
to the sign up button,

479
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.750
dark font, legible, appropriately sized.
And so the concept is

480
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.110
an active adult. Consumer would
appreciate that by signing up

481
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.510
for the service, they agree
to the terms and conditions.

482
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.570
Now turning to the other
case, which is Amazon. This

483
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.750
was a case in the
second circuit. Again, this is

484
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.820
in that, that court of
appeals that, that encompasses New York

485
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:45.370
and certain other States in
that area, that one, they

486
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:50.110
said that Amazon's terms and
conditions might not be enforceable.

487
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.240
They didn't. They said that
this had to go back

488
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.560
and there had to be
a hearing. It had to

489
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:59.770
be a trial on this.
And this was a hybrid

490
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.100
between a click wrap and
a browse wrap. And what

491
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.350
they said was, and Amazon,
and it'll be familiar to

492
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.140
people who use Amazon and
Amazon percher was not required

493
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.990
to click. I agree after
being presented with a list

494
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.660
of terms and conditions, nor
was the purchaser simply left

495
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.360
to browse the page, but
you were asked to click

496
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.290
place your order after being
told elsewhere that by placing

497
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.660
your order, you agree to
the privacy notice and conditions

498
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.020
of use. So the point
is you're not clicking the

499
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.590
terms of use. You're clicking
a button that says by

500
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.560
clicking this button, you're agreeing
to the terms of use.

501
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.040
And I see, so you
take an explicit action to

502
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.050
continue your relationship, your transactional
relationship with Amazon and implicitly,

503
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.990
you are agreeing to their
privacy notice and their conditions

504
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.330
of use That's right. And
so what they're saying is,

505
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.180
first of all, that might
be confusing to people. First

506
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.850
of all, they might overlook
it. And the second part

507
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.960
of that was the, it
was that the words by

508
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.170
placing your order, you agree
to Amazon's conditions of use

509
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:02.160
was not bold. It wasn't
capitalized. It wasn't conspicuous in

510
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.260
terms of what was, what
else was on the webpage.

511
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.110
There was a lot of,
of information on the webpage.

512
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.650
And so the idea was
that, because there were so

513
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.570
many links, there were so
many things they were saying

514
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.270
that I think there were
15 to 25 links on

515
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:20.130
the order page, alongside buttons
for promotion and advertisements and

516
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:24.540
so forth, that it was
just as they said, distracting.

517
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:29.310
So as to temper, whatever
effect the notification had such

518
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.950
that the person might not
know that they were giving

519
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.260
up these rights. So again,
the point is not to

520
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.260
say that there's something wrong
with Amazon and something right.

521
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.170
With Airbnb or anything like
that. The point here is

522
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.530
to say that this is
something that developers should be

523
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.610
looking at carefully. You don't
want to just, just assume

524
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.070
that because you've always done
it this way. This is

525
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:51.750
the way it should be
done, because you're using a

526
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.930
template that a, a customer,
a client is using. That's

527
00:31:54.930 --> 00:32:01.860
correct. Instead, the actual configuration
of the pages, the click-throughs

528
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.110
the, I agrees the so
forth. All of that should

529
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.480
be looked at by an
attorney who was familiar with

530
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.870
this, as well as the
actual terms of con and

531
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.530
conditions. Those should be reviewed
so that it comports with

532
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.380
this case law, especially because
the case law is changing

533
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.030
so rapidly. Yeah. There are
articles written online that the

534
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.260
browse wrap and click wrap
distinction is kind of falling

535
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.890
apart. Do I need to
make as a developer? I

536
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.260
mean, do I need to
ask them a quiz? You

537
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.020
know, like, Hey, referring back
to paragraph six, what's the

538
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.170
fifth word? Like how, how
far do I have to

539
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.650
go with, Well, that's what
we do. In other words,

540
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.170
you're describing what we do.
We have clients, we have

541
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.180
a lot of eCommerce clients.
We have a lot of

542
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.380
people who want us to
review their websites for efficacy

543
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.190
and enforceability. And we literally
go, go through each page.

544
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.200
We look at it, we
look at the factors in

545
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.020
the cases and we make
recommendations. And by the way,

546
00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:01.250
these recommendations, a lot of
them are common sense recommendations.

547
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.490
And it may be that
when someone is putting one

548
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:08.570
of these websites together, the
developer is being given conflicting

549
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.750
signals because the developer sort
of in between the, the

550
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.630
customer, their client is telling
them, you know, I want

551
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.540
the functionality. I want it
to be quick. I want

552
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.840
to be able to, to
sell the service, et cetera.

553
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.560
And then they have to
also be saying, well, if

554
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.220
it's too quick and it's
too simple, you may not

555
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.700
have enforceability. So the, the
lawyer in the, in the

556
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.150
mix may be saying, well,
we need these changes to,

557
00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.950
it might slow it down
a little bit. There might

558
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.050
be an extra screen. There
might be an extra click

559
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.890
that has to happen, but
that's important because if you

560
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.800
sell the product with no
terms and conditions, if you're

561
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.040
selling the service with no
terms and conditions, you're putting

562
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:53.890
the client in danger without
them even knowing it. Hmm.

563
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.250
This is really, really useful
information. And I appreciate you

564
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:59.200

with me about it today.
