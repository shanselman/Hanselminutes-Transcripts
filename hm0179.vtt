From Hanselman it's dot com.
It's Hanselman. It's a weekly

2
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.400
discussion with web developer and
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is

3
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.280
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number one
79. Recorded live Friday, September 11th, 2009.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.570
Support for Hansel minutes is
provided by teller RD controls

this unusual episode of Hansel

7
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.780
minutes, organized late night over
Twitter and recorded as a

8
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.410
community conference. Call Scott moderates,
a discussion on open source

9
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.140
and the new code flex
foundation. Hi, this is Scott

10
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.210
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes, and this

11
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.370
is an interesting episode of
Hansel minutes because we have

12
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.490
spent the last one hour
trying to record this episode.

13
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.460
We tried it on Ustream.
I tried it on denim.

14
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.240
I tried it on a
tiny chat and now we're

15
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.320
trying it on a thing
called talk shoe, which talks

16
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.780
shoe.com. Honestly, I think I
should've just tried my gut

17
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.590
reaction, which was live meeting.com
instead I did not. And

18
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.500
I tried this. People were
having all sorts of trouble

19
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.000
with managing a conference call
of this size. I've got

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.670
a number of people called
in though here on the,

21
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.760
on the talk shoe. And
I've got this very strange

22
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.630
interface from the, from the
nineties. I've just un-muted Scott.

23
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.950
She rentals. So you there,
Scott I'm here. Isn't this,

24
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.170
isn't this thrilling, this talk
shoe.com. What do you think

25
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.050
of this? This is like
the wave of the future.

26
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.380
I'm telling you how you
series a web, a web

27
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.840
based conference calling management system.
You think this is how

28
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.530
we should do this thing?
No, I don't. Yes. This

29
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.960
is deeply not working for
me. I think a live

30
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.550
meeting probably would have best
thing to be. The idea

31
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.380
is that I want to
record a podcast and I

32
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.460
want people to call in
life. I think that, but

33
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.730
Jeff Atwood, coding horror has
a really nice system where

34
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.150
he's got people calling in
to a, basically a voice

35
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.300
recorder, like a voicemail. And
then he plays the wave

36
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.250
file of those people. Who've
called it over the course

37
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.800
of the last week in
any, any answers them? I

38
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.860
don't know that that's one,
that's one system, but I

39
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.620
don't know if it's necessarily
the white system. Let me

40
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.140
see if we got Scott Barnes
and get him on muted

41
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.600
here. This is a strangled
interface we've got where I

42
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.000
actually click on somebody and
I wait like 10 seconds

43
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.850
and then they get un-muted.
Scott. Are you there other

44
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.450
Scott? There's three Scott's right
now. Scott Barnes? Yeah, I'm on

45
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.060
the iPhone. Okay. So if
we've got our third Scott,

46
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.020
who's logged in on an
iPhone, a Microsoft employee. That's

47
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.850
a, that's just pretty bad.
We've got three Scott's on

48
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.290
the call. Is there one
here? Have an iPhone. Is

49
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.270
that what's going on? I've
located on the computer. I

50
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.960
was gonna shut down. Now.
I'm just desperate to talk

51
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.810
to you, Scott. I know
you couldn't have just chatted

52
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.100
me. Alright. I'm going to
unmute someone named 10 because

53
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.290
I'm a little concerned. This
is probably someone evil, someone

54
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.200
in guest, 10 Italian guests,
10 unnamed guests. Who are

55
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.710
you? That's me soon. How's
it going? Where are you

56
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.220
calling from? Calling from Colorado.
Yeah. And why are you

57
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.380
up so late on a
Friday night because I have

58
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.220
insomnia. We've got a number
of people who haven't told

59
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.910
me. We were talking earlier
with Yoho from Israel, the

60
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.580
unit testing expert. And he's
actually on the chat too.

61
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.680
He's up at about seven
in the morning and Israel,

62
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.890
his daughter kept him up
all night and he has

63
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.900
followed us all the way
over to here as well.

64
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.240
I'm gonna unmute a couple
of more people. We've got

65
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.660
John Shannon, Ryan Farley on the phone.
Ryan, are you there? Yeah,

66
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.810
I'm here. This is interesting.
I feel like I'm suddenly

67
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.090
on a Leal, the port,
a podcast. I don't know

68
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.410
if that's a good thing
or a bad thing, but

69
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.110
I must say most people
know who Leo deport is

70
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.450
and they know who I
am. So I got to

71
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.570
give a Leo the prompts
for that. What was it?

72
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.240
The Ryan Farley that does a
lot of cell phones integration.

73
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.210
I think so, Ryan either.
Yes, that's me. This is,

74
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.090
this is nice. It's a
nice little, little, little community

75
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.690
we've got going here. People
logged in. It's amazing though,

76
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.180
2009 and we can't find
a decent place to do

77
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.790
this. It was a shame.
You know, one thing we

78
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.850
could do would actually be
leave our homes and go

79
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.370
to where people are, would
be one idea that we

80
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.850
could potentially just the thought
might be a little, a

81
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.790
little out there, a little
revolutionary, but actually speaking to

82
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.890
humans. Excellent support is really
great. That's that is true.

83
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.080
That is true. I'm surprised
we couldn't get the video

84
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.150
thing working. I noticed that
when we were trying this

85
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.840
before using a tool called
tiny chat, we were using

86
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.910
a flash based interface and
we were all trying to

87
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.010
broadcast our video. I think
they allow you to do

88
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.680
12 video slots, but the,
the, the lag was just

89
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.170
horrendous and on Ustream I
could, you could see me,

90
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.750
but I could only see
you via chat. Another guy

91
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.480
who does this kind of
stuff is, is Chris Parillo

92
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.020
also I think extremely famous
for being famous. Really? And

93
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.820
he does this stuff. Does
he use Ustream or what

94
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.360
is, what does Chris use?
He series everything on Ustream.

95
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.970
Is there anything on your
stream? Oh yeah, I guess

96
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.490
he's got three. A's actually
live right now on Ustream

97
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.580
with 308 people. I'm not
even sure what he's doing

98
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.590
right now, but I'm going
to click on it and

99
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.870
see what's going on here.
People are chatting with this

100
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.350
guy. He lives online, broadcasting
live. He's got his giant

101
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.390
and he's got a whole,
a chat thing on the

102
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.960
bottom of the screen. People
are watching. Chris is sitting

103
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.200
here with a glass of
wine. This is really even

104
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.570
sad. Or do you realize
that we're in one tool

105
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.470
talking about a geek in
another tool? Really? Ultimately we

106
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.380
all just a bunch of
tools at this point. So

107
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.320
not too good. Hey, did
anyone see the copex flex

108
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.910
announcement that we saw this
week where Microsoft announced the

109
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.760
creation of the code flex
foundation? So you guys see

110
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.270
that yes. Any about that?
I know Roy Joshua had

111
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.070
some opinions, Roy, It was
kind of a nice to

112
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.050
me if I was a
good idea at first for

113
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.000
that, I have to read
bellwethers blog post gave me

114
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.320
more thoughts about the various
risks. And, and I'm especially

115
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.930
concerned about the fact that
it's a separate entity and

116
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.040
that Microsoft seems to still
again, do something, everything on

117
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.220
its own. It's like the
not invented here syndrome instead

118
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.340
of joining something that exists.
I just not to have

119
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.700
to recreate everything from the
beginning and to create its

120
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.660
own identity and to, to
actually put it inside Microsoft

121
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.510
belly instead of putting it
out there. Well, at least

122
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.600
it seems that way that
it's going that direction. So

123
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.970
I think it's a good
idea at the very least.

124
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.910
So you, you, you actually
were concerned that it was

125
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.470
a separate entity. You didn't
think that was a good

126
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.320
idea. It doesn't the independence
of that entity equal a

127
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.700
good thing. Well, there are
already existing independent entities. Why

128
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.330
did Microsoft create another one
of their own? That's a

129
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.850
really good question. I, again,
I'm speaking only as Scott,

130
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.220
not as a represent, not
in the representative, Microsoft and

131
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.440
certainly not as anyone with
any kind of power, but

132
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.710
it seemed to me that
you've got the eclipse foundation,

133
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.780
which really supports eclipse. And
you've got the, the Apache

134
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.520
foundation, which supports Apache. Why
wouldn't you want a foundation

135
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.860
that was not tied to
a particular product? That seemed

136
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.380
like a good idea to
me. I think that's the

137
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.240
idea of the code books
foundation. Are there no foundations

138
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.840
that are not related to
specific products? I'm trying to

139
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.260
think of foundations that are
not specific to products. Anyone

140
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.740
here think about any of
foundations that are not specific

141
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.610
to a product And code
is complex products Flex isn't

142
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.690
a product called flex is
just a name SourceForge SourceForge

143
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.730
well SourceForge is that a
foundation? Is that actually an

144
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.990
open space? That of all
the size of course is,

145
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.460
is SourceForge a, a, an
independent, like a nonprofit, or

146
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.420
is that a corporation? I
thought for a minute it

147
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.220
was a sole source, but
I take it back. I

148
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.210
recall that, right. Well, there's
the free software foundation, right?

149
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.090
FSS, you know, it's a
good question, but see that,

150
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.030
that really supports the new
right. So free software supports

151
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.870
canoe and you know, and,
and Linux distribution. So that's

152
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.550
a very good question. I
think that Scott bellwether, his

153
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.910
article really kind of nailed
it for me though, because

154
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.020
it, it, it gives, it
gives.net a place to live.

155
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.520
It gives.net projects, a place
to live. I think that

156
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.350
if, if you get the,
what I think of it

157
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.460
as kind of the end
start out star stack, moving

158
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.640
over to COVID foundation, then
we could get some actual

159
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.860
strength in numbers we get
like in hibernate and then

160
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.850
unit and this, and then
that, that could be a

161
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.950
pretty good thing. Well, obviously
it's better than what we

162
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.380
have now. Everything is better
than what we have now.

163
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.590
The question is, could you
get it to, this has

164
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.030
been even better than that.
And that's what I'm not

165
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.350
sure about. And I think
that the fact that I'm

166
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.680
not one of those big
mainstream contributors to open source,

167
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.730
like a game day and
stuff like that makes me

168
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.550
understand less about this topic.
But I think that it's

169
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.460
dot net developers, we all
should know more about this

170
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.950
topic and the fact that
most are not developers don't

171
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.770
really care about this announcement
at all. Just show you

172
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.830
how not ingrained it is
in our culture. And I

173
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.790
think we should all be
involved in this just to

174
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.920
learn what it is, why
it's important for us to

175
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.960
know about it. And the
fact that I don't, I

176
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.790
can't even name those other
foundations. Not again, it's actually

177
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.950
a shame considering that we're
we were some of the

178
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.960
guys that care the most,
but we're still struggling to

179
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.250
figure this out. Now there's
a number of people who

180
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.770
were making comments here in
the chat, scrolling by one

181
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.130
individual said that while the
Apache foundation started with Apache

182
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.390
has lots of projects, certainly
underneath it, not just the

183
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.360
web server, including leucine, and
also it's got things that

184
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.880
aren't necessarily Java. They've got
ports from Java as well.

185
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.600
And then you've got, and
another person indicates that sourceforge.net

186
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.710
is owned and upgrades operated
by SourceForge incorporated, which is

187
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.260
actually a publicly traded us
company. So that is a,

188
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
that is interesting. You know,
we, we should, is there

189
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.150
anyone that knows about this
kind of stuff? It's interesting

190
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.790
around open source. That's so
many people speak authoritatively. They

191
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.780
did make a lot of
declarations that it is so,

192
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.920
but they don't necessarily, there's
no way to tell whether

193
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.560
they're just talking or whether
they know what they're talking

194
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.360
about. You know, we need
to get like a Sam

195
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.540
Ramji, something like that to
help break it down because

196
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.560
it changes so often that
I, I personally have trouble

197
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.130
keeping up with it. Maybe
there should be a whole

198
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.380
podcast you can do, and
just get a few of

199
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.110
those people in there and
get some questions from the

200
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.780
community. Yeah. That is the
next idea. People should feel

201
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:52.610
free to email me@scotthaatmicrosoft.com and
make suggestions to about who

202
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.650
they would want on a,
on like the, the ideal

203
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.590
open source panel to get
some of these questions answered.

204
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.960
I can certainly pull in
people from the copex foundation.

205
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.600
One individual of course just
made up a very valid,

206
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.370
very important point that we
really can't can't emphasize enough,

207
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.420
which is a complex.com is
not copex.org. And a lot

208
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.300
of people have complained about
the naming of cope, but

209
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.490
it's too confusing. And personally,
I think the.org, Oregon, the.com

210
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.980
top level domain is pretty
specific. We also pointed out

211
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.390
that we've got Sarah Ford, who
is the owner of covid.com

212
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.430
she's on the advisory board.
And her job is to

213
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.960
make sure that, that we
stay separate because you're not

214
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.940
a code books. Dot com
is a, is a Microsoft

215
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.970
thing. And you'll notice if
you look at the, the

216
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.210
licensing that the Copa foundation
owns the name code flex

217
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.300
now, and they actually licensed
it back to COVID dot

218
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.660
<inaudible> dot com, which is
interesting. The nice that we

219
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.950
had a couple of people
log in to the, the

220
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.370
call here, and we can
get some more people speaking.

221
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.800
I think Jesse Macola is
on the, on the phone.

222
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.680
Let's see if he is
next in the queue here

223
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.010
to, to speak. We've got
some folks in the queue

224
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.590
who, who just came on
there, Dennis? Hi Dennis, on

225
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.910
Twitter. I'm coder Dennis. Right?
Right now the only sponsor

226
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.360
of the code plus flex
foundation, at least it shows

227
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.950
up on the website as
Microsoft. I think some of

228
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:27.870
these reactions that people are
having might be pushed aside

229
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.430
if there were other sponsors
besides Microsoft. Do you know

230
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.420
if that's something that's like
our other, if you take

231
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.070
a look at my yeah,
yeah, exactly. If you take

232
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.010
a look at my blog
and the comments, bill staples,

233
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.960
who was one of the
Microsoft general manager, she's the

234
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.260
general manager of kind of
a web stack, made some

235
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.490
comments where he wants to
point out that this was

236
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.480
a soft launch. It was
a launch that was not,

237
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.750
we weren't a hundred percent
prepared and we wanted to

238
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:02.550
start small. We figured that
in the interest of, of

239
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.100
transparency, why not start small
and say, this is something

240
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.540
that we're intending to do
as opposed to doing a

241
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.420
bunch of stuff that was
kind of hidden in the

242
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.870
background. So the intent is,
as I understand it in

243
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.320
the first hundred days to
get an all new board

244
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.830
that is going to be
less Microsoft and have a,

245
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.850
a chairman who is not
Sam Ramsey, Samar MPSP the

246
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.220
interim chairman for the first
hundred days. So it's kind

247
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.680
of one of those things
where it launched with no

248
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.860
projects and it launched really
in a very light way

249
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.100
and success isn't, shouldn't be
based on what happened today,

250
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.350
but success should be what
happens in a, in a

251
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.140
hundred days if we're having
this conversation, like, what the

252
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.500
heck is it for? And
we're doing this Christmas time,

253
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.370
then we have, then we
have a problem. Yeah. I

254
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.290
don't think it's a bad
thing that Microsoft sponsors that

255
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.220
foundation like this. I think
that's great. I think people

256
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.320
are having a really hard
time letting Microsoft change. I

257
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.400
mean, maybe they aren't, but
I think people, I don't

258
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.550
know, I think we should
give Microsoft a chance to

259
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.210
change. I think a lot
of people just aren't, that's

260
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.810
interesting. Someone's going to think
that you're a shell that

261
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.330
I've set you up to
soda. That's actually a really

262
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.870
very interesting thing to, to
say that people won't let

263
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.140
Microsoft change. Well, they, they
wanna like, like a gentleman

264
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.270
named soul Hunter just said
that people hang on to

265
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.760
a lot of the old
hate. Remember we saw recently

266
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.790
that Linus said that hating
Microsoft was a bit of

267
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.970
a disease. I think that
that is, is definitely true.

268
00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.750
People. A mendicant just said,
let's get, let's get men

269
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.130
to get on the phone
here because he just made

270
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.590
an interesting point about giving
people a lot of power

271
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.780
mannequins. Are you were there
on the phone? Yeah. I'm

272
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.330
here. Go ahead and say
again, what you just said

273
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.540
in the chat. Oh, people
are wary because everyone sees

274
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.150
Microsoft as large and all
powerful, all of that, all

275
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.840
that sort of jazz. So
now by having control of

276
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.760
the, of this foundation, you're
arguably giving them more power

277
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.380
by putting all this IP
and property and code under

278
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.840
their control for as long
as they're on the board.

279
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.100
So, so I mean, like,
I can see why people

280
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.860
would be wary to say,
even though, you know, it's

281
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.960
not possible to put in
hibernate on there right now,

282
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.230
but to put a project
like in hibernate on there,

283
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.170
technically they could basically just
take it and run with

284
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.920
it. People. It was my
first reaction when I first

285
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.360
saw this. I, yeah, I
have a time. Trust is

286
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.460
going to be something that
we as a company and

287
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.410
I'm going to break down
in terms of, I think,

288
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.390
I think in the past
has been a feed minority

289
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.140
monitor issues, which is, I
kind of build that momentum.

290
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.060
And I think creating safe
Haven is like, this is

291
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.990
essentially, you know, taking another
step forward in sort of

292
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.600
breaking down that antitrust sort
of out share that it

293
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.770
does across the community sometimes.
And I mean, like from

294
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.540
my point of view, I,
you know, five years ago

295
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.720
I couldn't stand Microsoft. I'd,
you know, wouldn't run their

296
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.400
operating systems. I wouldn't run
anything, but being involved on

297
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.950
the.net side of things and
seeing the change and seeing

298
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.340
the direction kind of, they're
trying to make the right

299
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.690
move. So I've really, you
know, kind of lightened up

300
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.660
on that a lot, you
know, but there's more, that

301
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.430
needs to be changed, but
it's not going to happen

302
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:22.000
overnight. Right? Yeah. Janitor just
made a comment. I want

303
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.310
to hear him say, go
see there's people who hate

304
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.690
Microsoft to hate Microsoft, no
matter what they do. There's

305
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.990
a guy, as I understand
it, who's not allowed to

306
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.150
participate in certain code camp
events as a speaker in

307
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.660
Boise, because all he does
is rant about how much

308
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.350
he hates Microsoft. I came
from the Unix Linux world.

309
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:50.710
I started.net in mano. I
didn't own a windows license

310
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.910
and I did it just
kind of on my own

311
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.320
through work. And now I'm
a full time.net developer. And

312
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.020
let's hear from guests 94,
who's just come into the

313
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.800
queue. Let's go ahead and
unmute, unmute you. Are you

314
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.130
there guests? 94. Yeah. It's
me Rob Connery. How are

315
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:15.130
you? Oh, hi, Rob. How
are you doing good, mr.

316
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:20.020
Scott. Good to see John
<inaudible> said, Hey, you gotta

317
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.570
get on this call. Right?
Sure. Why not? It's so

318
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.700
funny. And you, you came
on and you could not

319
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.070
actually change your name. You
figured out how to get

320
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.440
into the queue and you
called yourself guest 94. So

321
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.280
sneaky. It's cryptic it's code.
What do you think about

322
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.300
the, the announcement Rob? I
think it's awesome. I think

323
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:43.510
if you're a Microsoft shill
not anymore. Well, the interesting

324
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.330
thing about it is that,
you know, I can, I

325
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.060
can speak, I can speak
rather freely now. And I,

326
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.310
that it was, you know,
it was something that was

327
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.880
fought for long and hard.
And I was in some

328
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.480
initial discussions. I wasn't any
part of making it happen,

329
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.090
but I was in some
initial discussions about it. And

330
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.070
I remember thinking at the
time when the thing came

331
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.090
up, you have right. You
know, but I gotta say

332
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.900
it happens and kudos and
congratulations to everyone that needed

333
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.260
to happen. I think it's,
it's interesting now as to

334
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.210
what's going to happen in
the future with it. Oh,

335
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.310
you know what? I think
it's an opportunity to still

336
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.010
work with today. And I
can't believe everyone's saying this

337
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.640
today. I can't believe I'm
quoting Boulware. No, that was

338
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.200
pretty funny. I saw a
number of people on Twitter

339
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.390
that were saying, we hear
I'm going to retweet bellwether,

340
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.400
but I think that the
has got some good points.

341
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.500
We've got another guy who
just asked to be in

342
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.590
the queue here called the
one. Are you there? Hey

343
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.300
guys, I did have a
quick question with having just

344
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.480
a glance over the pot
or the blog posts. Can

345
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.000
you give me any idea
of what this foundation is

346
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.970
actually going to oversee? Okay.
So, so by having a,

347
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.880
as I understand it as
having the, the organization be

348
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.260
its own entity, it is
a separately, you know, kind

349
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.880
of wholly owned thing. It's
not controlled by Microsoft. Microsoft.

350
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.700
Can't tell it what to
do. This would allow open

351
00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:07.580
source projects to assign their
copyrights to it today. You

352
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.660
would, they would get the
resources of the foundation. The

353
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.920
foundation can, is this kind
of a, a, like a,

354
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.440
what kind of drawing is
drawing a circle around a

355
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.440
bunch of people who think
the same and giving it,

356
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.010
giving it a name. Okay,
great. Thanks. And the idea

357
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.100
I think is to bring
those, those open source projects

358
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.890
under, as, as Scott Beller
says under his auspices, let's

359
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.920
see what Scott Coon thinks
about that Scott did. Does,

360
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.570
does this do anything or
is this just a press

361
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.630
release? There's a couple of
things that I think same,

362
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.520
or we had a good
point, but he was hoping

363
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.090
they would follow the, the
eclipse or Apache model, which

364
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.610
is, which is more that
they assign the licenses and

365
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:52.250
the contributions are actually owned
by the foundation. And I

366
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.040
think from that respect that
the foundation then takes any

367
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.420
legal hits or is responsible
for finagling around any new

368
00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.460
patent issues or anything like
that. I think that would

369
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.220
be a good thing because
that's the number one complaint

370
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.480
people have about using OSS
is that, you know, how

371
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.240
do I know, how can
I vet it's pedigree? How

372
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.310
do I know that I'm
not going to get sued

373
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.060
for patent infringement and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And

374
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.730
all of that. So I
think if they get to

375
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.660
that point where they're, they're
actually, you know, accepting the

376
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:30.590
contributions and distributing licenses or,
or, or taking licenses, I

377
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.930
think it's going to be
a really good thing. I'd

378
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.300
also like to see a
little bit more, and I

379
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.370
talked about this a little
bit, or Lauren Clooney, I

380
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.900
think had mentioned this a
little bit when I was,

381
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.590
when I was venting on,
on Twitter about the foundation,

382
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.760
that there may be some
possible financial support grants, et

383
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.160
cetera, coming in, you know,
maybe there was, of course,

384
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.310
none of this is finalized
because it sounds like, you

385
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.790
know, they're, if they're at
the toddler stage, they've just

386
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.070
figured out how to walk
into this open source land.

387
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.540
And you know, they're not
steady yet. Well, we're we're,

388
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.780
and we're clearly behind. I
mean, it's nice that this

389
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.070
is happening, but I think
a lot of people that

390
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.900
think very valid points and
they said that it really

391
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.350
should have happened years ago.
Hey everybody, this is Scott

392
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.990
coming at you from another
place in time. Summer is

393
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.300
peaking. And our friends at
Tellerik are working at full

394
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.000
steam. They've just released the
Q2 volume of the telework

395
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.660
premium collection for.net. The biggest
release yet it's packed with

396
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.970
new things, that'll excite anyone.
Who's got to do anything

397
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.000
with that development, starting with
Silverlight and the introduction of

398
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.700
the first commercial 3d chart
in the market it's developed

399
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.770
as a true vector 3d,
which gives you a nice

400
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:39.270
performance enriched capabilities with rotation
and animations. Also the Silverlight

401
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.820
scheduler, which is packed with
even more features in the

402
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.950
first version. Telerx flagship rad
controls for asp.net. Ajax grows

403
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.320
in this release, not only
with four new controls, but

404
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.280
also with new productivity tools.
There's the new visual style

405
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.160
builder and online application that
allows you to visually modify

406
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.260
skins or even design new
ones with just point and

407
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.110
click. If that's not enough,
they've added a completely new

408
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.530
product, a free testing framework
powered by art of test

409
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.300
for automating Ajax. And Silverlight
rich internet applications. I'm short

410
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.740
on time. So I can't
give you all the new

411
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.100
features and enhancements until our
reporting open-access RM or wind

412
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.710
forms, but I encourage you
to check out all of

413
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:22.860
these products@tellerik.com. Thanks Fabio from,
from in hibernate is bring

414
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.120
out about a point here
where he says that he

415
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.840
really needs someone to protect
the N hibernate copyright and

416
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.440
other people have made the
comments like John Clayton just said,

417
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.860
is this COVID place foundation
can actually help commercial software

418
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.990
developers use open source, or
is it just gonna give

419
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.050
them warm fuzzies to make
people to make people feel

420
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.700
comfortable? Let's see, we've got
Scott Reynolds is back on Scott.

421
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.140
Yeah, I think warm fuzzies
maybe, and, and actually helping

422
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.560
get people using open source
would be ideal. One of

423
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.260
the biggest complaints, a lot
of us in the community

424
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.600
have had for a long
time is that it's, you

425
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.580
know, we do have a
lot of great open source

426
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.820
projects in the.net space, and
it's hard to get them

427
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.110
legitimize, you know, in kind
of the larger corporate development

428
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.810
world. And Microsoft never seemed
to be doing much to

429
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.870
help that. And, and rather
than, than help, they would

430
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.590
often reinvent the wheel and,
and send out in this

431
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.680
test for the big corporate
dev shops. So what I'm

432
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.080
hoping, we'll see out of
this either by actual action

433
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.820
on the code Plex foundation
or, or even just having

434
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.610
the association is, is that
we get some of that

435
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.010
legitimizing factor so that open
source can get into a

436
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:42.610
wider corporate development world. That's
an interesting point about, about

437
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.610
corporate development. One of the
things that I think got

438
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.740
us kind of in trouble
when we put the, the

439
00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.650
blogs out there and when
I put my post out

440
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.470
is I use the word,
you know, commercial. It seems

441
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.330
like if you say the
word commercial in the same

442
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.090
sentence as open source than
you are kind of Satan's

443
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.220
minion. I think that that's,
you know, people say, Oh,

444
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.830
he's commercial. It's not a
good idea, but I spent

445
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.990
many, many years working at
a bank and company trying

446
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.690
to get open source, okay.
To run in large banks.

447
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.020
I'm interested in folks on
the call about what they

448
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.540
think about, is it difficult
and has, have they had

449
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.610
trouble? And if they had,
if you could say, well,

450
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.980
you know, there's a foundation
out there that can help

451
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.720
us navigate the licensing of
open source code and commercial

452
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.700
projects. Would that be easier?
We had another guy on

453
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.180
the queue here, ft fry.
D are you there, sir?

454
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.780
FD fry. Yeah, I'm here.
Actually. I was actually going

455
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.630
to speak directly to that
commercial question. I find it

456
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.710
that one of the challenges
is, you know, handling the

457
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.010
licensing of, of utilizing open
source. But another challenges is

458
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.180
just, you know, getting buy
in that it's, you know,

459
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.820
up to speed with what
the other commercially available products.

460
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.700
I mean, Microsoft specifically, I
think has a lot of

461
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.480
word of mouth reputation about
having, you know, magic, you

462
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.940
know, whether it's, you know,
a team of developers that

463
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.610
are able to tweak every
last drop of performance out

464
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.460
of a new feature that
has never been seen before,

465
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.890
you know, 200, 500 developers
that are locked away in

466
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.110
some case. And where, you
know, I mean, I think

467
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.200
that open source is so
much more transparent. We can

468
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.360
see the total number of
contributors and things like that,

469
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.330
but we also know that
just can't stack up against

470
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.910
the, you know, the, the
hidden secrets that, you know,

471
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.750
people say that, you know,
happened to surround Microsoft, you

472
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.800
know, you know, releases straight
out. Do you think that,

473
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.200
do you guys think that
having the foundation is just

474
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.450
Microsoft trying not to look
evil, but they are in

475
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.660
fact still evil or is
this back to that point

476
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.570
about, you know, is this
for a, for selfish reasons?

477
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.180
Do you guys think that
there's something underneath this or

478
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.580
is this an honest attempt
to do something to do

479
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.070
something right? I'm willing to
give them the benefit of

480
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.860
the doubt here and see
where it goes and, and

481
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.510
not describe any ulterior motives
yet. I'd like to think

482
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.930
that this is, this is
actually a legitimate attempt to

483
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.780
do some good. And I
agree, I think they have

484
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.000
a lot to gain, but,
you know, for, you know,

485
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.020
pushing the adoption of, of.net
technologies and other technologies in

486
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.020
general, by getting more people
involved, I think they've got,

487
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.660
you know, good reasons to
be completely selfless in this

488
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.820
act. Okay. Let's see what
Roy has to say. Yeah.

489
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.670
I think Microsoft is, is
I think there are two

490
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.250
faces there. I think there
is a higher up level

491
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:24.160
where it's purely an internal
interest of Microsoft to be

492
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.760
more open, to opensource, to
get more business and get

493
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.030
more people interested because that's
where the wind is blowing,

494
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.790
but that higher up, or
the gave the Baton to

495
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.060
people who actually do care
and we're going to do

496
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.350
grids. So I think we're
going to get the good

497
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:48.220
out of what was initially
just a self-interests. I can't

498
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.570
make a comment here on
the note, if being immediate

499
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.360
is, is good enough or
should I wait? What you

500
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.880
just say your name first?
Okay. This is all a

501
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.340
Hunter Kent. And what I
was going to say was,

502
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.070
I think that this is
this kind of points out

503
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.970
the part of the problem
with moving to the open

504
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.490
source community in the sense
that, you know, you hear

505
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.700
a lot of stuff about
open source is good for

506
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.150
business, that we should be
open to the open source

507
00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.250
stuff, because in addition to
everything else, that's going to

508
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.760
help us make money and,
and make a good product

509
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.030
and whatever. But when someone
takes them up on that,

510
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:26.480
when Microsoft makes a move,
there's always this question, are

511
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.810
they doing it for pure
motive, which is supposed to

512
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.850
be better, or are they
doing it in their self

513
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.730
interest? And I guess my
point is, we've been told

514
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.920
that those are the same
things that we can do

515
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.040
well by doing good. But
then when you do that,

516
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.950
it's not good enough. Like
if you're not a starving

517
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.670
artist working for the good
of everybody by yourself, but

518
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.820
suddenly every move you make
just never measures up. And

519
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.260
I think Microsoft's getting that
heat, you know, that are

520
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.910
they doing it for the
right reasons or are they

521
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.790
doing it to make money
and gain customers, but aren't

522
00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.520
those right reasons. The business
wants to make money. That's

523
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.430
wonderful having a business and
it's okay to want to

524
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.430
make money. It's okay. Just
to support an opensource while

525
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.140
we want to make money.
I don't think there's a

526
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.510
problem with them. And I
agree there is a hi,

527
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.270
this is Roy. By the
way, I agree there is

528
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:21.530
a high anti commercial, and
I feel that having worked

529
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:26.720
for a commercial related tool
company that does have open

530
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.460
source related tools that compete
against it at some level,

531
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.560
there is a high level
of antitrust from the community.

532
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.220
You're wanting to be good
and wanting to make money

533
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.560
at the same time. So
I just want to understand,

534
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.610
like, Yeah, I like to
think of this as myself.

535
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.550
I mean, I like open
source, but I like open

536
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.460
source in the way that
I like free Legos. I've

537
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.070
always felt that the things
that should be open sourced

538
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.180
are the Legos of some
appropriate size. The, when I

539
00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.690
was working at the banks,
putting the enlarge retail banking

540
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.660
systems, I was thrilled to
find things of an appropriate

541
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.690
size, like log for net
and then units and all

542
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.510
the end, you know, the
end stack. But I don't

543
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.000
think that I would want
to open source the intellectual

544
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.260
property in any large online
banking system. I think that,

545
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.310
I think it's nice when
Legos are appropriately licensed and

546
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.830
have a right size, and
then you build something awesome

547
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.980
with it. I wouldn't expect
for someone to build something

548
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.970
amazing and then suddenly opensource
that until it, it taught,

549
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.840
fit the community until the,
the, the size and the

550
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.750
topic until I have become
commoditized, I guess, is what

551
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.680
I'm saying. You know, I
don't think logging impressive. I

552
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.680
don't think, Oh, IRM is
such an amazing thing that

553
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.840
someone should have to go
and patent the heck out

554
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.610
of it. Those are the
kinds of things that should

555
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.580
just be, they should just
work. So do you guys

556
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.330
feel that the size of
most open source projects, the,

557
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.150
the scope of what they
try to solve is appropriately

558
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.260
sized right now? I think
a lot of these groups

559
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.710
take on, you know, we
tend to judge the entirety

560
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.740
of open source by the
five or six or seven

561
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.740
projects that have really done
something big and done it

562
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.830
really, really well, the Apaches
and whatever. And certainly those

563
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.320
are fantastic projects. And I
used them and I love

564
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:20.100
them, but most open source,
you know, there's nothing magic

565
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.650
about the open source sauce.
A lot of those projects

566
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:28.020
take on something and fail,
fail badly. And I think

567
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.120
it's because they try and
bite off more than they

568
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.040
can chew. And then there's
a lot of infighting and

569
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.520
who's going to do the
architecture. I think you can

570
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.230
only get so much effort
out of people who are

571
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.350
working for free before they
have to, they have to

572
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.170
make a living somehow couple
of points that I want

573
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.000
to answer that are going
by on the chat here.

574
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.670
Cause while we're having this
conversation in audio, we've got

575
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.580
people going on, live in
the chat. We had a

576
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:54.300
Fabio from in hibernate, ask
the question about licensing. And

577
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.430
as I understand it, and
again, I'm just speaking to

578
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.460
Scott. So very, very well
could make a mistake, but

579
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.760
there's nothing in the code,
flex foundation and foundation. There's

580
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.900
nothing in copex.org that is
specific to a particular license.

581
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.270
I would even go so
far to say, as copex.org,

582
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.070
doesn't prefer a license. It
doesn't even prefer MSPL. So

583
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.940
I think it would welcome
projects that are under other,

584
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.230
other licenses. I'm sure like
BSD would be a very

585
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.670
appropriate license that could, could
come under covid.org. And while

586
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.690
Plex may lean towards dotnet
projects. I don't think that

587
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:32.100
code flex is about necessarily
dotnet projects, just like the

588
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.830
Apache foundation does target towards
lamp, but there are other

589
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:41.250
things. And remember of course@coviddotorgisnotcovid.com.
And I think the sooner

590
00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:45.750
that we get a, a
chairman head of the complex

591
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:49.590
foundation who is going to
be a non-Microsoft person in

592
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.900
the open source space, the
better that we're going to,

593
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.360
we're going to get, I
think that the better things

594
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.730
are going to be, we've
got Bob, the janitor who's

595
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.620
sitting in the queue here.
Let's see, we can unmute

596
00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.930
Bob and see what Bob
has to say there. Bob

597
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.040
know I'm here. So I
came out of a very

598
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.950
heavy unit splenic shop and
came into this window shop

599
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.740
and it just blew me
away that they were so

600
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.880
anti open source. I couldn't
use any open source libraries,

601
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.730
no matter what they were.
I had to actually fight

602
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.340
to get them, to allow
me to download and unit.

603
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.150
And it was, I literally,
it blew me away that

604
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.970
we had such, Oh, no,
it opens for you. Can't

605
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.680
touch you. Can't touch it.
Oh, it's Microsoft. Oh yeah.

606
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.700
Whatever. So I actually started,
that's an interesting point. That's

607
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.920
a very interesting point because
interestingly enough, a lot of

608
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.050
people wanted to use code
and use, excuse me, use

609
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.460
jQuery even inside of Microsoft.
Then when Microsoft came out

610
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.700
and said, Hey, we're gonna,
you know, quote unquote release

611
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.090
jQuery. I think that was
already released. But basically by,

612
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.780
by, you know, wrapping our
large arms around jQuery and

613
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.200
giving it a virtual hug
that made it okay for

614
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.550
jQuery to be used by,
by opensource. Hopefully that that's,

615
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.140
you know, and I would
have to say also that

616
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.450
I said, let me, let
me, rather than saying, let

617
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.540
me ask you guys, don't
you feel more comfortable using

618
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.170
an Apache or an eclipse
or a, a product that

619
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.320
is under a foundation than
you do picking up a

620
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.590
piece of source. That's just
sitting on covid.com written by

621
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.590
some random dude who you've
never heard of, or do

622
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.840
you not, do you not
make any differentiation between a

623
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.090
project that it has the,
is under the auspices of

624
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:27.380
a foundation I'm interested. Let's
hear, let's hear the answer

625
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.760
to it. Let me actually,
let me, let me unmute

626
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.020
a mendicant there. What do
you think about that? This

627
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.380
is Mandela. And again, I
mean, I I'm coming from

628
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.940
a place that we're, we're
very heavy into opensource and

629
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.330
to me, like a foundation
doesn't really matter what matters

630
00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:48.450
more is the reputation of
the project. You know, we'll,

631
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:52.480
we'll try stuff out, but
it's a lot easier to

632
00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.840
a find a good project
and B be comfortable using

633
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.560
it. When you see other
people talking about it and

634
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.440
saying, you know, this is
great. Like we're, we're using

635
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.830
auto mapper now, which is
pretty new. And it took

636
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.800
us awhile to really kinda
finally go and check it

637
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.590
out. But you know, you
see a lot of people

638
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.140
saying, Hey, this is great.
You feel a lot better

639
00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.360
about downloading it, whether or
not it's a part of

640
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.450
a foundation. Okay. Okay. Let's
see if we can get,

641
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.560
I think Joe Pruitt had an
interesting comment. Let's unmute Joe.

642
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.000
And see what he's got
to say. Are you there,

643
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.510
Joe? Yeah. I'm here now
guys. That's gone. Yeah. Yeah.

644
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.330
And a couple, couple of
comments coming across. I think

645
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:34.810
coming from a, you know,
a corporate standpoint, you had,

646
00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.450
you had asked me to
point about, you know, somebody's

647
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:40.570
more likely to go with
a patchy or, you know,

648
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.930
somebody who's supported by a
larger foundation. And I think

649
00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.450
that that depends on the
size of the project and,

650
00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.910
and the components that you're
using. If you're using a

651
00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:51.670
big framework, probably yes. You
want something, that's got a,

652
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.120
especially with how embedded it's
going to be in your

653
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.420
projects, right. Smaller components where
you can get the source

654
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:02.290
and like logging utilities, things
like that, that are critical

655
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:08.560
to these applications. Not necessarily
interesting, interesting point. We've got

656
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.870
a Wolf bite who is
in the queue here. Let's

657
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.670
unmute, we'll fight and see
what we'll find finance to

658
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:20.680
say. Yes. Yeah. What do
the foundations, why would it

659
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:27.830
be better than when it
was back? Yeah. Okay. You're,

660
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.260
you're, you're having a heck
of a time. It sounds

661
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.700
like you're on a sip
phone, but I heard you

662
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.860
say that you wanted to
know that why is this

663
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.880
particular product better under a
foundation and under another, is

664
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.320
there a, between projects that
are under, under no foundation

665
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.190
or whether something that has
suddenly been brought into the

666
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.460
code flux universe, the copex.org
universe, is that a, is

667
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.070
that a, a better project
or a more supportable project?

668
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.320
You'll be able to, as
a person who has an

669
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.330
open source project assign the
copyright over to the foundation,

670
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.700
it, Phil had decided that
he wanted to take the

671
00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.140
subtext project and he could
a secret assign the copyright

672
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.560
of that over to the
code Plex foundation. And then

673
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.720
they would own that. And
then he would get a

674
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.200
license back. Ryan, Ryan Farley is
in the queue here to,

675
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.650
to speak. Yeah, I was
just going to mention on

676
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.930
the, on the whole question
of whether or not it

677
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.200
brings more validity to a
project that's supported by a

678
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.990
foundation rather than just something
that's hosted out there on

679
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.440
code blacks. You know, I
think as developers, we're more

680
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.100
open to use open source
things in the software that

681
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.340
we build more so than
a typical user of that

682
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.340
software might be. And, you
know, example of, you know,

683
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.870
Firefox part of the Mozilla.
I think that that is,

684
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.570
has a lot of growth
because it's supported by a

685
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.020
foundation rather than something that
somebody wrote. That's just hosted

686
00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.460
out there on source sports.
For example, I think that

687
00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.280
one of the things that's
a little bit difficult about

688
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.040
this, the creation of this
foundation is that because it

689
00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.470
was, as they call it
a soft launch, it was

690
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:04.040
a, it really left a
lot more questions than, than

691
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.680
answers. I think that when
I was looking through the

692
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.080
fact myself, I would have
liked to have a lot

693
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.790
more clarity around, well, what
do I do now? And,

694
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.630
and are there going to
be monthly calls and how

695
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.340
can I get involved and
how do I get my

696
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.700
project to be supported and
be under the auspices of

697
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.120
the foundation? I think that
hopefully the people are obviously

698
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.850
interested. We're, we're sitting here
talking about it. So it

699
00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.220
must be a, it must
be a topic that people

700
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.980
are interested in, but in
the, in the coming weeks,

701
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.010
we'll, we'll start to have
some additional transparency about what's

702
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.970
going on. We'll find out
who other advisors and other

703
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.660
members of the, of the
board of directors are gonna

704
00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.590
be. And, and then started
hearing about how, what projects

705
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.150
are going to join up.
You know, I'd love to

706
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.240
see some of the big
name projects, the end hibernates

707
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.120
and the X units, and
then unit start to get

708
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.010
involved so that someone could
point at the, the copex

709
00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.500
foundation. And, and just by
saying, Oh yeah, don't don't

710
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.530
they have don't they haven't
hibernate. Yeah. There's a lot

711
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.180
of people, a lot more
people are involved in, in

712
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.490
hibernate because of the fact
that they're in the foundation.

713
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:12.020
Now he's Scott, can you
address the issue regarding, you

714
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.290
know, focused on dotnet technologies?
Cause all the examples you

715
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:18.260
gave are.net based. Is there,
yeah, that's a good point

716
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:22.220
fronting with some non.net based
technology. I, I didn't get

717
00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.830
from the whole, you know,
FAC and things like that,

718
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.920
where the focus of the
foundation is going to be

719
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.240
with technology base. Again, speaking
only as only as Scott,

720
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.030
as I understand it, Microsoft
created the foundation because they

721
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.540
thought that there was a,
a missing piece out there

722
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.540
that a lot of existing
foundations are there to, to,

723
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:47.950
to basically support an existing
foundation. And they didn't want

724
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.260
to create the kind of
the windows foundation or the

725
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.280
visual studio foundation, but they
did have an interest in

726
00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.280
helping commercial companies use open
source. And as someone who's

727
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.040
worked really only in commercial
companies, I've never actually worked

728
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.260
for an open what you
would call an open source

729
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.160
company. I've always worked at
companies where just mentioning open

730
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.500
source, got us afraid, and
being able to, you know,

731
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.020
call a foundation or have
a foundation assist us and

732
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.280
say, this license is compatible
with your, your business goal.

733
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.890
And if you use software
into these licenses, or if

734
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.350
you license your software in
this way, or being able

735
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.140
to explain dual licenses, that
we might be able to

736
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.880
use more open source software
in commercial projects. I also

737
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.560
think that as a Microsoft
employee and I noticed, and

738
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.690
I'd be interested in if
there's any Microsoft employees on

739
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.160
the call right now that
I want to work on

740
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.600
open source projects. And you
probably know, as a, as,

741
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.030
as people who either are
in the Microsoft universe or

742
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:57.670
you orbit the Microsoft universe,
that Microsoft is notoriously picky

743
00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.580
about what employees, if any,
they allowed to work on

744
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.950
opensource projects. They really prefer
that if you're working for

745
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:06.370
Microsoft, you're not be doing
open source. I think in

746
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.670
my opinion, that the foundation
represents the beginning of a

747
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.690
change so that, you know,
somebody's working on some project

748
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:18.040
at Microsoft, let's say that
they're working on a photo

749
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.260
editor at Microsoft. Cause it's
not like we haven't got

750
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.690
enough of those. If that
person wants to work on

751
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:25.000
it hibernate and then hibernate
has nothing to do with

752
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.310
the photo editor. And it's
two different pieces of technology,

753
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.310
two different pieces of intellectual
property. That there's no reason

754
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.860
that someone couldn't be able
to work in their spare

755
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:36.850
time and donate their time.
Basically, even as a Microsoft

756
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:40.420
employee to this is not
for profit entity, this separate

757
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.720
entity that they could potentially
have their employee, their employee

758
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.300
agreement set up such that
I can work at my

759
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.220
photo editor at my job
at Microsoft. And I can

760
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.630
work on an hibernate at
night and, and it's, and

761
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:55.510
it's okay. And imagine if
kind of Microsoft released the

762
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.480
bonds of all of these
developers at Microsoft potentially, and

763
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.960
I'm just speculating here to
think about what we could

764
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.470
do. If more Microsoft employees,
good engineers could start working

765
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:06.940
on open source projects. I
don't know, it'd be pretty

766
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.810
cool. This is my belief,
and this is my hope

767
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.510
I, where the direction things
will go. But again, I'm

768
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.000
only on the board of
advisors. I'm not on the

769
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.550
board of directors. And I
think you guys realize the

770
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:24.520
difference between directing something and
advising advisors sit in the

771
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.950
back seat and scream while
the car's, where is out

772
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.340
of control. And directors typically
have control of the wheel.

773
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:35.540
I'd go to the first
guy who spoke. And that

774
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.520
was me. I was just
going to ask what your

775
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.310
personal stances on things like
nerd dinner or baby smash

776
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.470
or things that you work
on that are more along

777
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.600
the lines of samples, but
you know, still have some

778
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.880
of your personal, I mean,
how do you feel about

779
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.030
that? You know, releasing it,
not releasing it licensing, you

780
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.590
know, that kind of thing,
try to release everything that

781
00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:57.460
I work on as MSP
L. And there's also an,

782
00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.550
some talk about a new
rule inside of Microsoft, where

783
00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:03.640
to make it easier to
release code. Sometimes Microsoft employees

784
00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.220
were released small samples and
find it difficult to go

785
00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.010
through the legal hoops. But
as I understand that, that

786
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.320
if it's under a, under
a thousand lines of code,

787
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.060
then we can call it
a sample. And a Microsoft

788
00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.300
employee can potentially release less
than a thousand lines of

789
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.410
code without having to worry
about the licensing. Cause that

790
00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.600
is the know about the
size of a reasonable sample

791
00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:25.000
for larger things. I just
released as much as I

792
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.680
can and MSP out. And
that doesn't mean that I

793
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.530
wouldn't like to make money.
Honestly, if I turned to

794
00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.980
baby smash, baby smash.com, by
the way, I'm into an

795
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.530
open, into an open source
educational toolkit, I would be

796
00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.510
thinking he really awesome. I
could build a whole community,

797
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:39.190
build a corporation around it
and we can make a

798
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.980
big, I could make the
speak and spell.net, you know,

799
00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.350
and make lots of money.
But it seemed to me

800
00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.260
like releasing things like that
as MSPs is a better

801
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.650
idea. But remember back to
the discussion of Lego sizes,

802
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:55.120
both Nour dinner, and, and
baby smash, you called them

803
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.910
sample sized. You could call
them, you know, medium sized,

804
00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.810
Lego sized. I've seen people
extend both of those applications

805
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.780
and make them into more
interesting things, whether or not

806
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.270
they choose to open source.
The thing that they derive

807
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:10.330
from that is really up
to them. But I don't

808
00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.360
know if, if I had
a really great idea, if

809
00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.240
I had a Twitter sized
idea, I would probably go

810
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.850
and talk to, to legal
and, and see that I

811
00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.470
could turn it into a
commercial thing. And I would

812
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.920
hope that you would do
the same as well. So

813
00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.080
Scott think got, I've got
a question here, Scott. Okay.

814
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.920
So let's look at this
from, from the other stated

815
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.060
goal of code plex.org is
to, to help facilitate not

816
00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:38.200
only developers working on, on
open source, but also to

817
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.480
help. What am I trying
to say, corporations to use

818
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.900
open source? So shouldn't one
of their targets be Microsoft

819
00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.930
itself. What's the, one of
the first things you install

820
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.690
on any windows machine. If
you want to do any

821
00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:56.320
kind of graphics manipulation, and
you don't have Photoshop, it's

822
00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:02.560
probably paint.net, right? So like
paint.net on the DVD instead

823
00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.870
of, instead of including ms.
Paint, I mean it was

824
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.080
painted. Yeah. So just to
make sure that everyone heard

825
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:12.040
that you saying that why
isn't paint.net paintbrush, right? Why

826
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.900
didn't it literally replace it?
What is it? It's that

827
00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.110
good? Why isn't it a
replacement? Right. So, and, and

828
00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.450
most of the arguments that
I've heard of Ben, you

829
00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.400
know, well, we can't vet
the pedigree or we don't

830
00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.200
own the IP and blah,
blah, blah. We don't want

831
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.260
to take the hit. And
so maybe, maybe one of

832
00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.030
the first things that this
this foundation can do is,

833
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.550
is see if they can
get more open for shipping

834
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.780
on Microsoft DVDs. I take
where was a, was a

835
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.260
good first step. Let's see
if we can get some

836
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.920
more in there. Yeah. That
is a, that's a really

837
00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.480
good point. I know that
the people who there are

838
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.800
a lot of people who
are interested in the code

839
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.380
books foundation at Microsoft at
the, at the highest levels.

840
00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.000
And I, I hope that
we'll hear more and more

841
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.750
from those people. I'm only
excelling and advisor, and I've

842
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.870
heard general managers and different
people talk. You know, if

843
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.990
we start hearing from vice
presidents and stuff who can

844
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:06.500
start speaking to their interest
in this, maybe the foundation

845
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.280
will provide a bridge for
Microsoft to do just those

846
00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.580
things, right? I mean, Linux
distributions can, can fill their

847
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:17.090
DVDs up with great open
source products, not paint.net. In

848
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.070
the example that you gave
is not in fact, an

849
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.880
open source project, paint.net recently
went closed source. But I

850
00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.820
think that the point is
still there now. So we

851
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.400
just said, and hibernate versus
entity framework, how Microsoft found

852
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.620
a project that is going
against the core technologies. You're

853
00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.560
basically asking the question that,
you know, that if the

854
00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.940
hibernate decided to come over
to covid.org, wouldn't Microsoft be

855
00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.720
funding, something that was a
going against them. And if

856
00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.590
they were they're competing against,
this is the kind of

857
00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.420
the fundamental point, and we
should probably get ready to

858
00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.380
end the call at this
point, which is that codex.org

859
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.900
is not Microsoft. It's Microsoft
seed money. And certainly Microsoft

860
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.120
is interested in pushing it
in a certain direction, but

861
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.670
it can only Microsoft can
only push code such foundation

862
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.070
as far as it has
control over the board of

863
00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:07.700
directors and things like that.
I think that I would

864
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.820
like to see a world
where the code flex foundation

865
00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:14.090
pushes back a little bit,
gets it gets powerful enough,

866
00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:19.040
gets interesting, you know, interesting
enough that it can put

867
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.250
a little pressure on Microsoft
to, to change things. I

868
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:26.570
think that an an independent
foundation is the only way

869
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:31.730
that this is gonna work.
So I, I can't stress

870
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:35.270
enough that as someone who's
watching this from the, from

871
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.580
the inside that I would
really like to see it

872
00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.570
be independent. And I don't,
I don't, you can, you

873
00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.270
know, it's all out in
the open. If you see

874
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:47.750
something happening around the Kotex
foundation that you don't think

875
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:52.130
is transparent, then you should
sound the alarm as the,

876
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:54.740
as the, as the public.
And as, as, as interested

877
00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:58.280
individuals, you should talk to
the governance and the people

878
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.680
in charge of the foundation
and say, I don't think

879
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:06.320
that's cool. Does that help?
It makes sense to me.

880
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.630
I think one of the
reasons that code Plex is

881
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:13.100
there, especially the.org version is
to sort of give Microsoft

882
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.150
the freedom to not duck
those questions. But the answer

883
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:20.780
it's an impossible answer for
corporation to go well, we

884
00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.200
fund someone doing something against
our core technologies. I don't

885
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.070
even think of the stakeholders.
You know, the stockholder should,

886
00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.550
should deal with it. So
by sending this off to

887
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:33.880
a.org, I think their definitive
answer to that question is

888
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.460
we're going to let it
happen, but we certainly don't

889
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.160
need to directly pour our
dollars into it. And I

890
00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.280
think that's a reasonable answer
for a corporation. Yeah. And

891
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.670
I hope that you have
HP and you have IBM

892
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.830
and everyone else who wants
to get involved in fund.

893
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.980
When you have a healthy
foundation, you've got a foundation

894
00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.850
that has more as funding
from multiple locations. Just like

895
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.590
when you have a healthy
company, you have a company

896
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:59.320
that's making money from many
places so that the money

897
00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.230
stops. If you know, if
Microsoft stops funding, the Copa

898
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:05.550
foundation, that it's got funding
from other places too, to

899
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.690
keep going and keep doing
what it, what it means

900
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:10.420
to do. Hey, Scott, there's
a big call for people

901
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.120
to get involved. How do
you recommend to individuals get

902
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:17.410
involved outside of just talking
about it until, until it

903
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.390
becomes clear on the website?
So it's getting filled out.

904
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.790
Cause as I understand it,
they're moving into offices and

905
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.770
doing stuff like that, getting
servers and all these kinds

906
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.130
of things, getting infrastructure, I
think you emailed Sam Ramji

907
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:29.200
and you emailed the email
addresses of the people on

908
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.640
the board of directors. So
if you want to get

909
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.020
involved, start by emailing your
manifestos to them. I think

910
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:37.000
that that's, that's what, that's
what I would do. If

911
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.800
you email me, I'm going
to add, I'm going to

912
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.660
just add them to the
email address. That's what I'm

913
00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.000
going to do when it
comes to the copex foundation.

914
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:47.050
Cool. All right. Well, this
has been another episode of

915
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:50.140
Hansel minutes, the strangest episode
ever as we hopped from

916
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:53.620
social networking site to social
networking sites. And now as

917
00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.960
Firefox begins to lock up,
I'm going to see if

918
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.510
I can push the end
button and hopefully this, this

919
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.410
has been recorded and will
be up on my website

920
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:12.210
tomorrow. Thanks everyone for participating.
I really appreciate it. <inaudible>.
