It's Hansel minutes, a weekly

9
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.450
discussion with web developer and
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is

10
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.920
Lawrence Ryan announcing the show number
four 91. In this episode,

11
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.910
Scott talks with cat small
from SoundCloud about being a

12
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.970
designer and a front end
developer. Hi, this is Scott

13
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.190
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

14
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.070
we're talking with cat small,
she's a product designer and

15
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.480
a developer. How are you?
I'm great. How are you?

16
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.840
Fantastic. Thanks for coming on
the show today. You, you

17
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.560
are actually do so many
different things. You do product

18
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560
design, you do UX, you
do front end development, you

19
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.560
speak at conferences and you
also do a lot of

20
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.910
prototyping. And you think about
how prototyping and UX design

21
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.920
fits into the larger product
life cycle. Yeah, I it's.

22
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.370
I find it so interesting.
Just so my background is

23
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.570
I'm a bit of a
design and programming, and I've

24
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.420
always been curious throughout the
years as I've become more

25
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.270
on the design side, in
terms of user experience about

26
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.000
like how can code kind
of fit into these things?

27
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.830
Where can we, how can
designers think about the experience

28
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.500
in a way that involves
code and, and how can

29
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.590
programming really kind of enhanced
the prototyping phase of, Yeah,

30
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.920
I've tried design prototyping where
I literally just took a

31
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.280
three by five series of
cards and tried to make

32
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.070
a fake, you know, a
fake phone and like handed

33
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.390
it to a user and
like, pretend this is a

34
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.180
phone swipe. Like you would
swipe and just throw the

35
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.060
top card off, you know,
it doesn't quite work. And

36
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.400
then you see those, there's
like balsamic where you get

37
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.070
to scribble and stuff. What
do you think about those

38
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.530
interactive make, make a fake
app design tools? I think

39
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.970
they're all incredibly useful. So
I've also experimented with other

40
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.160
kinds of prototyping tools. I've
definitely done some paper prototyping

41
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.070
kinds of things. I've messed
with envision. I've messed with

42
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.720
Acture, a couple of others,
but I've always just found

43
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.770
it, I guess, because I've
been spoiled code in a

44
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.420
way. It just doesn't often
come close enough to the

45
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.210
actual experience of, of seeing
what it's like in that

46
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.270
context, being able to control
things and really make them

47
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.420
feel close to what they'd
be like in the actual

48
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.200
experience. I will say that
there are some really good

49
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.600
ones that are getting very
close, such as a framer

50
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.970
JS, which uses coffee script
or Java script. That's of

51
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.090
course still code, but it's
not nearly as in depth

52
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.560
as certain other things would
be with coding, but that's

53
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.620
been really interesting to see
happen. I think the good

54
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.530
thing is that there's so
many tools and that the

55
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.690
nice thing about that is
that everyone's got an option,

56
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.450
but I still think that
nothing comes close to the

57
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.410
actual experience of seeing what
it's like on the phone

58
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.220
or on the computer, and
really feeling that seamless experience

59
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.000
that you get with code.
Why do you think that

60
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.110
there are so many products
and companies and things that

61
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.980
are trying to keep developed
designers and UX people from

62
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.680
just coding? Like the one
that you liked the most,

63
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.870
you just said, well, I'd
use this coffee script, right?

64
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.910
Which for you as a
developer, isn't a big deal,

65
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.890
but for someone else that
might be a huge barrier,

66
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.540
but why don't we just
make them learn how to

67
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.130
code? Totally. Unfortunately not everyone
is really amenable to the

68
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.460
idea of programming or they
might've tried it and they

69
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.200
just hated it, which is
totally a valid, completely valid

70
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.920
experience. And I think there
is space for everyone. It's

71
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.660
just, it's kind of unfortunate
because there's something better when

72
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.240
you can actually program, but
it's also not just that

73
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.240
it's also that you have
that literacy in a way

74
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.940
and you can actually communicate
better with people. I think

75
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.670
some people are just not
used to it. And so

76
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.820
they're kind of a little
afraid. Some people might be

77
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.000
scared for their jobs because
like, if we have designers

78
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.890
who can code and what's
the point of a front

79
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.520
end developer, other people just
feel kind of threatened or

80
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.720
like they have to compete.
So I definitely understand why

81
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.260
some people might not want
to, to have designers who

82
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.080
code, but I think it's,
it does have its benefits

83
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.740
for sure. And I definitely
encourage anyone who is interested

84
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.750
in designing. Like they should
definitely learn about programming for

85
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.450
whatever device they're going to
be designing for. And I

86
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.810
also encourage developers to learn
about design because like one,

87
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.620
when we have more people
kind of blending, I think

88
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.030
there's a really interesting thing
that happens there. Yeah. You

89
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.670
bring up a really interesting
point though, that it's going

90
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.460
to end up on the
phone eventually, like, let, let

91
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.220
us as designers not forget
that, like it's really great

92
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.240
to do crazy stuff and
illustrator or Photoshop then only

93
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.220
to be told later by
the developer that that's not

94
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.890
possible. If you're a developer
though, you would know that.

95
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.150
Totally. Yeah. And so one
of the things I also

96
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.040
really encourage people to do
if they're not going to

97
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.160
learn to code is to
at try to communicate as

98
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.800
often as possible. But I
definitely think that when designers

99
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.890
learn how to code, they
learned the limitations of whatever

100
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.350
they're working with and they
learn the capabilities of what

101
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.920
they're working with. They learn
how exactly to communicate with

102
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.820
people who are going to
be building it out. And

103
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.510
so there's, there's just like
wonderful benefits. There's so many

104
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.310
of them it's, it's like
hard to name all of

105
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.320
them, but then you also
start thinking in a different

106
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.760
way, you think earlier about
animations and interactivity and those

107
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.000
kinds of things. And so
instead of sticking to something

108
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.030
that feels really static in
a way you end up

109
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.220
with something that feels more
fluid and natural, I think,

110
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.710
And if you're familiar with
the way animations should look

111
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.150
on Android versus iOS and
how the, for lack of

112
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.350
a better word, the idiomatic
UX style of that particular

113
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.750
platform, as opposed to what
we often see, which is

114
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.140
like an app from, I
don't know, a unnamed company

115
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.070
that looks like a named
company's app on every platform,

116
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.680
as opposed to looking like
it's comfortable within the material

117
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.880
design or it's comfortable within
iOS design. Totally. Yeah. I

118
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.280
mean, that's the other wonderful
part and I've actually started

119
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.150
learning a bit of Android
development for that reason because

120
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.420
I wanted to understand what
are Android components? How does

121
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.700
Android specifically work? And the
other thing I try to

122
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.750
do is actually use a
product from each operating system.

123
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.270
So I do have windows
on my Mac. I have,

124
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.880
I don't have a windows
phone yet, but I do

125
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.520
want to get one or
a windows tablet to get

126
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.400
that experience. I also have
an iPad. I have an

127
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.380
Android phone and I just
really try to make sure

128
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.960
I am familiar with all
of these things, because again,

129
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.930
it goes back to being
able to communicate properly about

130
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.610
it and understanding what makes
each operating system special. The

131
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.020
same thing applies to coding
when you understand why programming

132
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.910
is important and what it
does and how you can

133
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.290
use it, you have this
understanding that other people just

134
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.080
unfortunately don't have. And it
becomes another strength in your

135
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.050
toolkit Backing up a little
bit. You touched on a

136
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.160
really interesting point, which was
potentially management could say, Oh,

137
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.430
well, the dev designer can
code. Therefore we don't need

138
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.820
a front end developer as
if, you know, first as

139
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.140
if people are interchangeable like
that. Right. Yeah. It's so

140
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.920
sad. Oh, so that's the
thing is I think, I

141
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.860
think there's space for, for
everyone to, to kind of

142
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.500
exist in the environment. I
think that the good thing

143
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.110
about being at sound cloud
is that there is space

144
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.290
for someone like me. Who's
more of a hybrid. And

145
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.930
the thing that I've been
able to do is code

146
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.180
a prototype up to a
certain point. And I'm still

147
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.300
definitely working on figuring out
what is the best time

148
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.630
to start doing that kind
of thing. But it's really

149
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.680
been great to kind of
just be able to prototype

150
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.250
something, test it on enough,
people modify the prototype and

151
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.040
then do some screenshots or
some kind of thing to

152
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.150
communicate with the front end
engineers and the back end

153
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.640
engineers and say, this is
what we're going to build.

154
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.100
And then I just, just
being able to give that

155
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.840
to them, for them to,
in a lot of cases,

156
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.690
just copy and paste code
from has been really amazing

157
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.680
and interesting to experiment with.
Well, that's interesting. So I

158
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.300
was right with, I was
right with you. I was

159
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.400
like nodding and nodding, and
then you said, copy and

160
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.710
paste code from, and then
that got me asking myself,

161
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.380
well, wait a second. When
you express this, when you

162
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.350
express this design in the
code, are you saying it

163
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.890
should look like this developer?
Or are you saying it

164
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:30.620
should be this and developer?
Are you expressing intent with

165
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.800
code or are you getting
them started? Are you jump-starting

166
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.990
their project by giving them
code that they can, like

167
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.260
you said, copy paste from
Ideally somewhere in the middle.

168
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.790
That's the hope is that.
And again, I'm still trying

169
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.950
to, like every time I
work on a new project,

170
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.000
I'm trying to figure out
exactly where, where this happens

171
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.610
and how it happens. And
I, I've also worked with

172
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.090
different people who kind of
have different preferences. Some people

173
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.300
I've prototyped things, and they've
just been like, well, why

174
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.150
aren't you just building this,
like in the repository, just

175
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.000
go do that. And that's
been really interesting and really

176
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.720
great because I love, you
know, getting to just ship

177
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.850
production stuff. Like that's really
cool, but some people are

178
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.390
also a little bit more
protective of their environment or

179
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.300
like the repository that we're
actually shipping stuff on. So

180
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.200
in those cases it's better
to, in their case, like

181
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.040
copy paste or perhaps they
just are coding in a

182
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.740
different way. And they kind
of have like certain preferences

183
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.010
around how they're building things.
And so it really kinda

184
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.010
depends, but I think in
most cases, in most cases,

185
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.340
we're definitely starting to communicate
more. This is the exact

186
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.520
intent, this is how it's
just kind of take it

187
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.000
from here and the rest.
I mean, like you don't

188
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.340
have as much to do,
but it's really about refining

189
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.860
it and making sure that
it's production ready instead You're,

190
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.990
you're describing though, it seems
like you're being very polite

191
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.930
about it though, that people's
egos sometimes get in the

192
00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.040
way of UX versus dev
and some want a bright

193
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.010
line and some are like,
Oh great. You know, cat

194
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.170
wrote 40% of that. I'll
just keep going in the

195
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.790
direction she was going. Totally.
I think it is funny

196
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.320
to watch those kinds of
dynamics happen. I love working

197
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.260
with people who are really
flexible, but that isn't always

198
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.590
the case, unfortunately. And a
lot of people are still

199
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.330
kind of afraid or they're
just, they think that development

200
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.640
is done in one way.
And that's not always the

201
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.900
case. It's been interesting because
I've been looking into different

202
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.990
methodologies and different ways of
thinking. Like there's been a

203
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.900
really interesting movement called balanced
team, and that's been really

204
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.260
cool because it's people who
are all hybrids and grow

205
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.340
a really flexible balance balanced
or balanced team, balanced team.

206
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.250
Yeah. They're really, really interesting.
And they're all about the

207
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:53.830
idea of hybrid designers, developers,
researchers, managers, like all of

208
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.350
that kind of stuff. And
I think it's really interesting

209
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.870
because I think as time
goes on, people are becoming

210
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.520
definitely more flexible, but I
also totally understand the fear

211
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.160
that some people have, because
again, some people might be

212
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.520
afraid that they could lose
their job because who needs

213
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.580
a front end developer when
there's a UX designer or

214
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.460
product designer who can code.
But I think again, there's

215
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.730
space for all of these
people because the more hands

216
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.670
you have on deck, the
more you can do. And

217
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.270
it's just so helpful to
have someone whose main focus

218
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.200
is, is really about refining
and producing this code rather

219
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.590
than kind of like prototyping
this thing, getting into the,

220
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.350
to the best in terms
of the experience that the

221
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.230
person's in to see, and
then kind of like going

222
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.540
off to the next thing
really. And I also think

223
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.680
that I tend to be
a bit, I get to

224
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.060
finish something and then I
want to go to the

225
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.280
next thing. I don't want
to really spend that much

226
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.250
time refining it until I've
had space from it. And

227
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.870
then I want to come
back later and see, what

228
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.880
can we do next to
really make this even better?

229
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.040
One thing that you said,
you've said now twice separately

230
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.920
in two different parts of
our conversation today is the

231
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.350
concept of being afraid that
you might lose your job.

232
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.570
And I, I, I'm glad
that you say that. I

233
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.520
love that you said that
because I have felt that

234
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.650
way also. And I've felt
like I also relate back

235
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.350
and forth between, well, should
I be a deep expert

236
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.470
on this thing? Or should
I be a Swiss army

237
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.140
knife and be kind of
good at a bunch of

238
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.570
little things. And I keep
hearing people use this term

239
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.420
full stack developer, except I
feel that they're using it

240
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.580
in the wrong way because
they're implying that they are

241
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.780
literally awesome at everything as
opposed to being generalists. And

242
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.270
I'm curious where you, what
do you think about that?

243
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.530
Totally. So I often advise
people to do the whole

244
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.520
T-shaped thing where it's like
they have like broad experience

245
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.860
and then they're really deep
in something like they have

246
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.470
really deep experience in like
one or a couple of

247
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.150
things. I definitely would consider
myself to be a generalist.

248
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.740
I think it's really about
personal preference because some people

249
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.220
are just naturally, they just
don't like doing a bunch

250
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.740
of different things. They want
to focus on one thing

251
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.930
and just go with that.
And I think there should

252
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.120
be space for those kinds
of people and they should

253
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.690
feel comfortable because again, like
a person who's a generalist

254
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.950
often needs to feel like
satisfied by doing a bunch

255
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.200
of different things. So there'll
be hopping back and forth

256
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.110
between something. And while they're
hopping back and forth between

257
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.830
doing different things, you've got
a person who's specializing, who's

258
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.500
working on the things that
the generalist kind of hopped

259
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.590
between. And so I think
there's like this natural kind

260
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.870
of rhythm that can be
created by having both kinds

261
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.270
of people. And I think
it sounds, I thought we've

262
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.370
done a pretty good job
with that by, you know,

263
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.240
asking people, are you interested
in like working across different

264
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.130
platforms or do you just
kind of want to work

265
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.980
on one thing? And I
think we're pretty open to

266
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.350
both of those kinds of
people, because they're, again, just

267
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.160
so important to have and
think it's also kind of

268
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.360
like another kind of diversity
working style diversity. Yeah. I

269
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.610
think you're right. I think
also it needs to be

270
00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.850
said at some level, either
the team leader level or

271
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.510
at the company culture level,
that it's okay to have

272
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:10.360
picked one style because I
I'm afraid sometimes I have

273
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.730
been doing this for 20
years and there have been

274
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.860
times when I'll, let me
give you an example, I'll

275
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.160
work with someone who's a
performance tuning person and they'll

276
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.040
take my code and they'll
make it 10 X faster.

277
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.380
Right. And they're like, Hey,
look, we made a 10

278
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.330
X factor and they're totally
cool about it. But then

279
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.840
in my mind, I'm like,
wow, my code sucked 10

280
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.350
times worse than it does
now. I really should be

281
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.330
better at that. But then
I realized that as you

282
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.520
said, this is a great
analogy. Is there a T

283
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.370
shaped person where they go
deep, deep, deep into perf?

284
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.280
And then I feel guilty.
I feel like an imposter

285
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.920
that I did not know
how to do that, but

286
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.830
you have to accept that
you can't know all of

287
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.740
that stuff deeply. Can you?
Yeah. I mean, I feel,

288
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.610
I actually feel like that
all the time, just because,

289
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.120
you know, like when you're
doing so much stuff, sometimes

290
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.760
you don't have the time
or the ability to really

291
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.010
focus down on one thing
as much as you might

292
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.580
like to. But yeah. I
mean, I think it comes

293
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.120
down to, again, like just
having, being in a workplace

294
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.940
where people can comfort you
and give you that comfort

295
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.270
that, you know, just because
you're like focusing on programming

296
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.540
something and then researching something
and then designing the experience

297
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.390
and then doing all these
other things that you can

298
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.060
still, like, there is still
a place for you there.

299
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.700
And the more that we
have companies that do that

300
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.520
and stop relying completely on
one type of person or

301
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.520
the other type of person,
I think that'll be really

302
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.400
helpful in the future in
terms of like making sure

303
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.290
that people don't feel like
they need to compete with

304
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.230
each other or that they
need to do something that

305
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.230
just really doesn't jive well
with the way they personally

306
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.930
work. And do you think
it also has to do

307
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.020
with the size of the
project? Like you've worked on

308
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.750
small projects on the side
and open source and things

309
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.850
and you know, you and
three or four people in

310
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.910
20,000 lines of code is
one thing, but then you

311
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.490
want a team with 50
to 100 people and a

312
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.370
million lines of code is
a whole other universe and

313
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.170
how you interact and how
you work on those things.

314
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.380
Yeah. That's been the most
interesting part of being at

315
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.650
sound cloud, I think is
just figuring out, like, how

316
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.370
can I contribute to code
and how can I still

317
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.770
do design work and how
can I be a generalist

318
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.400
in here? Like we have
our UX research team, we've

319
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.730
got product designers, we have
a marketing team, we have

320
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.450
front end developers and back
end developers. Everyone's been really

321
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.480
supportive, but that's because the
culture and the environment has

322
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.050
been created and cultivated around
that kind of supportive feeling.

323
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.280
But yeah, I mean, it's,
it's definitely really interesting to

324
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.540
see, like when you get
to, you know, 200 million users,

325
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.050
how can you still have
generalists working on things? Because

326
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.470
again, it goes back to
that performance factor need to

327
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.740
have this code ready to
work for millions of people.

328
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.120
So I've definitely been looking
into exactly how do people

329
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.880
write code at SoundCloud because
there is a specific style.

330
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.650
And I think that's one
of the interesting things that

331
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.740
you can do is when
your company gets large enough,

332
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.570
you need to have a
style guide for these kinds

333
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.850
of things. You need to
make sure that your documentation

334
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.970
is well written. All of
these things really help to

335
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.300
enable not only generalists, but
people who want to eventually

336
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.000
be specialists in, in whatever
they're working on at your

337
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.790
company. I think all of
those things are really helpful

338
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.260
for both kinds of people.
When you are dealing with

339
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.330
a product that's going to
touch that many people like

340
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.450
Sydney, you know, millions and
millions, tens of millions, hundreds

341
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.120
of millions of people. How
do you have ever have

342
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.880
a sense of analysis paralysis
where it's like, I want

343
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.190
this animation to work like
this, but then when you

344
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.710
find that, well, 25% of
our users have crappy video

345
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.390
cards or what they like.
And you just, you, you

346
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.690
can imagine, right. That the
decision tree goes so far.

347
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.150
Where does that, where do
those things get figured out?

348
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.430
Do you suss them out
or does it animation experts

349
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.870
test them out or can
you figure them out in

350
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:57.440
production? It's a complicated process
for sure. I think what

351
00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.930
we usually end up doing
is a lot of times

352
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.260
we'll look at analytics. So
we have a lot of

353
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.580
insights and analytics at SoundCloud,
and we really focus a

354
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.340
lot on it because we
want to understand what our

355
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.070
capabilities are. So a lot
of the times what will

356
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.410
help me make decisions in
terms of, can we do

357
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.600
this thing? Can we animate
this thing? Can we use

358
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.290
this component? Can we use
Flexbox for example, it's really

359
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:25.280
about how well supported is
it and how many people

360
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.970
are using something that supports
it. So that's been a

361
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:33.380
really interesting set of conversations
that we've had. I do

362
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.800
end up doing a lot
of contributing to decision making

363
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.730
regarding those things. It involves
a lot of facilitating conversations

364
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.970
between people. And I actually
find that to be very

365
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.180
interesting as well, because I
don't know, there's something fun

366
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.940
about kind of just talking
to someone and being like,

367
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.820
Oh, you know, can we
do this cool new thing?

368
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.100
And you know, they'll say
like, Oh, okay, how many

369
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.200
people can actually see this
cool new thing that we

370
00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.890
want to do? Oh, only
like 8%. Maybe we should

371
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.960
do it, you know, in
like a year or so,

372
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.940
like put it on the
backlog for now. We'll think

373
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.160
about doing it later, or
we'll try to find a

374
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.790
workaround to make it work
now, but it is really

375
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.340
about how many people can
see those kinds of things,

376
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.210
analytics, you know, past data
in terms of usage, all

377
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.880
those kinds of things, and
then the technical capability. So

378
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.730
I really that's the also
the really interesting part of,

379
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.480
of being in technology and
user experience design is just

380
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.310
trying to see what are
the cool new things that

381
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.680
we could be doing. And
then like how, how much

382
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.290
can we actually do right
now? Doesn't it seem like

383
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.540
though the web is starting
to kind of the beginning

384
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.390
of this hockey stick where,
you know, internet Explorer is

385
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.260
going to die. Everything is
going to be evergreen. Suddenly

386
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.810
Safari is holding the web
back, but for people that

387
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.980
are on evergreen browsers that
are updating every 20 minutes,

388
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.890
maybe it's less than a
year before you can do

389
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.020
that crazy thing. Maybe it'll
be a couple of months.

390
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.410
Like, it seems like there's,
there's nontechnical parent who never

391
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:01.170
upgrades and then there's everyone
else. Yeah. I mean, it's

392
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:05.880
so interesting. Just the fact
that you said Safari's like

393
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.490
the one holding people back
now that always kind of

394
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.280
blows my mind because before
they were kind of like

395
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.940
the new thing, but yeah,
I think I'm, I'm really

396
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.400
excited. Yeah, totally. It's, it's
so sad, but that is,

397
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.520
it's pretty much what's going
to happen. I think, unless

398
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.180
they really continue to, you
know, up their browser game.

399
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.530
I think that it's, that's
really an interesting point. Like

400
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.220
that's, it totally is the
future. I'm, I'm so happy

401
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.060
that automated updates everything now,
just because it really enables

402
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.090
people to experiment way faster.
Like how long it took

403
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.720
us to wait for, you
know, six and seven and

404
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.160
eight to actually go away.
That was years, decades, some

405
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.750
cases like 10 years plus
it's, I'm just so happy

406
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.510
that we're at this point
now where, you know, Flexbox

407
00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.820
came in and I was
able to start messing with

408
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.480
it pretty immediately because WebKit,
I supported by so many

409
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.490
browsers and then the rest
of them had already started

410
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.240
implementing it. Yeah. I think
that I, I hope that

411
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.180
the web continues to, to
enable us to do things

412
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.300
faster and faster. And I'm
so happy. I'm just so

413
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.110
excited. Have you had any
situations where these automatic upgrades

414
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.690
have been automatically breaking stuff
where you just wake up

415
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.400
one day and you're like,
Oh, well this whole section

416
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.240
of our site's broken now.
Thanks Chrome. Or whatever Definitely

417
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.310
happened with Chrome before. We've
yeah. So there have been

418
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.540
some cases where gladly, a
lot of browsers will have

419
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.570
like a beta version where
they'll implement these things for

420
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.730
like the overnight updates. And
then some, a lot of

421
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.130
people don't have those versions.
They've got the ones that

422
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.500
update like maybe once a
month or so. So we'll

423
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.110
have advanced warning and then
we'll try to implement fixes

424
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.130
beforehand. But yeah, there definitely
have been cases where it's

425
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.770
like, ah, this is going
to happen soon. Ah, it's

426
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.640
happening now? Like they've implemented
the monthly update and we're

427
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.770
screwed and we need to
fix this right now. But

428
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.900
you know, it's just a
part of the ever changing

429
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.050
world and keeping up with
things. Yeah. Yeah. I've just

430
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.060
upgraded this laptop to, to
windows 10. And there's a

431
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.260
white list internally for enterprises
that says these websites will

432
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.720
never change. They're old and
they suck and we know

433
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.410
it. So when you visit
those websites with edge, edge

434
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.820
says, sorry, this is the
expense reporting system sucks. You

435
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.120
have to use internet Explorer.
So internet Explorer is like

436
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.000
frozen and Amber like Jurassic
park. Right. It'll never change.

437
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.180
So it seems like, like
we were talking before that

438
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.660
there's nontechnical parent who is
stuck and then there's the

439
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.830
evergreen people. Like the enterprise
people are stuck, right. They're

440
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.070
going to keep using crappy
that they wrote 10 years

441
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.230
ago and everyone else is
going to use a fresh

442
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.360
new browser. That's kind of
interesting the way you put

443
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.910
it. It kind of feels
like a two class system

444
00:23:54.910 --> 00:24:03.520
of the internet, which is
interesting dystopian feeling. Yeah. I

445
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.760
mean, it's interesting because I
used to actually work at,

446
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.530
at a part of the
government I'm specifically doing web

447
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:16.900
design for them. And that
was a really interesting experience

448
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.050
because even though this was
in 2008, you know, getting

449
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:24.520
Photoshop was really hard and
getting everything I needed, like

450
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.030
Dreamweaver, which was okay to
use at the time. And

451
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:32.590
I had to use XP
for windows. It was, it

452
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.320
was really a different experience
from what I was used

453
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.850
to. I was used to
using a Mac and I

454
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.210
was used to having everything
pretty easily available to me.

455
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.240
But it was a prime
example of like what that

456
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.170
experience is probably still like
for a lot of people.

457
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.560
Yeah. I mean, it's, it's
a very complicated thing to

458
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.530
think about. And I wonder
like how can we really

459
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.710
make that transition better for
people and faster for people,

460
00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.580
My wife on her laptop,
she uses Chrome and she's

461
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.790
going to school at these
colleges. And you would think

462
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.220
that you spend all this
money on a college, you

463
00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.340
would have really great, awesome
software. It is like surfing

464
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.940
the web in like 1997.
She is installing old versions

465
00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.610
of Firefox because her professor
is saying like, if you

466
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.390
want to use Blackboard or
whatever, stupid collaboration app, that's

467
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.290
not something basic like Skype,
like GoTo meeting, old ass

468
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.680
version, Santa swore in my
old pet podcast. That was

469
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:32.230
bad. Yeah. If you're using
like these old collaboration softwares

470
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.210
that you have to use
specific versions of her. So

471
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.520
I might I'm like, why
do you have Chrome? I

472
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.450
E Firefox and edge all
open? Oh, well I've learned,

473
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.250
and this is not my
not, my wife is not

474
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:47.140
technical. I've learned that these
sites want these browsers that's

475
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.590
way more than anyone should
ever have to suffer. That's

476
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.340
unacceptable. Totally. Yeah. I mean,
I remember that was a

477
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.500
really big thing that people
would do. And I guess

478
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.780
they were still trying to
do when they don't want

479
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.830
to rebuild their sites is
that they'll throw up a,

480
00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.180
this site is optimized for
Firefox kind of thing. And

481
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.280
it's like, optimized Air quotes,
optimized. How does that even

482
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.010
happen? Why don't they just
say it? Like, they literally

483
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.670
say optimized for this horrible
old version of this browser.

484
00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:22.570
This site is old. We
will never upgrade this site.

485
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.700
We are sorry. We have
no money going and go

486
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.300
browse with Safari. Yeah. Maybe
that'd be a better way

487
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.010
of putting it. And then
maybe they can have like

488
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.560
a sign up form and
like a donation form. And

489
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.600
then they'll have a new
website in like two years

490
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.060
and it'll be great. I
never had to cut users

491
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.430
off completely with just the,
sorry. You're now that you're

492
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.670
the 1% and not the
good 1% that have lots

493
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.220
of money. You're the 1%
that have ISX. You're done.

494
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.330
Goodbye. Come back later. Yeah.
We've had to do that

495
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.720
at SoundCloud. Actually we had
a version switch from what

496
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.900
is called classic to the
new version of the site.

497
00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.050
And some people were incredibly
attached to the old version.

498
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.760
So we kept it around
for a bit and we

499
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.520
had the ability to turn
on the new version. But

500
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.160
then we just had to
say, it's just, unfortunately not

501
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.230
worth the amount of maintenance
that we're putting in. We

502
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.950
just really need to just
switch everyone over. We're turning

503
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.380
it off at this point.
Sorry. All of you, like,

504
00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.260
we love you, but like
we can't. Well, who is

505
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.060
all of you though? Is
it like, sorry, both of

506
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.110
you too. Sorry. All 15
of you. Like, you're great.

507
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.940
I mean, it was a
fairly, like a lot of

508
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.480
people definitely were really attached
to that version and we

509
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.760
tried our hardest to support
it, but there is just

510
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.910
a point at which you're
spending more time supporting an

511
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.870
older version of something then
working on improving the site

512
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:40.910
and working on new versions
of it. And sometimes you

513
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.520
just have to let it
go after a bit. Yeah.

514
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.340
It's also difficult from a
designer's perspective that do you

515
00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.280
let it be ugly? Like
it's totally functional. It just

516
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.870
doesn't look right. Because web
fonts are because SVGs, like

517
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.960
my blog doesn't look right
on old Android devices, but

518
00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.230
I don't block them. I
mean, I should probably shame

519
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.970
them. I should probably pop
up a banner and just

520
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.810
tell them that they're bad
people, but you don't. Yeah.

521
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.380
I mean, I think, yeah,
you just kind of let

522
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.370
that, you just let them
go. It's a sad way

523
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.140
to say it, but yeah.
You know, I mean, if

524
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.920
you're, if a person refuses
for some reason to, to

525
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.820
update to something new, you
there's, you just can't support

526
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.970
them forever. It's just, unfortunately
not really the way evolution

527
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:34.760
works. They, yeah, I went
there. It's true though. Right?

528
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.650
I mean, do they deserve
a nice looking web? I

529
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.230
mean, if they can, there's
the other thing too, is

530
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.960
about like affordability of things.
I mean, in terms of

531
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.050
school, a lot of the
time they can't really afford

532
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.600
to, to upgrade to these
new things and same with

533
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.880
the city government. Like I
totally understood why they were

534
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.020
so cost efficient and really
asking why do you need

535
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.550
this thing? Why do you
need this thing? And it's

536
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.940
because they have to spend
so much money and, and

537
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.260
really for a lot of
people, technology just, isn't very

538
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.080
affordable in terms of keeping
up with everyone else. And

539
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.420
especially with our two year,
actually now it's like a

540
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.660
one year phone cycle or
even a six month cycle

541
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.630
for like new technology. In
some cases it's very intense

542
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.090
On that. That's a really
good point. And I, I,

543
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.800
you know, you could see
where you and I were

544
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.480
going, but I think we
both pulled back for a

545
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.400
second there when we realized
that it should not be

546
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:29.180
about economics, right. You should
be able to have a

547
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.110
free evergreen web, but this
also brings up that point.

548
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.940
Like you have some old,
but totally functional software. Why

549
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.850
should you have to update
it to use something fancy?

550
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.320
It works like that. It
works. So it's a little

551
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.750
bit unfortunate that some of
the evergreen browsers don't have

552
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.730
a compatibility mode to just
say, Hey, Chrome, 58. Can

553
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.840
you just be Chrome 34
for just a minute? Yeah,

554
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.540
that would be beautiful. I
mean, I know there's the

555
00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.380
concept of graceful degradation and
that's been, I love that.

556
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.870
That has been kind of
a methodology that a lot

557
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.200
of people have taken, like
how some browsers don't support

558
00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.570
quarter radius, blah, blah, blah.
But they still look acceptable

559
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.580
and they still function acceptably.
Yeah. I think it like,

560
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.550
ideally that would definitely be
a mode where a website

561
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.700
would just automatically transition when
like it reads the head

562
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.860
or something of the site.
And it says like, Oh,

563
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.880
this is good for Firefox
this version, Safari, this version,

564
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.460
et cetera, et cetera. I
think that would definitely help

565
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.400
to solve a lot of
problems in certain cases, especially

566
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.680
since we've got so many
testing sites where it's like,

567
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.750
Oh, this is how it
looks across. Well, how do

568
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.990
you fix these problems when
you encounter? Yeah. If you

569
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.600
could, if the, if the
site could carry along with

570
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.910
it, an explanation of these
other features that I need,

571
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.100
and I know some of
them are old, but please

572
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:52.530
don't take these features away.
Cool. Well, thanks so much

573
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.330
for chatting with me today.
This has been super fun.

574
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.180
Of course. Thank you so
much. So people can check

575
00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.000
you out at cat, small.com
and learn about, and also

576
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.190
I want to real quick,
quickly, you made a video

577
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.630
game, you made a couple
of video games. Can we

578
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.280
play these online or can
we buy them in an

579
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.400
app store? Yes. So you
can play some of my

580
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.960
free games on my website,
cat, small.com and prism shell

581
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:17.160
has also been released on
iOS, Android, windows, and Mac.

582
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.490
And you can go to
prism, shell.com to learn more

583
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:24.180
about that. Very cool. We'll
put both prism, shell and

584
00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.130
links to the apps in
the app store and your

585
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:30.240
website in the show notes.
Awesome. This has been another

586
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.910
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.

587
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:40.500
