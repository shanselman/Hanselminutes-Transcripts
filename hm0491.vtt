a weekly discussion with web

9
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.260
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.390
number four 95. In this
episode, Scott talks with Don

11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.240
C Hayes about the intersection
of physical computing and creative

12
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.240
coding. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

13
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.070
of Hansel minutes. And right
now I'm talking with a

14
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.430
coder tinkerer and adjunct professor,
Don C Hayes. How are

15
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.700
you? Great. I appreciate you
coming on to talk to

16
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.950
me today. One of the
reasons I wanted to talk

17
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.710
to you was because it
feels like in your work

18
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.090
you're exploring not just coding,
but the intersection of physical,

19
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.380
physical computing and the creativity
of, of programming and thinking

20
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.000
about it in ways that
I think a lot of

21
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.460
people haven't thought about it
before. Yeah, I think that

22
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.920
was definitely a case when
I first got started, which

23
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.210
was around 2009, I think
then it was more about

24
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.150
just letting people know what,
you know, how basic things

25
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.160
work. Like this is a
microcontroller and this is an

26
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.730
led and this is electricity.
And I think now so

27
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.380
many people were hearing about
things like MakerBot and Arduino

28
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.440
and raspberry PI and, and
it's, it's become super trendy

29
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.050
now. So it, well, maybe
not trendy, but, but more

30
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.440
into the mainstream now. So
it's, it's less of a

31
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.170
difficult thing to have a
conversation about, Hey, we should

32
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.610
start incorporating this into wherever
our learning environment is. So

33
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.460
Yeah. Why was, do you
think that nerds are still

34
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.860
a thing? Like I remember
like in the eighties, if

35
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.410
you had a soldering iron
or in the nineties, if

36
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.900
you had a garage full
of stuff, you know, you're,

37
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.180
you're a little weird, you
know, you visit someone's house,

38
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.290
you see their space and
then you see the clutter

39
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.740
and everyone's clutter is different,
right? There's a certain kind

40
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.270
of stereotype of, Oh, you're
one of those people you're

41
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.300
in the garage. Right? Evil
scientist, I think was the

42
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.730
word I was looking for.
But now I feel like

43
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.710
there's a lot more stuff
to make and there's a

44
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.500
lot more tools to use.
Definitely. Well, I think nerd

45
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.420
is kind of sexy now,
right? So, I mean, you've

46
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.020
got big bang theory. You've
got people looking really good.

47
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.760
Like, I mean, when I
was growing up and I

48
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.400
was definitely a nerd, I
was not cute. You know

49
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.560
what I mean? Like when
you were a nerd in

50
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.110
those days, eighties kid, you
really look like a nerd.

51
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.390
And I think today it's,
it's, it's, it's chic is

52
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.320
trendy. Nerds are, are probably
more manicured than they had

53
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.060
been. But I think the
interesting thing out of that

54
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.020
is it's it's, it's now
cool to be smart. It's

55
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.110
now cool to actually like
know something that maybe no

56
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.630
one else does. Like today
your rock star is considered

57
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.020
like a coder or an
entrepreneur, not just the person

58
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.580
who like, you know, bangs
on her drums in their

59
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.690
garage. So I think that's
been great. I think some

60
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.330
of the reason that that's
probably become the case now

61
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.090
is because we have more
people are actually interested in

62
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.360
reaching out to a greater
audience. So in my case,

63
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.000
like I teach a class
called hacking and building and

64
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.180
city university, New York. And I
expect that most students are

65
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.430
going to come in, not
having had any background at

66
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.450
all in electronics or programming,
have no idea what a

67
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.310
soldering iron is. Don't even
know where to get these

68
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.730
parts. And, but they are
interested because, you know, the

69
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.960
first thing I ever asked
me was, Oh, so we're

70
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.270
going to break into like
the FBI or CIA, which,

71
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.850
you know, that's always, I
can neither confirm nor deny

72
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.390
that. But I think that
because we're starting to see,

73
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.460
you know, the nerd is
now, you know, super rich,

74
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.970
right? You think of your
Facebook founder, even Microsoft and

75
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.330
people are curious or they're,
they're thinking like, what can

76
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.910
I build next then? And
you have more opportunity in

77
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.910
the form of hackathons and
in a form of contest

78
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.700
and in a form of,
of, of Kickstarters and crowdfunding.

79
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.150
So it's getting open now,
so that it's not a

80
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.690
matter of so much. Can
I do it, but what

81
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.610
do I want to do
and what resources are available

82
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.310
to me? So I think
what started out maybe seem

83
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.760
like, okay, be here today,
gone tomorrow is now just

84
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.660
almost expected that some aspect
of what you're doing and

85
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.490
what you might do, whether
it be, you know, you're

86
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.960
going to go to school
and then do a computer

87
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.360
science degree, or you're going
to be a full developer,

88
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.240
web developer will have some
aspect of kind of the

89
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.320
nerdy factor, but in a
very cool way. So I

90
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.360
want to dig into what
you said there is that

91
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.180
when people come in, they
don't necessarily have the preconceived

92
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.580
notions maybe that we did
in the past. They're like,

93
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.590
Oh, okay, this is how
this is done. And they

94
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.650
just, they jump in, you're
teaching people from all walks

95
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.640
of life who come into
your class. Yeah. I mean

96
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.990
the average student is probably
traditional college age. So anywhere

97
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.780
between 18 and again, a
few seniors. So 20 to

98
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.110
21, the courses are required.
So I don't want to

99
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.790
make it sound like it's
just so exciting to everybody.

100
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.630
It's just not, self-selected like,
Hey, It is, it's not

101
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.080
selected. Self-selected if you are
a communications technology major, but

102
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.820
I do get quite a
few students who are not

103
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.600
majors who take it as
an elective. And what I

104
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.450
find is that most of
them, if they've read the

105
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.660
syllabus are still not quite
sure what they're going to

106
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.170
encounter, but they're excited about
this idea of like we

107
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.680
purposing something. And then most
of them have heard of

108
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.020
three D printing. They've heard
of things like MakerBot. So

109
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.630
they're really excited about getting
into digital fabrication when it

110
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.900
comes to things like physical
computing, making your own, you

111
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.810
know, interactive wearables, or even
talking about some, some more

112
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.380
emergent technologies, like Bluetooth, low
energy. That's the kind of

113
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.680
thing that we delve into
maybe about halfway through once

114
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.470
they've got a confidence that
they can suddenly know what

115
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.480
it means to, you know,
cause an led light up

116
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.710
polarity, things of that nature.
So the first exercise I

117
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.210
do for a lot of
students is just have them

118
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.640
bring something in that, you
know, it was old or

119
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.890
dusty. Hopefully not. They're a
little brother's toy and just

120
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.340
tear it apart. And it's
really interesting sort of the

121
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.860
expressions and the response, because
a lot I'm like, wow,

122
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.930
like, I didn't know all
this was in here. Sometimes

123
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.060
it's very simple stuff. So
they're like, I didn't know.

124
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.310
It was just these few
parts. How does that work

125
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.100
together? But I think they're
the bridge between seeing what

126
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.230
at one point looked like,
just this thing that I'm

127
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.290
not concerned with, what's inside.
I just, I'm just consuming

128
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.820
this. I mean, they don't
say it that way. Black

129
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.340
box. Exactly. And then having
the sort of the reality

130
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.750
are reasonably and all of
a sudden that they can

131
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.150
actually build something like this.
Even if it's a rapid

132
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.030
flimsy prototype, it excites a
lot of them. Some people,

133
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.190
you know, end up deciding
they want to continue on

134
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.690
and some say, you know,
it was the toughest course

135
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.640
I've ever had. I'll never
do it again, but I'm

136
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.320
glad I passed. And I'm
glad I got to demo

137
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.950
what I made. So I
think for some people who

138
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.530
are listening, they might be
thinking, gosh, someone made it

139
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.590
to 20 years old and
never like took something apart.

140
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.690
When I think a lot
of us, I always use

141
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.080
the example of the clock
radio. Like the born nerd

142
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.140
takes apart, the clock radio,
when the mom and dad

143
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.570
aren't looking. And then if
you're lucky you put it

144
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.710
back together and it still
works. And then Yeah, I

145
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.450
was one of those kids
who took a lot of

146
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.070
things apart. I can't say
I always put it back

147
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.270
together again, we're at work,
but you know, one thing

148
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.340
I think that that's what's
happening is to speak to

149
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.500
the point about some people
who've never even had that

150
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.780
chance until later in life.
You know, I got to

151
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.900
do that real early and
for a while I thought

152
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.030
I was going to become
a scientist and our inventor

153
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.310
or an entrepreneur is like
one of the first words

154
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.760
I learned to spell. It's
just pretty funny. And you

155
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.350
know, by the time I
got to college, it was

156
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.870
more of a conversation around
you need to do something

157
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.120
practical, right? So this wasn't
in the two thousands and

158
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.530
yeah, I graduated around the
first.com wave without giving my

159
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.040
age away. So, but you
know, there was no thinking

160
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.480
that you're going to do
this. If you did want

161
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.640
to do something like that,
you're going into, you know,

162
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.510
an engineering field or you
might study computer science at

163
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.360
the academic level and maybe
do something for a company

164
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.290
that just wasn't as open
to where people could really

165
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:41.740
understand what they were doing.
So I think that having

166
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.920
the opportunity to play and
to figure things out and

167
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.400
then to realize that you
could actually make a career

168
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.920
of it is also is
turning a lot of students

169
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.700
into, you know, soon to
be or future makers. They

170
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.430
realize that I could be
Sheldon. I could also be

171
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.370
Mark, but more importantly, it
could be me. And here's

172
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.340
how I want to plug
in. And what I'm really

173
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.820
hoping will happen is, you
know, just the idea of

174
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.520
not just doing this within
a space of the four

175
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.740
walls of academia, which is
great because you get to

176
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.890
play and prototype and kind
of fail in a safe

177
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.030
way. But taking this out
into communities where people just

178
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.770
like you said, may not
have had any exposure to

179
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.880
this until maybe they're 40,
maybe they're 60. My mom

180
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.160
is probably the biggest influence
on me as far as

181
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.080
being a maker's Mozart and
she's, she doesn't do the

182
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.920
tech stuff, but I mean,
almost everything she's built and

183
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.840
you know, some stuff looks
really great and some stuff

184
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.720
could use Polish, but it's
just always been something that

185
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.510
I've been around. And what
I realized was that, you

186
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.540
know, whether you call yourself
maker with a big M

187
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.510
or maker, her a little
M it's really invention, right.

188
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:54.360
It's really play. It's really
creativity. And the current generation

189
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.940
of students that I encounter,
a lot of them really

190
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.490
just haven't had that exposure.
So if you sit them

191
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.740
in a room for 10
minutes, you say, okay, look,

192
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:08.160
here's a box, a paperclip
and Alright, MacGyver scenario. Right,

193
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.630
right. Make something, you know,
and it's amazing how they

194
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.910
look at me. They're like,
Oh, what could I do?

195
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.180
I mean, there's this idea
that it has to look

196
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.290
a certain way. And I
think that in academia, we,

197
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.260
because the, a lot of
the programs, I mean, even,

198
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.210
even starting a program like
hacking a building or a

199
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.900
course like that, just trying
to break students out of

200
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.150
the traditional experience, you know,
you, you, you take a

201
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.190
quiz, you take an exam,
you final exam. It's, it's,

202
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.560
it's an amazing transition. So
I found a lot of

203
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.970
times with those that I
encounter, they're not, they're not

204
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.980
used to giving a demo
at the end of the

205
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.030
semester. They're not used to
something not working and it

206
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.430
being okay. And what I've
found is that if you

207
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.060
can bring some of that
outside of the traditional academic

208
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.910
environment, it's a little bit
more encouraging. Cause I think

209
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.370
people feel a little bit
more safe to fail. It's

210
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.800
not, you're gonna worry about
failing or not receiving good

211
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.930
grade. Cause it's it's, your
project can be whatever you

212
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.480
want it to be. And
I think that's an important

213
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.830
part of the culture that
I'm hoping to dive into

214
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.860
full time. I think that
that concept of safe to

215
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.940
fail is so important for
early learners. Whether that early

216
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.240
learner is seven or that
early learners, 22, I've been

217
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.340
struggling with that with my,
my kids. I've got a

218
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.570
seven year old and a
nine year old and a

219
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.820
seven year old still has
this idea that he's supposed

220
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.450
to get it right on
the first try. And right

221
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.320
now we're three D printing,
a quad copter. And I

222
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.260
have no idea what I'm
doing. You know what I

223
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.960
mean? Like I have a
PDF and a bunch of

224
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.820
three D print and I
am sure it's going to

225
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.580
suck. And it probably will
never take off. Right. I

226
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.380
keep trying to remind them
of that at every. And

227
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.850
he's like, no, it's gonna
be awesome. Like what are

228
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.030
we flying it around? Like,
no, we're not. It's probably,

229
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.220
and so there's two things
there. There's the safe to

230
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.050
fail, but then there's the,
this is not something we're

231
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.360
going to do in a
weekend. It would be, you

232
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.540
know, next year we might
pull this off. Who knows.

233
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.920
Absolutely. You know, it's funny
because the same experiences that

234
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.420
I've had for a lot
of my students and it's,

235
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.510
it's amazing how they actually
get frustrated. Because again, going

236
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.880
back to sort of a
traditional learning experience, that's the

237
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.180
expectation, whatever you do needs
to be an a plus,

238
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.290
whatever you do must, you
know, so I think another

239
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.680
part that's, that's really a
key to this is creating

240
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.800
a culture. So, you know,
my students, we walk in

241
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.710
first day, I'll show them
the, Oh, I hope I

242
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.410
don't get fired for it's
the official syllabus. And then

243
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.890
I'll say, okay, and now,
Yeah, yeah. I was an

244
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.020
adjunct. I've done that before.
Okay. Yeah. And, and, you

245
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.090
know, I think, you know,
you have to make sure

246
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.230
that you're also meeting your
expectations and meeting your goals

247
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.100
and requirements. But I think
the minute they recognize that

248
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.270
it doesn't have to be
pretty. So an example, I

249
00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.090
showed a project done by
Casey Kinzer some years ago

250
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.730
called tweet between bot. And
the idea was it was

251
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.090
a interactive robot, but it
was not, it was not

252
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.280
smart. It was like cardboard
and a motor and some

253
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.260
wheels. And, you know, she
puts this thing out in

254
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.810
a park in New York city.
And this is, you know,

255
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.850
post nine 11. So putting
things out in the parks,

256
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.070
probably not the, you don't
know what kind of results

257
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.740
you get, but she puts
us out. Then she all

258
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.800
that is the only prompt
that's on this robot is

259
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.680
a little message that says,
Hey, can you help me

260
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.120
get to the Northwest corner
of the park? I think

261
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.390
it was Northwest. And the
idea was experiment and see,

262
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.450
Hey, are new Yorkers, you
know, somewhat polite or they,

263
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.700
you know, as mean and
antisocial as people think they

264
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.490
are. And it was actually
a really cool experiment. She

265
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.800
went on and did some
Ted talks and it was,

266
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.650
you know, people really liked
it, but what stood out

267
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.540
in the minds of my
students and what I was

268
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.360
trying to explain to them
was, you know, with all

269
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.400
respect to John Ivy, like
it doesn't have to be

270
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.490
iPhone six, right? Your, your
first try, your 50th try

271
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.470
is important. Aesthetics are important,
but it, it absolutely does

272
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.420
not have to be what
you encountered in your first,

273
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.180
maybe even your 50th try.
And once you can get

274
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.540
past that, then you're free
to like, you know, take

275
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.120
your building blocks and make
really great things. And then

276
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.560
you can go back and
reiterate and make it look

277
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.570
pretty and nice and, you
know, put it up on

278
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.900
Kickstarter. So yeah, that's, that's
always a challenge. And I

279
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.950
think that documenting that too
is, is really important because

280
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.590
people see where they've come
from, lady, see how, you

281
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.170
know, really rigid they were.
And then they're like, there's

282
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.490
only two weeks left before
I have to get the

283
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.560
devil, whatever, let's just get
it done, you know? And,

284
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.960
but it's also been a
learning process that they actually,

285
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.050
if at farm, because it
is safe for them, I

286
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.430
think that you've been at
a number of really good

287
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.950
points there. I want to
touch on first, the documenting

288
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.470
it thing. Like I follow
these people on Instagram, these

289
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.510
fitness people. And while I
find selfie culture obnoxious, the

290
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.930
fitness people do it in
order to see progress. And

291
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.910
this is a standard working
thing. They, they prep, they

292
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.170
measure and they Reno and
then they cut and they

293
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.770
repeat. And I think we
as engineers have a tendency

294
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.010
to just zip up a
version or committed to source

295
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.830
code. Right. Right. We're not
nearly as regimented. I think

296
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.710
we could take something from
that culture and start looking

297
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.970
at a project and see
that, Hey, look, this actually

298
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.860
did move. It didn't feel
like it was moving, but

299
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.080
if you make six months
back, it made a difference.

300
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.030
Right. Yeah. I mean, and,
and, and again, you know,

301
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.910
whether you're in a traditional
classroom, you're in a Makerspace

302
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.280
or, you know, you're in
your basement, you know, that's,

303
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.400
that's part of the process.
A lot of the students,

304
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.860
and even some of my
non-students when, when I first

305
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.070
would introduce that we were
going to like document everything

306
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.740
and I have to admit,
like I have, I have

307
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.700
maybe 12,000 images and videos
sitting on my laptop that

308
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.740
have not made their way
to the social media. So

309
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.810
I'm, I'm definitely hypocrite when
it comes to that. But

310
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.120
you know, as far as
the student's progress is concerned,

311
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:54.250
that's important because you know,
it's easy to feel like

312
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.920
I should go from step
a and B and Z

313
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.250
in like two days. And
I think the first thing

314
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.840
that students learn is whatever
you think is going to

315
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.020
take like 20 minutes is
going to take you like

316
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.570
four hours and whatever it's
going to take you four

317
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.090
hours is going to take
you maybe like a week.

318
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.340
Right? And so you start
to learn to manage the

319
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.390
expectation, but you also have
this encouragement, periodic encouragement, because

320
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.430
you can look back and
say, okay, I did make

321
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.520
some progress. It's not quite
what I was expecting, but

322
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.340
I did make some progress.
Right. This is a really

323
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.890
tough lesson for people to
learn though, because well, well,

324
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.390
we, myself, yourself and people
who think like us, I've

325
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.680
just put us in a
group, by the way, in

326
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.690
case you didn't notice a
want to go out there

327
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.660
and getting people to turn
that led on right. As

328
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.320
fast as possible so that
they have that moment. Then

329
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.000
we say, okay, that was
great. You got an led

330
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.340
to turn on. It only
took you 10 minutes and

331
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.560
now your next project is
going to take you six

332
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.330
to eight weeks. And that's
what to be a year,

333
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.210
right? So I think people
get spoiled, you know, they

334
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.920
can go and type something
in a command line. And

335
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.110
they've got a Ruby on
rails blog. And two seconds

336
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.870
now learn to code. It'll
take a year, right? How

337
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.470
do we teach that patience?
And that to me is

338
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.500
just have as many different
experiences as possible. So one,

339
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.710
one thing that I've experimented
with is students get to

340
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.020
work on their own individual
projects, but then they also

341
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.350
have to complete a lab.
And at the same time,

342
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.630
as they get towards maybe
the last four to six

343
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.840
weeks of the semester, they
then have to work collaboratively.

344
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.230
So what I found is
that when you work in

345
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.310
a group, well, do I
need to say any more

346
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.620
right when you work in
a group, but when you

347
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.210
work in a group, you
have to learn to work

348
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.270
with other people's pace. You
have to figure out like,

349
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.760
you know, who's going to
do what, and, you know,

350
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.610
if somebody slacks off the
product still needs to get

351
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.970
done. And in my courses,
everyone earned the same grade,

352
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.070
but then I have a
separate metric to measure people

353
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.770
against themselves and measuring people
against himself as really important,

354
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.760
because it keeps people from
feeling like, you know, I

355
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.830
should give up because this
person is like way better

356
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.810
than programming than I am,
but this person's, you know,

357
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.970
way better at arranging a
circuit of figuring out like

358
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.380
why there's a short. So
I think that being able

359
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.220
to measure yourself against yourself
as important, I think the

360
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.740
other part that probably has
worked well in, in helping

361
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.490
people to get become patient
is it's it's one semester.

362
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.350
And you know, if you
find it, you like this,

363
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.230
you can continue next semester.
If it doesn't work in

364
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.360
the semester, you know, you
can go hang out at

365
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.900
a Makerspace or, you know,
chime in on a challenge

366
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.440
post. So just getting people
involved in different experiences. So

367
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.990
they see that the process
of making something from start

368
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.130
to finish varies, depend on
what you're doing, what the

369
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.440
setup or parameters are around
that. And then even your

370
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.380
teammates, even when you're working
by yourself. Like for me,

371
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.460
I know my biggest problem
is procrastination. I do not

372
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.560
like pressure, but for some
reason, it always comes down

373
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.480
to like, Oh, there's a
week left. You, you need

374
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.450
to like, get it going.
So 2:00 AM the day it's

375
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.610
due for exactly. You know?
And then that's when everything

376
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.100
fails. So, you know, those
little lessons help you learn

377
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.260
about yourself and they also
help you figure out, you

378
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.390
know, like, am I, the
type person needs like plan

379
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.180
everything. And if I do,
I learned that not everything's

380
00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.730
going to work as, as
planned. And if I'm the

381
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.830
type person who just takes
it in stride, I realize

382
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.380
more structure is probably gonna
help me create a better

383
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.680
product or project and also
feel good about myself because

384
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.540
I got it done. So
I think all of those

385
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.920
things play into helping people
to be more patient it's

386
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.200
hard. Cause we live in
like a push button in

387
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.520
society. So the idea is
push and is there, it's

388
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.880
a challenge. Hey folks, I
wanted to take a moment

389
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.970
to tell you about Reagan
and their new product called

390
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.390
pulse. Reagan is an error
and crash reporting software provider

391
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.920
and their new product pulse
to realtime user monitoring product.

392
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.980
It gives you performance data
and user insights. Lets you

393
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.700
understand exactly what's happening when
users interact with your software.

394
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.970
So you're never left guessing.
Reagan provides you with the

395
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.750
answers to your performance questions
and they've found over 10 billion

396
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.080
that's billion with a B
bugs and customer apps with

397
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.440
their crash reporting product. And
now Reagan will help you

398
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.700
understand application quality. Like no
one else over 30,000 developers

399
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.250
worldwide, can't be wrong. I
use Ray gun and all

400
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.440

403
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:31.010
for free today@reagan.io. I had
Keisha Rogers on a couple

404
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.620
of months ago, who's talking
about systems thinking and how

405
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.300
we spend all this time
trying to teach people how

406
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.790
to code, but not how
to think about systems, right?

407
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.160
And while you're, while you
were saying what you were

408
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.500
saying a moment ago there,
I realized that what I

409
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.720
do with any large project,
whether it be a coding

410
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.840
project or a larger creative
project, that youth for the

411
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.990
physical and the software is,
it's not just breaking things

412
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.470
down into functions. It's breaking
things down into tiny victories.

413
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.410
Yeah. Wow. I like that.
Okay. So like you'll have

414
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.620
to break this into a
function. I'm like, no, no.

415
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.690
I want to break it
into something that I can

416
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.050
succeed at and go, yay
me. Right? Like I, I

417
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:09.550
made the worst soldering joint
yesterday. It was like, I

418
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.770
just basically got halfway through
it and said, screw it.

419
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.140
And then I just duct
tape the whole thing. I'm

420
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.780
pretty sure it's safe. Like
I'm pre it's only five

421
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.220
volts. I'm pretty sure it's
not going to burn the

422
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.860
house down. But basically I
was, I'll just be like,

423
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.590
it's very small story. I'm
trying to get this three

424
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.430
D printer to plug into
an ATX power supply so

425
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.130
I can have the heated
bed. And right now I

426
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.530
have one thing plugged into
the wall for the raspberry

427
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.780
PI another thing plugged into
the wall to get five

428
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.200
volts to the printer itself
and then another whatever Watts

429
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.600
for the bed, I've got
three things plugged into the

430
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.900
wall and I got this
ATX power supply. Right. So

431
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.060
I'm, I'm leaving. I decided
I'll just leach power off

432
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.120
this way. Strip the wires
off of the USB cable.

433
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.950
And I start figuring out
what's is five volts. And

434
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.640
I'm like, you know, how
do I not die? And

435
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.970
it looked like a big
problem. Like I'm not a

436
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.310
real good hardware person, but
I was like, okay, let's

437
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.140
just break this down. I'm
just going to solder these

438
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.990
two wires together. And that's,
today's tiny victory and I'm

439
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.150
going to check this with
a multimeter and that's today's

440
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.430
tiny victory. Right. And even
though I ended up just

441
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.730
using electrical tape in the
end, it works. I plug

442
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.340
one thing into the wall
and it powers all three

443
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.080
and nothing is burst into
flames yet. Thank goodness. Amen.

444
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.230
Yeah. And, and I think
that's again where I, I

445
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.080
go back to the point
of like measuring yourself against

446
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.310
yourself. Right. And, and having
those little victories do help

447
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.540
and knowing that that's the
victory rate. So like this

448
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.450
victory. Exactly. Yes, yes. Thank
you for that. Yeah. You're

449
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.240
welcome. Oh, I think you
inspired me, but yeah. I

450
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.880
mean, definitely knowing it's a
victory because you know, again,

451
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.770
when you're getting started in
this stuff, you don't know.

452
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.880
Right? Like you, you don't
literally, when I started soldering

453
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.880
exercise, students take like a
piece of wire loop it

454
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.960
and solder the two ends
together and they're so excited,

455
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.840
you know? And I say,
Hey, go take this home.

456
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.900
That now that works really
well for my seven year

457
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.760
old. I wasn't really sure
if it worked with my

458
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.920
20 something year olds, but
you'd be surprised. They are

459
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.780
all excited. I want to
come back to me and

460
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.790
say, Hey, look, I still
have the little ring that

461
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.070
I saw her, so, Oh,
you can make him solder

462
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.790
or ring with. Oh, that's
literally. Yeah. It's yeah. Yeah.

463
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.540
So the guys like it
too, but This gets down

464
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.610
to a recurring theme that
I've talked about on the

465
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.480
show over the last year,
which is this represents power.

466
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.560
Yes. Whether we're talking about
new people in technology, whether

467
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.170
we're talking about underrepresented people
in technology, whether they're young

468
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.930
or they're old, the reason
that this is important, the

469
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.750
reason that maker with a
capital M is important is

470
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.350
his power where the capital
is. Yeah, absolutely. I mean

471
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.320
like I've been alive for
the entire existence of the

472
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.290
world, but I think this
is probably the best time

473
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.130
to be alive because there
is so much opportunity. There

474
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.300
are so many resources. So,
you know, before we started

475
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.150
this podcast, we were like
joking around about grad school

476
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.370
and finishing and paying for
it. Right. So, so this,

477
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.690
this was my motivation. When
I went to a small

478
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.140
college in Ohio, it was
a family school. What that

479
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.260
means is your sibling goes
to school and then you

480
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.200
go to school because you're
on scholarship and they're on

481
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.480
scholarship. And it has nothing
to do, whether you want

482
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.950
to go there and outright,
right? Like I fought my

483
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.340
parents for like a year,
you know, got grandfathered in

484
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.090
or something that they did.
It was great, but it

485
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.690
wasn't the school I wanted
to do. 10. Nevertheless, when

486
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.580
I graduated, I thought I
wanted to work on wall

487
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.970
street. So I start teaching
myself finances, keep in mind,

488
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.640
this is a very, very
small school. So they had

489
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.310
no finance program. This was
right around the time when

490
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.530
people were starting to get
interested in financial engineering and

491
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.200
eventually wants to do quads
and all stuff. And somehow

492
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.260
I thought that's what I
wanted to do. So I

493
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.320
ended up going to Columbia
for a while and just

494
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.830
like a semester was ridiculously
like cost prohibited for me.

495
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.230
I could not afford it.
I worked hard and I

496
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.690
pay for a semester. I
end up going for like

497
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.550
a year. And I was
like, I can't finish. I

498
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.210
can't even get into the
program. Can't afford it. Same

499
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:06.020
thing with ITP, $80,000. Awesome.
For grad program NYU, but

500
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.440
pretty expensive for most of
the people that I'm connecting

501
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.220
with. And it suddenly occurred
to me because one really

502
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.680
nice thing about ITP interactive
telecommunications program at New York university.

503
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.780
One really nice thing about
them is they put everything

504
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.100
online. They're very open. They're
basically like MIT media labs.

505
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.990
So they focus on a
lot of the recent or

506
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.810
newly emerged technology and they
do it within a context

507
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.150
of art. So it's a
very nice place to play

508
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.520
for play for two years
and feel comfortable and feel

509
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.800
safe if you can afford
it. And what I took

510
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.590
away from the program and
finish. But what I took

511
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.850
away from the program was
amazing support, extremely open in

512
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.850
terms of sharing knowledge. And
it dawned on me that

513
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.420
like, why can't this be
anywhere? You know, why can't

514
00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.960
this be everywhere? There's really
it's I don't to say

515
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.340
it's not rocket science, but
it really isn't. And that's

516
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.220
where this idea of like
breaking beyond the four walls

517
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.190
and making every space, a
maker space and creating a

518
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.690
culture around being collaborative, being
open, be objective around learning.

519
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.900
Because if you, the most
important thing I think you

520
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.870
could start with is first
building culture that says I

521
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.780
can and then saying, okay,
now what resource do I

522
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.140
need access to? And you
know, when you're doing these

523
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.090
things, a lot of times,
no one is an expert,

524
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:34.070
right? So you have the
opportunity to get in early

525
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.830
and become your own expert,
so to speak. So going

526
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.110
back to this idea about
making why such an exciting

527
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.230
time is maybe you didn't
do so well in high

528
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.360
school in calculus, maybe you,
you know, like took precalc

529
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.300
four times and you know,
college cause you were, I

530
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.400
dunno, a sociology major and
you didn't have to do

531
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.580
it, but you need to
graduate all those things as

532
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.820
helpful as they can be.
Especially as we start going

533
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:02.400
more computer science topics, it's
still not a barrier. It's

534
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.340
it's you may go so
far before you need to

535
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.500
start delving into some more
advanced topics, but it's literally

536
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.950
democratized how you learn around
engineering, how you learn around

537
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.450
programming, coding, how you learn
around making and to make

538
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.870
that equitable. I'm trying not
to be too PC, but

539
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.420
to make that equitable, you
need people who are willing

540
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.240
to say, okay, maybe I'm
not going to spend half

541
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.400
a semester or a full
semester at a university teaching

542
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.100
the stuff, but maybe I
can document this online and

543
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.590
maybe I can, you know,
run this in a place

544
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.100
like general assembly or my
local church or my coffee

545
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.280
shop. You know, when they
don't have peak hours, maybe

546
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.320
I can take five people
and just show them how

547
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.780
to do it, or do
a hangout on Google groups.

548
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:49.560
So more people thinking about
this and being willing to

549
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.750
step up, whoever they know,
right? You don't have to

550
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:56.460
necessarily know everything about Bluetooth,
low energy or blockchain, but

551
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.070
whatever, you know, like let's
take this and now let's,

552
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.190
let's fold this into a
Wiki. Let's get people pair

553
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.550
program using Adam, like just
these very open resources to

554
00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.950
make this reality and Very
similar ideas about this. Because

555
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.790
every time you learn something,
if you don't tell anyone

556
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.910
about it, then exactly what
good is that you? Yeah.

557
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.620
I mean, that was, I
mean, congratulations, but that's a

558
00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.400
little selfish, you know, I
always say if you learn

559
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.760
something, put a URL on
it. Sure. Yeah. It doesn't

560
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.300
matter where that is. Wiki,
you know, blog, God forbid

561
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.060
SharePoint somewhere that you can
then say, look what I

562
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.750
learned, videotape it, take pictures.
This comes back to what

563
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.660
you said originally about documenting,
right? It's not just for

564
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.730
yourself, but it's also for
other people. And I think

565
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.760
that, you know, people look
at me sometimes on my

566
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.380
blog and say, Oh, he's
an expert. It's like, no,

567
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.430
I'm a, like a professional
amateur. I just just been

568
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.910
documenting it for a very,
very, very long time. I

569
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.320
know what you mean. Sure.
Yeah. I mean, it's what

570
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.800
did I used to call
myself? I'm a specialized generalist.

571
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.070
Right. And that's my way
of not saying that. I

572
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.040
know absolutely nothing about, you
know, whatever. I mean, just

573
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.470
right. You, you play and
you try and you know,

574
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.420
for me, I think that
the thing that's, you need

575
00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.690
something to motivate you to
write. So what motivates me

576
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.410
is I I'm a new
Yorker, right? So I commute

577
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.270
by bus and train. I
live in Queens. I know

578
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.570
not sexy, but that's the
case and the wouldn't anything

579
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.120
about this, God I know,
but you're driving, I'm sure

580
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.960
we're bike, but you know,
around here it's, it's not,

581
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.620
you know, it's not bad
to take public transit. Hey,

582
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.590
I'm from Portland. We like,
we're all about That's true.

583
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.850
That or biking. Right, right.
Oh, biking. But so there's

584
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.350
this intersection, it's a major
intersection and there are several

585
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.320
buses that serve each angle.
And there's a lot of

586
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.440
seniors that take the bus
and repeatedly. And it's one

587
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.710
particular intersection. There's always at
least three people who are

588
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.140
trying to cross against the
light to make it to

589
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.580
the bus. On the other
side of the street, they're

590
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.230
all going the same direction.
These all go to like

591
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.110
a major Depot because you
know, you're kind of playing

592
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.850
a game of chicken. You're
like, is my bus gonna

593
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.160
come here? Or can I
wait, fix you five? Or

594
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.000
should I get on 84?
And you know, we're, we're

595
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.940
so tied to like our
mobile phones and you know,

596
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.700
wearables and that's okay. That's
sexy. But you know, what

597
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.250
about the demographic of people
that use the bus at

598
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:19.300
generally probably don't have the
latest, greatest OSTP on their

599
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.010
mobile phone, or maybe they
don't have their mobile phone

600
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.070
at all, or maybe, Well,
they don't need to ask

601
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:27.090
that question. Exactly. You should.
Should that information be something

602
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.610
like, when is my bus
coming in where it should

603
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.190
only be relegated to on
a mobile phone? So my,

604
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.530
I would say no. And
I think also because just

605
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.710
the, a good percentage of
writers don't have access to

606
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:41.880
the technology side, the MTA
was developing for like iOS

607
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.870
as opposed to Android. So
I started thinking about network

608
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.510
public artifacts. And it was
like, well, you know what,

609
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.390
if your stop sign or
the bus stop sign lit

610
00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.330
up when your route, your
bus on your route was

611
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.460
near you. Right. And if
you have more than one

612
00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.920
route, how would you know?
So, you know, blank within

613
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.920
two stops, you know, keep
blinking. And then if you

614
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.020
don't say anything clashing, you
know, you missed the bus,

615
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.630
right? Most people know generally
how far apart these bus

616
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.340
stops are. So they know
like if I see it

617
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.730
blinking height, I could run,
I could walk or I'll

618
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.970
stay where I am and
Housing, these things, don't like,

619
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.400
this is such an obvious,
brilliant idea. Like why isn't

620
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.800
the entire bus? A what's
it called? Like the, when,

621
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.000
when it's raining, you're in
the bus shelter. Yeah. Why

622
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.850
doesn't the whole shelter flash?
Why aren't there LEDs the

623
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.330
white light? Like why isn't
it connected shelter? That's blinking

624
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.330
the buses coming. Right. Well,
you know, here in New York

625
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:37.500
scale, That scale is more
than a $600 iPhone. I

626
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.440
totally agree. In New York, there's
a lot of politics around

627
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.150
like who owns what? So
there's apartment transportation. And I

628
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.440
shouldn't be saying this, but
MTA love you guys, but

629
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.480
there's a lot of politics
around it, but what's been

630
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.260
really nice is with our
current mayor, he's been very

631
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.360
interested in a connected city.
So we have so many

632
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.900
call NYC, big apps and
whole point behind that love

633
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.750
for major talking points. One
of those is connected cities.

634
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.730
So I think it's a
little bit of timing, but

635
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.570
the really awesome thing, just
tying this back into opportunity

636
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:11.310
and everyone is makers is
there is no minimum requirement

637
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.700
for submitting an idea and
having the opportunity to be

638
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.720
incubated by the city of
New York on this project. So

639
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.210
this idea could be something
that I can work on.

640
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.620
It could be something that
you can work on, we

641
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.500
can contribute and get hub,
whatever it doesn't matter. And

642
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.850
I think that what's missing
is not this opportunity, but

643
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.550
who do we want to
include in the conversation that

644
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.930
isn't online necessarily, or isn't
on GitHub, right? So the

645
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.070
more we work out these
channels when the, that will

646
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.970
help people know about these
opportunities, regardless of where they

647
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.110
are, right. Regardless of whether
they're in school. And that's

648
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.900
why I know about big,
big apps or whether they're

649
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:55.220
at civic hall, these are
just local resources that they'll

650
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.930
have an opportunity to say,
okay, I want to get

651
00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.620
involved. And then next step
is you open it up

652
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.920
to the lowest or least
common denominator of skill and

653
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.170
expertise, which means that you
shouldn't have to be a

654
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.960
developer or programmer. You don't
have to be an engineer.

655
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.660
You just need to be
a user of the transit

656
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.750
service. Right. And then from
there, you can think about

657
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.180
these things. So when you
have these collaborations and you

658
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.180
have the ability to post
your idea on something like

659
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.760
big apps and is a
potential to collaborate with others

660
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.640
and to receive some kind
of support for it, I

661
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.760
think incentivizes a whole group
of people who, first of

662
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.070
all, it's for them, that's
why they'll be interested in

663
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.010
it, but it also incentivizes
them to be involved in

664
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.040
actual design development as opposed
to, okay, well, I'll just

665
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.500
wait until this is done
by the MTA or DLT.

666
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.630
And then, and then I'll
be happy to use it.

667
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.070
Right. Which doesn't work that
way, but this is the

668
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.860
opportunity we have now. You
didn't have that before. Right.

669
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.890
And it's also early that
there's no one that can

670
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.320
say, well, we don't know
if we really want to

671
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.210
go with your model because
such and such as an

672
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.490
expert, who's an expert. Like
who's an expert in blockchain,

673
00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.330
who's an expert in Bluetooth,
low energy, right there. There's

674
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.820
still relatively young technologies. Even
though, you know, we have

675
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.600
quite a few meetups and
other opportunities where corporations are

676
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:12.680
supporting these things, but it's
a vast frontier, vast frontier.

677
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.550
So to start with an
led is like the spark

678
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.070
and in the next step
is where do you see

679
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.340
an led wherever you are,
whether it's your house, whether

680
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.280
it's your park and now
how do we take what

681
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.980
we've learned, just the basics,
right? And then build upon

682
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.060
those things to make it
happen. Stoplights, bus stops, whatever

683
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.070
trash cans that talk and
tell you I'm full like

684
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.710
MTV, whatever. Right. But these
are the things that are

685
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:40.340
important. It starts with, you
know, just what we've been

686
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.360
talking about, culture around it,
the resources, the openness, the

687
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.670
documentation, and managing expectations. Do
you know, you're making me

688
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.810
want to go put a
lid on it. I can

689
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.340
I go and put an
led on, cause there's so

690
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.320
many, it's such a more
scalable way of having a

691
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.570
connected city than it is
to connect all the people

692
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.720
with expensive supercomputers in their
pockets. You know? And I

693
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.450
think that the other thing
is too, this is an

694
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.210
amazing opportunity because if we
can convince, and I think

695
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.790
that we probably will if
this particular competition this year,

696
00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.190
but if we can convince
people of exactly what you

697
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.980
said, you know, we have
an opportunity. I think the,

698
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:20.830
the, the, the proven resource
is well by such and

699
00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:22.900
such. Everybody's going to have
a mobile phone dash. True,

700
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.630
but not everyone. Not all
mobile phones are the same,

701
00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:29.950
not, not all operating systems
equal what might seem like

702
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.370
a very small bill. I
remember when our president was

703
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.030
supporting the, you know, the
low income phones and he

704
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.030
like, yeah. Or, and even
healthcare for the price of

705
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.020
cell phone bill. And I
kept thinking myself, well, wait

706
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.300
a minute. Who cell phone
bill? Cause some cell bills

707
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.240
are like 40 bucks and
some are like 200 and

708
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.670
change depending on what you've
been doing, especially with teenagers.

709
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:55.110
So, you know, we've, we've
got it. It's right now

710
00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:59.700
it's corporate Lee viable to
use what exists. Right. So

711
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:05.730
use like the iOS and
Android platforms, but that's consumer

712
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.370
tech. So we can get
more people interested in, I

713
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.200
guess I call it consumer
to consumer. It could be

714
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.540
business to business, but you
know, you having a hand

715
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.230
in prototyping the future of
your city, I think that's

716
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.570
how you gain traction. And
that's how you get the

717
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.180
support of companies like at
and T or IBM, they're

718
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.430
all looking for this. Like,
I, I sat in on

719
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.940
like a really, really awesome
workshop. And I was amazed.

720
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.950
There was like 50 people
in a room in a

721
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.820
city of like 8 million people.
Right. So the point is

722
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.430
that there's definitely more room
for people to get involved.

723
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.710
We just have to be
willing to, you know, break

724
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.590
beyond the four walls. I
love academia's paid me, but

725
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.840
you know, we have to
kind of get beyond that.

726
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.880
And I think this is
a time that we have

727
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.870
the ability to do that.
People who are interested can

728
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.990
check that out at big
apps dot N Y C.

729
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:56.420
That's the really nice top
level domain, big apps.nyc. Yes.

730
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.180
That's very cool. John C. Hayes. Thank
you so much for chatting

731
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.670
with us today. Thanks for
having me. This has been

732
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.160
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

733
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:04.490
week.
