This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 42. In this

10
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.290
episode, Scott talks with Saranya
Barak creator of code newbie,

11
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.860
a community of beginner and
developing programmers. Hi, this is

12
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.380
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes. And

13
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.400
today I am chatting with
saran yet Barak. You are

14
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.720
the creator of code newbie.org,
which is a fantastic site.

15
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.180
It's us. It's actually a
community that you've started to

16
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.720
support a new programmers because
would you consider yourself a

17
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.950
newbie? Yeah, I've been programming,
I guess, professionally for about

18
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.280
nine months, graduated from a
programming boot camp. So definitely

19
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.310
a newbie. So your background
is not in computer engineering.

20
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.340
You don't have a degree
in software or computer science.

21
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.770
Yeah, exactly. I actually thought
that I was going to

22
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.500
be a doctor and I
consider that a huge bullet

23
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.100
that I dodged in God,
but I did three years

24
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.590
of premed. I wasn't really
hardcore with the sciences. I

25
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.950
taught organic chemistry. I did
biochemistry research. I was published.

26
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.550
And then in my senior
year I shadowed a doctor

27
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.070
for the first time and
I realized that I don't

28
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.950
actually want to save human
lives, which I feel like

29
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.080
is important if you want
to be a doctor. And

30
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.510
what I really liked was
the problem solving and the

31
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.420
difficulty of science and the
breaking things down and that

32
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.630
stuff. So instead I decided
that I was going to

33
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.020
be a journalist because I,
I written stories and I'd

34
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.200
done a lot of journalism,
both, you know, throughout my

35
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.740
college experience. And so, yeah,
I graduated with a double

36
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.760
degree in English and psychology
finished the premed track. And

37
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.160
when I did journalism, I
worked at NPR and I

38
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.370
worked at discover magazine for
a bit. And I realized

39
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.940
that I liked that creative
part. I like telling stories

40
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.460
and getting to talk to
people and hearing about their

41
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.460
lives and experiences. But that
part of science that I

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.550
loved was totally gone. You
know, I couldn't be analytical.

43
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.310
I couldn't break problems down.
I couldn't do all that

44
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.070
stuff. And so in that
process, I ended up reading

45
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.650
the Steve jobs book, which
got me interested in tech.

46
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.240
And that was the first
time I really thought of

47
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.720
technology as a possible career
option. And so from there

48
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.730
I said, okay, I need
to get into this world.

49
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.570
What is this world like?
And through startups, I ended

50
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.220
up at the flatter in
school and now I'm a

51
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.510
programmer. So are you saying
that it was the lack

52
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.370
of creation? Like you weren't,
when you were working as

53
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.920
a journalist or doing these
different things, you weren't making

54
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.110
something building. Exactly. I felt
like I wasn't creating things.

55
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.290
I was observing other people,
create things and then spinning

56
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.690
that into a story. And
you know, that's not to,

57
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.870
you know, devalue journalism or
writers or anything like that.

58
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.700
I think they're great. I
love it. I love writing

59
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.610
to this day, but it
just wasn't fulfilling and satisfying

60
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.760
to me. Did you know
that you were a builder

61
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.740
early on or did you
literally discover you were a

62
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.800
builder when you headed in
the wrong direction? I don't

63
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.290
think that I knew what
a builder was. My idea

64
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.380
of building and creating was,
you know, like the Legos

65
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.120
when I was a kid
or, you know, Barbie dream

66
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.250
house and things like that.
I didn't really understand what

67
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.350
it meant. I didn't even
know that it was an

68
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.620
option to make things. My
world was about either fixing

69
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.410
things, you know, I consider
doctors to fix human bodies

70
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.250
and such and, you know,
experiencing and observing, but I

71
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.790
didn't understand this idea of
having an idea alone and

72
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.920
then building it into something
that other people can use.

73
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.920
Tech really introduced that concept
to me. So do you

74
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.380
didn't have a computer growing
up or were you, do

75
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.880
you have like a PC
around the house, but you

76
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.650
didn't think about it as
anything more than a utility?

77
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.590
I'm curious. Yeah. I think
we got a computer when

78
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.630
I was nine years old
and that's really what it

79
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.700
was. It was for consumption.
You know, I used it

80
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.820
to play a couple games
and, you know, we're documented

81
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.740
type things up, but that
was pretty much it. And

82
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.930
what's interesting is I think
when I was either 12

83
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.410
or 13, I did one
of those making technology, more

84
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.000
diverse summer programs for mostly
African American teens and young

85
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.280
people. And I think it's
been a couple of weeks

86
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.060
soldering. I built an led
battery powered heart that my

87
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.240
mom knew nothing to do
with. And I did a

88
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.610
little bit of coding and
a few other techie things.

89
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.610
But once that program was
over, that was it. There

90
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.290
was no one to kind
of say, Oh, if you

91
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.050
like this, maybe you should
be a computer scientist. Maybe

92
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.300
you should be a programmer
there wasn't a next step.

93
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.570
So for me, I got
my little taste of creating,

94
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.820
but I thought that that
was a one time experience.

95
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.890
And I didn't understand that
I could do more with

96
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.300
it. Where are your parents
techies? No, definitely not. They're

97
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.390
both pharmacist and my mom's
still emails me about or

98
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.300
texts me about how to
email things. So, Okay. So

99
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.270
they're, they're medical people, right?
So this is why medicine

100
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.720
seemed like the obvious kind
of next step. Exactly. The

101
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.880
program that you did early
on. You said this was

102
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.150
in high school and it
was focused on increasing diversity.

103
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.730
It was focused on for
people of color. Did you

104
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.040
feel that that was necessary
in the sense of it's

105
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.670
something that is presenting an
option? Like, Hey, here's a

106
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.090
thing you maybe hadn't thought
of? I had no context

107
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.340
for it. I didn't really,
I mean, I grew up,

108
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.090
you know, at that time
I was, you know, in,

109
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.360
in DC and I had
a lot of minority friends.

110
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.660
My neighborhood was very diverse,
so I didn't really understand

111
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.260
this whole diversity in tech
issue as a thing. So

112
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.650
that didn't really mean anything
to me. But besides that,

113
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.760
I just felt like it
was this isolated thing that

114
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.920
someone thought would be fun
and interesting. And I didn't

115
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.010
understand the purpose. I didn't
really connect with the issue

116
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.990
it was trying to resolve.
And only now when I

117
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.730
look back at it, do
I get what they were

118
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.120
trying to do? Right. So
setting aside diversity and focusing

119
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.880
on you as an individual,
you are going through life

120
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.650
and you're trying to figure
out where your path is.

121
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.220
You arguably find a little
late, like, wait a second.

122
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.050
I can, I can build
this. I can build that,

123
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.240
but you've already got a
degree, a D a double

124
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.680
degree in totally unrelated fields.
Was that like, Oh, I'm

125
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.690
sorry, I'm committed. I have
to be an English major.

126
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.070
Well, I always knew that
I probably wasn't going to

127
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.130
get a job in with
something to do with English.

128
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.500
I did English because I
just really liked it and

129
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.920
I wanted an excuse to
write. And so, no, I

130
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.460
didn't really feel committed to
anything liberal artsy, if anything,

131
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.770
I feel like it's an
advantage and it's a strength

132
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.660
because in technology, you know,
I think it's easier for

133
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.150
me to, to write from
an honest place. I think

134
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.160
it's easier for me to
blog. I think it's easier

135
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.990
for me to speak and
do a lot of those

136
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.860
soft skill, liberal artsy things
that a lot of developers

137
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.080
may not do quite as
easily. So I think it's

138
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.080
an advantage. Did you think
I want to build, so

139
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.720
I need to go back
and get another undergraduate degree,

140
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.090
or maybe go into a
master's program and kind of

141
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.880
go from a BA into
more of a ms. Or

142
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.070
did you know that you
wanted to find a trade

143
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.160
school? Yeah, I looked at
all the options I looked

144
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.380
at, you know, possibly going
back and doing another four

145
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.440
years as an undergrad. I
thought about getting a master's.

146
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.620
And what I really wanted
was I wanted an opportunity

147
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.840
to try it and see
how committed I was and

148
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.720
see how far I could
get with as small investment

149
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.330
as possible. And so for
me, that meant doing a

150
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.610
programming boot camp. So before
I did that, actually I

151
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.100
did just a month on
my own learning to code,

152
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.990
trying to see how far
I could get as a

153
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.820
way to test myself and
see if I was actually

154
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.360
serious about my own ideas
and ambitions. And once I

155
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.180
did that, I applied to
the, to the Flatiron school.

156
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.210
And for me, that's gotten
me very, very far. And

157
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.250
from everything I've researched, that's
about as far as I

158
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.710
plan on going right now.
So I did consider everything,

159
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.980
but the bootcamp felt the
most realistic and just made

160
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.040
them, How did you know
a bootcamp existed? Cause I

161
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.110
think there are still people
who are discovering. I mean,

162
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.450
I even think people who
are listening to this podcast

163
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.910
might only have a sense
that these exist and what's

164
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.040
the difference between something like
the flat iron school, which

165
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.980
is a very well thought
of a programming school in

166
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.920
New York and something like maybe
a less well thought of

167
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.740
trade school, like, and again,
not to disrespect, anyone who

168
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.430
has a degree like this,
but your derives and your,

169
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.000
you know, computer tech Institute
type of degrees. Yeah. So

170
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.670
for me, the biggest difference
between flat, well, I found

171
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.310
out about bootcamps because I
just Google searched. I searched,

172
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.680
how do I learn to
code? And through lots and

173
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.020
lots of searches, I'm Cora
is also really great place

174
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.380
for answers. Bootcamps became, you
know, one of those options.

175
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.450
So that's how I found
out about it. And to

176
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.700
me, you know, I don't
know too much about Dubai

177
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.980
and the more traditional trade
school. So I can't really

178
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.340
speak to that, but I
can say that what appealed

179
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.920
to me about bootcamps in
general is it felt very

180
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.630
focused. It felt very applicable.
It felt very purposeful. It

181
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.150
wasn't, you're going to learn
this because you think it's

182
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.670
interesting and maybe it'll make
sense to you and you'll

183
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.620
get money from it. It
was no you're going to

184
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.420
make a career change. We're
going to help you get

185
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.550
there. And you're going to
be able to actually build

186
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.390
real things. So the tangibility
was very, very nice considering

187
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.670
my two liberal art, If
I may add a, a

188
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.060
thesaurus word, it was intentional.
It was intentional. Okay. So

189
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.330
these are focused programs that
are some number of months

190
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.900
long. How long was yours?
So really only three months.

191
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.240
I assumed somehow it'd be
six, nine a year, other

192
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.460
options, or is it always
just three months getting it

193
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.430
out? I think the shortest
is nine weeks that I've

194
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.980
seen. And the longest, I
think is six months. But

195
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.430
on average, they're about 12
weeks. And what is it

196
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.830
like? Is it a, just
a big glorious hackathon? Is

197
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.660
it just all fueled with
pizza and caffeine and you

198
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.000
all just pile in like,
like, like the MTV is

199
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.430
the real world, or is
it a job like nine

200
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:53.060
to five? I feel like
bootcamp, the a reality show

201
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.110
would be a really great
idea. So no pizza, lots

202
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.740
of coffee, definitely lots of
caffeine. It was really intense

203
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.880
at the end of the
day. I think that a

204
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.970
bootcamp is whatever you make
of it for me, you

205
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.160
know, that was my life.
I didn't see or speak

206
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.610
to anybody until it was
over, there was a pre-work

207
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.260
that we have to do.
That's about a hundred hours

208
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.930
of, you know, just the
basics of HTML and CSS

209
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.850
and Ruby and things like
that. And I did the

210
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.670
pre-work twice before I entered
the program where I was,

211
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.040
Oh yeah. Is this something
you pay for? Or is

212
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.500
this like, This is just
on your own pre homework.

213
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.620
Yeah. And when I got
to school, you know, they

214
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.110
started at nine o'clock. It
officially ended at six, but

215
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.390
most people were there, you
know, until nine or 10,

216
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.230
sometimes midnight. So yeah, that
was entirely my life. I

217
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.960
know that for other people,
because they either were working

218
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.240
part time or had a
family, they couldn't quite just

219
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.000
put in the number of
hours that I could, but

220
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.370
yeah, it was definitely full
time, a hundred percent. And

221
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.990
that's how you get the
most out of it. Okay.

222
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.020
So as with all things
in life, intentionality is so

223
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.300
significant. You, I assume you
told everyone that like, I'm

224
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.360
going into residency, not the
kind of residency that you

225
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.420
want, mom and dad, but
the one that is going

226
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.570
to have me successful on
the other side. Yes, yes.

227
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.480
Everyone knew. I said, I'm
starting this program. I'll see

228
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.270
you next year. Cause it
was like a fall program

229
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.970
and hopefully I'll be able
to build stuff. Then It

230
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.680
was this five days a
week or six, seven days

231
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.780
a week, Five days a
week. It's open during the

232
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.930
weekends too. And I definitely
went in most weekends, but

233
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.940
officially it's five days a
week. So schools like this

234
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.770
have different programs. You can
go in and say, I'm

235
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.140
going to do iOS or
I'm going to complete high

236
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.210
school or whatever, but you
did the, I'm going to

237
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.910
be a production ready developer.
And in this case they

238
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.820
focus on, on Ruby. Did
you, did you pick a

239
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.680
school or did you pick
a language and then find

240
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.790
a school? I kinda did
both. I think for me,

241
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.770
when I did the research
on what are good beginner

242
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.080
languages, the two that I
got were Python and Ruby,

243
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.990
and I kinda ended up
going through BB because most

244
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.870
boot camps taught Ruby. And
I also just heard really

245
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.270
great things about the Ruby
community and how supportive they

246
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.980
are and how a lot
of beginners are starting. So

247
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.810
it just kind of, you
know, kind of matched up

248
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.060
that way. So the bootcamps
I looked at, ended up

249
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.710
being Ruby on rails. No,
I taught as an adjunct

250
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.980
professor at a state school
for a while. And one

251
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.190
of the most challenging things
is when I saw people

252
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.440
and there's no way to
say this to be nice,

253
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.220
but they just probably shouldn't
be programmers. We tried, we

254
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.470
loved them. We held them,
we cried with them, but

255
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.420
it was just like, I
don't think you're wired this

256
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.620
way. Was it the pre-work
that kept that from happening

257
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.170
in the sense of someone
who didn't know someone who

258
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.320
couldn't put in 120 hours
of hard work as a

259
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.750
prep for this? Or did
you have people drop out?

260
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.370
Because just like, you know,
programming is not for me.

261
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.970
I think we had in
our class anyway, we only

262
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.510
had one person drop out
out of 44 of us.

263
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.010
And so I think that
for me, honestly, the very,

264
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.860
very first time that I
tried programming was actually a

265
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.260
year before I went to
the program to the flat

266
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.980
iron school. And I tried
MIT OpenCourseWare is, you know,

267
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.380
intro to programming class. I
can't remember what the one

268
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.900
It's all self study, just
autodidact on your own. Yeah.

269
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.660
And I did it, I
think for like two weeks

270
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.270
I got through four lectures
and it was the hardest,

271
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.200
most painful thing that I
could have ever put myself

272
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.930
through. And I got to
a point where I honestly

273
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.270
just felt like this just
wasn't for me. Like I

274
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.740
got to a point where
I said, I don't think

275
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.570
this is made for me.
I don't know what is

276
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.170
wrong with my brain, that
this isn't making sense, but

277
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.250
Seriously, God bless MIT OpenCourseWare
but if that's your introduction

278
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.280
to programming then yeah. It's
not for me either. I

279
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.380
actually have, this is a
true story and I'm embarrassed

280
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.880
to say this they're still
on my iPad. Like since

281
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.250
the day I bought the
thing, like four years later,

282
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.420
like it's sitting in the
like I university thing, every

283
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.980
time I get on a
plane, I'm like, ah, I

284
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.730
should probably watch that open
courseware. It's pretty hard work.

285
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.590
There's a brain for it.
I don't have that brain.

286
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.270
So I respect, I respect
that you did it. I

287
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.200
tried to do it. And
so, yeah, so that was

288
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.850
kind of my first taste
of it. And then when

289
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.090
I tried it again, a
year later, I had that

290
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.580
experience of knowing that it
was going to be hard

291
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.830
and I expected it to
be difficult and I expected

292
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.490
it to be very painful.
And so that wasn't as

293
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.730
big of an obstacle for
me anymore. And so I

294
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.250
think that a large part
of the wiring is more

295
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.380
of just setting your expectations.
And I found that for

296
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.500
people who went to, you
know, my bootcamp and did

297
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.900
the pre-work, they understood that.
And they had already kind

298
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.230
of started reshaping their brain.
And then there were some

299
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.720
who didn't do the pre
work and didn't have quite

300
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.240
the right expectation and the
right, you know, grit and

301
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.210
discipline. And so I think
it's not so much, you

302
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.220
know, should you be a
programmer or you born to

303
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.290
be a programmer? I think
it's more of, do you

304
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.360
understand that this is going
to be hard and that's

305
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.690
okay. And that's just part
of the game. I think

306
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.090
that's what matters more. So
do you, that kind of

307
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.460
brings me to my original
kind of like loaded question,

308
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.040
which is, do you think
just anyone can be a

309
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.740
program where there is no
limitation really like the idea

310
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.730
that it's some mysterious thing
only a special gifted few

311
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.250
can do is just, it's
just nonsense. Yeah. I do

312
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.740
think that anyone can be
a programmer, but if that

313
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.140
is scientifically not true, I
don't want to know about

314
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.840
it because I think that
the moment you start saying,

315
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.210
Oh, it's only for some
people, but it's really, really

316
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.370
easy to hit a roadblock
and think, Oh, I guess

317
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.860
I'm not one of those
people and to quit. So

318
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.020
whether or not it's true.
I like to believe that

319
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.820
anyone can do anything. And
that's just what I'm gonna

320
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.560
say. Nice. Nice. So then
going backwards, should we be

321
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.080
teaching kids programming at six
years old, 12, 18? When

322
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.990
do you start? I don't
know when the starting age

323
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.850
should be, but I think
it's kind of ridiculous that

324
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.130
I have to take four
years of history in high

325
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.130
school, but I take nothing
in technology that's just before

326
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.250
literally nothing like there's, you
know, electives, I guess, but

327
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.580
that's insane. And I feel
like regardless of whether or

328
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.860
not you want to do
computer science, whether you want

329
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.780
to be a programmer, I
think it's just such a

330
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.660
different way of thinking and
a different way of analyzing

331
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.470
everything that everyone should be
able to experience that for

332
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.200
at least a year, at
some point in public education.

333
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.210
I don't know when that
point is. I think the

334
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.060
sooner, probably the better, but
I think it definitely should

335
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.050
be required. So technology that's
a pillar like geography and

336
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.840
social studies and stuff. See,
I've always felt like another

337
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.140
thing that was missing was
like, home-ec like, hold on.

338
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.220
I don't know if you
did that, but we're different

339
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.830
generations, but like how to
balance checkbook, how to rent

340
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.950
an apartment. Like no one
teaches that you ended up

341
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.920
putting these like 25 year
old humans fully formed out

342
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.190
into the world who like
cannot boil water, make an

343
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.280
egg balanced checkbook, rent an
apartment, or like do anything

344
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.710
Exactly. Especially personal finance. That's
another huge one. Yeah. That's

345
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.370
home economics. That's that's first
the first thing that they

346
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.890
dropped. Right. So the fact
that they're not teaching these

347
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.100
basic skills, I think you're
right. I think that becoming

348
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.380
a developer or a builder
or someone who can at

349
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.700
the very minimum, write a
macro, not feel intimidated by

350
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.170
the machine. Right, right, right.
Yeah. Go ahead. I was

351
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.060
going to say that that's
a really big thing. Cause

352
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.700
I feel like when you're
used to using technology just

353
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.700
to consume stuff, you grow
up with this barrier, you

354
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.590
know, even now I keep
forgetting that I can just

355
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.060
look at the code and
figure it out on my

356
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.340
own. Like I have to
remind myself that. And I

357
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.830
think the biggest advantage to,
you know, having a hacker

358
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:12.730
mentality or a tinkerer mentality
early in life is you

359
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.000
get to interact and do
stuff and manipulate and control

360
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.430
and build in a way
that you're not used to.

361
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.860
Yeah. I, I, my wife
is a, is becoming a

362
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.010
nurse right now and she's
really struggling with the systems

363
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.110
that are put in place
by her school because they're

364
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.530
really old. You've probably remember
when you're in school, they're

365
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.100
using Blackboard and all of
these kind of weird little

366
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.800
web apps. That's literally like
transporting yourself back to like

367
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:41.650
1997 and Chrome keeps updating
every week. And she, and

368
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.990
like it worked last week.
I'm like, well, Chrome update

369
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.180
it. So she's like, well,
Chrome needs to stop updating.

370
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.970
And my answer is usually
try a different browser and

371
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.370
she's like, well, don't you
work on this stuff? Can't

372
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.070
you fix this for me?
Yeah. I don't really sorry.

373
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.900
I can't. But it, as
if she had the hacker

374
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:03.210
mentality, those things suddenly become
intuitive. So you've been going

375
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.100
out of your way as
a new member of the

376
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.280
community to make it feel
right for other people who

377
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.000
are in the community to
make them feel welcome. Did

378
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.530
you feel welcome? I did.
And I was very surprised

379
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.980
that I felt welcome, you
know, before the flatter in

380
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.620
school, I just heard a
lot about the tech community

381
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.220
and how unfriendly it was
for women and minorities and,

382
00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.980
you know, I'm a black
woman. So I was absolutely

383
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.090
terrified and I was really,
really welcomed. And, and to

384
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.910
this day I've been, you
know, receiving nothing but support

385
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.310
and encouragement from my community.
And I feel like a

386
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.130
lot of that has to
do with, I entered through

387
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.500
a bootcamp and I was
kind of introduced through the

388
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.680
community of that bootcamp and
that community is already newbie

389
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.920
friendly. And so, you know,
yeah. And I think that

390
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.010
was huge. And so Then
it's friends of friends of

391
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.500
friends. So everyone is being
vouched for, as you work

392
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.860
outwards in the onion there
for different layers. Exactly. And

393
00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.230
so everyone else is going
to be kind and friendly

394
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.200
and supportive and all that
good stuff. But the one

395
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.840
thing that I guess I
didn't like about it is

396
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.780
I felt very privileged that
I got to, you know,

397
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.690
I think with learning to
code, I ended up not

398
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.060
working for six months cause
I took time off before

399
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.480
the bootcamp. And then I
spent, you know, thousands of

400
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.300
dollars on the bootcamp itself.
So I felt very, very

401
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.820
privileged to have the opportunity
to do that and to

402
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.730
afford that. And the most
valuable thing I got out

403
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.220
of it really was the
community like that has carried

404
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.010
me so far. And I
didn't like the idea that

405
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.040
people who couldn't afford to
do what I did wouldn't

406
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.840
have that community. And if
you don't have it, it's

407
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.930
really, really lonely and really
frustrating to learn to code

408
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.150
on your own. So I
started the code newbie, Twitter

409
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.030
chat to provide that sense
of community for people who

410
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.330
can't necessarily get it from
a book. Yeah. Bootcamps are

411
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.880
surprisingly expensive, they clearly work.
And they're clearly a business.

412
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.570
You know, most of these
are not nonprofits, but you're

413
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.690
right. There's a gap between,
Hey, just go to Khan

414
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:06.470
academy.org/cs or code Academy or
Treehouse or Pluralsight and learn

415
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.780
in silence and alone. Right.
And then pay $10,000 or

416
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.960
something for, for this to
be injected directly into your

417
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.450
brain. Where's that middle ground.
Where's that middle ground. Yeah.

418
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.280
I think there are some
companies that are trying to

419
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.160
fill that space. There's, you
know, the Viking school, which

420
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.160
is doing an online program
there's Thinkful, which is doing

421
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.160
like mentorship and online programs.
I think Tealeaf Academy is

422
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.550
another one. So I think
there's, there's an obvious need.

423
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.680
And I think that people
know there's a need for

424
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.720
some kind of middle ground.
I think they're trying to

425
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.570
fill it. So my way
of filling it is to

426
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.530
just start a chat. Hmm.
So at code newbie, and

427
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.940
this is N E w
I E not noob like

428
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.520
an OB and we'll put
links in the show notes,

429
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.280
you've got a Twitter chat.
Now Twitter chats are interesting.

430
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.290
Do people need to sign
up for Twitter to see

431
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.340
these chats? Not to see
it. I think you can

432
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.590
search for the hashtag and
anybody can, you know, just

433
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.540
be an observer, but to
participate, you do have to

434
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.180
be on Twitter. And Twitter
chats are kind of a

435
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.540
recent last couple of years,
a feature it's basically not

436
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.020
a feature of Twitter. It's
just everyone agrees to use

437
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.590
this hashtag in this case
code newbie at a certain

438
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.980
time, you say it's on
a, what is the day?

439
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.790
Wednesday nights, 9:00 PM. Eastern. Okay.
So Wednesday night. So then

440
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.160
anyone can get involved West
coast or East coast. And

441
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.310
presumably of course, people overseas,
if they're awake. And if

442
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.370
everyone agrees to say hashtag
code newbie y'all can have

443
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:37.170
some pretty compelling conversations. Yep.
Exactly. Has this started into

444
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.630
a, a new community of
people that you've met or

445
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.060
is it mostly just people
that are, have gone through

446
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.630
your programs? It's funny initially
I thought that it would

447
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.180
be filled with, you know,
new developers like myself who

448
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.540
graduated or recently graduated from
a bootcamp, but it's actually

449
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.850
not a lot of the
people that we have are

450
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.730
split between more experienced developers
who want to give back

451
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.980
to the community. And then
the other half are people

452
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.650
who are even newer than
I am, who are mostly

453
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.890
just using code Academy or
code score or, you know,

454
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.800
or in some neighborhood or
town where there's just not

455
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.980
a big developer community and
code newbie is their way

456
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.710
of being part of the,
of the tech community On

457
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:18.060
your, on your Twitter account
at twitter.com/code newbies, a plural.

458
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.900
There's some really cool stories
that you are retweeting people

459
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.510
saying, you know, Hey, I,
I met my goal of

460
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.090
10 hours of development this
week to really find out

461
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.640
like what that's like. And
I started in Ruby this

462
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.450
week and I coded for
a full 10 hours. It's

463
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.090
a pretty amazing stuff. Yeah.
It's great to see the

464
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.820
things that, that they build
and they're excited about and

465
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.640
people blog about what they
work on. We had one

466
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.300
person working on an app
for Ferguson and we've just

467
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.390
had some incredible work there.
And it's, it's exciting because

468
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.970
you get to celebrate the
little wins. Right? A lot

469
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.400
of times I think a
recent, a recent tweet was,

470
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.830
you know, this is kind
of embarrassing, but I finally

471
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.830
got this really simple Ruby
script to work. And every

472
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.630
one of the going to
be community retweeted that in

473
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.310
favor of that and said,
you know, this is great.

474
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.370
You should totally own this
when, so it's a place

475
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.980
where even the things that
may not seem too exciting

476
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.220
are celebrated and encouraged. It
seems like when someone's been

477
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.530
in the industry for five,
six years, even 10, or

478
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:17.550
like in my case, 20
years, those little, those little

479
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.620
achievements, you know, I got
my CSS to do around

480
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.540
the corner, or I figured
out how to do this

481
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.960
in full screen mode. People
like me are like, Oh,

482
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.560
you guys, but you, you
have to look at it

483
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.780
with the same kind of
wide eyed excitement. Cause this

484
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.400
is an entire universe that
people are discovering that we,

485
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.490
people who are inside you
and I totally take for

486
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.360
granted. Yeah. I remember the
very first time I learned

487
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.920
CSS and I turned the
background, yellow blew mind, just

488
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.680
blew my mind. I was
so excited that I turned

489
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.960
the background yellow because for
the first time I was

490
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.230
controlling the computer in a
way that I never had.

491
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.510
And so if anything, I
see the handle on the

492
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.570
site as a way to
just be a cheerleader for

493
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.910
everyone. And to just say
like all those little steps

494
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.220
you're taking, you're on your
way to somewhere really important

495
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.820
and really big. I think
that so, so many people

496
00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.460
just don't understand that like,
Hey, you push a button

497
00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.100
on the remote control TV
turns on and you know

498
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.800
what happened there? There's I
think there's a mindset. I

499
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.040
always call it the taking
apart, the toaster mindset, like

500
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.530
there's this there's people who
make toast. And there's people

501
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.620
who like make the totally
how the hell did that

502
00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.990
thing make toast. And then
they start taking it apart,

503
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.020
you know? And some people
come built in that way

504
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.150
and they take stuff apart.
But other people, you really

505
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:32.650
need to take something apart
in front of them and

506
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.440
go look now here, you,
you put this back together.

507
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.900
And when you do that
on the web, like you

508
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.630
said, you changed some CSS.
One of my favorite things

509
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.880
I'm going to do this
weekend at a conference called

510
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.220
blend conference, teach a bunch
of middle schoolers, how to

511
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.060
surf the web from Telnet.
Like you have to go

512
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.110
into Telnet, open the socket
to port 80 type, get

513
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.940
HTTP, cnn.com and hit enter.
And then suddenly you're like,

514
00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.510
wait a second. There's an
underneath. Yep. You know, it's

515
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.520
almost like showing them the
basement. Like I look at

516
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.540
all the cool stuff we
have in the base. Yeah.

517
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.870
That's fantastic. So what are
your plans for code newbie

518
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.790
right now? It's a Twitter
chat. It's a website. It's

519
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.930
a mailing list. What's next?
Yeah. So one thing that

520
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.330
we're doing the podcast and
when we actually recorded our

521
00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.180
first episode, hoping to do
a couple more and I'm

522
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.340
really excited because, you know,
I listened to a lot

523
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.590
of tech podcasts and I'm
actually, I'm a panelist for

524
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.170
Ruby rogues and it's great.
But a lot of times

525
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.970
I feel a little bit
lost because a lot of

526
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.360
the topics are complex. The
guests that we have are

527
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.960
definitely experienced programmers. And so
I really liked the idea

528
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.620
of having a podcast just
for newbies and directed at

529
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.890
newbies and focusing more on
the journey of coding and

530
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.320
less so on kind of,
you know, the, the end

531
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.450
product, if that makes sense.
So that's one thing I'm

532
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.150
really excited about. The other
thing is we have so

533
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.680
much information and so many
resources being shared on Twitter,

534
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.340
and it's great to see
that energy and that support

535
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.800
in the community. But it's
also frustrating because Twitter like

536
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.160
goes away, you know, the
tweets kind of evaporate and

537
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.560
just a couple hours. And
so I'm really looking forward

538
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.540
to starting a discussion board
and kind of moving the

539
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.550
community to a place where
you can go back and

540
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.100
reference the resources that you
share. So those are my

541
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.740
two really big goals. So
thinking about maybe like forums

542
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.200
or something like maybe discourse,
which I think is a

543
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.380
Ruby application. Yep, exactly. Very
cool. So people will be

544
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.970
able look at this, of
course, code newbie.org for your

545
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.660
personal journey. Are you programming
professionally now? What are your

546
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.340
plans? What kind of things
are you building now that

547
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.330
you can build? Yeah. So
it's funny, I'm literally in

548
00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.060
between jobs right now. So
I just finished a seventh

549
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.140
month residency at the New York
tech meetup, which is the

550
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.010
largest meetup organization in the
world, focusing on technology. Yeah.

551
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.890
We have over 40,000 members
at this point. And so

552
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.100
I spent the last seven
months building a platform with

553
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.130
one other developer. We pretty
much did everything. Ourselves is

554
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.210
incredible, especially as a first
job for a programmer. And

555
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.070
then in a few months
I'm going to be starting

556
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.100
at thought bot as a
developer apprentice. So the next

557
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.080
couple months are kind of
focused on me building out

558
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.650
code newbie and really ramping
up on my skills and

559
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.090
you know, doing a lot
of stuff for the community.

560
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.800
So you said developer apprentice,
which is interesting because I

561
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.810
have, I've had a gentleman
on the show a couple

562
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.760
of weeks ago who talked
about what it means to

563
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.520
be a junior engineer. And
I found that there's a

564
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.910
certain amount of entitlement. I
think amongst computer people, you

565
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.920
may have come upon folks
that are like, Hey, I've

566
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.540
been, I've been doing this
for three years. I'm a

567
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.200
senior engineer, like, and in
particular, and also technology is

568
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.080
moving so fast. Some of
these technologies have only existed

569
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.140
for a year. So there
was like that joke. What's

570
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.510
the name of the, the
new technology that Apple came

571
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:46.400
out, that it replaced objective
C Swift. So Swift comes

572
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.490
out and then like the
next day, like you go

573
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.680
to monster.com and it's like,
I'm looking for a senior

574
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.360
Swift engineer with five years,
experience things move so fast.

575
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.400
You know, who is a
junior engineer who is a

576
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.100
senior engineer and when you're
an intern, do you, do

577
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.890
you feel bad about being
an intern? You're like, I'm

578
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.600
just an intern or do
you think this is an

579
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.360
amazing opportunity? How do you,
how do you take that?

580
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.170
Yeah. So when I worked
at New York tech meetup, I

581
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.890
felt like I had way
more responsibility than anyone would

582
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.920
ever give me at that
point. And so, you know,

583
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.570
it was interesting because I
felt like it was a

584
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.150
great opportunity to prove myself
and to, you know, show

585
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.130
everybody what I could do
and all that. But I

586
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.070
also learned everything the hard
way, right? Cause there's no

587
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.530
senior person to say, Oh,
I've tried this before. Maybe

588
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.180
you should do this. And
not that, or that gem

589
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.690
is totally awful. Do this,
use this instead. And so

590
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.810
without that, you're kind of
testing a lot of stuff

591
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.420
and you're starting from scratch
over and over again. So

592
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.200
I'm really excited, honestly, to
be in a more junior

593
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.990
role, you know, as far
as official titles go, because

594
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.150
I've learned that I need
to be a student more,

595
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.730
you know, I think that
I would learn more and

596
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.970
get a lot further by
having someone more senior than

597
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.830
me kind of guide me
through a process that I

598
00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.400
would just continuing to hack
along. So it definitely showed

599
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.170
me how far I can
get, and I'm really proud

600
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.320
of my progress, but I'm
very, very happy to be

601
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.360
back in more of an
apprentice role. How do you

602
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:15.290
separate the non, the non
technology specific concepts in your

603
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.480
mind? Like for example, if
I were to go work

604
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.810
on New York tech meetup, you
know, like I said, I've

605
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.820
been in the industry 20
years, but I would probably

606
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.540
work for you because I
don't know Ruby and I

607
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.370
don't know rails. Right. I
mean, I have a general

608
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.200
understanding. I've read some books,
I've done a couple of

609
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.340
projects, so I've got a
systems architecture background and I

610
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.490
can build large systems. And
I know how at a

611
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:42.370
theoretical level, those things work.
Yeah. Which you may not

612
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.200
have, but at the same
time, you know, so how

613
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.990
do you think you and
I would work together? It,

614
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.890
what I work for you
or we'd work for each

615
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.060
other. We'd be peers. I
think, however we word, I

616
00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.940
think you and I would
have a blast That is

617
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.910
clear. Yeah. But you know,
I think that we'd actually

618
00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.120
compliment each other very well
because what I found interesting

619
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.060
about that was it wasn't
the coding that was hard.

620
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.060
Like actually getting things to
work was not the hard

621
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.820
part. That part was actually
fine. The hard part was

622
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.910
understanding what features should take
priority, what order to do

623
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.730
them in, how long do
you bang your head against

624
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.950
the wall before you move
on to a different solution,

625
00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.730
it was product development issues.
It was decision-making, it was

626
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.850
more of that stuff than
it was anything language or

627
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:28.650
framework specific. So what I'm
yeah, yeah, definitely. And it

628
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.810
was also, you know, this
is a skill I totally

629
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:36.030
underestimated. It's also talking to
nontechnical people, you know, which

630
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:40.500
I, you know, when, you
know, Jessica Lawrence, who's the executive

631
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.510
director and it's a very
small office. It's just her

632
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.450
and one other person. And
then the two developers and

633
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.670
we would meet every week
and touch base. And I

634
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.240
was never quite sure how
much to explain how much

635
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.520
I should be telling her
how much she cared to

636
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.800
know it was, it was,
it was very, very uncomfortable.

637
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.340
That alone is a skillset
I would love to learn.

638
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.080
That is a really interesting,
yeah, because it's like, I'm

639
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.580
gonna use this gym, you
know, I don't really care,

640
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.700
but, but at the same
time there might be licensing

641
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.940
issues. What do we, as
an organization use as far

642
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.470
as our opensource license and
we don't want to bring

643
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.520
in GPL code, whatever. Right.
And even things like, you

644
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.620
know, Oh, this feature will
take a couple of days

645
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.540
to build, Oh, it took
two weeks. Let me now

646
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.090
I have to explain why.
And if you don't know

647
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.400
the, you know, the tech
behind why then nothing I'm

648
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.870
saying will make sense and
you might think I'm an

649
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:27.780
idiot. So it's really important
to know how to talk

650
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.810
to the nontechnical. Very, very
cool. Well, it's just an

651
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.690
absolute joy to talk with
you saran yet bark, you

652
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:38.550
can check out saran@codenewbie.org. We'll
put links to their Twitter,

653
00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.790
chat, their website, their podcast,
which will probably be out

654
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.910
by the time this podcast
is out and as well

655
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:47.160
as being able to connect
on Twitter. Thanks so much.

656
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.070
Yeah. Thanks so much. This
has been another episode of

657
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.110
Hansel minutes and we'll see
you again next week.
