In this episode, Microsoft developer

9
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.540
Polly DePaula gets a visit
from Scott and Roy life.

10
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.800
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman
and I'm wandering around building

11
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.500
42 at Microsoft, and I'm
asking random people in random

12
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.790
offices. What are you working
on Roy? Thanks for walking

13
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.930
around with me at building
40. Okay. Okay. Hi. How

14
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:23.570
are you? Hi, <inaudible> fantastic
thing. Is that Greg? What

15
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.060
is it? It's not great.
A, well, the first name

16
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.790
is Mexican and the last
name is German. I was

17
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.280
so wrong in every possible
way at HR question to

18
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.320
ask on chaplain. Well, I
actually do it all the

19
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.210
time. I'm really curious just
because we've got people from

20
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.640
all over the world, actually
a lot of people, I

21
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.430
guess. Huh? Okay. Well, I
don't feel that by then.

22
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.890
So what do you do?
What's your title? I am

23
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.670
a, I'm a dev on
the asp.net team. We have.

24
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.760
That's your debt you program?
I do. If we found

25
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.510
one. Okay. The deal is
this. There is a 10

26
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.990
to one ratio program managers
to devs at Microsoft. It's

27
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.820
a little known fact and
you could potentially own a

28
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.130
feature as a PM and
you have only one 10th

29
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.120
of developer's time. We didn't
know that Jeff's existed. We

30
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.260
haven't found any. I won
the feature for the group

31
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.990
program manager of the unit
you actually code for a

32
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.510
living. I actually code for
a living on any features

33
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.670
or managing any programs or
products. Well, I do on

34
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.580
features, but definitely features. Oh,
that's fantastic. That's fantastic. Well,

35
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.090
I own a namespace. I
don't, I haven't, I am

36
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.950
parts of a namespace. I
didn't spaces, system, web UI

37
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.740
dealt with controls. Wow. That's
actually huge. I wish I

38
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.090
could say I came up
with it, but I didn't

39
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.820
know. What do you do?
What are you coding? I

40
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.700
mean, I couldn't see sharp
and I own the data

41
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.410
features or asp.net. So I
wrote the good view and

42
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.000
details of you in front
of you is where the

43
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.920
grid view <inaudible> I can't
believe we just walked in

44
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.820
here. We're going to totally.
Yes. Yeah. I taught people

45
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.590
how to use it. I
went through a home thing

46
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.090
where I was just teaching
people how to use it.

47
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.530
I've done that hardcore. Yeah.
Great. Yeah. And then we

48
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.800
another dev and I kind
of designed the, the data

49
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.590
interface options, data source and
SQL data. So Yeah, that

50
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.680
is cool. I love the
B side all data source,

51
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.400
but you have to data
source. Is it allowed for

52
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.490
that abstraction? That was, you
know, kind of, you know,

53
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.130
that was a bit difficult
to do influence as a

54
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.320
dev. Do you have on
the design? I mean, are

55
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.500
you sitting down and designing
out the experience and the

56
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.390
UML and how this thing's
going to create or does

57
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.910
someone do that? And you're
just trying to crack, I

58
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.330
dunno, we designed almost the
whole thing. We, we have

59
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.330
a very strong program manager
that we work with and

60
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.640
it's literally like two or
three of us will sit

61
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.060
down and talk everything out.
Talk about property names, and

62
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.490
are you stuff over and
our wrestle about what's the

63
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.300
best, whoever wins, wins, and
then you, Or something like

64
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.040
that, who says, man, we,
you know, the thing that

65
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.710
we're missing, object data source,
who does that and then

66
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.110
tells you, and then you
go, Oh yes. And you

67
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.560
get excited about it. When,
when does that happen? Largely

68
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920
nobody tells us what's missing.
We, we know our customers

69
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.560
really well. And we say,
we need object, data source.

70
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.570
We need this thing that
can just buy into, you

71
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.530
know, people's code. And so
we, we prioritize it and

72
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.080
we build it. It's really
fun. We were working on

73
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.650
stuff for orcas It's pattern
cubes to Petland cute. She's

74
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.090
got freaking six of them
cubes. Wow. Initial dynamic, rendering

75
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.220
control data. Wow. Yeah, that
was a feature that, that

76
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.740
made it into a CTP,
but not create a final

77
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.920
release. The names are so
you must not have come

78
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.210
with a super tentious. They'll
give some really complicated named

79
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.460
method and system provider actually
dated by and they get

80
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.210
control of the template. They
have to be specific object

81
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.920
data source on the cube
is that would be too

82
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.890
often. That's not the object.
That's the bind statement. The

83
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.440
fund, you have a patent
for the binds different fine

84
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.440
pair, you know, open parent,
close parents without, without getting

85
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.830
to, you know, potentially, you
know, stuck in the legal

86
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.560
stuff. Do you know? I
mean, I don't do patents

87
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.390
myself or I've never, I'm
not, I'm not one of

88
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.100
the smart people here. So
when you do those, is

89
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.740
it more to protect us
rather than to, you know,

90
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.960
use it like to Lord
over other people? I always

91
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.480
feel like we do patents
to protect ourselves. I think

92
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.860
it's a little bit of
both. We do it to

93
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.970
protect ourselves into a kind
of claim ownership over something

94
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.890
that we feel is unique.
But, but I think it's

95
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.050
also to make sure that
that is ours in the

96
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.390
future that we don't, we
don't have a lot of

97
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.850
features that we're giving away
for free. Yeah. Because I

98
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.160
think he's just sometimes have
the idea that we're just

99
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.080
like trying to patent everything
so that we can, you

100
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.120
know, be like a big
bulldozer. But I don't think

101
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.770
we're doing that. I mean,
we do it to protect

102
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.230
our IP really. I mean,
I've been here eight years

103
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.560
and I've got six of
these. It's not that common.

104
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.310
We don't, Well, we saw
Vance's office, you've seen his

105
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.980
office, he sits on a
cube of cubes. It doesn't

106
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.400
sound countable. He's got like,
I was like 14, 14.

107
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.950
He had quite a few,
they were in a pyramid,

108
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.100
but I mean, yeah, it's
cool. Every time I see

109
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.970
someone with cubes, I get
excited. Cause cubes. Yeah, he

110
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.420
did something good. You know,
I'm actually, I'm starting to

111
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.750
think of something to say
I've starstruck with. <inaudible> pretty

112
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.700
cool. We got very, very
lucky. I worked on a

113
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.270
book with, with bill Evian
and Devin rater for Rocksville

114
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:42.130
professionally. Never heard of the
book. No idea just knew

115
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.580
she doesn't need it. I
know. But see if I

116
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.470
knew her before it would
have been a better book.

117
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.620
Do you bother you that
we reflect into your code

118
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.390
to get into your mind?
Or would you rather than

119
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.820
we just gave you, would
you rather that you could

120
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.820
give away the source? And
that's interesting because we reflect,

121
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.110
we feel the sources available
anyway. Well, absolutely. We don't

122
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.100
mind the guy that wrote
reflector, you know, down the

123
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.400
hall, right? Yeah. We're looking
for him. Yeah. He's usually

124
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.160
around. I think it's great
that people look in the,

125
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.110
in the code and figure
out how to do stuff

126
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.000
on their own. It's almost
like an enabler to make

127
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.870
you more independent. You don't
have to send mail to

128
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.500
somebody at Microsoft. And if
you don't get your answer

129
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.230
off the forums, you can
find it yourself. The XML

130
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.020
data stores also. I know
I didn't do the Monday.

131
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.830
Yeah. So I want to
know why it doesn't support

132
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.880
namespaces within X path. You
can't use the XML data

133
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.000
source with any document that
has a namespace. I don't

134
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.850
know the answer. No prefixes,
nothing to call out sick

135
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:55.630
today. Now he's sick. He's
faced prefixes. He's telling you

136
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.820
to appreciate me. How did
you coordinate that? You've got

137
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.830
one person. I mean the
XML data source, you obviously

138
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.340
want to have a overarching
group of data sources and

139
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.590
they all want to behave
the same way. <inaudible> Oh,

140
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.900
so the actual there's a
patent for the creation of

141
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.690
that. The management of that.
Wow. That's great. Yeah. So

142
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.520
Alon the guy who wrote
most of those and I

143
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:24.460
spend lots and lots of
time. Yeah. <inaudible> to get

144
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.320
back into the content what's
that made out of, I'm

145
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:38.050
going to be granted my
countertops. Wow. That's fantastic. And

146
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.500
then who's your guest? My
guest is Matt. He's my

147
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.440
manager too. Hi Matt. So
Matt, you have responsibility over

148
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.200
which, which portions of stuff
now. Cause you're never going

149
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.520
to pull it. You just
keep rising. I have responsibility

150
00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:01.470
over asb.net. Yeah. Full-stop system,
that web system, that configuration

151
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.340
you're branching up. So, so
I have a question for

152
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.680
you and this is getting
a little off of your

153
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.520
topic, although I really respect,
what do you think about

154
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.330
alternative ways to write, write
and that's sites like monorail

155
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:22.020
and the castle project. So,
so, and this is not

156
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.700
like a control and I'm
not trying to kind of

157
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.640
like how much it from
the side, but, but you

158
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.440
know, you know that there
are people out there doing

159
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.310
crazy wacky stuff with HTTP
handlers and to be modules

160
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.500
and stuff like that. When
someone builds something on top

161
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.620
of like monorail is a
rails, like framework, an MVC

162
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.190
framework based on an HTP
handler. And it's an alternate

163
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:48.090
lifestyle that runs within ASP.
The thought process. When you

164
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.800
hear about something like that,
that a person's built a

165
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.130
whole other parallel universe, evil
Spock, there's an evil mat

166
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.010
with a goatee doing this
kind of work. Do you

167
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.570
go, Hey, that's awesome. Fantastic.
Or do you kind of

168
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.830
wish they really understood pages
and the whole, what we

169
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.650
were thinking, is there kind
of a sense of now

170
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.490
it's not a, have they
done something evil? It's it's

171
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.370
what is it that they're,
they're driving out there? For

172
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.500
example, they might say that
we really wanted a really

173
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.210
true MVC style model, three
framework, and that the code

174
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.160
behind it just didn't give
us the kind of separation

175
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.350
that we wanted. They felt
that the markup and the

176
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.410
Kobe Hunter. So, so married
partially because of the way

177
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.180
that one, one had that
kind of uncomfortable derivation situation

178
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.640
that became very nice with
the partial classes stuff. But

179
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.700
they felt that the idea
that you can't reuse a

180
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.780
code behind with other markup,
without some serious dancing, you

181
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.590
can always do stuff without
some dancing when they do

182
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.390
stuff like that. Do you
want to kind of bring

183
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.070
them back into the fold
and explain to them like,

184
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.210
this is what we were
thinking or do you think

185
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.740
that's great. They want to
build that on top of

186
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.380
it. And they're using the
stack. I take it beyond

187
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.170
that. I look at it
and go, we have the

188
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.440
page framework and controls architecture
is somewhat heavy weight and

189
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.230
the control tree and the
whole pre-render process is nontrivial.

190
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.880
And if they say, what
I really wanted is a

191
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.870
model view architecture, and I
want it this way. I'm

192
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.180
not looking to convert them
back to some other architecture.

193
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.670
I look at it, go,
are there ways that we

194
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.520
should be building something closer
to that? So how do

195
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.440
you do that? So here
you've got people like the

196
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.140
rails guys in the Ruby
world, they have a, just

197
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.290
a very different view on
things. And I know that

198
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:27.000
there's the, where's the, where's
the, the generator that someone

199
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.590
just did. It was a,
that was you, Scott. You

200
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.000
want to tell the audience
real quick or what do

201
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.930
you tell ya? That's an
example. So here's an example

202
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.730
of someone doing the alternative
lifestyle thing. And the team

203
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.620
itself, is this your way
of kind of sending a

204
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.080
message, like here's a totally
different way thinking about it.

205
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.870
We really, the creativity And
what we see in the,

206
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.080
in the industry of people
coming out with new things

207
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.030
are their way of telling
us what they want to

208
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.100
see an estimate on that.
And that's how we get

209
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.090
to figure out what people
want. And we knew there

210
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.730
was an area where people
wanted to show their data

211
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.860
and they didn't want to
spend a ton of time

212
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.560
kind of exposing their data
and wiring up lots of

213
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.560
data sources. They wanted something
that could get them started

214
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.530
really quickly. And also we
wanted a chance to show

215
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.600
off this new technology called
length that we were building.

216
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.450
So that's what blink did
it. It was a command

217
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.210
line generator, really simple, no
UI or anything that just

218
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.150
says, here's, you know, you
showed me your database and

219
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.060
I can show you pages.
That'll let you insert, update,

220
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.130
delete, filter, all those things
that should just It's like

221
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.040
Rick, just do it. Yeah.
It just like, right. Yeah.

222
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.590
And, and when you're done,
you should have a website

223
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.180
that works for That's an
asp.net WWF. L I N

224
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.920
Q. Yeah. You're just the
hits. Keep coming. Can I

225
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.320
say something that's fine. I
just thought your question was

226
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.260
really interesting because I mean,
it is on our stack,

227
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.330
so that's, that's good. You
know, that's a good thing.

228
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.430
So they're building on our
staff, but I used to

229
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.050
work kind of in the
Java world. You know, that's

230
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.940
what I did before coming
to the Microsoft side of

231
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.970
things. And, you know, the
Java kind of method was

232
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.760
to build your own framework.
You know, you often just

233
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.020
kind of went ahead and
build, you built your own

234
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.480
framework and you didn't use
the supply tools. And the

235
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.600
Microsoft word is typically people
use the supply tools, you

236
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.130
know, they don't typically build
their own framework. So this

237
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.230
is actually kind of a
fairly new thing in, in

238
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.980
Microsoft. I think it's nice
because of like C sharp

239
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.010
and VB and boom and
iron Python and the stuff

240
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.170
that's on Lam and the
Ruby CLR guys are doing.

241
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.120
I mean, this is all
just saying that, you know,

242
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.020
babble is, is kind of,
okay, diversity is all right.

243
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.210
There are languages that are
clearly more expressive than others,

244
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.730
but in the aztreonam net
world early on, it was

245
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:47.550
just such a monolithic thing.
And, and that people can

246
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.340
be encouraged to do blank
or monorail or, or whatever

247
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.900
else. That's not that we
support that, that tells me

248
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.230
that there could potentially be
a future for blank beyond

249
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.260
just being a, a curiosity
or a CTP or a,

250
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.180
you know, a sample that
just kind of sits there.

251
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.150
It could be an alternative
way of thinking about how

252
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:11.430
to do stuff Upset. Yeah.
And that the evolution of

253
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.120
blink is that the team
that does our designer is

254
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.840
looking at building perhaps a
wizard in the future where

255
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.310
maybe you could choose your
tables. It'll do something Cool.

256
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.620
The done at CF has
some tools like that, sort

257
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.130
of where you can generate
an entire tenancy of from

258
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.830
a, from a database. Well
sort of, I mean, a

259
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.150
lot, a lot of the
plumbing is done for you.

260
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.250
It's actually pretty cool. And
I mean, well, that gets

261
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.170
into the whole topic of,
of where can you find

262
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.210
your contract, right. Let me
talk to about this, Roy

263
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.340
I'll, I'll find the idea
of a, we call it

264
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.090
contract supplementation or use your
contract in some ways it's

265
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.520
NCLR metadata, and you want
to generate the fan out

266
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.330
from there, or is it
fries? Is it your, your

267
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.240
database? Is it an XML
file? You have model driven

268
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.520
development, right? Here's kind of
what I'm trying to say.

269
00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.680
And what can't you generate
generate if you're, if you

270
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.420
have to write anything that
could have been done by

271
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.500
the computer. Sure. You could
imagine, you know, generating like

272
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.650
forms apps or generating apps
or generating, you know, lots

273
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.860
of different things. There's, there's
no reason that that UI,

274
00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.460
like can't be switched out
for other UI layers. I

275
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.950
think the teaser. Thank you
both. Thank you so much

276
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.730
for accommodating us. And we're
just sort of barging in

277
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.200
sort of a we're good.
Thanks guys.
