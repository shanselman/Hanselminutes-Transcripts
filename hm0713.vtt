today@raygun.com. That's our a Y
G U n.com. Hi, this

11
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.160
is Scott Hanselman. This Hansel
minutes today. I'm talking with

12
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.010
Brian Lyons. How are you sir?
Doing well? How about yourself?

13
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.680
I am getting there. I
am well blessed to have

14
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.690
a podcast. So I'm feeling
pretty good about that. I

15
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.400
get to talk to people
like you, which is pretty

16
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.610
cool as well. You have
had a couple of pretty

17
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
good tweets lately that have
got me thinking where you

18
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.090
talk about leveling up, like
the secret to being an

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.640
engineer and the secret to
being this level or that

20
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.190
level. But you've talked about
what it means to be

21
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.670
a complete engineer. What does
that mean? A complete engineer.

22
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.100
Am I an incomplete engineer?
No. So one day maybe

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.590
I'll write a book about
this, but I'll start here.

24
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.220
There's there's I have these
roles to life because I

25
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.460
realized that I can't fake
it till I make it.

26
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.980
I'll ex I have anxiety.
So I have to have

27
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.060
rules for everything I do.
So rule number one is

28
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.140
there's a competition going on
out there and you're the

29
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.660
only person in this competition.
You can only compete against

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.260
yourself. You can't compete against
anyone else. You can watch

31
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.480
what other people do. You
could enjoy it. You can

32
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.520
try to emulate it, but
you could only do it

33
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.850
to your ability and to
someone was anxiety, like an

34
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.970
anxiety disorder that I have.
What it does is it

35
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.330
allows me to compare myself
to myself, which means that

36
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.850
I can, I can at
least get to where I

37
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.970
was before and maybe top
it, but, you know, comparing

38
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.370
myself in a vacuum to
let's say someone like Scott

39
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.120
Hanselman, who is super popular,
you know, I would never

40
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.350
compare myself to you. So
that's, that's how that's rule

41
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.860
number one. And then when
it comes to being a

42
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.890
complete developer, what I think
about it is two different

43
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.880
things. So there is you,
the developer, the person who

44
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.110
is basically writing software for
money for somebody, either for

45
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.500
yourself or someone else, but
writing software for money. And

46
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.340
then there's you, the developer
who is providing an impact

47
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.920
on the world. And that
impact can be a couple

48
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.190
different things. It can be,
you're helping other developers level

49
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.380
up, or you're providing a
good role model for people

50
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.160
or, you know, even better
yet. You're just not causing

51
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.310
any problems. Cause sometimes you
get tired and you to

52
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.220
do anything else and yeah,
just do no harm. Literally

53
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.600
these rules that I use
and these guide how I

54
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.280
approach life, because I'll tell
you, it's interesting. I didn't

55
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.040
grow up in a way
that I thought I'd be

56
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.270
a software developer for money.
We weren't poor. We definitely

57
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.670
weren't poor. My father was
in the military, but we

58
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.970
weren't rich like far from
it. And the people that

59
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.100
I saw were mostly blue
collar and some good, some

60
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.080
bad. Some of them are
still living. Some of them

61
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.060
are not still living. Some
of them are in jail

62
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.170
or some of them were
in jail. So I didn't

63
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.930
see myself. I saw myself
as you know, just trying

64
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.380
to do the right thing
to make the best situation,

65
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.390
have a better life than
my parents. You know, that's,

66
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.590
that was my dream. The
crazy thing is that now

67
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.770
as an adult, what I'm
trying to do is share

68
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.070
those lessons that I've learned
and show people that what

69
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.820
I've done in life is
not a fluke. It's, I'm

70
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.600
very purposeful. There was some
luck, but all out of

71
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.930
these opportunities, I put myself
in that position. And when

72
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.180
I see people out there
on Twitter, it's my favorite

73
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.980
part. It's Twitter. Or they
get on there and they're

74
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.060
like, Hey, y'all I got
my first job and I'm

75
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.840
a software developer. And I'm
like, yay. That's amazing. And

76
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.340
I always like it and
I'll go look at their

77
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.120
history and maybe I'll follow
them. But that's what makes

78
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.670
me, that's the kind of
world that I want to

79
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.000
live in where we're trying
our best. But we're also

80
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.550
looking at people behind us
trying their best as well.

81
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.740
I've always tried to like
remind myself how I got

82
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.620
up the ladder and then
try to figure out how

83
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.260
I'm going to pull people
up the ladder, you know,

84
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.770
with me, because there's lots
of different things that made

85
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.920
the rungs on the ladder
and made those rungs possible.

86
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.560
It can be like you
said, you know, luck, it

87
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.470
can be being prepared when
the luck happened, where I

88
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.460
was talking about opportunity being
luck, plus being prepared when

89
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.010
people tweet about that stuff
online and they say, I

90
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.840
did this, or I did
that. How did you ever

91
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.940
think about their journey? How
they got there? How hard

92
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.170
it was? Cause we don't,
we don't know. We just

93
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.630
saw the tweet. It was
very small tweet. Well, that

94
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.030
was something I had to
learn for a long time,

95
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.390
you know? But on as
of January, I've been on

96
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.690
Twitter for what? 13 years,
something like that. I think

97
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.860
I joined in 2007. You
know what? I don't care.

98
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.800
I'm a grown man. I
like what I like. It

99
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.960
doesn't even matter anymore. I
don't need to be cool,

100
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.860
but let me suck. But,
but really, wow. Let's, let's,

101
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.610
let's rewind this a little
bit. I mean, unpack this

102
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.550
a little bit. You are
always going to see somebody

103
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.580
who is doing better than
you. I mean, I want

104
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.740
to be president like Barack
Obama, that seemed like a

105
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.320
pretty cool gig until you
see his hair color from

106
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.800
when he got into, when
he left, maybe that's not

107
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.530
a cool gig, but bringing
it more closer to tech,

108
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.370
I've seen people who've written
software and I've used it.

109
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.840
And then I, and I
looked at it and I'm

110
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.390
like, Oh wow, that's amazing.
And then I go look

111
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.710
at the source and I'm
like, well, I could have

112
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.090
wrote this. So that's the
secret is that we like

113
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.270
to put people on pedestals
as people who are doing

114
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.990
great things in the game,
but you know, really what

115
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.650
you have to do every
single time is congratulate them.

116
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.680
Like my role, number one,
don't compare yourself to somebody

117
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.090
else and understand that you're
only seeing what might be

118
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.730
the best that they'll ever
be. Like they got this

119
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.250
one thing that one time
that you saw at two

120
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.150
35 on Twitter three weeks
ago. And you know, we're

121
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.120
both over 40, that's a
lot of time to see

122
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.150
to, to just wait for
that particular thing. So what

123
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.830
you have to do is
you have to go make

124
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.520
the moments for yourself. And
that's, that's the hard piece.

125
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.870
There was a tweet today
from ed Williams, he said,

126
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.280
Disney released a major streaming
service. That's playing more errors

127
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.610
than contents. And we're all
still here. You need to

128
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.400
launch that imperfect thing that
you've been sitting on for

129
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.360
months. I just love that
tweet. It's just a perfect

130
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.120
little tweet right there. Like
all those people that we

131
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.180
look up to, they, the
thing that they made, that

132
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.460
imperfect thing that we all
use, they did it though.

133
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.820
They put it out there.
Yeah. But real talk Disney

134
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.300
signed up 10 million customers Mark
yesterday. Have you ever done

135
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.290
that? I think about that.
I definitely said hug ops

136
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.510
to our friends at Disney
who were struggling with that,

137
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.300
but I kind of liked
the romance of it though.

138
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.370
The idea that like, yeah,
I mean it's not perfect.

139
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.770
I mean, sure. It's pretty
awesome. Like, it's pretty fantastic,

140
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.290
but yeah, maybe they would've
signed up 12 million if it

141
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.710
hadn't been Right. And, but
I will just tell you

142
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.740
right before this podcast, I
was down in my theater

143
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.970
watching Mandalorian and it didn't,
it didn't skip a beat.

144
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.550
I didn't understand any of
it. It didn't. I was

145
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.040
like, I don't understand this,
but I am intrigued and

146
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.930
I'll be back. We need
to have a whole show

147
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.860
just about unpacking the Mandalorian
because that I'm ready to

148
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.740
do frame by frame analysis.
I very much enjoyed that.

149
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.500
Yeah. There was a lot,
there was a lot going

150
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.060
on in there. So, but
understand it though that you,

151
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.850
the success that you see
may have been something that

152
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.420
took, you know, weeks or
months or years to make.

153
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.310
And it could have only
been like a one time

154
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.370
thing. So why are you
setting yourself up to fail

155
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.010
for something that you know
is not sustainable? At least

156
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.840
not for yourself. Cause you
ain't put in the work.

157
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.210
So you gotta can't have
MV and you can, but

158
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.060
you can definitely appreciate what
people are doing and then

159
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.730
realize that this is a
big world. And then our,

160
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.270
like our tech ecosystem is
huge. There's so much money

161
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.930
out there. Everyone should have
the chance to go get

162
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.200
their shine, but you know,
forces don't make it, doesn't

163
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.770
make that possible, but it's
out there. Why do we

164
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.060
choose though, to set up
these systems, this idea that

165
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.210
I'm sitting here in my
little house in Portland, Oregon,

166
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.270
and I'm salty that Ryan Reynolds
has my comedy career. You

167
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.340
know? I mean, I didn't
do the sit ups and

168
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.530
I don't have the hair,
but still I'm mad at

169
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.400
this man. Yeah. But guess
what you didn't do. I

170
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.710
didn't, you didn't do the
common clubs. You didn't do

171
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.810
the comedy clubs. You didn't
do the COVID. Yeah, I

172
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.340
did for a minute, but
I wasn't good at it.

173
00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.540
That's all Right. He probably
got booed his first time

174
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.150
too. And, but he kept
with it and it doesn't

175
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.010
help that he's I guess
he's good looking and, and

176
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:33.110
he's Canadian close to charisma
right there. Right. And he

177
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.340
made van Wilder. I know
there's so many, you didn't

178
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.620
make bandwidth, But I set
myself up and I sit

179
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.350
here and I'm sad about
that. So what do we

180
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.180
do to lift up the
people who are listening to

181
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.620
this show? And they're like,
man, I wish I could

182
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.930
get on Brian Lyles his
level. He's a, you know,

183
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.880
doing all this cool stuff,
making all this great open

184
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.630
source software, how do we
set them up? Well, I

185
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.420
understand that, like I will
talk about this open source,

186
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.720
my newest open source, but
that was a year journey.

187
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.890
We started that project in
like September of last year.

188
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.530
And I didn't talk about
it until August of this

189
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.450
year. And the understand that
it might look neat on

190
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.810
the, on the outside, but
it's not complete because it's

191
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.150
a hard problem, but it's
good enough that I can

192
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.360
show people. And I'm fairly
certain, you won't lose any

193
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.970
data, like, like pretty certainty.
You won't lose any data.

194
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.360
And that was the important
piece to me. Well then

195
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.010
you might lose data. No.
Alright, we'll ship it. But

196
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.010
how did I get there?
Well, the problem that I

197
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.920
think a lot of people
do, or a lot of

198
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.300
people run into is that
you want to, you want

199
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.200
to swing your little baseball
bat, whatever your software thing

200
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.150
is. And you want to
say, well, I'm going to

201
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.150
hit a triple home run.
Not even like a normal

202
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.400
home, right? You want to
get around the base three

203
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.430
times. Oh, that doesn't make
any sense. You can't do

204
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.490
that. And then you're like,
all right, well maybe I'll

205
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.890
just hit a single, well,
guess what? You don't even

206
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.440
know how to hold the
bat. So first of all,

207
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.690
learn how to hold the
bat. So what have I

208
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.540
been doing? This is actually,
I'll tell you about the

209
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.980
project now. So recently back
in, I guess, August I

210
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.930
released a project open source
called Oakton. And what actin

211
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.310
is, it's a, it's a
console that runs in your

212
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:25.490
browser right now for Kubernetes,
that shows what's going on

213
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.970
in your cluster. Only break
that down. Kubernetes is this

214
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.030
kind of neat way that
we can take multiple computers,

215
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.370
make them look like they're
one and run our software

216
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.120
on them. That's that's very
simple. And the problem is,

217
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.900
is that notice, I just
said multiple computers, imagine all

218
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.770
the problems you got many
desk and networks and this

219
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.910
and that Kubernetes ultimately will
make that simpler. But the

220
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.740
problem is, is because Kubernetes
contains so much complexity. It

221
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.250
exposes a lot of complexity
as well. So as a

222
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.130
developer who wants to ship
a software, some sip, some

223
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.220
software, like I got this
website and maybe this microservice

224
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.810
or something I'm having to
learn Kubernetes is, is tough.

225
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.490
So we created Okta to
make that easier. And this

226
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.620
is something that a lot
of people don't do. A

227
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.240
lot of people will be
like, well, I want this

228
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.360
dashboard that shows everything. Our
first premise was, well, we

229
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.500
have this application or group
of applications running in Kubernetes.

230
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.130
Can we figure out how
to tell users if something's

231
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.970
broken and then can we
show how everything is organized

232
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.300
together? And then from there,
when we solve that problem,

233
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.670
then we were able to
work backwards to figure out

234
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.440
the details that were missing
in the gaps. And that

235
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.830
is actually what made the
product so many times we

236
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.020
start off trying to make
a product and we're going

237
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.390
to like, it's going to
have this feature and this

238
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.480
feature and this feature. And
the problem with that is

239
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.820
that everyone has a friend
who talks too much when

240
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.790
tells horrible stories. You never
want to talk to that

241
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.160
friend. You want to talk
to that friend who tells

242
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.450
the really dope stories, but
they're always very simple. And

243
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.730
that's the same thing with
software. You got to start

244
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.770
off simple. You can really
only do one thing at

245
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:16.390
a time. And that's actually
how I actually live life.

246
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.340
Like you can, you can
only do one thing at

247
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.100
a time. Like I'm on
this podcast right now. I

248
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.640
can't be on Twitter or
I'm writing software. I can't

249
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.910
be looking at my outlook
or I'm looking at outlook.

250
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.370
Hi, the software or only
work on one software project

251
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.740
or even better yet when
I'm in there, I can

252
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.260
solve one problem at a
time. If I'm not solving,

253
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.020
I write it down and
that's it. And it's, it's

254
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.410
kinda mundane, but I can
repeat that forever and ever,

255
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:48.330
and ever, and then solve
bigger and bigger problems. Hey

256
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.320
folks, I'm taking this episode
to advertise for other podcasts.

257
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.800
If you enjoy stories about
the people behind the technology

258
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.140
that we use, you should
check out the greater than

259
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.040
code podcast. They focus on
the human side of software

260
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.210
development with stories of diversity
and inclusion, accessibility from people

261
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.360
that you don't normally hear
from search for greater than

262
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.350
code in your favorite podcast
app, or check out greater

263
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:18.780
than code.com. Do you think
that people who are getting

264
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:24.210
started in software are trying
to do the most tuition?

265
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.140
Well, the problem is, is
they see, well, I want

266
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.270
to create these websites. So
you need to learn react.

267
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.380
Well, first of all, react
is hard. First of all,

268
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.330
and this is, and this
is crazy. And I think

269
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.360
some of our boot camps
have this problem is that

270
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.240
it's like when you're teaching
a child, I can teach

271
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.370
a child a whole bunch
of big words. But if

272
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.580
they don't understand what that
big word is, they have

273
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.280
no context around the word.
They just know the word.

274
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.960
And I, a lot of
this happens with teachers, Web

275
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.070
development. We teach, we teach
React, and we teach JSX

276
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.820
or teach angular. And we
teach 'em observables from RX

277
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.960
JS or we teach view.
But what we really need

278
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.000
to do is go back
to thinking, well, what is

279
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.230
a web application? Well, it
runs in the Dom. All

280
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.960
right, well, how does the
Dom work Too high level?

281
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.990
You lost me there. Like,
do they even, like I

282
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.910
wrote on geo cities and
I didn't know about the

283
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.450
Dom until 10 years ago,
But what I'm trying to

284
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.950
do, what I'm trying to
say is that we need

285
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.410
to go backwards. We need
to get people. So what

286
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.010
I ask developers about RFCs
when we start, we'll talk

287
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.850
about RFCs and I'd always
ask about the HDP RFC.

288
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.190
And they're like, well, what's
that? I'm like, well, you're

289
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.380
a web developer, right? And
they're like, yeah. I said,

290
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.380
you don't understand how HTTP
works. We're like, yeah, we

291
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.540
have get posts. I'm like,
no, no, no. Do you

292
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.930
understand how it works? Like,
do you understand how the

293
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.930
protocol works? You might not
write it, but when you

294
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.840
understand the semantics of it,
it's like English. I know

295
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.910
a whole bunch of little
words and I can make

296
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.420
bigger sentences. Then I can
learn bigger words and make

297
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.350
it even more complex sentences.
And then I realized that,

298
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.680
Hey, maybe the little words
were better. Okay. Well, let

299
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.680
me ask you this though.
Sometimes, you know, I don't

300
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.180
want to be a gatekeeper.
I don't want to be

301
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.490
someone that says you don't
get to do this until

302
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.230
you do that. I don't
want to do that whole

303
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:18.010
like one true Scotsman kind
of like style of stuff.

304
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.530
But at the same time,
the older I get, the

305
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.600
more I get back to
fundamentals, I just did a

306
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.770
YouTube video. That that was
an experiment. And I think

307
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.440
it's going to become a
series where I spent basically

308
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.010
20 minutes talking about carers
return line feed, and people

309
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.810
really liked it. They thought
it was pretty cool. And

310
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.200
I wouldn't say it was
a requirement, but I think

311
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.030
that you are a better
driver when you can drive

312
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.820
a stick shift before you
start taking an Uber. But

313
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.710
other people are like, well,
not everybody wants to drive

314
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.300
a stick shift. Maybe I
just want to take an

315
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.630
Uber. So then am I
a gatekeeper to driving? Because

316
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.490
I think that people ought
to know how to change

317
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.100
a tire and you know,
change the oil once before

318
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.770
they take an Uber. So
I'm actually not even looking

319
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.800
at his cake keeping you
can. I'm just gonna S

320
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.380
I'm just telling you the
problems that I ran into

321
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.770
and how I think you
could learn it. Well, I

322
00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:10.330
appreciate that. I got it.
But yeah, At the end

323
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.890
of the day, whenever you're
still spinning your wheels and

324
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.710
you're not in, you're not
progressing, you then need to

325
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.590
ask yourself, am I smarter
than this problem that I

326
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:24.100
know nothing about? And all
I'm doing is throwing out

327
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.010
a little bit of guidance
because it literally costs me

328
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.700
nothing to tell you this.
Okay. And that's, and that's

329
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.070
how I look at it.
Do you, there's a thing

330
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.810
that I've been learning about.
I've been using this term

331
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.480
for many, many years where
I talk about being intentional

332
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.540
and intentionality, and I've talked
about it on John podcast

333
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.210
and I've taught classes on
it. And then I discovered

334
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.640
that all this time, what
I've been thinking about things

335
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.920
in terms of being intentional
is actually a thing that

336
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.540
someone else came up with
called deliberate practice. So are

337
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.500
you familiar with that? Am
I, well, I think I've

338
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.230
heard of this term where
yes, I have heard of

339
00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.140
this. Right? So deliberate practice
is like a thing. I

340
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.580
don't know where it came
from. I'll go and dig

341
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.970
into at some point, but
like step one of deliberate

342
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.970
practice is slow down. Like,
what you're describing is, is

343
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.130
deliberate practice, slow down. Step
one, step two. What's your

344
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.010
goal. Don't try to learn
a complex skill all at

345
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.530
once. Step three, chunk it
up, break it up into

346
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.170
pieces. And then the one
that I think that you

347
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.600
really hit on is this
idea of practice at the

348
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.810
edge of your abilities, but
don't aim too high and

349
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.300
don't aim too low. Like
you literally should design a

350
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.430
task to fit your level.
So that it's right on

351
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.470
the edge of your abilities.
And then you get better

352
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.690
by virtue of the fact
that you did the task.

353
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.200
And you're kind of implying
that people aren't slowing down,

354
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.200
they're not breaking up tasks.
And they're like, Hey, you

355
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.420
want to make a hello
world website first, we'll start

356
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.250
with Kubernetes. Yeah. But here's
the crazy thing. So you

357
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.600
went down to deliberate practice,
I'm going to counter with

358
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.620
everything good in your life
or bad in your life

359
00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:01.670
can be described through hip
hop or some song somewhere.

360
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.880
And what I would like
to apply for this one

361
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:11.570
is an outcast lyric where
it goes, listen to me

362
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:16.430
now, believe me later on.
And, and that's how I'm

363
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.520
going to leave it. It's,
it's more of the understand

364
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.860
that I'm just sharing this
guidance or telling you to

365
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.920
run and we'll figure it
out later. But whenever you

366
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.030
understand, or you can apply
my guidance to a problem,

367
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.480
then think about what I
said rather than just taking

368
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.810
what I, what I said
at as some kind of

369
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.000
good advice, because I'm just
telling you who am I,

370
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.060
I'm a random person on
the internet, but I don't

371
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.520
want to see you fail
unless you're bad. And then

372
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.840
I don't really care. So
recently trying to turn over

373
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.560
a new leaf, because I
realized this late, that on

374
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:59.510
social media, people don't understand
nuance. So on, on, on

375
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.690
social media now, I'm just
going to the things that

376
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.530
I'm saying are going to
be purposely full of positivity.

377
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.260
And, and here's the crazy
thing is that people, I

378
00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.670
didn't realize this, that people
like people like the back

379
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.380
and forth and the fighting.
I don't really like that.

380
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.550
Yeah. I never understood that
either. Yeah. But what I

381
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:27.770
do find is that people
love positive and people listen

382
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.970
and, and really all I'm
trying to do is inspire.

383
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.310
I'm trying to inspire others
to be the best versions

384
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.370
of themselves. And just to
let you know it was

385
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:45.620
Cujo. Cool. I looked it
up. Okay. Yes, yes. Appreciate

386
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.480
that formed in 91. I
remember. Cause I was in

387
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.750
high school. I'm sorry. Little
sidebar. This song got me

388
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:59.190
through a lot. It did
it actually. I still think

389
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.770
about it now. Just the
beat. It makes me feel

390
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.160
good. Whenever I hear that.
I'm sorry. People should check

391
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.290
it out. I'll put a
link to cell therapy in

392
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:11.610
the, yeah, you should. Yeah.
I want to set people

393
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.520
up for success. I want
someone to take these moments,

394
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.520
take these little bits of,
listen to me now and

395
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.790
take it out where they're
having a driveway moment. Like

396
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.710
the goal of this whole
podcast is to have a

397
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.230
driveway moment. You know what
I'm talking about, that you

398
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.390
listen into a podcast or
radio station. You shouldn't in

399
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.820
the driveway and you have
a moment where you can't

400
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.380
get out of the car
cause you need to absorb

401
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.710
it. Oh, okay. So you
want to drive away moment.

402
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.720
Let me see here. I
don't want you to artificially

403
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.640
create a driveway moment, but
I feel like this whole

404
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.760
talk is actually become that
driveway moment for me, because

405
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.980
I'm going to go and
listen to cell therapy. Again,

406
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.650
I'm going to go and
revisit the whole goodie mob

407
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.470
kind of like set, but
I'm also gonna think about

408
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.650
deliberate practice. And I'm going
to think about whether or

409
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.930
not I am chopping things
up in a way that

410
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.840
will set me up for
success. So Here, here's how

411
00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.210
I look at this. I
always want to put out

412
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.080
the best version of myself
wherever I go. And it's

413
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.100
not for me, really what
it is is I hope

414
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.980
that the best version of
my self could inspire someone

415
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.040
else to be the best
version of themselves. Maybe more

416
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.730
than one person. And then
they can go out and

417
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.410
inspire others. So I look
at myself as basically the

418
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:29.640
seed of positivity and self-awareness
and progression. And I want

419
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.520
the whole world to just
go out and try and

420
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.370
make it better than you
got it. And then what

421
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.030
I want people to do
is turn around, you know,

422
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.360
look, look at yourself, go
find someone who doesn't look

423
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.760
like you and go help
them because that's actually a

424
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.980
big piece of what we're
missing out here as well.

425
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.370
It's where we have, where
I see all these black

426
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.770
women who are just like,
I can't move forward in

427
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.670
tech. And I know it's
not ability. Like sometimes it

428
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.610
might be ability because guess
what? We have to start

429
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.870
from somewhere, but had it
not been from this random

430
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.640
dude in Fort Wayne, Indiana
in 1994, giving me a

431
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.800
chance on a job, even
though I could actually write

432
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.250
code at that time, just
taking a chance on me

433
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.960
and had it not been
this random, huge actually web

434
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.050
hosting company in Maryland, given
this 20 year old a

435
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.800
chance I wouldn't be here
right now. So it was

436
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.190
these random chances that, that
actually got me to where

437
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.710
I am right now. And
I want everyone to do

438
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.160
that because guess best believe
there's so much good out

439
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.290
here. And there's so much
money out here and there's,

440
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.580
and that can lead to
you, giving people chances so

441
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.120
they can live lives like
they want to. And that's

442
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.510
what I'm want. That's all
I want in tech. I

443
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.260
did a Hashtag a couple
of months ago where I

444
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.630
was doing random, nice stuff.
And I call it be

445
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.630
the luck. And I think
about like the, the, you

446
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.840
know, the warm introduction when
somebody just like hooks you

447
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.400
up with like, Oh, I
know. So. And so you

448
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.380
should talk to them and
they do it in such

449
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.680
a way that they don't
actually keep score. Right. It's

450
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.990
one thing for me to
say, Oh, Hey, you know,

451
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.000
Anna, you should talk to
Brian <inaudible> and then I'm

452
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.920
like, Oh, Hey Ryan, remember
that time that I had,

453
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.490
you talked to Anna, I'm
keeping track rather the idea

454
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.080
of like, I'm just going
to introduce as many people

455
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.730
as I can to as
many people as I know,

456
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.830
so that they might be
the luck for somebody because

457
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.870
all those things that you
just described that made your

458
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.730
career possible. And like those
sliding door moments where you

459
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.520
could have gone either way.
Like I remember those two,

460
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.100
like I know the teachers,
I know the managers, I

461
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.170
know the jobs, I know
the moments where I bumped

462
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.790
into somebody and I was
ready for it. And it

463
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.730
happened. And if any, one
of those didn't happen, who

464
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.550
knows I could be Ryan Reynolds.
So let me tell you

465
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.300
about one of those right
now. So two years ago

466
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.630
I was working at a
bank and I decided I

467
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.620
didn't want to work with
her anymore. So I talked

468
00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.070
to this dude named Scott,
and he's like, well, let

469
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.550
me introduce you to such
and such. And I got

470
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.480
an interview. Things didn't work
out, you know, that's, that's

471
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.790
cool. But then I, and
in my thinking about why

472
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.540
that didn't work out, I
realized that it wasn't me,

473
00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.510
you know, it was a
physician. So what I did

474
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.340
is I went and applied
for another job where I

475
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:25.240
never would have applied for
that company was Heptio with

476
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.560
the founders of Kubernetes. And
I interviewed so well there,

477
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.940
they were like, here, just
go do what you're going

478
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.570
to go do a year
later. So a year ago,

479
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:39.280
VMware bought that company for,
I don't know, some stupid

480
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.180
amount of money made those
people richer than, you know,

481
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.000
they need to be. But,
you know, I got a

482
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.910
little bit off that. And
what I've been doing is

483
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.310
realizing that before that I
could pay for myself, I

484
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.760
could afford myself. I already
own a house. So now

485
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.470
what I do is I
take that little bit of

486
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.680
excess that I have, and
I want to, I want

487
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.200
to give away so many
things that I forget what

488
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.160
I'm giving things. So a
couple months ago I gave

489
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.930
away a whole bunch of
facility scopes. And hopefully those,

490
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.200
those college kids got good
use out of them. And

491
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.330
I'm always just looking for
little things like that. Like

492
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.050
I did some laptops in
Africa just cause it makes

493
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.250
me happy, but here's the
thing. I hope that whatever

494
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.770
I'm doing to people inspires
them to go do something

495
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.430
else. And then realizing that
it could be random moments.

496
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.560
Like when I talked to
that dude, Scott, his name

497
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.960
was Scott Hanselman, by the
way, that those little moments

498
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.210
where he was trying to
do something nice, put me

499
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.980
in a position where I
could do something nice for

500
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.390
other people. And I just
want everyone to see that

501
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.280
it doesn't work like that
all the time, but it

502
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.360
can work like that frequently
if, if we're actually just

503
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.570
given the best of ourselves.
So you're sitting in your

504
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.140
driveway now thinking like, man,
is this dude deep? Is

505
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.540
he? Why does he think
like this? Well, I'll tell

506
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.170
you why, because I've seen
the other side. I, like

507
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.780
I said before, at the
beginning of this, I grew

508
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.290
up in a blue collar
family and my brothers don't

509
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:14.490
do this. They've seen, you
know, from, you know, people,

510
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.110
I know seeing drug addiction,
violence in jail and that

511
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.930
alternative, isn't good. I'm not
compatible. I'm a little soft.

512
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.040
I can't, I can't do
that. So this is me

513
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.130
thinking the world for giving
me a chance to do

514
00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.800
things where I can actually
put good on the world.

515
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.130
So hopefully it inspires other
people to go put good

516
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.430
on the world because if
we didn't, you know, we

517
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.590
would just stagnate and the
rich would be rich and

518
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.600
everyone else will be not.
And it doesn't have to

519
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.010
be that way. That's cool.
Yeah. I mean, I was

520
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.200
a tiny footnote in that
because that's all just about

521
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.170
how, like I talk about
sliding doors, right? If, if

522
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.120
this hadn't happened, what did
that happen? And that happened

523
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.300
and that happened and how
you, but you paying attention

524
00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.660
was the, was the, the
steel thread throughout that whole

525
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.380
thing. Like you noticing those
moments and acting on them.

526
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.570
Right. Well, so that's all,
so to be my, my

527
00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.070
final tidbit of advice, and
this is the advice that

528
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.160
I give to all black
males that I meet. And

529
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.830
the only reason I say
that is because I understand

530
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.930
your struggle because you know,
I am one of you,

531
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.880
first of all, ignore the
vice where you say, you

532
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.950
have to be the dumbest
person in the room that

533
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.620
works when you have privilege
and you have a safety

534
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.600
net when you don't have
a safety net, be the

535
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.630
smartest person in the room.
But don't tell nobody that's

536
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:37.520
number one, two opportunity is
rare. So when it comes,

537
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.670
be ready and when it,
and whenever I say, be

538
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.920
ready, you need to be
able to hop on any

539
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.280
opportunity. That's gonna move you
forward. So you gotta have

540
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.560
a bag of tricks. So
like whenever I was telling

541
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.110
you about you helping me
out and that interview didn't

542
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.450
work out, right. I was
ready. I mean, that was,

543
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.090
I was, I was fresh.
I was, I was excited.

544
00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.320
And number three, I tweeted
about this this morning, or

545
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.020
maybe, yeah, it was this
morning. Failure's a thing. Get

546
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.840
used to it. Don't get
comfortable with it, but get

547
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.940
used to it. It's going
to happen. It's going to

548
00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.210
happen all the time. Understand
that's part of life. Don't

549
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:15.440
let failure drive you away,
but also understand that like

550
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.620
an abusive relationship at some
time you have to go.

551
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.040
So understand that as well.
And that's how I actually

552
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.960
get through life. Those three
things right there. And that's

553
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.540
what I tell people. If
you can do these kinds

554
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.650
of things, you know, be
good, be ready, but no

555
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:34.400
one leave. You can actually
get ahead in the world.

556
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.640
Very cool. Thank you. That's
those are the formula for

557
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.760
becoming a complete developer as
told by Brian Lyles. Thank

558
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.130
you for hanging out with
me today, sir. I thank

559
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.840
you for inviting me. And
just to let you all

560
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.360
know, Scott's been trying to
get me on this podcast

561
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.560
for like two years. And
finally it finally, like, you

562
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.470
know, I was ready and
I was hungry, but I

563
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.210
don't know I was ready
to walk away and then

564
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:04.150
TMT, you were like, okay,
let's do it. Yeah. You

565
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.570
caught me at exactly the
right time. Stop. Don't be

566
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.640
hungry. And you too can
have Brian on your show.

567
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.960
Right? All right. This has
been another episode of Hansel

568
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.730
minutes. See you again next
week.
