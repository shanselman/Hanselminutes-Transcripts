<inaudible> From hand full minutes.com
it's Hansel minutes or weekly

9
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.330
discussion with web developer and
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is

10
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.250
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number four
79. In this episode, Scott

11
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.820
talks with John old bacon
about building community around the

12
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.390
X prize. <inaudible>. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

13
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.180
another episode of Hansel minutes.
And today we're talking with

14
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.090
John O bacon who used
to work as a community

15
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.850
manager for Boone too. And
you've got a new gig

16
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.790
now I do in date.
Yep. I moved over to

17
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.220
a place called the X
prize foundation, which is based

18
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.290
out of LA the X,
when I think X prize.

19
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.290
I think there's a prize
for helping people either, you

20
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.710
know, get to space or
fly a solar powered something

21
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.560
around the world. I mean,
it's really hard technical problems

22
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.140
and no, I feel like
no one ever got around

23
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.750
to solving them. So let's
put a prize for $10 million

24
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.510
and see if anyone will
do it. Right. Right, right.

25
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.420
It's it's, it's interesting. You
know, when I, when I

26
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.870
left canonical that night, I
was in a position. This

27
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.000
is probably gonna sound a
little egotistical. It's not meant

28
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.970
to, but I was in
a relatively public position, economical

29
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.280
in representing the community. And
when I went to X

30
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.860
prize, a bunch of people
said, you know, what's that?

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.970
And, and I talk about
the very first X prize,

32
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.950
which was the Ansari X
prize, which was the space

33
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.310
one. And everybody remembers it
is that, that big space

34
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.270
competition from years ago. And
it started out that way.

35
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.250
As you know, Peter diamond
is the founder of X

36
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.180
prize, basically organize that as
the first X prize competition.

37
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.890
And it was never really
intended to go beyond that,

38
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.650
but it was so successful
that he thought maybe we

39
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.660
can do this in other
areas as well. And how

40
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.490
does someone, I mean, do
you have, did, was he

41
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.470
like a bajillionaire and he
just sat around like, you

42
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.840
know, no, one's doing this
thing. No, one's getting us

43
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.660
to the moon again, let's
put a prize for $10 million

44
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.880
to make that happen. Like,
how does that conversation start?

45
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.860
I mean, he was basically,
and I'm I'm, I wasn't

46
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.390
there, so it's kind of
dark. And then this guy

47
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.660
kind of hanging out, trying
to solve problems. Well, he,

48
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.600
you know, he was a
space dog and he, you

49
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.150
know, he's, he's incredibly accomplished
academically studied at MIT and

50
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.150
he'd read a book about
the spirit of st. Louis

51
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.290
and thought that that was
an incentive competition that resulted

52
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.660
in commercial flight and he
thought we could do the

53
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.820
same thing for space. And
the thing about Peter is

54
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.840
that he is one of
the most affable human beings.

55
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.730
I think I've ever met.
Like he, he's got a

56
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.760
great way of connecting with
people and he basically pulled

57
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.010
together a stage in the
Mojave desert and announced this

58
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.020
competition and had the ability
to, to reach out, to,

59
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.880
to media and all the
rest of it to get

60
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.640
the level of awareness that
it, that it struck. And

61
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.550
he's basically continued that forward.
I mean, you know, he

62
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.940
he's, he's essentially an entrepreneur
he's, he's, he's, you know,

63
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.040
the founder of X prize,
but he also founded a

64
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.230
bunch of other companies like
human longevity and, and, and

65
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.220
planetary resources, which is mining
asteroids. So he's kind of

66
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.170
crazy in all the right
ways, I think is the

67
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.680
best way of describing it.
Where does this, where do

68
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.690
these, the, the, the, the,
what is the pot come

69
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.640
from? Where does the money
come from? When, when, when

70
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.810
a prizes is There's two
components, really, I mean, you've

71
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.940
got the price purse, which
everyone hears about. So, you

72
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.420
know, the, the $15 million global
learning X prize, but then

73
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.580
there's the money that goes
into the development of the

74
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.120
prize itself. One of the
things that I didn't realize

75
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.340
until I joined X prize
was just how much work

76
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.770
goes into one of these
X prizes, because they are,

77
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.440
you know, Google talks a
lot about moonshots and they

78
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.540
are by definition, moonshot competitions,
they're designed to solve market

79
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.020
failures where the market is
not providing a solution for

80
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.050
a major issue in the
world. And so the, the

81
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.040
money for, you know, for
the prize itself for the,

82
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.110
for the development, the price
comes from lots of different

83
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.310
sources, it's foundations and wealthy
benefactors and people like that.

84
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.700
And then the actual price
purse is usually from either

85
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.090
individuals or companies. So for
example, Elon Musk put up

86
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.190
a big chunk of money
for the, for the global

87
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.520
learning X prize competition, as
well as a bunch of

88
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.870
other sponsors as well. It's
almost a branding exercise in

89
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.170
the sense of there were
ways to get money and

90
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.740
to motivate people with grants
and things like that. And

91
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.480
also just general academic accomplishment.
But if you get organized

92
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.140
and put a lot of
thought and branding and excitement

93
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.460
behind it, somehow people get
off their butts. Yeah. I

94
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.890
mean, it, it really, it's,
it's, it's a really interesting

95
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.530
model because, you know, I
came from the, from the,

96
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.510
from the opensource where I've
spent my career working in

97
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.120
open source, which is inherently
collaborative. So going to a

98
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.290
world that is more competitive
was, was interesting. And one

99
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.140
of the things that's interesting
about the incentive model is

100
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.200
that, is that you have
to have a price purse

101
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.980
that's sufficiently large enough that
it justifies R and D

102
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.290
in that area. So for
example, with the global learning

103
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.890
X prize, there's 250 million kids
in the world who can't

104
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.520
read, and that has a
tremendous economic impact on those

105
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.680
countries. It has a huge
impact on those kids and

106
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.650
families. And it's a market
failure. That company has not

107
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.600
solved that problem, but that's
a really ambitious piece of

108
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.710
software to build. It could
incorporate machine learning and artificial

109
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.590
intelligence and all different pieces.
So you have to have

110
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.780
a price plus it's big
enough that can result in

111
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.290
that level of R and
D to initiate. So it's

112
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.050
not just that people are
wooed by the, the prize

113
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.770
purse it's that it essentially
justifies the formation of R

114
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.780
and D and new markets,
which I never really particularly

115
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.620
realized until I, until I
joined exerprise X prize. And

116
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.260
in many cases, people actually
invest more money than the

117
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.320
prize purse in winning the
competition with the first X

118
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.200
prize. I think if I
remember correctly, I think like

119
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.170
$50 million was invested by one
of the teams in a

120
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.450
$10 million competition. So there's an,
it's an interesting model Learning

121
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.390
one that was launched in
September of 2014, that's the

122
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.490
$15 million prize. Do you create
free apps to do reading,

123
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.460
writing, arithmetic? The result of
that though is for this

124
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.130
was for open source teams.
Like it's not always for

125
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.980
a company there's, there's a,
the resulting software could be

126
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.670
open source. Yeah. So this
was the first, this was

127
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.480
the first open source X
prize, which was, you know,

128
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.270
fortuitous for me coming into
X prize era just before

129
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.510
that prize launched. And the
idea there is that teams

130
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.330
can build their technology privately
if they want, but then

131
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.170
the prize that they're the
winning five team or the

132
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.440
top five finalists have to
open source that technology. And

133
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.180
one of the things I
liked about that was that

134
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.480
it means that it's not
just that your you're creating

135
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.000
a solution for this issue
of illiteracy around the world,

136
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.370
but that because it's open
source at the end of

137
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.780
it, that's that builds technology
that essentially becomes a foundational

138
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.170
code base in society. It
can be fought. People can

139
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.600
utilize it in different ways.
And it also opens up

140
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.120
interesting ideas around where the
teams can collaborate over common

141
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.070
pieces, which is some of
the, one of the things

142
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.830
that I've been experimenting and
which, you know, I'm not

143
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.860
aware of people doing beforehand.
So it's, it's been very

144
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.860
experimental at a technology layer
for the expert When somebody

145
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.770
jumps into it, are they
already in the space? Like

146
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.600
I'm looking at the global
learning one and I'm thinking,

147
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.450
Oh, well, the Khan Academy
should get involved in that.

148
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.850
And that would be a
great way for them to,

149
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.980
you know, they're already doing
open source, they're already doing

150
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.070
education. They're already got great
design. Like that's a slam

151
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.050
dunk for them. It's, It's
a real mix. I mean,

152
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.230
there are, you know, there
are teams, I think of

153
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.920
something like 198 teams, something
like that, registered for the

154
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.820
global learning X prize. And
it's a mixture of academics

155
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.440
companies, individuals, it's a really
broad mix of, of, of

156
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.470
people who, who are taking
part. And that's one of

157
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.260
the things I quite like
about it is that there's,

158
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.320
you know, there was a
there's I think it was

159
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.960
the Qualcomm tricorder X prize,
which is to build a

160
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.290
device that can diagnose a
range of issues better than

161
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.380
a board of certified physicians.
One of the participants in

162
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.690
that I believe was Jack
and Draker who was this

163
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:55.090
kid who developed a, a
test for pancreatic cancer when

164
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.900
was like 15. And it's
one of those things where

165
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.800
I think it unlocks smart
people in doing interesting things.

166
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.760
And it's again, similar principle
to open sources that anybody's

167
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.560
got the opportunity to rise
to success. Do these prizes

168
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.080
just hang out there until
they are solved? Are they

169
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.960
like those difficult math problems
that we hear about a

170
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.090
century later? And they say,
yeah, someone was working in

171
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.300
their basement and salty scan
practice, like, is the tricorder

172
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.230
expertise, did that get solved?
It's a, there's a timeline.

173
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.770
These prizes are usually three
to five years. They're quite

174
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.060
long because they're pretty ambitious.
I mean, an X prize

175
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.190
has to be an ambitious
price. It can't be something

176
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.680
that could be one in
a couple of months, but

177
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.780
there is a defined timeline
and there is a defined

178
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.710
criteria around winning the prize.
So if you don't achieve

179
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.250
it, you don't win the
prize. And, you know, it's

180
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.100
usually broken into different phases.
So there's a development phase.

181
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.820
There's a field testing phase.
There's a, the, there's an,

182
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.450
a phase where, where, you
know, you narrow down to

183
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.560
a set of finalists. So
yeah, it varies obviously between

184
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.570
the different prizes, but yeah,
there's a timeline for it.

185
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.260
Okay. Right. Cause the Qualcomm
tricorder one and tri-quarter of

186
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.540
course, was the medical device
that they use on star

187
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.090
Trek. So that's just kind
of a generic word. Now.

188
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.290
It was, I think it
was, was it a $10 million

189
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.210
prize? And it's broken up
into a kind of grand

190
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.780
prize, second prize, third prize.
And, and then there's a

191
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.530
timeline of course, that people
can continue onto the next

192
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.330
step. Right. Thanks. Exactly. And
I believe that we've got

193
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.760
the finalists for the Qualcomm,
for the F for the

194
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.420
Qualcomm tricorder X price. We're
getting into the final stages

195
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.210
of that, of that competition
right now. And it's, it's

196
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.790
really interesting seeing what they
can, What is the relationship

197
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.100
between the prize and then
the company whose name goes

198
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.160
in front? Like there's the
Nokia sensing challenge, which is

199
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.490
a sensor problem. There's the,
you know, the Google lunar

200
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.100
one, is that just the
primary backer of that price?

201
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.870
Yeah. So that's the, you
know, that's the, that the

202
00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.140
primary sponsor of the, of
the price purse. And then,

203
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.330
like I said earlier on,
within each prize, you'll have

204
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.910
a series of other sponsors
that invariably do the price

205
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.650
development work, but also that,
you know, the relationship will

206
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.900
vary in different ways with
the different sponsors. So sponsors

207
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.060
may be able to have
give you access to technology

208
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.060
or access to, you know,
smart people or in testing

209
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.180
infrastructure and things like that.
So at its most basic

210
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.450
level, it's they provide the
money, but then there's some

211
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.680
times additional benefits on top
of that as well. Now,

212
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.830
one of them that was
the second prize, the, the

213
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:40.130
art, our con genomics prize
ended up getting canceled. Was

214
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.300
that just because technology went
so fast that they, they,

215
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.820
it became a solved problem
before the prize ended. Yeah.

216
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.630
Precisely. That is that essentially
the talented, you just caught

217
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:55.300
up quicker than the price,
which I think, again, you

218
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.860
know, I wasn't there at
that point in the X

219
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.470
prize history, but from talking
to my colleagues, that was

220
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.490
a necessary thing to happen
is that, is that you

221
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.890
want an X prize to
be so ambitious that it's,

222
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.330
that, that, that can't happen.
That technology cannot catch up

223
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.550
quicker, but also you don't
want it to be too

224
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.610
ambitious where it can't be
done. So for example, the

225
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.790
Google lunar X prize, which
is to build a, a

226
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.540
Rover that will, will, will,
that will run on the

227
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.780
moon and send back HD
video back to earth. That's

228
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.130
a remarkably ambitious X prize.
And that's taken has been

229
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.450
extended a few times because
it's so ambitious. So I

230
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.390
think that's right in pretty
close to, to what can

231
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.880
and can't be done. So,
so X prize has to

232
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.880
get a pretty delicate balance
and making sure that it's,

233
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.750
you know, it's crazy, but
not, not too crazy. The

234
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.460
thing is though, it's funny.
I just, maybe this is

235
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.920
just a linguistics thing, but
the idea that you can

236
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.020
say something in a sentence
and go, yeah, I can

237
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.560
see that happening, but like,
you know, the, the, the

238
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.230
lunar one, for example, right.
Just I'm reading here, the

239
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.170
prize awards, $20 million for the
first team to land a

240
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.170
Rover on the move on
the moon and then successfully

241
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.770
move at 500 meters and
transmit back high definition. Right.

242
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.350
So I'm thinking, okay, high
definition, cool. Yeah. Move at

243
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.510
500 meters. You got that,
you know, it's just the

244
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.930
little detail of getting it
to the moon. Right. But

245
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.210
other than that small detail,
this is off the shelf

246
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.100
parts. Right. My kid could
do this in a week.

247
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.990
Easy, easy. Yeah. It's there,
what's been interesting about the

248
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.860
Google lunar one is that
there is a, there's at

249
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.840
least in the United States, there
is fairly significant regulation around

250
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.590
building space technology. And I
believe it's called ITA, which

251
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.230
basically says that if you
build a spacecraft, that's bigger

252
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.610
than a certain size, it's
considered a weapon. Oh, I

253
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.470
guess because it could go
really fast and crash into

254
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.890
stuff. Right. So it's, it's
one of those things whereby

255
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.320
it, I'm presuming that it
limits what teams can and

256
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.860
can't do fairly significantly. And
obviously you then need to

257
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.110
deal with launch partners and
all kinds of stuff. So

258
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.100
it's not like that competition
exists in a vacuum as

259
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.280
the, you know, the space
X and other organizations are

260
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.250
building technology to launch to
the moon cheaper and more

261
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.820
efficiently. So while this prize
has been development, other pieces

262
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.860
that are variables that are
working alongside it as well.

263
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.860
Right. And that the, the
lunar one, you know, easy

264
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.430
to say, but hard to
do that was delayed from

265
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.350
the end of this year
to the end of next

266
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.970
year. Right. Right. Exactly. Pretty
soon someone needs to say

267
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.920
that they're going to schedule
a launch. Otherwise you're going

268
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.820
to have to, Yeah. I
believe that we're in the

269
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.460
final stages of getting to
that now into it, to

270
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.310
the launch. So yeah, it's
been a, it's been a

271
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.380
tough one to run, but
I think it's starting to

272
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.140
reap some rewards. It seems
like Something that a Elon

273
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.410
Musk would be doing to
get a little on the

274
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.910
moon. It doesn't have to
be giant. Like, why not?

275
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.830
Why couldn't it be, you
know, the size of a

276
00:14:54.830 --> 00:15:00.050
laptop. Right. And I believe
that the actual, the rovers

277
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.680
are pretty small and it's,
it's, you know, they've, they've

278
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.250
been testing in, in Moonlight
conditions on earth as well.

279
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.990
I mean, I believe there's
been some testing out in

280
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.560
Hawaii and places like that.
So, you know, it's obviously

281
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.390
it's not, it's not space
is not something you can

282
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.520
iterate on very quickly, you
know, in software you can

283
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.310
use automated tests and you
can, you can, you can

284
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.940
iterate really fast to, to
improve things, but you get

285
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:29.780
basically one shot at it
with space. I want to

286
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.810
take a brief moment to
thank my sponsors sync fusion

287
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.830
this week, the first and
only complete Hadoop distribution designed

288
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.280
for windows is now available
from sync fusion. You can

289
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.700
literally deploy a production ready,
big data cluster in minutes.

290
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.880
This revolutionary big data platform
will not only change the

291
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.640
way that you approach big
data, but it is 100%

292
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.960
free for everyone with free
commercial support for sync fusion,

293
00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:02.840
plus members learn more at
sync, fusion.com/big data. These things

294
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.260
being rebooted remotely, like bill
Nye, his team has got

295
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.720
a sensor system out there
that just got rebooted remotely.

296
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.870
And I'm just thinking about
how unreliable my PC is

297
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.960
the fact that they were
able to take, you know,

298
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.830
take a light, sail and
reboot the thing. Yeah. Yeah.

299
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.280
It's pretty scary stuff. Yeah.
Yeah. It wastes interesting. I

300
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.820
was reading about, you know,
I think it was, I

301
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.470
think it was a trip
to MAs. I think it

302
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.720
was the, you know, is
that the technology that they

303
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.230
set up there was of
course developed years ago. So

304
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.310
you've got material constraints, you've
got processing constraints. And then

305
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.290
of course you just got
that massive distance in terms

306
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.080
of radio transmission. So this
is one of the reasons

307
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.000
why I could never be
a space person. Cause it's

308
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.730
too complicated. Yeah. Have you
read the, have you read

309
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.630
the Martian? No, I'm recommending
this to everyone. I recommend

310
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.920
it to everyone who's listening
and I recommend it to

311
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.310
you. It is a, what
they call a hard science

312
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.250
fiction where it's, you know,
it's a science fiction book

313
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.640
about a fellow who's on
Mars with his team and

314
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.220
something happens and he gets
left behind. So then he

315
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.230
has to figure out how
to survive for 18 months.

316
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.460
And it's written by a
huge nerd who wants to

317
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.700
make sure all the science
works. So it's hard science

318
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.030
fiction indicating that it's not
just made up like totally

319
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.420
wacky lasers and forced fields.
Everything that he tries has

320
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.750
to be something that is
scientifically feasible and dumb and

321
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.540
interesting. And it's going to
be a movie with Matt

322
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.710
Damon at the really seriously
it'll change your life. This

323
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.830
book is amazing. The audio
book is brilliant, but I

324
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.870
will. I've even told people
that if they buy it

325
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.850
and they hate it, that
I'll pay for it. That's

326
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.690
how good it is. That
is a pretty strong, pretty

327
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.300
strong advocacy of this book.
I don't know if you've

328
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.160
ever seen like a show
or a movie so good

329
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.830
that you just want to
find a friend and then

330
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.740
watch them watch the movie
so that you can have

331
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.960
the experience of watching them
watch the movie. I would

332
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.090
like to sit over your
shoulder and watch you read

333
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.000
the Martian so I could
see your face at different

334
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.430
points and go, I know
That's both endearing and creepy

335
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:13.730
at the same time. So
shifting gears the first time

336
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.670
that I think I ended
up talking to you was

337
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.290
around 2009. When your book,
the art of community came

338
00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.170
out, and this is kind
of the canonical book on

339
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:29.270
creating communities, both offline and
online and, you know, leadership

340
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.060
in that context. So, and
then you did that, you

341
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.170
know, working with the Ubuntu
project and building community there,

342
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.650
how does that relate to
working on next prize? Is

343
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.210
there, is there a community
now? I think of X

344
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.850
prize as being a bunch
of rich people and scientists.

345
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.770
How does that affect me?
It's a great question. One

346
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.220
of the, so, you know,
I was at canonical for,

347
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.690
for eight years and I'd
written the book and I,

348
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.590
I, I, I'd been basically
born in the brain of

349
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.190
open source community and I
felt like a while. Never,

350
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.020
no one's ever an expert.
I felt like I knew

351
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.610
it pretty well. I knew
I wanted to do something

352
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.460
completely different to, to get
me out of my comfort

353
00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.830
zone, but I wanted it
to have a more meaningful

354
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.300
impact. I didn't want to
just go to a company

355
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.930
that makes more widgets. And
I got introduced to Peter

356
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.060
diamond as the founder of
X prize. And I basically

357
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.500
said to him, you know,
I think X prize is

358
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.690
neat, but only so many
people are going to be

359
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.400
able to take part in
these competitions. You know, the

360
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.550
three or five years, they
the require significant R and

361
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.490
D and investment and whatever
else I'm like, who's going

362
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.590
to, not, everybody can quit
their job to work on

363
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.980
an X prize. And I
said, in my mind, it,

364
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.920
what you need is a
global community that has the

365
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.380
shared mission and ethos of
making the world a better

366
00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.220
place and applying best skills
and that perspectives to solving

367
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.920
smaller problems all over the
place. And he basically said,

368
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.630
that sounds like a great
idea, come and build it.

369
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.650
So I joined X prize,
frankly, really not knowing what

370
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.970
kind of community was going
to look like. And the

371
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.960
last year has been a
really interesting learning experience in,

372
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.260
in identifying what elements of
the community collaborative model work

373
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.980
and apply in different areas.
So my goal at X

374
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.500
prize has been to build
a community of people who

375
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.990
are a passionate about the
work that X prize does.

376
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.120
That's what I would call
a read communities, people who

377
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.630
won't collaborate or build anything,
but they're their fans and

378
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.150
they want to engage in
discussion. But then I also

379
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.090
wanted to build a collaborative
community. That's working together on

380
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.050
practical problems outside of X
prizes that can, that can

381
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.420
make the world a better
place that can solve our

382
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.970
grand challenges and kind of
conducting that work. I've learned

383
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.220
more about community management in
the last year than I'd

384
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:48.250
done in my entire career.
It's been, it's been, it's

385
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.500
been, it's been fascinating because
one of the things I've

386
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:57.010
learned is that is that
innovation. And so innovation comes

387
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.250
in different forms and in
the open source world and

388
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.560
in the technology world, innovation
starts with a hack. It

389
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.950
starts with someone building something
like you, you make something,

390
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.350
you shove it up and
get hub. Somebody also finds

391
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.180
it interesting. And so long
as you've got the tools

392
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.590
and the knowledge to contribute,
then that hat can evolve

393
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.660
and it can be buffed
and something that's more refined.

394
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.980
And then you have a
release and then it becomes

395
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.460
a project. And that happens
in companies that happens in

396
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.400
open source communities and elsewhere
is that it starts and

397
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.880
ends with material that you
that's, what you collaborate around.

398
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.990
What's interesting about X prize
is that innovation is a

399
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.510
statement. It's, you know, we
want people to solve this

400
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.540
problem. It's, it's a moonshot
thing. So it's innovation in

401
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.330
a way, but it's problem
solving in another way. And

402
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.180
a lot of the people
who joined the X prize

403
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.030
community are not the kind
of people that are in

404
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.490
the opensource community that are
in the technology world. They

405
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:53.110
are entrepreneurs or they're scientists.
So connecting those people to

406
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.720
a community when they're not
necessarily starting out with a

407
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.270
hack, has been, the challenge
is, you know, how do

408
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.260
I bring a, a neuroscientist
into the X prize community

409
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.050
to play an impact in
what we're doing? I'll play

410
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.380
a role in what we're
doing in a way that

411
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.390
we do the same kind
of thing with a software

412
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.450
engineer, with a software engineer,
the material code, what's the,

413
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.630
what's the equivalent code for
a neuroscientist. And there's, so

414
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.210
there's been all kinds of
like interesting learnings. I it's

415
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.320
been exacerbating at times because
I've realized that long-held perspectives

416
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.160
that I've had have been
frankly untrue. And then it's

417
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.380
also opened up all kinds
of new ideas and thinking

418
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.310
about what a community should
look like. So it's, it's,

419
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.070
it's, there's going to be
a book that sometimes it's

420
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.150
just going to ask you,
it sounds like you have

421
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:41.140
another book in you. Yeah,
I definitely. And I, and

422
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.050
it's one of the, I
think one of the key

423
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.540
lessons that I've learned is
that I used to be

424
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.170
broadly of the viewpoint that
so long as you can

425
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.560
get people United around the
mission, any community can be

426
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.040
built anywhere. So if you
can get people excited about,

427
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.510
about a book club or
about a band or about,

428
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.540
you know, making the software
or whatever it might be

429
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.450
that a community is possible
anywhere. And I think that

430
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.110
read communities are possible anywhere
communities where people are sharing

431
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.770
an experience and sharing a
perspective and sharing consumption is

432
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.660
possible anywhere book collaborative, right.
Communities, I don't think are

433
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.530
as, as, as, as tractable
in as many places is

434
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.230
that it, you have to
look at, you know, what

435
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.050
that core material is, what
that hack is, what the

436
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.180
tools are, what the knowledge
is and the kind of

437
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.670
personality that people have got.
You know, I was, I

438
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.730
was I've written and I've,
I've written an article about

439
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.220
open organizations. That's going to
be going up on a,

440
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.950
on a website soon. And
I interviewed Jim Whitehurst is

441
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.590
the CEO of a red
hat. And he recently wrote

442
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.380
a, wrote a book about
open organizations. He came from

443
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.770
Delta airlines to red hat.
And one of the points

444
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:56.030
that he made was he
really only understood the open

445
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.840
source approach and the collaborative
approach effectively because he came

446
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.630
out of that world into
that world. And I feel

447
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.030
like going from that open
source world into a completely

448
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.250
different world has helped me
to understand that as well

449
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.330
and how unique the technology
mindset is. Like, I think

450
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.160
we take for granted when
we're, we, you know, you

451
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.170
and I've both been working
in technology for a long

452
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:20.260
time. I think we take
for granted the, the, the,

453
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:24.230
the personality traits that are
present in technology people and

454
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.440
how pragmatic and are practical.
They are that aren't necessarily

455
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.910
present Now, not trying to
be too functional, but when

456
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.840
I think of community, I
have trouble separating it from

457
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.290
the concept of collaboration. And
that inevitably leads me towards

458
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.220
tools. And when I think
about collaborating and open source,

459
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.790
I always feel like an
advancement in tooling comes up

460
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.720
and then collaboration increases. So
the advent of kids, you

461
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.150
know, I mean, IRC for
a while was like, where

462
00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.870
it all happened, you know,
then get comes along and

463
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.150
then get, you know, get
hub issues, you know? Yeah.

464
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.880
Well, while some communities are
in the GitHub issues, kind

465
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.300
of Slack level of collaboration,
other various successful communities, if

466
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.010
it seems like the only
thing that they do is

467
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.370
send email and they have
a mailing list and it's

468
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:14.560
extremely low fidelity with ridiculous
quoting rules. And it's like

469
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.190
a whole other language. Where
does the X prize community

470
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.990
collaborate? Where does this collaboration
and community occur? Well, this

471
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.330
was one of the first
interesting questions was, you know,

472
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.450
when I joined the X
prize foundation, the first thing

473
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.880
I did was just to
learn about who's involved right

474
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.350
now. And, you know, when
I was at canonical, the,

475
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:38.340
the general demographic of people
was technology people. It's, it's

476
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.020
people who are interested in
it is people who are

477
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.950
interested in the boon too.
And even people outside of

478
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.550
like software developers, you know,
BizDev people, for example, with

479
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.780
technology, business, people in the
X prize community. When I

480
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.900
joined in the X prize
community at the time, you

481
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.720
know, it was a real
interesting mix of business people,

482
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:05.140
conference organizers, entrepreneurs, scientists, VCs,
or massive mix of people.

483
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.660
And I wanted to identify,
okay, I don't want to

484
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.300
build like a ton of
small communities. I want to

485
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.270
bring these people together in
a way that's unified for

486
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.430
all of them as best
I can. So the first

487
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.260
thing I put in place
was the forum of forum

488
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.560
that X prize dog, cause
that's a relatively straightforward way

489
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.620
in which people can engage.
And my, my feeling was

490
00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.650
let's start simple and see
what shakes out. So the

491
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.530
first step was I looked
at the expos community as

492
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:35.200
essentially a barren Island with
kind of natives on it

493
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.630
and what I need to
put in place, the tools

494
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.850
or the, you know, the
roads and the buildings and

495
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.760
the infrastructure. So a lot
of that was building a

496
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.000
website, get in the form
in place, getting a Wiki

497
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.770
in place, having monthly Hangouts,
where we can communicate out

498
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.100
things that are going on,
infusing community into the price

499
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.380
design, the price development process,
like nothing existed in that,

500
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.650
in that sense, before I
joined. And then what happened

501
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.290
was natural kind of next
steps panned out of that.

502
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:09.060
So we've seen, for example,
teams forming open teams that

503
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.010
are forming to compete in
these prizes where they're keeping

504
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.490
all the material on, get
hub, we've organized local user

505
00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.800
groups all over the world,
collects price, think tanks, where

506
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.520
we have teams in groups,
in Shanghai, in Hyderabad and

507
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.840
Bangalore and London and Zurich
and various other places. So

508
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.050
my view was frankly, suck
it and see is like

509
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.810
join and see what we
already had. And then, and

510
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.930
then it would naturally the
most logical areas of focus

511
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:37.020
would pan out of that.
And also, you know, the

512
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.740
other, the other challenge here
was, was bringing community to

513
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.190
a organization that is pretty
unfamiliar with how communities work.

514
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.370
So Peter Diamandis understands community
at the, at the, at

515
00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.450
the wider level, but you
know, my colleagues at the

516
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.580
X prize foundation, this was
completely new to them. You

517
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.550
know, I come from a
company where it was born

518
00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:01.680
in the brain of, of
community. It understood the importance

519
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.200
of community and why that
plays a role in open

520
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.420
source. Whereas for the X
prize foundation, the first questions

521
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.570
I had was why you
here, I'm like, what's the

522
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.440
point of this? And, you
know, so it was interesting

523
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.810
kind of translating the point
of all of this stuff

524
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.090
into a language, for people
who are completely unfamiliar with

525
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:22.320
it, and then building kind
of engagement and building support

526
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.220
for that internally. So that,
like I said, this is

527
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.480
one of the reasons why
the last year, I think,

528
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.020
has been a really interesting
year because I was consulting

529
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.780
with companies previously, who weren't
particularly familiar with the community,

530
00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.060
but you play a different
role as a consultant that

531
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.100
you need to do when
then when you come in

532
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:43.340
on the ground. So, So
what can the software engineer

533
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:48.350
or developer or person who's
listening to this podcast do

534
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.100
when they can't presumably take
three years of their life

535
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.190
off and assemble a team
and go off into an

536
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.680
unknown space. If they want
to do this kind of

537
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.320
work, do they find people
who are working on X

538
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.340
prize and join those companies?
Do they other smaller enterprises

539
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.430
that an individual or a
person can do in their

540
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:11.930
garage? The things that we're
exploring right now. So I've

541
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.530
broken these initial ideas into,
into a few different phases.

542
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.200
So phase one was getting
all the infrastructure in place,

543
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:21.350
which we're pretty much there.
Now, phase two was getting

544
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.330
these local think tank groups
all over the world, set

545
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.020
up, which you know, which
is where people give presentations

546
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.860
about three D printing about
drones, about artificial intelligence, that

547
00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.250
kind of stuff. But then
also those groups are encouraged

548
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.470
to kind of get together
and to ideate and to

549
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.250
brainstorm ways in which they
can collaborate and work together.

550
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:44.050
So, one thing I'd recommend
is, is, is software people

551
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.730
go to a think tank,
or if there isn't a

552
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:50.020
thing, technically you set one
up, but the second area

553
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:55.420
is, Oh, sorry. The, the
third area, rather that we're

554
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.070
at the beginning of thinking
about, and I'd love to

555
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.860
get people's views on this
is I'm of the view

556
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.790
that, you know, X prize
is a big, hairy, audacious

557
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.620
incentive competitions. And imagine that
you've got all these big

558
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.650
problems in the world floating
above us, around energy, around

559
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:18.520
water, around ocean health, around
education X prize understands those

560
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.550
problems pretty well and can
pick off some elements of

561
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:25.060
those problems. And then at
the bottom underneath that massive

562
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.450
problems are people who can
do stuff. They're software developers,

563
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.680
hardware, engineers, translators, designers, scientists,
all of those different people.

564
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.740
So X prize basically translate
some of those problems into

565
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.010
a form that some of
those people can connect with.

566
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:42.580
And those are the X
prize competitions. My personal philosophy

567
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.940
is that there are still
loads of major challenges in

568
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.190
the world that people would
not be able to participate

569
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:52.450
in that are smaller pieces
that I believe that people

570
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.760
would like to play a
role in. So this could

571
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.050
be making better software for
emergency responders to communicate with

572
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.080
each other on cell phones.
It could be building crisis

573
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:07.270
management systems where people can
quickly find relatives and food

574
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.910
and things like that. It
could be big data. I

575
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:14.950
just recently joined a board
for the, the open cloud

576
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.490
consortium, which is creating an
open data commons for doing

577
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.520
cancer research. And Alzheimer's research.
You know, this is the

578
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.740
kind of thing that I
think technology people would be,

579
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.480
would love to play a
role in making the world

580
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.330
a better place that isn't
an X prize. So what

581
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.820
I'm looking at doing right
now is exploring ways in

582
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.220
which we can construct an
environment where people can do

583
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.490
precisely that. So I'd love
to get people's input on

584
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.730
the forum at particularly, you
know, what around what would

585
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.330
be attractive to somebody. Cause
again, it's everything in my

586
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.790
mind starts to the hack
with that world. So how

587
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.270
do we, what's the first
hack in solving these bigger

588
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.810
problems? And then how do
we make that hack apply

589
00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.970
to those bigger problems in
a, in a practical sense,

590
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.610
Ideally, and this is selfish,
but because I'm a diabetic

591
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.910
and I work on some
open source projects around diabetes,

592
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.520
one of the, the, if
there were an, a diabetes

593
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.060
X prize, it would be
closing the loop and making

594
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:14.490
a software based controlled artificial
pancreas. Right. Which is kind

595
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.950
of currently being done. And
there's three or four people

596
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:20.730
who've hacked one together in
their garage, but like formalizing

597
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.280
that in a way that
dealt with all of the

598
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.750
issues around patient privacy and
security and all those kinds

599
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.960
of things. Yeah. It would
be interesting to have X

600
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.280
prizes that were somehow coordinated
or managed or supported by

601
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.900
the X prize community, but
maybe it didn't just have

602
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.070
a giant person the other
side. Well, yeah, it's interesting.

603
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.600
You say that there was
no money on the other

604
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.440
end. Yeah. There's, there's a,
a S a spinoff of

605
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.450
the X prize has been
this as there's been this

606
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.470
site called hero X, which
is essentially Kickstarter for running

607
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.760
incentive competitions. So, you know,
you could have a competition

608
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.210
that's 500 bucks, so it
could be 500,000 bucks. So

609
00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.930
it could conceivably be something
else. But the idea, one

610
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.370
of the things that we're
working with right now with,

611
00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:08.090
with the think tanks is
encouraging local groups to kind

612
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.400
of go through an ideation
process that results in an,

613
00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.090
in a hero X competition.
So, and then you could

614
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.970
potentially do some fundraising to
fund that at a smaller

615
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.730
level. So right now with
Kickstarter people get up and

616
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.700
they say, we want to
raise, you know, $50,000 to

617
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.030
make our product happen. You
could conceivably have a really

618
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:30.830
crisp competition that solves a
particular problem, and then go

619
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.830
and get people to fund
that they can contribute towards

620
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.730
the price purse. So this
is another interesting kind of

621
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.180
slant on the model. And
that frankly is important for

622
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.450
scaling up the incentive competition
model. Cause X prize is

623
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.370
so big. There's only so
many can run at a

624
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.690
time. So I think you
need that, that scalable crowdsource

625
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.080
model for it to really
have that way. It'd be

626
00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.790
interesting to see if you
could run a bunch of,

627
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.310
could you, like you could
run one, what is the

628
00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:02.050
difference between running $1 million X
prize? And, you know, I

629
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:06.070
don't know, 10, a hundred
thousand dollar ones. Well, that's

630
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.870
it, you know, there's one
of the things I've been

631
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.120
reading into recently. I don't
know if you're, if you've

632
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.670
read into this is behavioral
economics and you know, there's

633
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.460
this, there's this interesting. There's
a, there's a guy called

634
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.240
Rory Sutherland. Who's this he's,
he actually works in advertising

635
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.350
and he, he's a tremendous
Ted speaker. I'd encourage your,

636
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.780
your listeners to go and
check them out. Rory Sutherland.

637
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.220
And he basically taught, you
know, behavioral economics is essentially

638
00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:39.070
the premise that people make
irrational decisions. And that, you

639
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.370
know, economics is you have
a very rational set of,

640
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.980
of, of ways in which
the economy works. And then

641
00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:50.020
economics is, you know, is
panned out of those, those

642
00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.960
rational presumptions. And we all
know that those rational presumptions

643
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.050
are completely fictitious. So it's
basically this applied to social

644
00:34:56.050 --> 00:35:00.190
behavior. And one of the
premises that Rory Sutherland talks

645
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.290
about is that a guy
wrote this book called nudge.

646
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.660
Is that the way in
which we make big things

647
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.530
happen is not necessarily through
one massive thing. It's through

648
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.990
lots of small nudges. So,
you know, we see this

649
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.300
in governments where a government
will try to solve a

650
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:17.050
problem. And what they'll do
is they'll announce the $2 billion

651
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.770
initiative to solve this particular
problem. Whereas in reality, when

652
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.230
you empower lots of people
to do lots of little

653
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.250
paper cut nudges, that's how
we tick off these problems.

654
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:31.840
And this is how crowd
funding, crowdsourcing and community development

655
00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.880
has had an impact in
the world is, you know,

656
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.890
Wikipedia is one of the
finest example of the nudge

657
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.300
model is that of people
have written little bits of

658
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.470
Wikipedia. Now it's becoming a
tremendously valuable aggregate. So I

659
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.600
believe that there is a
similar kind of approach that

660
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.840
can be applied to solving
our major challenges in the

661
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.110
world through X prize. So
X prize competitions are the

662
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.290
big, the big campaigns, but
then we need to empower

663
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.990
lots of people to make
those small lunches. Very cool.

664
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.170
Well, thanks for chatting with
me today. Yeah, no, I

665
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.540
appreciate you having me on.
So folks can go up

666
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:11.490
and look certainly@thenewforumsatcommunitydotexforumsthatxprizedotorgiscommunitydotxprize.org coming soon,
it is coming at the

667
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.980
end of this month, that's
going to be launching, but

668
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.960
you can find everything right
now at forum dot X

669
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.370
prize dog. And then obviously
you can just go to

670
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:19.650
the main website X prize
to Okta to find out

671
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:23.550
about the wider organization. So,
and certainly also I do

672
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.300
very much recommend the art
of community, your book. It's

673
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.540
still well, it's certainly still
relevant today. I hope so.

674
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.450
I hope so, but I'm
looking forward to writing the

675
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.780
next one and I appreciate
it. Thank you. This has

676
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.360
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

677
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:39.870
next week.
