9
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.550
am Scott Hanselman. This is
another Today. I'm talking with

10
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.390
Rubin Harris. He's the CEO
at career karma. You were

11
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.810
a Y Combinator company. How
does that work? Well, essentially

12
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.210
you have to go through
a process of interviewing with

13
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.260
Y Combinator and meeting a
bunch of objectives. But yeah,

14
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.660
we, we got into it.
We got rejected the first

15
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.210
time, but we applied again
in the same year and

16
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.140
got in. It was a
so grueling process, but totally

17
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.170
worth it. Well, that's actually
a good segue because you

18
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.990
bring up a couple of
things. They're getting rejected more

19
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.150
than, you know, getting rejected
once. And then also the

20
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.810
idea of a grueling process,
because career karma is an

21
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.970
app that helps job training
programs, boot camps find qualified

22
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.180
applicants. And I'm sure that
as people are trying to

23
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.980
get into tech, they're going
to get knocked down a

24
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.270
couple of times. That's exactly
right. I mean, to your

25
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.990
point, you know, job training
programs are trying to identify

26
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.860
people that want to take
control of their careers, but

27
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.190
individuals themselves also want to
take control of their careers.

28
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.880
And so several people that
come to career karma have

29
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.420
tried to become software engineers
before, and we don't just

30
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.550
match them with the right
job training, but we put

31
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.370
them through a three week
process called the 21 day

32
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.730
CK challenge that helps them
create a habit, but also

33
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.360
gives them support through a
small group called a squad

34
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.640
of other people like them
to have done it before

35
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.290
when I inside installed it,
I hope you don't mind,

36
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.600
but I pretended to be
a person trying to get

37
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.870
into tech and right off
the bat, I was kind

38
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.420
of impressed with the, like,
I almost felt like I

39
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.880
got a hype group for
me there just within a

40
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.800
couple of people, call me,
people were texting me. There

41
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.580
was chats. I mean, if
you're lacking or if you're

42
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.430
struggling with any kind of
internal motivation, you definitely have

43
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.550
a squad that is hyping
you up through, you know,

44
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.620
every day, all day, like
letting you know that you

45
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.050
can do it and then
providing you with like measurable

46
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.810
and specific resources to go
in and make it happen.

47
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.690
Yeah. I'm glad that you
downloaded the app. You know,

48
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.790
a lot of people like
to see things from the

49
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.650
outside, but it's a very
different experience feeling. I think

50
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.530
scaling human to human connection
is difficult. However, even though

51
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.930
we have an app and
is technology driven at the

52
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.090
end of the day, it's
all about relationships. And so

53
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.420
we are working on figuring
out how to help people,

54
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.970
help people. And we tell
people when not teaching you

55
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.500
how to work for companies
with teaching you how to

56
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.510
work for each other. Hmm.
There's definitely a vibe of

57
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.320
positivity that you get in
the app. And there's like

58
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.820
almost 400 squads that are
all different groups. And I'm

59
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.570
a big fan of the
idea of a squad because

60
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.390
you know, it could be
people that look like you,

61
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.520
people who are from your
town, people who are your

62
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.410
age. I mean, it really
is up to you to

63
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.430
self-select. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
I think if you think

64
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.780
about where people get their
best friends from, it's usually

65
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.460
through going through struggle and
trying to do something hard,

66
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.490
like becoming a software engineer
is a struggle for many.

67
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.670
And so through the process
of acquiring skills that are

68
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.670
difficult, you're going to meet
your best friends. A lot

69
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.280
of times in the corporate
world, you'll say, you know,

70
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.500
your best friends came from
college, but if you never

71
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.080
went to college, where do
your best friends come from?

72
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.090
It's usually through, you know,
sports or family or the

73
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.020
neighborhood or a gang, even
because you guys went through

74
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.200
hard times. Hmm. You know,
that's actually interesting that you

75
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.710
bring that up because my
entree into, into tech was

76
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.350
not typical. I didn't go
to a four year school.

77
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.710
I was working full time,
right out of high school

78
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.940
and never actually did the
college experience where you have

79
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.940
like, you know, being a
dorm, join a fraternity, or,

80
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.040
you know, spend time with
people at that level. Everything

81
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.190
I did was working at
night. So the people that

82
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.230
I ended up being friends
with were people who were,

83
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.840
you know, in the middle
of the hustle with me,

84
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.350
trying to make it happen
because the traditional four year

85
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.860
college didn't did not work
out. Yeah. Yeah. For sure.

86
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.440
For sure. When I'm looking
through your list of squads

87
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.980
here, you've got, you had
like moms who code, you

88
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.410
got gray, you know, code
gray. I love this people

89
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.220
who are 55 and older
vets who code like you've,

90
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.160
you've, you've got every kind
of group of people that

91
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.600
dads who code are these
self-selected or did you all

92
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.830
make these yourself They're self
selected. If you think about

93
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.010
my cofounders and I, which
I didn't talk about, but

94
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.620
we, we met in Atlanta,
Georgia. We've moved to the

95
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.670
Bay area without knowing anybody.
And essentially we figured out

96
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.400
how to break into tech.
And if you think about

97
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.450
us after we did boot
camps, we were essentially like

98
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.660
the original squad we've been
through ups and downs. We've

99
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.540
been through startups doing well
and startups not doing so

100
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.650
well. We've been through layoffs.
And essentially we built career

101
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.510
calm as the product that
we wish that we had

102
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.320
when we were breaking into
tech. And so squads actually

103
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.900
started off on their own.
The first squad was FFT.

104
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.190
And you can hear about
that story on the breaking

105
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.010
stars podcast. And it was
a group of people from

106
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.060
different bootcamps that essentially created
a study group and started

107
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.880
creating their own bylaws and
meetings and things like that.

108
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.480
And through learning from them
and how they structured it.

109
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.880
We built that as a
feature into the app that

110
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.540
has blown up into what
it is right now. The,

111
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.130
one of the things that
I was impressed about the

112
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.040
Abbott, I'm not, I'm trying
to find my way around.

113
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.990
It is. It's very, it's
very interesting. Your whoever's doing

114
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.790
your UX is really clever
because it's very like, how

115
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.360
can I express this? It's
very like homey and friendly,

116
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.090
but it's also walking you
along a path. It's, it's,

117
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.420
it's linear, but you don't
feel like you're being moved

118
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.180
along a path, kind of
like in an aggressive way.

119
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.910
It's just like, okay, it's
a new day. And here's

120
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.600
what we're going to do
today. So that that's by

121
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.990
design. So Timor, who's our
chief product officer who loved

122
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.200
that feedback. So it's good
that you shared that he

123
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.980
thinks a lot about gaming
and he thinks a lot

124
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.890
about, you know, workout apps
and things, a lot about

125
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.150
things like dual lingo that
took things that were normally

126
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.470
hard for people, but they,
they were able to accomplish

127
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.890
big things, but it did
it, they did it without

128
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.620
even realizing that it was
hard. It's like a child

129
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.830
learning a language like Japanese
when they're a baby, like

130
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.410
they just do it because
they're like in the environment

131
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.690
and they didn't know it
was hard. It wasn't in

132
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.700
their mind where it would
have to be hard and

133
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.060
things like that. So essentially
we study a lot of

134
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.340
those types of things. And
so that's, that's all by

135
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.880
design. So like right now
I'm looking at mine, I

136
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.890
think I'm on day three
or four here. And it

137
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.380
says I've got some conversations
that are going. It was

138
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.800
funny. I was actually talking
with one of your founders,

139
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.130
Archer, and I'm afraid. I
hope he's not offended. But

140
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.220
I asked him if he
was a bot, because he,

141
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.470
he was like, Hey, you
know, are you interested in

142
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.120
learning how to code? And
he was chatting me and

143
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.940
I just said, bot. And
he said, Nope, I'm real.

144
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.160
I used to get that
a lot. There's a, there's

145
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.220
a, there's a light touch
and a personal touch. That's

146
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.920
almost so real that I
think in this world of

147
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.920
bots, we're all suspicious that,
you know, it can't scale,

148
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.120
the personal touch can't scale.
I mean, that's a, that's

149
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.660
an interesting point. I mean,
cause I we're building technology

150
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.650
that isn't just helping people
take control of their careers

151
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.640
and house job training programs
find qualified applicants, but we're

152
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.020
also building software that helps
us coach people and mentor

153
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.890
people in a scalable way.
And we get that a

154
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.860
lot to the point where
some people think that this

155
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.170
is even the scan, like
how's it possible that to

156
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.000
even talking to me and
you guys are doing this

157
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.810
all the time and that's
honestly the only reason I'm

158
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.520
able to be able to
speak with over a hundred

159
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.860
people a day, I've been
doing this since April, 2018 is

160
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.210
to this technology that we've
built. So yeah. So you

161
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.940
are, you're, you're hosting, like
for example, here on the

162
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.050
homepage of the app, you've
got an event later this

163
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.240
evening where you're going to
do a kickoff, you're doing

164
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.540
these regular kickoff kickoff events
where you're making yourself available

165
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.210
to, you know, all these
thousands of thousand people that

166
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.780
are on career karma. And
you're scaling this through these

167
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.900
webinars and these events. Yeah,
yeah. Every night, 6:00 PM, West

168
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.370
coast time, we have something
called the CEO kickoff. You

169
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.180
talked about Y Combinator earlier.
They talk about making something

170
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.280
that people want and making
something that people need it.

171
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.910
Yes. We, we have gone
through the process of being

172
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.520
in a bootcamp. You could
think about what Combinator like

173
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.340
a bootcamp for entrepreneurs. But
even though we've been through

174
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.890
this experience of trying to
take control of our career

175
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.610
and breaking into tech, the
world changes, everything is always

176
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.790
changing. And so what we
went through is still different

177
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.720
than others. And so it's
very important to constantly be

178
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.780
talking to your users. They
have something called doing things

179
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.230
that don't scale and, and
the best source of information

180
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.660
from people is going to
be by talking to them

181
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.710
about their problems and not
prescribing your own solutions that

182
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.770
they didn't ask for a
muscle pretty much day in,

183
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.080
day out. We're writing code,
talking to users. That's pretty

184
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.960
much what we do all
day, day in, day out.

185
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.600
Yeah. One of the things
as I'm going through my,

186
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.340
my daily assignment here is
there's discussions of accountability and

187
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.710
there's discussions of it that
you're not, I wouldn't say

188
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.540
you're like warning them. It's
going to be hard. But

189
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.700
I think you're giving them
a level of structure that

190
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.520
is making it clear that
we're not messing around here.

191
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.460
And if you don't follow
through with this, this, this

192
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.880
checklist or you don't make
a forward, you know, some

193
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.640
positive forward motion every single
day, then you probably are

194
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.500
not going to be as
successful as if you did.

195
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.350
Yeah, but thousand percent, I
mean, a lot of people

196
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.830
ask like, well, what's the,
what's the success rate of

197
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.580
people going to career combine?
Honestly, like if you don't

198
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.430
quit, there's a hundred percent
success rate in a hundred

199
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.980
percent failure rate. If you
do, you know, if you,

200
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.310
we're never going to give
up on you and everybody

201
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:02.330
has different paces during the
process. But when we check

202
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.110
in on you, we're going
to learn, what's changed. And

203
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.820
we're going to give you
something to make you better

204
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.170
in that day. If you
don't do it, then you're

205
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.870
going to be stuck in
the same place every day.

206
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.690
That doesn't mean that you're
a bad person. That doesn't,

207
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.460
that just means that you
don't want it bad enough.

208
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.460
You know? Like, or life
life happened or it's not

209
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.350
the right time to do
it. You know, a question

210
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.500
to ask on the C
okay, I forgot phase. If

211
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.190
I give you a million
dollars to do the 21

212
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.040
day challenge, five minutes a
day, every day back to

213
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.910
back, would you do it?
And everybody says, yes. And

214
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.730
<inaudible>, and I say, what
if your phone blew up

215
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.350
or fell in the toilet,
would you still figure it

216
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.840
out? They say, absolutely. Well,
if you could do it

217
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.400
with the million dollar incentive,
you should be able to

218
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.470
go without one. You just
don't want it bad enough.

219
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.220
Hmm. That's a, that's a,
that's a slippery slope though.

220
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.520
Wouldn't you say? There's like
you said, life does happen.

221
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.700
We've got single parents. We've
got people working, two jobs,

222
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.580
wanting it bad enough. Like
the willpower I think is

223
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.560
like a well, and you
have to refill the well

224
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.500
sometimes is, is being in
a squad or what are

225
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.910
things within career karma that
can help you refill your

226
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.810
own willpower? Well, Yeah. So
if you look at day

227
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.820
seven of the 21 day
challenge, it talks about the

228
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.260
importance of breaks and, and
taking the importance of refreshing,

229
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.410
right? So like I said
before, it's like, it's not,

230
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.340
we're not telling people commit
to four hours a day,

231
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.670
immediately as five minutes every
day. And everybody has 168

232
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.070
hours in a week. Yes.
In the beginning, there's a

233
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.970
lot of engagement in that
activity, but we don't dive

234
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.810
people right into the world
of coding. We just five

235
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.800
minutes, I just check it
out, taught some people, dip

236
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.700
your toes, play around and
to your point, life happens.

237
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.460
It doesn't always have to
happen back to back. Since

238
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.440
I've been running a company
it's been difficult for me

239
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.540
to be back to back
in the gym, as much

240
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.850
as I like to. But
as we're going through this

241
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.360
process, you know, if I'm
telling people to be consistent

242
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.240
and their path of coding,
then I should be consistent

243
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.780
with things in my own
life, despite everything else going

244
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.390
on here. So we don't
make you feel like a

245
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.580
bad person if you don't
do it, but we will

246
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.770
constantly remind you that if
you want to do this,

247
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.450
then try this. The other
thing that we do too,

248
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.300
is to your point is
we want to people, people

249
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.960
to think less of coding
as like just a way

250
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.910
to make a lot of
money. And if they trust

251
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.910
the process, yeah. They will
actually make a million dollars

252
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.430
if they stick in the
job for five, 10 years

253
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.130
making over a hundred thousand
dollars. But that's not the

254
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.590
goal. You know, money is
a means. It's not an

255
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.980
end. And so we, we
talk deeper about deeper things

256
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.290
that go beyond money. Yeah.
I mean, you have to,

257
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.990
you have to explore people's
motivations. Why is someone doing

258
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.420
this? What is the, you
know, what is the ultimate

259
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.640
goal? But at the same
time, I think it's probably

260
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.920
valid. If you want to
make a bunch of money,

261
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.730
that's certainly reasonable thing, right?
It's a reasonable enough reason

262
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.590
to get into tech. You
don't have to like people,

263
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.900
people always sometimes try to
imply that you're not, you're

264
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.330
not a real developer. If,
and then they give you

265
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.150
some, some nonsense about why
you're not a real developer.

266
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.660
Like you don't have to
work on this stuff after

267
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.990
five, if you're not passionate
about it. I mean, my

268
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.230
wife's a nurse. She's not
necessarily like thinking about nursing

269
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.560
when she's on the weekend,
like nursing as a, as

270
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.030
a hobby, you know what
I mean? It is her

271
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.620
job. Yeah. Yeah. For sure.
For sure. I mean, we

272
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.470
also tell people that, like,
you're not a United developer

273
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.540
the day that you get
paid to become a developer,

274
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.430
you're a developer, the day
you write your first line

275
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.760
of code, you know, you
could be a struggling artist

276
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.990
for years and you can't
play the best music in

277
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.110
the world, but would you
consider yourself an artist? Yeah.

278
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.080
If you've never been paid
to be play music, would

279
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.090
you consider yourself an artist?
Yeah. I play a guitar.

280
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.600
Okay, cool. Then like, why
do we have to like,

281
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.400
wait to be paid, to
do something, be defined ourselves

282
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.440
as that. That's, that's not
how you should be thinking

283
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.590
about things. Like if you
typed hello world, like you're

284
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.700
call it enough. Hmm. That's
a kind of good attitude.

285
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.920
And like, you know, sense
of inclusion that I think

286
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.500
is really positive. Like, I
mean, I've been coding for

287
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.250
30 years, but I'm literally
learning stuff three, four, five

288
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.040
times a week. And I,
in no way am an

289
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.310
expert in a whole bunch
of stuff. It's such a

290
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.280
huge thing. That's the thing
about coding. Unlike a lot

291
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.070
of other environments is that
there's so much to know

292
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.650
that if you think you
you'll never know it all,

293
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.630
and by the time you
do, there'll be some new

294
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.870
thing that just came out
the next day. Exactly. Exactly.

295
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.360
It never ends. And that's
the, that's the beautiful part

296
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.280
about it. It's like, you're
always going to grow. You're

297
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.790
not going to stay stagnant.
Hey, friends, I want to

298
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.240
introduce a new sponsor to
you. H M a VPN.

299
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.040
It's a VPN you can
count on. As you know,

300
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.810
I do a lot of
travel and I tend to

301
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.630
connect to a lot of
untrusted wireless networks. And I

302
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.200
probably shouldn't, but I can
use HMA as the world's

303
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.240
largest VPN service offers. The
most server locations worldwide covers

304
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.770
190 countries. There's always a
server nearby doesn't log your

305
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.410
IP address. It's got full
network connection and allows me

306
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.850
to connect five devices simultaneously
works on basically all platforms,

307
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:11.500
Android, iOS, Mac, Linux, windows
routers, wherever it's actually been

308
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.920
completely redesigned recently to make
it even simpler and more

309
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.800
fun to use. And there's
even a smart kill switch

310
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.710
that will turn the VPN
automatically on. When you launch

311
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.100
sensitive apps, here's your call
to action. My friends try

312
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:29.110
HMA VPN risk-free with a
30 day money back guarantee.

313
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.740
This deal is for handsome
and its listeners. That's HMA,

314
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:44.170
vpn.com/offer hyphen Hansel minutes. That's
HMA, vpn.com/offer-hansel minutes. So as

315
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.710
you walk through this process,
you find your squad. You

316
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.480
express to them how to
manage their time, how to

317
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.640
work through their own schedule
and figure out when they

318
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.580
can find those five minutes
until they build those five

319
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.430
minutes up into some number
of hours. Then you talk

320
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.030
to them about evaluating bootcamps
and evaluating these technical schools,

321
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.730
because they're not all the
same and people need to

322
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.270
find the culture fit that
that works for them. Why

323
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.160
aren't all boot camps the
same. And how would someone

324
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.100
decide which one to go
to? That's a great question.

325
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.940
I think job training programs
like coding, boot camps that

326
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.890
teach you exactly what companies
need in a short amount

327
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.910
of time are in Vogue.
And I think are going

328
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.540
to continue to grow in
popularity. And because of that,

329
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.710
now that there are hundreds
and of programs that exists

330
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.220
in the United States. Some say,
there's some reports to say

331
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.250
thousands, but let's say hundreds
of bootcamps that exist that

332
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.090
are higher quality. It's very
difficult for someone to choose.

333
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:44.920
There's a lot of psychological
things around paralysis by analysis,

334
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.320
where you can Google learn
to code, and then you

335
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.070
have thousands of options and
you just don't do anything

336
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.220
because you don't know. What's
the reason why there's so

337
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.840
many different types of learning
is because people are different,

338
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.330
right? And some people prefer
an online program. Some people

339
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.400
prefer an offline program. Some
people want to do something

340
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.800
full time. Sometimes we want
to do something part time.

341
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.060
Sometimes people want to do
self pace. Sometimes people have

342
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.830
money in their pocket to
be able to pay for

343
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:21.750
school. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes
people have loans already. So,

344
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.590
and they don't want to
take on any more loans.

345
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.360
So even if you can
create a scholarship or get

346
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.580
your company to pay for
it, or the government provides

347
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.830
some type of thing for
you, even if you have

348
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.740
the school for free, you
still got to live. So

349
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.170
you might need housing, or
you might need a job.

350
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.730
So you could earn a
check while you learn it.

351
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.280
So, you know, you might
need a connection with the

352
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.910
company. So there's all kinds
of different reasons why there's

353
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.480
different types of job training.
The problem that I would

354
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.750
say that a lot of
people face in addition to

355
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.020
selecting which job training program
is best for their learning

356
00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.000
style is that there are
schools that take advantage of

357
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.430
people that are desperate to
take control of their career.

358
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.590
And it will take advantage
of you and scam me

359
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.040
for your money in that,
get you a job. Yeah.

360
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.670
Like that's, that's a fact.
I there's definitely, there's just

361
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.850
like, you could even say
that with like some colleges,

362
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.880
right? There's, you know, for
profit colleges that have said,

363
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.730
we will get you this
degree. And that means you're

364
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.710
going to get a job.
So take out hundreds of

365
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.190
thousand dollars in loans and
then you'll be fine. But

366
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.140
the reason why our student
loan amount is one point

367
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.550
$6 trillion in America for 45 million
Americans is because for most

368
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.090
people that promise never came.
They never got the job

369
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.220
that was able to pay
off the debt. And that's

370
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.880
what we are. And so
if you're someone that's trying

371
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.760
to evaluate bootcamp programs, the
ultimate measure of success is

372
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.630
outcomes. How many people have
they placed into companies, not

373
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.150
placement rate? Like, do they
have a deep wall of

374
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.270
alumni that are working in
companies? Right? Cause if you

375
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.790
think about, if you just
look at placement rate, that's

376
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.810
kind of like looking at
all right. Well, you know,

377
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.010
these people got placed, but
you also not seeing like

378
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.730
how many people that graduated
or were in the program

379
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.980
that like dropped out in
the middle of it. It

380
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.920
might've been for legitimate reasons.
Like life, like someone might've

381
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.230
passed away or it might've
been just like they gave

382
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.660
up, right? It's like how
many people sign up to

383
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.310
the gym at the beginning
of the year and then

384
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.250
end up, I'm still in
the gym by the end.

385
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.180
So I think a school
that says that they're going

386
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.220
to get you jobs should
be able to point to

387
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.400
people that have jobs at
companies that you want to

388
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.730
work for. That's the ultimate.
Then you want to talk

389
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.030
to people that have been
through the program. You want

390
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.440
to talk to the people
that are currently in the

391
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.140
program because the program changes
over time and you want

392
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.430
to talk to people that
are evaluating the program as

393
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:54.130
well. You also want to
evaluate the way that they

394
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.190
teach to see if it's
receptive with your learning style,

395
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.720
because you're inevitably going to
have to learn new languages.

396
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.390
And so the way that
they teach you concepts, this

397
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.630
is going to be really
important. And you want to

398
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.350
understand what they offer. That's
not listed on their website

399
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.220
because of going back to
everything. Changing schools and boot

400
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.880
camps are going to be
constantly iterating based off of

401
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.670
feedback that they get from
people and things that companies

402
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:27.010
need. So often they're launching
new scholarship programs, new initiatives

403
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.620
to help people. And you
will never figure those out

404
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.700
without talking to them. And
so sometimes you self limit

405
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.350
yourself by not talking to
the school and just judging

406
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.750
that everything the school has
to offer is on their

407
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.290
website. So you need to
talk. Yeah. I really feel

408
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.780
like the importance of actually
talking to humans, looking them

409
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.520
in the eye. Like this
is not a decision that

410
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.500
one should take lightly. And
it's not a decision that

411
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.930
they can make necessarily just
by reading the brochure where

412
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.400
on the website. Yeah, exactly,
exactly. And we're gonna put,

413
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.400
come out with a pretty
big guy talking about how

414
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.520
to, like, I have a
YouTube video on youtube.com/career com

415
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.680
about how to pick a
coding boot camp that breaks

416
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.930
down how to pick a
coding boot camp. But we're

417
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.210
also going to come out
with a guide about this

418
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.710
as well. Yeah. And as
I'm going through the process

419
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.040
here on the learn section
of the app, day four,

420
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.190
I'm gonna evaluate the bootcamps
on day five. You talk

421
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.490
about income sharing because if
folks want to get a

422
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.910
job in tech, they that
they may not have any

423
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.670
resources right now. But the
assumption is that they're going

424
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.930
to get a job in
tech. They're going to make

425
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.500
a decent salary. And what,
what, what is ISA? What

426
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.780
is an income share agreement
and how to do is

427
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.320
you're basically betting on all
of these folks doing well.

428
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.170
And then that's how the
bootcamp and that's how ultimately

429
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.690
you will, we'll get some
money to keep the lights

430
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.620
on. Yeah. Yeah. So income
share agreement. So essentially study

431
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.090
now pay later models and
going back to career karma,

432
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.730
being the product that we
wish that we had when

433
00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:00.570
we were breaking an attack,
my cofounders Archer, who is

434
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.570
our chief technology officer and
his twin brother did bootcamp.

435
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.190
And they did both options.
Archer did hack reactor where

436
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.030
he paid up front, let's
think it was like $18,000.

437
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.380
And then Timor did app
Academy, which was essentially a

438
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.850
deferred tuition as a model
that essentially promises to get

439
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.760
you a job above a
certain salary. And if you

440
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.010
don't get a job, you
don't pay a dime. My

441
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.070
brother did app Academy as
well, ended up getting a

442
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:33.570
job that paid him about
$150,000 with no experience and

443
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:38.490
that he paid back about
$26,000. And so essentially that's

444
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.090
what income share agreements are,
where they focus on you

445
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:48.170
getting a job and above
salary, sorry about that. Getting

446
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.940
a job above a certain
salary. And if you don't

447
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.830
get a job, you don't
pay it. And then you

448
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.870
can pay over a period
of time with a percentage

449
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.570
of one salary, and then
you can set a, a

450
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.440
cap. So the percentage is
meant to be, you know,

451
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.030
kind of like not quite
a tax, but it's, you

452
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.400
know, it's a percentage that
is over a period of

453
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.800
time. And then if you
make more and then you

454
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.210
can pay it off quicker
and then you hit a

455
00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.550
cap, then you're done. And
you're good. Yeah. I have,

456
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.280
I have a video about
this as well called how

457
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.830
income sharing works, but the
four triggers for an income

458
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:23.350
share agreement is again, anted
salary, a percentage of tuition

459
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.320
that you pay a duration
of time and the cap,

460
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.270
which is the most that
you would ever pay. So

461
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.000
you will always know the
most that you would ever

462
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.090
pay. So just to use
simple math, let's say, I'm

463
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.250
going to promise to get
you a dub of $50,000.

464
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.870
The percentage of tuition is
10%. The duration of time

465
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.350
is three years and the
cap is 30,000. So let's

466
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.740
say my sister is inspired
by my brother and she

467
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.930
wants to do the same
thing that my brother did.

468
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.050
And she gets a job
making $150,000 and she's paying

469
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:58.090
10% of tuition. That's above
the $50,000 promise. She's paying

470
00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.500
15,000 a year after two
years, she's paid 30,000, but

471
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.780
the income share agreement is
three years. But since she

472
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.550
hit the cap in two
years, she's done it too.

473
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.300
Let's say that for some
reason, like you said, she's,

474
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.520
she's my, sister's a mom.
She just had a baby

475
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.430
and she's just desperate for
money. She's in Florida right

476
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.930
now. And $50,000 is good.
So let's say it takes

477
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.080
a $3,000 job. And so
now she's paying 5,000 a

478
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.790
year after three years, she's
paid $15,000. So that's not

479
00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.000
the $30,000 cap, but because
he has a duration of

480
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.660
time, she's done. So she
ends up paying less than

481
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.780
$30,000. So it's either you're
paying less than the amount

482
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.330
or the cap, depending on
how much you're making. And

483
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.030
if you make a lot
of money out of your

484
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:47.080
first out with some people
make to $200,000, then you're

485
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.050
not going to be paying
an exorbitant amount and you're

486
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.410
protected what the cap, there's
no interest. If you get

487
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.440
laid off or you quit
your job, you're not paying

488
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.120
the ISA. You only paying
it when you're in a

489
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.810
job. And you've also called
out, I'm looking on your

490
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.580
blog, that you have a
whole blog about this, that

491
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.880
we'll include into the show
notes on income sharing agreements

492
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.610
that, you know, some boot
camps we'll even set you

493
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.550
up for success and make
sure that if you don't

494
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.440
find a job, making a
certain amount of money within

495
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.110
certain years of graduating, then
you would not be required

496
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.290
to pay it. Yeah. And
there's also some thank you

497
00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:24.190
for including that. There's also
some boot camps that will

498
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.370
even give you money back
guarantees as well. So let's

499
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.040
say that you decided to
pay tuition upfront and take

500
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.070
out a loan. Some bootcamps
will even give you your

501
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.130
money back because that's how
they hold themselves accountable. That's

502
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.800
how you know that a
school really holds themselves accountable

503
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.860
as if they're willing to
not charge you. If they

504
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.460
don't deliver on you a
job, that's the ultimate measure

505
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.510
of success. Yeah. And that
is the thing, right? Like

506
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.020
if, if this were, if
these systems were scammy or

507
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.890
turned out on helpful, then
we would all start hearing

508
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.140
about it because we'd have
people who don't have jobs

509
00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.810
and they would be forced
to pay back the ultimate

510
00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:03.740
goal of career karma. And
presumably all the bootcamps is

511
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.890
make people successful and stand
on their own two feet

512
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.860
and, you know, make, you
know, make a good career

513
00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.350
in tech. Yeah. I think
also like, I think if

514
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.680
you look at higher education,
income share agreements are spreading

515
00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.240
across colleges as well. And
yeah. And so if you

516
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.690
look at the, the state
of income share agreements report

517
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.390
that we did, which is
the most comprehensive in the

518
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:31.270
industry, colleges themselves are starting
to launch income, share with

519
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.490
me with, I think that
our entire higher education model

520
00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.240
is going to be going
towards an outcome driven method.

521
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.140
And if you don't then,
I mean, people are going

522
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.340
to believe you don't hold
their interests accountable. And I

523
00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.080
think I say that don't
be table to table sex

524
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.270
or some kind of outcomes
driven things. It's table stakes.

525
00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.780
You know, that's interesting. I
liked the way that that's

526
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.020
phrased. Like it is all
in branding, but they, you

527
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.910
know, income sharing agreement. It
is a, you know, we're

528
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.680
paying it forward. It's a
loan. That's going to come

529
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.110
due at some point. But
the way you phrase it,

530
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.400
they're outcome driven. Like the
whole point is be successful.

531
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.830
And if you're successful, then
you pay, you pay back.

532
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.930
If you're not, then we
need to figure out why

533
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.110
you're not successful, then make
you successful. And then you

534
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.470
pay it back. Like, what
we don't want is crushing

535
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.620
loans that are tearing people
down while they're trying to

536
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.150
get up. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
Definitely. That's really interesting. I

537
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.010
wish that something like that
was available when I was

538
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.370
trying to go to school
at night, it was a

539
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:37.610
different time, definitely For the
tech. How do you let

540
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.340
people decide what tech to
go into, whether it's Ruby

541
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.200
or Python or, or how
do you make those kinds

542
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.100
of decisions? That's a common
question. And we encourage people

543
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.580
not to get caught up
with that and to focus

544
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:54.500
on the job training program
that is, has the teaching

545
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.830
style that is best aligned
with them and that they

546
00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.490
focus on their own learning
style. And I always use

547
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:07.130
the example of my cofounders,
again, which arches, a boot

548
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.290
camp that he went to
was teaching Java script. Timor's

549
00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:15.140
was teaching Ruby and Python.
And they both ended up

550
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.350
becoming full stack engineers and
got to the same place.

551
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.830
There's gonna be a bunch
of different languages that are

552
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:27.560
out there, but because bootcamps
are talking to companies about

553
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.250
exactly what you need in
order to be successful, you're

554
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.170
going to be able to
get a job no matter

555
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.640
which one you pick. And
so what you want to

556
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.660
really focus on is which
job training program is most

557
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.770
aligned with your teaching style.
And we encourage people not

558
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.150
to get caught up in
languages. Yeah, I think that's

559
00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.760
really great. I mean, the
point is to teach people

560
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.640
how to think, teach people
how to learn, to set

561
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.880
them up for what I
call and what I've actually

562
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.400
had a great podcast with
Kesha Rogers, who talked about

563
00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.850
systems, thinking you've got to
teach people how to think

564
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.100
and how to think about
systems. And the language really

565
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:07.050
is secondary. When we're moving
forward with, with a project

566
00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.780
like this, is this a
year long project, is this

567
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.070
week's how long into, into
coding Carmen into career karma

568
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.680
rather, does it go until
you start really having to,

569
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.910
you know, basically make it
happen or step off? Like,

570
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.210
it seems like the first
week is pretty casual. It's

571
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:28.200
like reflection thinking about it,
preparing to make action. When

572
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.600
does it get hard? And
when do people fall off?

573
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:35.490
Yeah, I would say after
week one, when people start

574
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:41.040
talking to bootcamps and they've,
they've finished the first interview.

575
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.930
So the first interview you
could think about it, like

576
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.370
a, a digital campus visit
where you're talking to the

577
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:51.270
schools about what makes them
different from each other and

578
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.380
what they offer. That's not
online. That's pretty casual conversation.

579
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.310
And then they usually receive
a conditional acceptance. And essentially

580
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.570
what the school is looking
for is let's use you

581
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.790
as an ensemble is as
Scott someone, that's going to

582
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.610
start and finish my program
and not quit. And then

583
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.160
they asking you questions about
that. Like, why do you

584
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.840
want to learn how to
code? What have you done

585
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.570
related to coding and things
like that. And then on

586
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.510
your end, you're also interviewing
the school with this campus

587
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.910
visit. And you're like, well,
you know, I really like

588
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.830
you, but I'm also talking
to these schools. What makes

589
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.900
you different from them? Right?
So you want to make

590
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.820
sure that they're yeah, exactly.
You want to make them

591
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.090
compete and sell themselves to
you. That's a pretty casual

592
00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:35.310
conversation, but then you get
a bunch of different conditional

593
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:39.270
offers and the schools have
different prep work that you

594
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.790
have to take in order
to pass the technical exams.

595
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.930
And so for most people
doing the prep work, which

596
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.260
is usually about 75 to
80 hours, which is about

597
00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.230
you can, most people do
it and it can be

598
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.420
done in a week because
you have under 68 hours

599
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.100
in a week, but most
people get it done within

600
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.820
two to four weeks. Essentially,
once you're done with that,

601
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.360
then you can take the
exam. But I'll say that's

602
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.760
usually where people fall off
is through the pre-training work

603
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.910
that you need in order
to pass the technical exam.

604
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.900
And it's not because they're
not ready. There's a lot

605
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.650
of people that have finished
the technical work and have

606
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:23.010
gone through the digital campus
visit and the first interview

607
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.860
and got conditionally accepted. But
they won't take the exam

608
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.980
because they're nervous. And I'm
not talking about just like

609
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:33.060
people that are marginalized. I'm
talking about MBAs, I'm talking

610
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.960
about grown men. I'm talking
about women. Like everybody, you

611
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.740
can imagine the most confident
people that would imagine are

612
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.940
extremely intimidated by bootcamps and
just tech. I mean, the

613
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.310
word bootcamp is scary. It
sounds like maybe seal training.

614
00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.530
It's true though. Like we
have made tech such that

615
00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.910
if I have, if I'm
at a barbecue with, with,

616
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:56.320
with like nontechnical neighbors and
they say, Oh, what are

617
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.600
you doing? I say, Oh,
I work for Microsoft. They'll

618
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.090
say, Oh, you're a computer
person. I'm not a computer

619
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.030
person. Or I'm not technical.
And they've immediately other my

620
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.510
me and other themselves, because
we've made it like, it's

621
00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:12.400
some secret handshakes, some secret
club. And, and then, then

622
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.770
it's just us and them,
the tech isn't the non-techies.

623
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.630
And that's the exact opposite
of what we're trying to.

624
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.380
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's,
it's so interesting to me,

625
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.250
like, especially this being, living
in the Bay area for

626
00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:27.640
the last five years and
just seeing like all my

627
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.720
friends that are Bay area,
natives that live in that

628
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.170
are from San Francisco or
Oakland or Palo Alto, they

629
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.310
have seen all the changes
in tech, but haven't been

630
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.800
able to take a part
of it, even though they

631
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.950
want to, in the beginning
it was, they don't know

632
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.740
how, but even when they
know how and they have

633
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.170
the path, they have the
steps in front of them.

634
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:55.000
It's scary to walk those.
Oh, and that is why

635
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.640
I need to get my
squad. I'm looking here. See

636
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.400
people have been, I've gotten
text messages, I've gotten a

637
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.460
phone call. I've gotten emails
all from career karma, trying

638
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.980
to encourage me to, to
make it happen. And that's

639
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:09.700
what it's all about. Exactly.
Exactly. And to your point,

640
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.780
like guys, I didn't fully
answer your question, but you

641
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.170
said like how long has
this, like going through 21

642
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.390
days and getting into this
into a bootcamp is just

643
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:22.690
the beginning. You know, we
provide wraparound support for you

644
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.080
during the bootcamp, after the
boot camp and division is

645
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.340
to be able to help
you for the rest of

646
00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.130
your life. And there's a
reason why we're not called

647
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.620
code karma. We eventually want
to do this for every

648
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.770
skillset, but we're starting with
software engineering, which is the

649
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:41.020
hardest, but not impossible to
figure it out. Cause we've

650
00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.140
done it for many people.
You know, when my wife

651
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:48.460
quit her job and completely
changed from one career to

652
00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.190
another, to go from being
an MBA and a finance

653
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:55.180
person to being a medical
surgical nurse, I think that

654
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:57.670
she could have used a
squad cause she was just

655
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.310
she and I and a
lot of late nights. So

656
00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:04.300
that's really cool that you're
going to hopefully branch out

657
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.120
into careers in general. Well,
thank you for sharing that.

658
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.190
I mean, part of the
other reason why we have

659
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:14.980
a squad is not just
for the psychological motivation, but

660
00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.070
also I can never relate
to a mom cause I'm

661
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.800
not a mom. So I
don't, I don't know the

662
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.580
things that moms go through
to manage their day. Right,

663
00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.010
right. You know, I can
talk to them as best

664
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:29.530
that I can and ask
them and try my best.

665
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.260
But if I'm in a
squad with other moms that

666
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.810
figured it out and they
can tell me what they

667
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:38.610
did, right. Same thing with
the, that might have suffered

668
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.510
from PTSD or blah, blah,
blah, with the dad. And

669
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:46.020
so, you know, these squads
allow you to save time

670
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.520
by learning from best practices
of other people that structured

671
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.240
their day in a way
that made the impossible possible.

672
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.360
Very cool. Thank you so
much. Ruben Harris CEO at

673
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.090
career karma for talking to
me today. Thank you brother.

674
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.030
I appreciate the time and
the in depth breakdown. We've

675
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.420
never done that. That was
awesome. I appreciate that. This

676
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.970
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

677
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:21.840
you again next week. <inaudible>.
