00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:51.380
get started. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is Hansel

9
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.080
minutes today. I'm talking with
Kelly mains. She's senior director

10
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.780
of product roadblocks. She's got
an MBA from Stanford. How

11
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.120
are you? I'm doing great,
Scott. It's great to talk

12
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.490
with you. I'm excited to
talk to you, but more

13
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.330
importantly, the little people in
my house are excited that

14
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.050
I'm talking to you because
this is a roadblocks house.

15
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.930
And my, my 11 year
old and my 13 year

16
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.070
old are obsessed and in
a world of Minecraft and

17
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.670
Fortnite and the internet itself,
roadblocks has been a kind

18
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.330
of a staple in our
house for years. Can you

19
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.670
maybe for people who aren't
familiar with it, you can

20
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.590
give us a little sense
of what roadblocks is and

21
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.220
why it has such stain
power. Sure. We are a

22
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.190
community generated game site. That
means when you come to

23
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.740
roadblocks, you can explore lots
of different games that were

24
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.740
actually created by our community.
That's kids in high school,

25
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.110
kids in college kids, you
know, some as young as

26
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.920
middle school or elementary school,
we have a ways where

27
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.050
you can play with your
friends and connect with others

28
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.660
online, and you can even
build games together. So it's

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.800
a lot about exploring and
creating and playing together. Yeah,

30
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.610
the, I thought they were
playing like a game, but

31
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.970
they enter roadblocks. They find
games within it from the

32
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.880
community of games. And then
all think that they're doing

33
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.440
one thing. Like I thought
they were playing cops and

34
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.600
robbers and then another day
they were playing another game.

35
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.010
Yup. We got cops and
robbers, various variations of that.

36
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.190
We have superhero games. We
have work at a pizza

37
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.830
place is quite popular. You
can get a team together

38
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.170
and run a pizza shop
together. We have a lot

39
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.390
of high school simulation games,
so you can go to

40
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.200
high school and be a
teacher or a student, have

41
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.260
a family be a part
of a gymnastics team. A

42
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.500
lot of cool things that
you can explore really quickly

43
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.380
in a digital space that
you can also explore in

44
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.300
real life, but maybe can
do it a little bit

45
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.050
faster and a little bit
more creatively online. One of

46
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.180
the things that I think
is notable about roadblocks is

47
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.920
that some game makers and
game construction, things have a

48
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.530
kind of limitations where it's
like, we're a game where

49
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.350
you shoot people and here's
a thousand ways that you

50
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.150
could come up with different
ways to shoot people. But

51
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.670
you just expressed a diversity
of things that one can

52
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.090
do from cops and robbers
on the, on the one

53
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.540
side or the high school
simulator. Are there any limitations

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.100
to what one could model
within the application? We've found

55
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.450
it very few. So it's
mostly 3d. Although you can

56
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.590
do two D games, it's
mostly multiplayer. Although you can

57
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.470
do single player games, we
do have a limit on

58
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.390
the number of players that
can be together, sort of

59
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.940
a technological limit, but we're
trying to increase that as

60
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.390
much as possible so that
you can have expansive vast

61
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.890
worlds with hundreds or someday
even thousands of people playing

62
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.430
in the same space. So
that sounds like no limit

63
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.280
to me. I mean like
it is for now limits.

64
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.290
Yeah. The aim is no
limits, I think is really

65
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.200
exciting. You know, this is
evocative of like early social

66
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.040
gaming online. Like I remember
second life, which was you

67
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.140
enter a space and then
you decide what you want

68
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.350
to do with that space.
Yeah. We take a lot

69
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.250
of inspiration from a lot
of the worlds that have

70
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.680
come before. A lot of
people have tried to go

71
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.080
after this idea of the
metaverse and you even see

72
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.710
it in books like a
ready player one or I

73
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.750
think snow crash is one
of the books that inspired

74
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.920
second life. And there's this
been this collective idea of

75
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.800
a digital space where you
have a strong, real, authentic,

76
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.060
but digital identity where you
can explore worlds and really

77
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.030
connect with people across space
and time. Almost you can

78
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.760
visit the pyramids. You can
have a friend who's in

79
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.160
China and this is the
same concepts that's inspiring roadblocks

80
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.030
and several other companies today.
But we have a very

81
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.620
strong vision of being able
to create this digital metaverse

82
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.400
and bring people together in
it. One of the things

83
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.310
that was interesting about second
life and worlds before it

84
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.540
was, they really intended those
things for older teens, but

85
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.000
I see really young kids
on roadblocks. And I remember

86
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.400
that my, my kids were,
were young. What do you,

87
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.830
when do you think is
an appropriate time to introduce

88
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.830
a young person to an
online world in a safe

89
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.520
way? Oh, that's a great
question. As a parent, I

90
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.790
really think it's somewhat individual
in terms of like how

91
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.360
your kid can handle social
relationships and you know, how

92
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.120
much attention you're willing to
give them and what guidance

93
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.880
you're willing to give them
on roadblocks. We definitely make

94
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.850
a lot of effort to
make our community safe for

95
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.220
kids. We do very strict
moderation of content, as well

96
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.710
as moderating the things that
people say to each other.

97
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.350
We have a real time
text filter that will take

98
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.330
out bad words or anything
that we deem unsafe, even

99
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.860
things that are kind of
considered bullying or flirty content

100
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.240
that might be okay or
playful for an older population

101
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.260
that really aren't okay and
safe for younger kids. So

102
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.870
we do a lot of
moderation on our side to

103
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.850
make sure that our communities
safe for all. And as

104
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.420
a parent, you know, I
think digital citizenship is something

105
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.280
that I want to teach
my kids and that I

106
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.140
think in this day and
age, we all should be

107
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.440
teaching our kids. It's inevitable
that they will have social

108
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.320
interactions online at some age
and at some age it

109
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.710
will be independent of you.
And so we're, we're quite

110
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.130
aware of trying to teach
good behavior and good habits

111
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.070
to our population. It's a
tough thing. And it's really

112
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.950
an unsolved problem in the
industry. Like you said, most

113
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.200
of the products out there
and the ones that have

114
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.680
come before are aimed at
adults who are considered to

115
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.160
have, you know, good judgment,
whether that's true or not

116
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.400
in real life. That's how
software has basically been built

117
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.870
so far. So there's not
a lot of state-of-the-art help

118
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.070
for people to have good
behavior online. Yeah. And it's

119
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.140
hard to also express like
what his behavior like. I,

120
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.580
my, my, my 13 year
old was quite upset because

121
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.980
someone jumped into his Minecraft
world and took some of

122
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.640
his stuff. And that's, you
know, that's just like going

123
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.140
to school. People are going
to be mean to you.

124
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.810
I can't no, no, no.
AI can say, Hey, knock

125
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.810
that off. But I was
impressed if you go to

126
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.990
roadblocks.com and look at the
section slash parents, you do

127
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.960
everything from, you know, look
at the clothing of the

128
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.020
avatars to make sure that
it's appropriate. There's an extensive

129
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.070
reporting system. It feels like
there's more parental controls and

130
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.510
chat filters than in most,
any other similar environment. That's

131
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.180
right. We are, we do
consider ourselves to be pushing

132
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.270
the state of the art.
And in terms of safety

133
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.490
and digital civility, we also
ideally get people to learn

134
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.090
how to resolve their own
conflicts. So, you know, one

135
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.450
really touching example that I
found from talking to some

136
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.270
roadblocks players and parents that
came through to visit our

137
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.860
offices was a girl was
being bullied on roadblocks by

138
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.340
somebody that she knew. And
her mom was able to

139
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.460
use that as a teaching
experience to bring the girls

140
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.230
together and talk about how
their words impacted each other.

141
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.930
And they were actually on
the tour together, rebuilding their

142
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.420
friendship. And that's the kind
of thing that I would

143
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.500
love to make happen more
often and more seamlessly. Would

144
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:14.050
you say digital, digital citizenship,
All civility, digital citizenship. Those

145
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.270
were really excellent ways to
phrase what we're trying to

146
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.990
express. Sure. Yeah. We're, you
know, in a large virtual

147
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:25.690
world, we're seeing society define
itself. Digital society is, is

148
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.650
building on roadblocks and people
have different kind of roles

149
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.310
and different ways of interacting
online than you do in

150
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.100
real life. And we want
to make it as healthy

151
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.670
and supportive as possible. What
kind of lessons though, can

152
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.030
you learn from the, the
worlds that came before you,

153
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.460
like we talked about, talked
about second life, let's go

154
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.640
even further, like know muds
or BBS multiuser as soon

155
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.830
as the computers became network,
they became social. Yeah. I

156
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.490
think A few lessons that
I look at kind of

157
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.600
contrasting various products that went
before. One is that you

158
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.700
need something to do. I
mean, one of the big

159
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.300
challenges with second life that
maybe wasn't present as much

160
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.120
in muds or, or kind
of traditional games like world

161
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.310
of Warcraft is that you
showed up in second life.

162
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.010
There's very little to do.
And so on roadblocks, there

163
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.090
are games, right? There's a
there's monsters to kill or

164
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.720
places to explore or levels
to level up or things

165
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.840
to craft. So having something
to do together is really,

166
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.950
really important. Another thing is
around and on naitivity. So,

167
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.330
and you can see this
in a lot of the

168
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.290
online forums, as well as
places like Facebook, when people

169
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.770
are anonymous, sometimes it actually
brings out the worst behavior,

170
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.530
but it also can let
you express sides of yourself

171
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.590
that are really valuable and
authentic. And maybe you might

172
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.990
be afraid to say in
real life. So we're trying

173
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.220
to strike that balance where
you can be anonymous yet

174
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.010
also safe. And so that's
one of the reasons we

175
00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.000
invest a lot in like
forming friend connections, where you're

176
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.390
more likely to be anonymous
in a positive way. And

177
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.600
also our moderation systems that
really help keep the public

178
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.080
areas very safe. That's a
really good point because a

179
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.650
lot of people believe that
anonymity online is an opportunity

180
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.590
to be mean and not
an opportunity to be kind

181
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.440
that's right. One of the
other things that I was

182
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.040
very impressed about because certainly
my little boys do not

183
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.880
have high end devices by
any means. They, you know,

184
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.370
I think one of them
has an iPhone six, but

185
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.740
your, your engine for roadblocks
goes even farther, like to

186
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.460
the simplest of devices, but
it also looks amazing on

187
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:39.320
my high end PC. Yeah.
We have a single platform

188
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.080
strategy where we want to
run on all devices that

189
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.960
goes from your X-Box and
all the way down to

190
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:50.210
phones. Also tablets, computers. We
definitely want to be accessible

191
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.540
and make sure that our
community is a welcoming place

192
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.300
for everybody. No matter what
country you're in, no matter

193
00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.780
how fancy your hardware is,
you're welcome here. And we

194
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.160
want you to be part
of our community and we

195
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.440
want the games to be
fun and look good. So

196
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.780
in this case, you're bringing
inclusion all the way out

197
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.350
to device inclusion, because we
don't know what network they're

198
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.820
on or what device they're
on. They might be on

199
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.190
an old Android or an
old iPhone. Yeah. I mean,

200
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.330
we see a lot of
kids using maybe their parent's

201
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.930
device or a hammy down
device from their parents. So

202
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.290
our audience is not always
on the biggest fanciest machines.

203
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.240
You know, I was looking
around to see some of

204
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.860
the most creative examples of,
of games on roadblocks. And

205
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.960
I found one that I'm
not even sure if it's

206
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.320
real or not, but I
find this hilarious. It's an

207
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.920
article called how to pass
an interview on roadblocks. And

208
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.080
it makes me wonder, it's
got this wonderful little suit

209
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.960
person and it says, be
polite and show up on

210
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.600
time, look professional. And it's
got a little roadblocks person

211
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.080
in a suit I'm trying
to understand. Are people hosting

212
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.130
actual job interviews here? Or
is this a game that's

213
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.620
Funny? I haven't seen that
one. My guess would be

214
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.110
it's a game I haven't
heard of people hosting actual

215
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.810
job interviews on roadblocks. Although
our community of developers are

216
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.380
starting to create indie studios.
Essentially we're seeing teams of

217
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.140
five, or even up to
15 or 20 people working

218
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:17.410
together. That includes artists game
designers, software developers, and they

219
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.880
might be recruiting people on
roadblocks, Which just gets to

220
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.040
the point of it could
do anything, right. This is

221
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.160
a shared space. And within
the limits of the technology,

222
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.200
if certainly if someone wanted
to have an interview on

223
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.700
roadblocks, I don't see any
reason that they couldn't do

224
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.300
that for sure. Do people
speak to each other? Is

225
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.420
this, are you preventing? Like,
it seems like there's a

226
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.460
lot that my kids have
tried to say. And the

227
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.920
chat filter has prevented them
from saying, but you do

228
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.640
keep people off microphones. Right?
That's right. We have text

229
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.520
chat currently. We don't currently
have voice chat. Is that

230
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.260
a conscious thing? Or is
that like a limit of

231
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.200
technology? Like, it seems to
me like I was on

232
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.680
Xbox live very, very long
time ago. And frankly it's

233
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.080
been years since I turned
text chat on for anyone.

234
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.390
Who's not a friend because
I just don't trust people

235
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.540
to be kind. Yeah, that's
a, it's a priority so

236
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.700
far. I would say it's
something that we might consider

237
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.580
in the future, but it
really hasn't been a priority.

238
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.730
Our priority is helping people
have safe conversations and play

239
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.600
with their friends in productive
ways. Hey, friends, backlog is

240
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.720

L O g.com/hansel minutes. There's

252
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.720
a huge amount of other
websites around roadblocks. Like you

253
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.420
were mentioning that indie game
developers have found it as

254
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.430
an engine, and I'm seeing
tons of articles on designing

255
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.870
avatar clothing. There's Twitch channels
that aren't even dedicated on

256
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.930
how to play roadblocks. It's
all about building. It seems

257
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.250
like you're trying to shift
people from simple consumption where

258
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.490
they just mindlessly play a
game to really encouraging them

259
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:38.100
to create That's true. Well,
since we're our platform relies

260
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.760
on creators and a lot
of our creators start out

261
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.560
as players. So we've had
a longterm focus on making

262
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.460
sure that we're inspiring people
to create on our platform

263
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:55.580
and making easy tools for
them. Essentially, roadblocks offers as

264
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.320
many tools that you need
to get your game to

265
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.220
a worldwide audience. We have
a development studio, we do

266
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.410
distribution. So we can put
your games in front of

267
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.910
the right players. We allow
you to monetize your game

268
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.810
through end game purchases, and
we're even adding tools to

269
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:18.050
allow internationalization so free translation
tools as well as compliance

270
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.940
tools to be able to
sell your game in a

271
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.110
lot of different countries. Interesting.
So it's, it's not quite

272
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.850
an app store, but it
feels like an app store.

273
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.390
Really. It's an engine for
creation. Yeah. It's definitely an

274
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:33.580
engine for creation, a full
stack distribution. And I'm noticing

275
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.030
that the developer section of
roadblocks has really jumped in

276
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.900
the last couple of years.
If you go to developer.roadblocks.com,

277
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.500
you can go to the
sophistication level of as high

278
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.360
as you want. Like I've
got my 11 year old

279
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.050
playing around in roadblock studio,
but I also see like

280
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.470
here's a German developer. That's
built their whole career on

281
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.860
top of roadblocks. There's a,
there's a developer conference now.

282
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.600
So, you know, grown people
can make and make stuff

283
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.290
on roadblocks and experience roadblocks
as well. Yes. Yes. It's

284
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.960
not just for kid. In
fact, we're seeing almost half

285
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.510
of our players are over
13, so we're definitely seeing

286
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.480
a lot of teenage players,
even college age players and

287
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.320
grownup players start to enjoy
the content on roadblocks. And

288
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.160
another cool thing is as
our developer community widens, we're

289
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.550
seeing more diverse types of
people creating experiences, which is

290
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.000
also pretty exciting. We have
international developers that are very

291
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.390
successful. Now. We've got a
lot of female teams that

292
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.990
are developing games and it's
really, really cool to see

293
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.900
everybody being able to have
a voice on the platform

294
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.500
and share their imagination. So
what do you think is

295
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.410
a risk though? Like you've
got this, this, this car

296
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.910
that's barreling down the, the,
the freeway here and it's

297
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.390
dramatically successful, but now you
have a growing, I was

298
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.660
going to say aging, but
the correct word, growing a

299
00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.280
user base of, of folks
that are building around this,

300
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.990
how do you make sure
that it's still going to

301
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.810
be accessible to the, to
the, to the tweens? Well,

302
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.060
one way is widening the
types of things you can

303
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.420
create. And this is one
area that's really cool in

304
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.900
the past year. We've enabled
people to start creating avatar

305
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.630
items, which are a lot
less complicated than a whole

306
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.390
game. So you can create
a cool hat or a

307
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.660
cool hairstyle and start to
sell that, which is possibly

308
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.270
a little lower barrier to
entry than a full fledged

309
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.470
game. So the more stepping
stones like that we have,

310
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.020
where you can create a,
an avatar item, you can

311
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.690
create a S a hangout
space. You can create a

312
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.560
full fledged game. The more
we'll be able to tap

313
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.220
into people at various skill
levels. That's a really good

314
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.820
point. And I'm here in
roadblocks studios right now. And

315
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.970
certainly you can start in
a Tron like virtual world,

316
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.350
nothing with a base plate,
but it's actually, it's kind

317
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.320
of cool. The templates scale,
like the game scale. So

318
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.410
it's like, alright, here's some
grass go nuts, or here's

319
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.800
a castle, or let's just
start with, you know, destroy

320
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:06.420
this, create and destroy this
whole town. And my 11

321
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.480
year old is certainly differently,
sophisticated than my 13 year

322
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.270
old. And they've been able
to go and create infinite

323
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:16.830
runners or, or just wandering
around like Zelda type games.

324
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.630
It's interesting. The idea that
they could monetize though. I,

325
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.400
I'm not sure what I
feel like about that. I

326
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.460
suppose they could even make
t-shirts for their, for their

327
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.740
school and they could have
their peer group be in

328
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.760
there. Yeah, you can, you
can sell to you. I

329
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.150
can sell virtual t-shirts on
roadblocks and almost anybody can

330
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.510
do that. So you're creating
an economy. What are the,

331
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.920
the Robux? Is this like,
is this real money? How

332
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.080
are you, how does that
translate? Is there a currency

333
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:50.090
conversion? Yeah, there's a currency
conversion. You buy Robux from

334
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.640
Roblox or with a gift
card or something like that.

335
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.480
And when a developer or
creator sells an item, they

336
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.940
earn Robux and they can
cash that out for real

337
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.760
money. You have to earn
a certain amount before you're

338
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.890
allowed to cash out. You
can't cash out like 50 cents,

339
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.560
but we do have a
lot of people that are

340
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.740
earning money and cashing out
Robux every month. In fact,

341
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.100
the top developers can make
millions of dollars every month,

342
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.570
Really amazing. And to be
clear, as we said, when

343
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:21.080
inclusion means every platform, like
when I'm here in roadblock

344
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.630
studio and I'm moving around
inside of create and destroy,

345
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.180
I can publish this and
it will work on a

346
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.850
low end iPhone, and it
will work on a full

347
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.470
PC. Yeah. You can publish
a game to Xbox in

348
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.640
minutes. That is really interesting
because, you know, being able

349
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.370
to go and publish a
game under the guise of

350
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.310
another publisher really opens up
something that would not be

351
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.860
opened up to, to my,
to my kids until they

352
00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.120
were quite a bit older,
certainly to become a, an

353
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.330
iPhone developer or an Xbox
developer would be a nontrivial

354
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.830
amount of complexity for them
to be able to pull

355
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.160
off. Yep. And a lot
of times, you know, your

356
00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.840
first game, you might just
want to share with some

357
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.500
friends or share with maybe
a community or forum. And

358
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.380
so we also give people
ways to see what their

359
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.920
friends are creating quickly, visit
that through your profile. I

360
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.470
really like that idea too,
because like, I know that

361
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.810
my 11 year old wants
to make a Twitch channel

362
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.480
and become the next Ninja.
I think all 11 year

363
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.550
olds do, which, which I
need to explain to them,

364
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.760
that's really not a career.
You know, it's actually hard

365
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.360
work. It is amazing. They
are disappointed when they can't

366
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.120
make a roadblocks game in
just five minutes. It's like,

367
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.120
well, you can't just republish
the existing template. My friend,

368
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.800
you know, I'd like you
to put some amount of

369
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.910
effort into the thing I'm
looking here. You've got animation

370
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.820
packs as well. So they
could spend their money to

371
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.870
jumpstart their game by including
different items within the game.

372
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.550
And then republishing that, sharing
it with friends and they

373
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.900
don't have to publish it
publicly. Right. They can just

374
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.430
share with their peer group.
I think most games are

375
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:57.480
publicly available. It's much easier
to discover games from your

376
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.120
friends. Oh, I see. So
if you know what to

377
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.850
look for, you can find
anyone's game. But the idea

378
00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.460
would be that if your
friends games are front and

379
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.180
center yeah. Is it true
that there are millions of

380
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.750
games or is that just
marketing hype? There are millions

381
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.710
of games because millions of
people have done probably the

382
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.260
first steps, which is opening
up that base plate and,

383
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.140
and doing a couple of
things on publishing them. We

384
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.400
have probably hundreds of thousands
of games that people have

385
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.640
put in several, you know,
like many hours to build.

386
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.130
So yes, millions of games,
but a lot of them

387
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.090
are, are very basic and
hundreds of thousands of games

388
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.370
that involve a lot of
thought and effort. Right. Right.

389
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.940
Exactly. As we say, long
tail is long. Yes. But

390
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.340
there is a huge amount
of games. Like there are

391
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.900
easily visually thousands and thousands
of games of high quality

392
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.080
and high quality by saying
they, you know, I think

393
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.300
a good example of quality
on roadblocks is the effort

394
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.330
that one puts into the,
the tile that represents the

395
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.870
game, the icon that reports
the game. That's true. You

396
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.070
know, if they, if they
went and they drew a

397
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.350
tile, then they put some,
they put some work into

398
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.320
these games, Right. I've probably
made three or four games

399
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.500
myself, but I haven't made
an actual tile. That's the

400
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.390
telling you all the good
tips on how to be.

401
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.110
It's so interesting though. There's
like games, I've got, you

402
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.250
got saber simulators. So like
let's burn things with a

403
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.490
saber. And like let's adopt
a piece of furniture is

404
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.240
like apparently extremely popular right
now. It's such a diversity

405
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.730
of, of games. This reminds
me a little bit kind

406
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.400
of, of the, we hear
about like the deep web,

407
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.070
right? Not the dark web,
the deep web, it's the

408
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.480
web that you can't Google,
where once you enter roadblocks

409
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.810
within there, there are millions
of things, but it would

410
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.680
be difficult to determine without
actually entering roadblocks. How big

411
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.140
this thing is. It's I
feel like when I entered,

412
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.400
I've discovered the, this huge
iceberg of stuff that was

413
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:59.340
not easily searchable without limitless
world feeling. Yeah. Am I

414
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.580
to understand that it also
has a virtual reality component?

415
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.420
Yes. We have designed roadblocks
and built roadblocks to be

416
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.200
available in VR. It's not
a giant platform for us,

417
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.230
so we're not doing a
ton there, but all the

418
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.840
experiences work in VR, you
can put on a headset

419
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.350
and go around the pizza
place or the cops and

420
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.670
robbers game and it works
and it's all 3d natively.

421
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.270
So it's essentially built for
VR. We just haven't seen

422
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.930
a ton of customers actually
using that yet. Yeah, it

423
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.540
does definitely seem like VR
is in an unusual place

424
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.550
right now. And that roadblocks
would be well-positioned if it

425
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.670
ever does pop, if we
can take a phone and

426
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.100
put it on our eyes
very easily, the potential is,

427
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.250
is, is huge. But even
my children have not expressed

428
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.220
a huge amount of in
VR. It just makes them

429
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.520
nauseous. But again, one of
the cool things that we're

430
00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:53.080
building is a platform that
literally runs everywhere on every

431
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.200
device available. And so we
spend a lot of time,

432
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.020
you know, building the technology
to make that possible and

433
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.630
make it easy. And so
we're going to support VR

434
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.690
hardware along with all the
other hardware that's out there

435
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.120
that people play games on.
Right. And being able to

436
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.810
support anything, not just any
device, but any, any kind

437
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.950
of concept you can also,
I suppose, build a curriculum

438
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.400
around this from schools or
schools, building economic curriculums about

439
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.040
how to, you know, trade
items, how to, how, how

440
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.860
this currency conversion works. Have
you seen pickup in schools?

441
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.130
I would love to see
an economic curriculum. That's awesome.

442
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.790
We've seen coding. So software
pickup. So roadblocks is a

443
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:36.190
great platform to learn coding.
Our, our games are all

444
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.100
built and scripted in Lua,
which is a really good

445
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.360
beginner language. And it's interesting
because we're in, in fact

446
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.660
building our entire application platform
on Lewis as well, we're

447
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.200
building on the exact same
tools that the game developers

448
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.320
use. So the roadblock studio
is built in Lewa and

449
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.750
our mobile app and Xbox
app are built in Lua

450
00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.770
as well. This is making
us really invest in really

451
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:03.250
robust tools for development in
this language. It's a really

452
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:08.320
interesting problem because it's not
typically a language that big

453
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.190
tech companies use. And so
we're really able to invent

454
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.970
the exact tools that we
need to solve the exact

455
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.600
problems that we're facing. It's
a pretty exciting and pretty

456
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.150
bold direction for the company
to go. Yeah. I think

457
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.730
that there's a lot of
excitement around Lua in gaming

458
00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.700
right now. I had some
folks on recently from the

459
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.170
Pico eight tiny, tiny, tiny
game development in Lewa as

460
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.550
well. And there seems to
be a bit of a

461
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.520
Lua Renaissance happening. Cause it's
such an accessible language. It's

462
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.850
almost like it's almost like
the basic of the eighties

463
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.400
except it's 2019 and people
find it to be extremely

464
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.850
accessible. Yeah. And it's, it's
also nice because you don't

465
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.880
need to compile so you
can sort of immediately see

466
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.870
the fruits of your labor.
Yeah. And I'm looking if

467
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.770
we go to again to
developer.roadblocks.com right off the bat,

468
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.440
there's a section here on
the roadblocks client server model.

469
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.050
So you're able to go
and write this Lua and

470
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.180
express what you need to
express in the client and

471
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.730
on the server. And a
lot of the remoting is

472
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.430
just, is just handled for
you very, very nicely. And

473
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.240
the kids only have to
learn the one language and

474
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:18.040
they are now suddenly distributed
globally distributed client server developers.

475
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:22.270
Yeah. It's pretty cool. Yeah.
And then when they create

476
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.220
their, again, you put it
out at scale when they

477
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.280
create their sound, their music
and their graphics, you're handling

478
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.950
the optimization to make sure
that their stuff looks great

479
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.980
everywhere. And even though there
are sections on game performance,

480
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.850
I'm not seeing it. A
lot of the tutorials, examples

481
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.760
on how to make it
look great everywhere roadblocks, the

482
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.320
engine just takes care of
that. That's right. We, we

483
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.210
do things like, you know,
downloading the games in a

484
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.230
very smart way. We do
things like rendering the graphics

485
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.310
at different levels of detail
so that it performs well.

486
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.760
We do a lot of
the motion and animation and

487
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.790
physics. So we really spend
a lot of time building

488
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.870
out these systems and then
making it really easy for

489
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.700
the developers to access them.
What is something that has

490
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.930
happened on roadblocks or something
that was built where you

491
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:18.170
or someone went back to
the developers or, and said,

492
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.750
I did not know this
was possible. This is pushing

493
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.810
this, this thing we built
way further than we ever

494
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.360
planned for it to happen.
Well, I think we definitely

495
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.470
see that with the number
of people playing games. Some

496
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:35.120
of our top games now
have billions of plays. And

497
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.850
I think that's probably more
like, I think we would

498
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.890
have been very happy to
have roadblocks have billions in

499
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.410
plays at a certain point
in time. Then now it's

500
00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:46.490
within our games. Our top
one has 8 billion, 8 billion in

501
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.220
a single game. And again,
long tail is long, but

502
00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.220
the, the, the, the level
of enthusiasm and repeat visitors

503
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.920
is massive. Yeah. Yeah. I've
been noticing as well. Things

504
00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.390
that I did not know
were going to be possible

505
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.820
because you pointed out that
is just largely a 3d

506
00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.570
game. Although certainly it folks
have the other, the ability

507
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.630
to make two D games,
but there's also story games.

508
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.210
And there's a great section
called the creator challenge on

509
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:16.760
the developer.robot.com where we're effectively
doing like old fashion text

510
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.160
games except in a three
D environment where the person

511
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.470
runs up like to a
book and then interacts with

512
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.480
the book. I would not
have thought that would have

513
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.120
been possible because the first
game that I saw was

514
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.040
cops and robbers. Yeah. Another
interesting one, people have created

515
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.900
some real life locations. Like
somebody created a virtual version

516
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.980
of Disneyland that you can
run around. People have created

517
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.510
like just really cool, very
high fidelity scenes. There's a,

518
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.230
a bunch of games that
often use the word showcase

519
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.420
in their title. So if
you search for showcase on

520
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.090
roadblocks, you see some of
the people that are kind

521
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.510
of pushing the graphics kind
of to the max and

522
00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:01.550
they have these really beautiful
immersive scenes of houses or

523
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.400
islands where you can explore
that have just really high

524
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.410
fidelity, beautifully crafted graphics. Yeah.
That's a really important thing

525
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.510
that if you're a parent
or if you're even not

526
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.310
a parent, you want to
play a fun game that

527
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.730
I admit that when I
saw the graphics and roadblocks,

528
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.700
I was dismissive. I thought,
though, this is cute. You

529
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.520
know, this is primitive, but
some of the things that

530
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.390
are happening are truly graphically
intensive and amazing. And it

531
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.210
does scale. I've got a
very high end gaming PC,

532
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:32.690
and I have a great
experience at 4k full screen

533
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.140
on a big machine, looking
at like running around the

534
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.880
roadblocks ultimate SIEM park, which
is a great example or

535
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.410
a complete model of studios.
And it, it does push

536
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.110
the machine and I don't
feel like you have to,

537
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.140
and don't be dismissive of
what might seem like simplistic

538
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.350
graphics. It is really extraordinary.
What do you think that

539
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.710
someone should do if they're
listening to this podcast and

540
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.340
maybe they've thought about other
creator type games and they're,

541
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.310
you know, we hear about
Minecraft, it's the big elephant

542
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.500
in the room. What is
the difference? How do you

543
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.260
differentiate roadblocks from something like
Minecraft or some of the

544
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.060
other big creator games? Roadblocks
makes it a little easier

545
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.390
to explore the worlds that
people have created since it's

546
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:20.340
all on one platform. Roadblocks
is also more social. In

547
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.010
my opinion, it's a little
bit easier to connect with

548
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:27.120
your friends and do things
together, including create together, which

549
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.830
is one of the most
exciting and fun things to

550
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:32.220
do on our platform. I
was going to say, it

551
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.160
feels like the, also the
ability to write the code

552
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.710
very quickly and then run
into the game and play

553
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.020
with it and then switch
back and forth. I see

554
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.660
that my kids have created
a lot of physical world

555
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.750
on, on Minecraft, but they
haven't actually done anything with

556
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.380
any interactivity. They haven't made
any, they haven't changed the

557
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.710
laws of physics. You know
what I mean? Yeah, yeah.

558
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.080
That's right. Yeah. Being able
to go into a game

559
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.030
and say, I want to
make a, you know, like

560
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.190
a lightsaber simulator or a
shooting game, or just walk

561
00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.370
around a city. Well that
they enjoy Minecraft. And they

562
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:05.550
find it to be different,
very, very different from roadblocks.

563
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.760
They definitely, the kids understand
the difference to be able

564
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.650
to go and go into
a world, hanging out with

565
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:15.080
their friends and not necessarily
be limited by the, the

566
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.300
environment around Right. You get
to create your own environment.

567
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:22.050
So folks can go to
roadblocks.com. It's in every app

568
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.530
store it's on the windows
app store iOS, Google play.

569
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.500
What's the smallest tiniest requirement.
Like what was, I could

570
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.570
do this on an iPhone
four, I suppose, or anything

571
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.120
that I could find in
the app. Yeah. I think

572
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.530
it's I phone for, for
sure. Any PC about any

573
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:42.450
PC, any tablet, fire tablet.
Really? Yeah. Yeah. We are

574
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.920
not yet on PlayStation. We're
not yet on Nintendo or

575
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.470
on Xbox in terms of
consoles and someday we'd like

576
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.800
to be everywhere. Fantastic. Well,
I really appreciate you chatting

577
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.460
with me, Kelly amaze about
building, you know, you called

578
00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:01.470
it digital civility and social
citizenship. Yeah. Thank you. It

579
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.840
was a fun chat. This
has been another episode of

580
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:21.090
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week. <inaudible>.
