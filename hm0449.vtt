from Hansel minutes dot gong
it's Hansel minutes, a weekly

9
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.770
discussion with web developer and
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is

10
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.360
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number four
49. In this episode, Scott

11
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.210
talks with musician Samis, AKA
in ongo Lumumba. Kasongo about

12
00:01:06.210 --> 00:02:03.180
balancing a music career and
a PhD. <inaudible>. Hi, this

13
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.340
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

14
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.850
and on Skype right now.
I am talking with <inaudible>

15
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.730
who is a fourth year
PhD student at Cornell in

16
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.330
science and technology studies. How
are you? I'm doing wonderfully.

17
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.880
How are you? I'm thrilled
to talk to you right

18
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.520
now because you are a
double threat, triple threat, not

19
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.610
just a PhD student, but
also a very accomplished nerd

20
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.100
core musician. Yes. Thank you.
I haven't, I think formally

21
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.680
been called the triple threat
yet, but it's great to

22
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.320
hear. Yeah, you have a
lot of things going on

23
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.060
and we only have so
long to talk about it.

24
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.880
So let's start with the
PhD. Explain to me what

25
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.630
this specialization is. So it
is the field of science

26
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.570
and technology studies. And as
we chatted about a little

27
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.050
bit before, it's a little
bit obscure, but essentially it's

28
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.040
thinking about science and technology
in different kinds of ways.

29
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.480
So typically these subjects have
been looked at in sort

30
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.700
of a black box. We
take things for granted. We

31
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.320
assume science is represents sort
of an objective perspective, and

32
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.100
this field is about tearing
those ideas apart and thinking

33
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.460
about how we even come
to a place where we

34
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.060
have those assumptions around science
and technology. So my specific

35
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.450
area of research is sound
technologies and thinking about sort

36
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.250
of the black boxes that
exist there, The sound technology

37
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.830
itself is a pretty broad
area. I mean, there's how

38
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.050
our brains process at how
it's thought about as a

39
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.080
physical or an aspect of
physics. There's how computers think

40
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.630
about sound. What aspects of
it are you tearing down?

41
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.470
So I'm interested in thinking
about how we talk about

42
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.100
the idea of quality as
it relates to sound specifically

43
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.270
in my dissertation. What I'm
thinking about is how individuals

44
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.130
in particular studio contexts identify
and determine what counts as

45
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.070
good quality versus bad quality
and how that's actually very

46
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.400
complex. And there's not sort
of an easy way of

47
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.590
parsing out what that means
and that it has different

48
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.400
violences to different individuals. So
really knowledge formation around sort

49
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.620
of issues of determining how
sound is evaluated. So is

50
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.020
that the sense of quality
in that? You know, this

51
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.260
is a quality recording, or
I prefer the sound quality

52
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.930
of a vacuum tube receiver
versus a digital one. And

53
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.020
all of those kinds of
things. It's all, all of

54
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.220
the below were all of
the above. It. What I

55
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.890
have already kind of looked
at as it relates to

56
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.760
my dissertation has focused a
lot around sort of microphones

57
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.950
and how individuals the studios
will make determinations about, you

58
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.090
know, how a microphone produces
a better quality sound and

59
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.400
where those assumptions are coming
from. And a lot of

60
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.400
it has to do with
perceptions that are outside of

61
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.100
sort of actually what the
individual is hearing and more,

62
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.580
you know, what the, the
sort of weight of the

63
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.700
brand carries like, Oh, it's
that type of microphone. Therefore

64
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.640
it must produce this kind
of quality sound. And so

65
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.390
I'm thinking about how those
labels are attached to, you

66
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.680
know, particular kinds of microphones.
Interesting. On the other side,

67
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.380
not just microphones, but also
headphones there's. There was an

68
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.350
interesting blind study. I thought
just a few weeks ago

69
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.290
about people heard that it
was a beats microphone, and

70
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.990
then suddenly they felt like
it had better sound quality,

71
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.640
but when they did a
blind study, it was not

72
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.440
Exactly that that's exactly. I
think what I'm trying to

73
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.170
get at is that we
have these perceptions about what

74
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.030
counts and what, what you
know, becomes popular and what

75
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.430
is sort of the go
to where the black box

76
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.550
kind of Mike are kind
of headphones and why that

77
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.930
happens. Can those things can
sound quality, B B objectively

78
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.120
expressed. I mean, is there
a way of mathematically to

79
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.420
say, I don't care what
your brain says, that's simply

80
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.850
better. And if you think
it's better, you're still wrong

81
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.860
because the math backs me
up. I think, I mean,

82
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.920
there are algorithms, there are,
there's even a program. Now

83
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.060
I believe that you can
use to have your, if

84
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.790
you have a song, it
can be mastered by using

85
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.280
like an algorithm that doesn't
have to be, have any

86
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.670
type of like human intervention.
So I think in that

87
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.730
context, someone might say, yes,
this is objective, really a

88
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.750
better sounding, you know, piece
of music. But even that,

89
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.340
you know, the idea that
quote unquote lo-fi is, you

90
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.610
know, lower quality. I think
there are people who would

91
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.950
contest that. I think there
are people who really like

92
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.340
the sound of like cassettes.
I've been to some rap

93
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.070
shows where people only sell
their music via cassette or

94
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.410
only via vinyl, or only
via certain kinds of like

95
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.010
sound technologies. And that's because
they value whatever that sound

96
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.520
is. And it's not necessarily
always Hi-Fi. So I would

97
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.010
say that, no, there's not
really an objective way of

98
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.060
talking about sound quality. It
really does your, your background,

99
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.230
your ideas about certain things,
color, your understanding of what

100
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.300
counts as good and bad
quality. I was at a,

101
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.080
a conference just a couple
of days ago and unrelated

102
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.930
to the preparation for this
interview. I was thinking about

103
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.630
you because I saw an
album released that I thought

104
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.210
you would get a kick
out of a individual was

105
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.360
releasing his album, brand new
album of techno music, but

106
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.480
was only releasing it on
NES cartridges. Wow. That's pretty

107
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.750
incredible. That's like really niche.
Cause I thought cassettes were

108
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.500
crazy, but completely Legit. I
mean, he was selling full

109
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.290
on, you know, you know,
three D printed NES cartridges

110
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.900
and inside he had a
custom EEPROM that he had

111
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.940
set up, you put the
cartridge in and it gives

112
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.670
you kind of a, almost
like an eight bit Zune

113
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.890
music, kind of a layout
and lets you go forward

114
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.180
and backward throughout a, a,
an eight track EAP. And

115
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.030
it was done entirely through
the audio of the NES,

116
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.580
which he insisted was the
best way to experience his

117
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.300
music. That's absolutely incredible. And
exactly what I'm, I think

118
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.270
I'm trying to get at
and make sense of that.

119
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.380
We have these very different
ways of thinking about what

120
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.080
counts as like the best
medium and people are really

121
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.890
attached to those. I think
any generation and I'm, I'm

122
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.500
reaching the age where I'm
starting to have my, you

123
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.580
know, back in my day
type of conversations, but I

124
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.330
think people really do feel
very strongly about the medium

125
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.280
that they listened to as
a child or as a

126
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.760
teenager, it evokes something more
than just good quality, bad

127
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.100
quality. There's like a, a
sense that goes with it

128
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.450
of, of your time and
your surroundings. So one interesting

129
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.430
thing that surprised me at
this conference is I picked

130
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.670
up a thing called a
Retron five. It's a retro

131
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.250
arcade. It's kind of like
a snack emulator, but it's

132
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.130
hardware. Are you familiar with
this? No, I'm not at

133
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.560
all. Oh, you're going to
love this. So this is,

134
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.600
you know, I'm sure we've
all done emulators. We've seen

135
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.900
online emulators. They are in
a very legal gray area

136
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.560
and, and by gray, meaning
completely not great at all.

137
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.920
So a restaurant is a
physical of hardware that lets

138
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.030
us play NES or Sega
or Jay five, six, 10

139
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.460
different kinds of cartridges. So
I pick up this Retron

140
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.850
five and I'm starting to
learn about it and I

141
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.680
have to go home and
flash the firmware. But now

142
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.100
I'm actually playing my real,
you know, NES and sniffs

143
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.330
cartridges. So it's fantastic that
my sons love it, but

144
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.380
the sound isn't quite right.
There's a restaurant. Yeah. There's

145
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.370
a restaurant three, which is
the inexpensive $30 one and

146
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.610
the restaurant five, which has
five slots. That's why they

147
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.980
call it the five and
it's got 10 different it'll

148
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.930
play game, boy color. It'll
play all sorts of different

149
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.020
stuff. Here's the thing though.
It doesn't sound right. The

150
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.940
three doesn't sound right. The
five does sound right. So

151
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.250
I go online wondering if
there's just a fixed and

152
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.300
I find huge message boards
and threads filled with people

153
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.170
talking about how the sound
on the three doesn't feel.

154
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.040
Right. And they don't know
why you would love this.

155
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.010
And someone actually found a
way to hack it at

156
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.950
a capacitor and change the
flavor of the sound on

157
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.560
the, on this device so
that it felt the way

158
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.420
they wanted it to feel.
And everyone else was like,

159
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.700
Oh, give me the plans
for that chip. That is

160
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.790
beyond fascinating for a number
of reasons. But I think

161
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.850
what's, what's the most interesting
to me is it seems

162
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.210
like people couldn't quite put
their finger on what was

163
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.220
missing. Like when you heard
it or when you listened

164
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.010
to it, can you identify
what it was that was

165
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.370
just off, You know, that's
the thing, right? It's like,

166
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.210
there are people who could
be really excellent, New York times

167
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.210
food critics and they have
all the right adjectives that

168
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.610
are ready. And there are
the people who like their,

169
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.460
their Crutchfield audio magazine who
say that, you know, this

170
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.130
warmth that drops out at
the low end. I have

171
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.080
no idea what those words
are. The words are not

172
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.930
in my mouth. You know,
I'm sure they're in yours.

173
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.970
What's interesting, I think is
that even trained audio engineers,

174
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.010
I've actually been reading a
lot about this because I

175
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.300
recently took qualifying exams, but
on some of the same

176
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.380
material, but they also struggle
with what, how to talk

177
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.770
about sound. It's still, I
think something, even for people

178
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.400
who have like very refined
ears, have they have a

179
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.060
difficult time, not just kind
of quantifying, but really articulating

180
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.090
like what, what a sound
is or what the quality

181
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.700
about a sound is that
makes it that sound so

182
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.000
you're not alone. Yeah, absolutely.
I think that at some

183
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.710
point these individuals were just
pulling out the know, pulling

184
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.510
out the volt meter and
just saying, you know, this

185
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.520
is how it ought to
be. And maybe looking at

186
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.730
their civil scopes and they
they're, it's an art though.

187
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.230
And this is an interesting
thing. And why I wanted

188
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.600
to talk to you is
that I feel like what

189
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.970
you're doing is a PhD
that has a foot in

190
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:40.490
art and a foot in
science. Yes. I actually just

191
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.970
talked about that today. We
had a, a colloquium, a

192
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.360
speaker who was interested actually
in something very kind of

193
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.820
different. I'd never encountered this
before. Maybe you have, but

194
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:56.680
this whole I'm thinking about
plants as being able to,

195
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.880
I don't even know how
to describe it, but, but

196
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.780
plants having the same sort
of capacities as sort of

197
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.710
humans and animals to like
respond to environments and how

198
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.500
that's really being taken very
seriously by a lot of

199
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.900
scientists now and how artists
have also tried to think

200
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.080
about how we can incorporate
a more holistic idea of

201
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.580
what it means to be
a plant and how a

202
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.610
plant senses things. And so
I was curious about whether

203
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.200
there were tensions between scientists
and artists, because in some

204
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.990
of the research that I've
done or that I've, I've

205
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.590
come across, there have been
tensions where scientists feel like

206
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.990
art artists, having their field
be affiliated with art, takes

207
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.040
away some of the sort
of scientific legitimacy. But what

208
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.350
I'm really interested in is
I think walking this middle

209
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.490
line between thinking about art
and how people determine what

210
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.620
is good art and bad
art and how that is

211
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.640
mapped onto a scientific context
like objectively, what makes something

212
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.610
quote unquote, have good quality,
bad quality, sound good, sound

213
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.300
bad. Well, there's been a
lot of talk in the

214
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.430
scientific community about why have
we been siloing? So many

215
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.310
things, you know, everyone likes
to have their niche, so

216
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.440
they just draw a box
around it and they point

217
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.550
at it and they say,
that's this that's that's entomology.

218
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.710
And this is the study
of, and you can't add

219
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.750
anything else. Well, that's why
I'm an expert in this.

220
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.690
You can't your space. Doesn't
intersect, right? There's no intersectionality

221
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:30.270
at all. Yep. And there's,
I think within academia more

222
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.780
broadly, there's always this sort
of anxiety around labels because

223
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.500
they're, they're really important when
it comes to getting funding

224
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.650
for things like people want
to be able to identify

225
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.440
what your product is, what
are you talking about and

226
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.450
who does it affect? And,
and they want to have

227
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.430
a nice way of thinking
about it. And even in

228
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.010
terms of framing your department,
you have to have a

229
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.560
way to market it. Like,
what are you, what are

230
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.470
you trying to have kids
walk out of your program

231
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.410
with? And I think particularly
for a field like mine,

232
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.930
we have to really think
a lot about this because

233
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.410
science and technology studies is
not something that I think

234
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.670
high school students come into
college knowing even exists. And

235
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.080
so we have to do
a lot of work in

236
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.720
the way of like defining
what this field is and

237
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.970
why it's interesting and why
kids should be involved so

238
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.430
we can have majors. So
we can, you know, put

239
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.470
people on the job market.
So people will invest in

240
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.630
it and, and we'll get
funding and stuff like that.

241
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.460
But there is also this
unease with defining what your

242
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.190
field is or what your
niche is, because then, you

243
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.080
know, there's no wiggle room.
There was no elbow room

244
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.720
for trying to do things
that might fall outside of

245
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.940
that purview. Right. And the
labels and the institutions put

246
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.680
up over the last, you
know, 50 to a hundred

247
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.040
years really want you to
study and explore in this

248
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.800
way. And if you start
to take two pieces of

249
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.720
the world and tie a
string between them and say,

250
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.680
look, these are connected. And
they've always been connected. The

251
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.330
system is set up to
say no to actually they'd

252
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.850
never been connected and it's
unacceptable for you to do

253
00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:02.050
this. Yeah. I feel like
in conversation that that is

254
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.230
something that I, at least
in my department and in,

255
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.240
in a lot of the
different, with a lot of

256
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.360
the different sort of social
science quote unquote and humanities,

257
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.330
PhD students I've talked with,
I think they are very

258
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.690
attuned to the different connections
between different fields, but it's

259
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.630
really hard in practice. Even
talking to some of my

260
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.570
like friends who have applied
for grants, when they try

261
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.540
to say, Hey, my work
is interdisciplinary. The people they're

262
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.360
writing to might be coming
from a sociology background or

263
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.280
an anthropology background, and they
don't want to see the

264
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.100
other stuff, they want to
see their field reflected. And

265
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.250
why does your thing matter
for their field? So it's,

266
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.580
it's tough. I think trying
to walk that middle line

267
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.930
between saying something definitive for
a specific audience, and then

268
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.760
making claims that lots of
different people can sort of,

269
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.170
that can be receptive to
it. It seems like academia

270
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:59.050
has a sense of coopertition.
I mean, you ultimately are

271
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:04.450
in competition for grant money.
Oh, completely. Yeah. It's and

272
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:09.160
it's, it's only gotten crazier,
which is part, I won't,

273
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.330
I won't say that when
I started doing music, it

274
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.830
was like, Oh, I gotta
have to have a side

275
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.420
project, or I have to
have some other thing that

276
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.370
I'm doing because I, you
know, in fact started doing

277
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.270
music before moving into the
PhD, but it is nice.

278
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.820
At least for me to
know that I have this

279
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.390
whole other skill set because
the job market for PhD

280
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.220
students is insane right now.
So it's like having a

281
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.010
side gig or a side
project is a really, really

282
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.050
good thing to have as
a student. I think right

283
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.990
now, I assume it would
keep you sane. It keeps

284
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.290
you saying, but I think
also gives you skills that

285
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.290
you might not pick up
in. Like there's, there's a

286
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.220
lot of stuff, a lot
of cool things that I'm

287
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.070
learning how to do that.
I would never have picked

288
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.040
up if I were just
sort of following the traditional

289
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.360
PhD student path. So you're
assigned project though, and this

290
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.830
is where I'm trying to
get my head around this.

291
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.460
It seems like pursuing a
PhD would be a full

292
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.150
time thing and having a
music career and going on

293
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.050
tour and recording music videos
and putting out a pretty

294
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.600
large at this point, a
pretty large body of work

295
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.640
is also a full time
job. How are you doing

296
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:24.190
two full time jobs? I
don't know. And I actually

297
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:31.060
recently I'm part of this
collective of basically nerd core

298
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.030
nerd core affiliated artists of
color who are just, you

299
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.850
know, trying to create a
sense of community and encourage

300
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.870
other people who are like
us and have similar concerns.

301
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:46.540
And so I wrote a
little article about that entitled,

302
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.270
like having infinite, not infinite
lives and essentially it's, it's

303
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.660
really, really difficult. It's not
at all easy. And I,

304
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.200
I often and feel sort
of paralyzed by the amount

305
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.060
of work that's required for
to maintain both of these

306
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.680
identities, but it, you know,
once I come down from

307
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.780
that and I'm like, okay,
I can't be paralyzed right

308
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.180
now. I find that I
just have to be really

309
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.240
strategic with time. So, you
know, when I have a

310
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.150
break, when I have like,
you know, fall break or

311
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.910
winter break, that's time to
do music. And you know,

312
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.420
other times it's time to
write a conference paper or,

313
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.810
you know, prepare something for
a class. So it just

314
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.370
means being very, very strategic
with my time. And you

315
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.980
wrote that article for the
NPC collective, and we'll put

316
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.900
a link to that in
the show notes that was

317
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.780
written just last month. And
you talked about the stress

318
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.630
of not just being a
PhD student and being a

319
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.060
rapper and a producer, but
also you were an RA

320
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.760
and a manager at the
student center. I mean, you've

321
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.930
got several jobs. Yes, it's
a lot. And actually I

322
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.420
was speaking to a prospective
student today. I took her

323
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.510
out to dinner and we
both agreed that when we're

324
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.090
busier, I think we're more
efficient and we get more

325
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.260
things done. Like my first
year I'm getting the PhD.

326
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.540
I didn't have quite as
much on my plate. And

327
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.750
I think I was kind
of lost at least for

328
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.660
the first semester. I didn't,
wasn't really working on music

329
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.060
all that much. I actually,
at that point was kind

330
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.310
of thinking that I wasn't
going to do music anymore.

331
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.180
And it wasn't until I
became sort of busier that

332
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.310
I was like, okay, wait,
let me kind of focus

333
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.430
my time and my energies
strategically. And I found that

334
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.100
I was much more productive,
so it's a lot and

335
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.680
it's exhausting, but it keeps
me motivated. So your, your

336
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.400
alternate career, your alternate, your
alter ego is, is Samis.

337
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.200
Who is Sam is for
people who may not know

338
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.940
that name immediately. So Sam
is, is one of the,

339
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.350
I don't want to say
the earliest, but one of

340
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:51.410
the very early female characters
and certainly protagonists for the

341
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:57.440
system, Nintendo the original Nintendo
console. And she's part of

342
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.680
the franchise entitled Metroid, which
you may have heard of.

343
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.690
And essentially, and in this
game, in the game that

344
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:10.730
I'm sort of drawing on
for this influence, she runs

345
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.030
around this planet in this
big armor suit. And you

346
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.160
don't know that it's a
woman until she's beaten the

347
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.100
game, sorry, spoiler alert. If
we're planning on playing it.

348
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.000
And then at the end,
it's revealed that gasp. She's

349
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.690
a woman. And I think
when people, you know, if

350
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.360
people play it now, it
seems very dated even terms

351
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.150
of graphics and the way
the game plays out. But

352
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.210
for me as a child,
seeing that it really, really

353
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.750
changed my perspective because it,
it forced me to question

354
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.470
why I had sort of
naturally assumed that this character

355
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.260
was a man. I, I
really was sort of struck

356
00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.030
by that. I remember my
brothers being struck by that.

357
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.410
Well, so that's where the
character Sam misses and I

358
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.100
wanted to draw on her
subversion of, of gender roles

359
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.020
in my sort of ability
to produce beats that I

360
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.260
often receive pushback and questioning
about as it relates to

361
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.460
my gender. So Well. And
you, you touch on those

362
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.860
issues in some of your
music. A while. Again, I'll

363
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.720
put links to all of
this at the show notes.

364
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.980
And if you'll let me,
I'll put some of your

365
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.730
music as a backing track
at the end of the

366
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.170
chat here, but you talk
about it in some of

367
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.230
your songs. One of them
called a woman. I really,

368
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:24.450
really enjoyed your may Jemison
song, which is taken after

369
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.880
the name of the first
black female in space. Also

370
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.630
also a doctor who briefly
had a general practice and

371
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:35.310
one of my heroes and
your, your lyrics are really

372
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.430
dense. There's a lot going
on as with all good

373
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.460
rap and all good nerd
core, just when I've figured

374
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.980
out what the last line
means. You're already two lines

375
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.960
ahead and I'm having to
go back up on rap

376
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.700
genius to figure out, did
she say what I think

377
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.680
That's, that makes me so
happy. And that, that actually

378
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.580
makes it all worth it
because I'm not like a

379
00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:01.590
particularly prolific person. It takes
me a long time to

380
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.050
put things together because I
want it to be perfect.

381
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.030
And I want there to
be layers. I want it

382
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.250
to be dense. I want
to make sure that each

383
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.000
song has a lot going
on. So I'm like perfecting

384
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.990
every single rhyme, every single
word. So it, it makes

385
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.630
me so happy to hear
that you feel like there

386
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.510
is some quality or some
depth there because it's really,

387
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.290
really intentional on my part.
You know, that's a really

388
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.120
good way to put it.
I mean, I don't know

389
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.000
if intentionality is a, is
a straight up compliment, but

390
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.820
it is certainly intended as
one, just with just within

391
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.700
that single song, Mae Jemison,
you've got references to <inaudible>

392
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.970
to fifth element. You've got
references to Michael Jackson. And then

393
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.580
within a single line, you
referenced both the mother brain

394
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.500
from, from Metroid and final
fantasy seven, all in one

395
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.500
line. That's a lot. I
mean, I mean, I'm not

396
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.000
saying it's a lot of
work to listen to your

397
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.040
music, but it is a
lot of work to appreciate

398
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.700
your music. Wow. Thank you.
So, Oh my gosh. I'm,

399
00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.630
I'm getting emotional now because
I think about those moments

400
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.760
when I'm sitting on the
couch and like trying to

401
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.340
find the exact perfect way
to say what I'm saying.

402
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.850
And, and there's a lot
of insecurity that goes into

403
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.740
making music period and releasing
it. So you're sort of

404
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.820
after it's out there in
the universe, I think you

405
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.660
can never hear enough times
you succeeded or you did,

406
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.180
you did a good job,
or this person feels, you

407
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.210
know, that your, your work
is important or that it's

408
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.850
dense that there's something there.
I really do want to

409
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.330
have music that has substance
in like a, you know,

410
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.750
social conscious way, but also
in like a, I think

411
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.660
what you've been talking about
that there's just, there's layers.

412
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.380
There's something for people who
have really played games and

413
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.070
they can draw on those
references. And there's people who,

414
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.220
you know, haven't necessarily played
games, but they know Michael Jackson,

415
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.160
I know Mae Jemison, you
know, I'm so happy that,

416
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.170
you know, you've picked up
on all of that. Thank

417
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.190
you. Oh, I'm glad. I'm
glad. I think that when

418
00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:01.900
people, people hear music and
they think, Oh, you know,

419
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:06.190
she's like me, you know,
I have the, I read

420
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.380
the same books. We watched
the same shows. We played

421
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.620
the same games. That's where
that emotional connection that happens

422
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.450
with music. I mean, a
good hook will get you

423
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.820
on the radio, but you
know, good lyrics will keep

424
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.390
you on the radio. Yes,
yes. And I firmly believe

425
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:23.380
that I'm really actually excited
about what's happening in hip

426
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:30.220
hop. I think for a
long time, there wasn't necessarily

427
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.260
a diversity of hip hop
in like mainstream, but I,

428
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.150
I do see that starting
to change. I do see

429
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.320
there being multiple different kinds
of rap that can exist

430
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.860
in a popular context. And
that's opening up the doors

431
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.760
for, I think like nerd
core music to grow. And

432
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.920
for that, that fan base
to exist in a more

433
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.460
prominent way, because there's people
who are talking about all

434
00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.670
kinds of things in rap
music. And it's, I think

435
00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.570
socially acceptable quote, unquote, to,
to talk about whatever you

436
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.660
want to talk about in
rap. Now, Do you think

437
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.940
that the name nerd core
that, that, that kind of

438
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.210
genre that sub sub genre
will, will be stifling at

439
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:15.070
some point? I think, I
think so. And I already,

440
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.940
I already have felt it
a little bit in terms

441
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.290
of people being confused with
how to market me, or

442
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:26.440
if they want to share
my music with a friend

443
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.540
or share my music with
like a blog or something

444
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.810
like that, there's always some
confusion about, well, what do

445
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.770
I say? How do I
categorize you? And I think

446
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.210
sometimes saying, Oh, she's nerd
core too, to other people

447
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.690
can mean, Oh, she just
talks about games, cartoons, and

448
00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:47.200
comic books or whatever. And
then you're missing this whole

449
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.930
other layer. And, and I
think that that's limiting for

450
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.050
a lot of nerd core
artists. Yes. They draw on,

451
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.710
you know, specific tropes and
ideas, but ultimately all of

452
00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.370
the music is really speaking
to, I think the whole

453
00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.640
human experience because games and
cartoons and video games are

454
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.720
talking to the human experience.
So I think that label

455
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.070
is it's great because it
draws people to your music.

456
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.070
People automatically are like, Oh,
she's into this type of

457
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.470
stuff. I can relate to
that. But on the other

458
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.750
hand, I do think that
a huge swath of the

459
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.120
population has just turned off
from it because they're like,

460
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.770
I'm not a nerd. I'm
not a geek. That's not

461
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.360
for me. Yeah. It does
seem like every niche that

462
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:33.130
is not pop music is
itself limiting just by virtue

463
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.740
of how it is labeled.
And, you know, someone could

464
00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.290
say, Oh yes, well, I
would definitely have Samis at

465
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.140
my nerd core, you know,
retro arcade event or at

466
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.760
my, maybe my, my company
in our company party. But,

467
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.890
you know, are we gonna
play her on Z 100?

468
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.700
Exactly. And there's, there's some
anxiety there with what to

469
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.090
do with me. And I
feel that sometimes even going

470
00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.200
to shows and performing, like
I've been, I've been blessed

471
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.290
to be able to perform
at, you know, quote unquote

472
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.280
nerd and geek functions that
are very specific, but other,

473
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.190
other venues, you know, bars
open mic nights and things

474
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.520
like that. And I'm always
thinking about my set list

475
00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.370
because there have been times
when I've performed songs and

476
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.190
been met with blank stares
because nobody knows what Metroid

477
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:24.170
is, you know? So it,
it's hard, I think, as

478
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:28.040
an artist, even in this
genre, because you find yourself

479
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:35.210
having to sometimes even produce
like two completely separate kinds

480
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:39.890
of music to a piece
to different audiences. Yeah. I

481
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.470
am not a musician, but
I, this will sound weird,

482
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.810
but I give a lot
of presentations and I am

483
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.930
effectively kind of known as
like standup comedy with PowerPoint.

484
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.580
So awesome. They're all kind
of like, you know, JavaScript

485
00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.180
virtual machines kind of like
cloud computing type things, but

486
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:58.640
they, they are, they are
known to be, I'm known

487
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.980
to be very funny for
those people who think I'm

488
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.550
funny, but I have to
have localized versions. You know,

489
00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.860
if I'm going to speak
in Sweden at a company,

490
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.270
I got to make sure
all the jokes are gonna

491
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.180
hit. You know, I could
see you like having the

492
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.880
explicit version in the clean
version and not just explicit

493
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.730
and clean, but like, this
is a bar in Nebraska

494
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.250
and this is downtown Chicago
and this is San Francisco

495
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.420
and a convention, same song,
three different lyrics. Yes. It's

496
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.130
really interesting that you mentioned
that. Cause I was having

497
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.490
a great conversation with a
friend recently about a sense

498
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.610
of humor and how, how
varied that is from place

499
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.790
to place and how some
things don't translate. I, I

500
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.220
love to chat with you
more about that. Actually your

501
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.270
experience, trying to like tailor
sense of humor or tailor

502
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.230
your presentations to reflect what's
funny somewhere and not somewhere

503
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.850
else. Cause I feel like
that would be really hard.

504
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.640
I'm pretty set in what
I think is funny. So

505
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.970
it might be difficult for
me to sort of adapt

506
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.490
to a different way of
thinking about what's funny and

507
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.100
what's not, but it's, it's
a similar thing with music

508
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.680
with the shows like, okay,
here I am in front

509
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.040
of four people who couldn't
care less, who Sam is,

510
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.890
is what am I going
to say to them? You

511
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.190
know? Yeah. There is a,
in all things, whether it

512
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.930
be art or music or
science, you have to kind

513
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.120
of fall back on what
is the universality of this

514
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.790
thing? What is it that,
you know, if you brought

515
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.800
up, if, you know, if
you're playing in Russia and

516
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.230
they don't know who may
Jemison is, is there a

517
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.440
may Jemison like archetype within
their space or is that

518
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.480
simply a song that will
never work for them because

519
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.860
they don't have that historical
context. Yeah. And I recently

520
00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.760
performed at geek girl con
and the Doubleclicks they performed

521
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.700
right before me. And they
actually recently wrote up a

522
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.650
blog post about what it's
like to tour. And I

523
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.140
think they, they had some
really helpful advice there because

524
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.830
they said that they specifically
go places where they know

525
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.980
that they can have conversation
with the audience because that's

526
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.890
really important to their whole
shtick and what they're doing.

527
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.010
And so I think as
I'm growing in my craft,

528
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.810
one thing I'm going to
have to start doing is

529
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:03.550
being not necessarily more selective,
but thinking more about what

530
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.970
my performance style is best
suited for. And I do

531
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.070
think that it's best suited
for a space where I

532
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.010
can have conversation or take
a break and talk a

533
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.170
little bit to the audience
and sort of a more

534
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.900
personalized thing. I don't think
I could ever do like

535
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.480
an arena show or something
like that. It just wouldn't

536
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.180
work for what I do
because so much of it

537
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.960
requires explanation and, and conversation.
Yeah. And, and, and even

538
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.390
though you might have in
your mind that the success

539
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.780
looks like 2000 people in
an arena, a more satisfying

540
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.090
feeling might be a hundred
people in a very intimate

541
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:41.310
venue. Oh yeah. Completely. And
as I'm getting older, I

542
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:45.660
think my ideas of success
are changing very, very much

543
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.750
so I don't, there was
never a point in my

544
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.180
life where I think I
wanted to be like famous.

545
00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.610
I think I always was
like, that's, that's a little

546
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.670
bit too much, but even
now I think what I

547
00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.660
would want is essentially what
has already happened is for

548
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.390
people to hear some of
my stuff and be affected

549
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.150
by it. And so I
can't really ask for much

550
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.540
more. Yeah. I think that
when people say I want

551
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.330
to be famous, I think
they're really saying, I want

552
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.150
to be appreciated. And if
you already have that, then

553
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:18.390
you, maybe you already are
famous. Exactly. You know, what

554
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.350
you, that was brilliant. That
was really brilliant. That's exactly

555
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.630
what I think I was
was, was trying to get

556
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.500
it, that I feel, I
feel everything that I think

557
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.260
people who are aspiring for
fame wants to feel. And

558
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.130
I think eventually realize that
they don't feel because it's

559
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.810
a different, it's a different
kind of beast. Having people

560
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:45.810
have sort of an expectations
for you that you can't

561
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:49.590
necessarily fulfill because you've become
like a character and not

562
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.550
a real person to them.
Right. Right. In the, in

563
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.820
the context of, of being
online the way I've usually

564
00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.710
thought about it. Like I
have a blog that's been

565
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.630
around for a long time
and I used to chase

566
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.370
page views. And I used
to think about it. Talk

567
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.980
about the page views and
page views. I realize it's

568
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.990
not about the page views.
It's about the comments. I

569
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.270
would much rather have 10
comments than a million page

570
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.840
views. Exactly. Exactly. Nothing is
sadder than a, than a

571
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.820
post with a million comp
with a million page views

572
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.220
and not a single person
commented. It's just like you

573
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.320
give a show 20,000 people
come and they all just

574
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.760
leave. There's no Encore. They're
like, that was it. Yeah.

575
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:27.660
That's, that's a really, I
like this, this conversation about

576
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.310
talking about your sort of
perspective on these things as

577
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.040
it relates to like internet
and your own work, because

578
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.500
it's, it's stuff that I
think about too, even going

579
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.990
to certain, you know, very
music blogs, they'll, nobody's leaving

580
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.220
comments, nobody's engaged, nobody's talking.
And so it's like, well,

581
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.490
what's the point of having
a million likes on Facebook

582
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:53.030
or, you know, 10,000 followers,
if nobody is engaging with

583
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.580
you. And I think a
lot of artists, companies, et

584
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.890
cetera, are running into a
brick wall because it, for

585
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.410
them, it's a numbers game
and it's really an engagement

586
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.460
thing. It is, it is.
And if you have a

587
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.630
music blog or a SoundCloud
track and no one's talking

588
00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.240
about it, they're just listening
and leaving. Do they even

589
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.780
really exist? Yeah. You know,
there's, if a tree falls

590
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.950
in the forest, right. That's
exactly. I think, especially in

591
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.520
this age it really doesn't
exist. It really doesn't it

592
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.360
ceases to have existence because
people are not discussing talking,

593
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.750
sharing. It only has a
life if people kind of

594
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.220
endow it with that kind
of power. And that actually

595
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.870
goes back to what we
were talking about with how

596
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:38.200
I stay sane is I
realized I don't have to

597
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.110
post every single day and
I don't have to post

598
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:44.860
every single thing if I
put up things that are

599
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.500
interesting. And I talked to
people who talk to me

600
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.840
about the stuff, then that's
good enough. And I feel

601
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.600
like I have engaged with
people who appreciate the stuff

602
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.870
that I'm doing. And I
found that that's really rewarding

603
00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.750
versus being stressed out and
feeling like, Oh my gosh,

604
00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.930
I haven't made a post
today. Or I haven't updated

605
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:04.060
this in X amount of
days. I have to do

606
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.280
this. And then it's not
fun. Right? Yeah. No one

607
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.440
wants to be on a
treadmill like that. Well, we

608
00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.870
appreciate you. And hopefully we'll
introduce you to some new,

609
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:13.270
new people who are listening
to us right now. Oh,

610
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.480
I'm so appreciative of this
period, just having this conversation.

611
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.820
Great. Well, this is great.
So you've got a new

612
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.490
single called crown and you
went to New York recently and

613
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:23.410
did a video shoot. And
I assume that video will

614
00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:27.790
be out soon. Yes. So
I'm actually going back again

615
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.960
this next weekend to shoot
some final stuff because the

616
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.830
director, he's a perfectionist. He
actually approached me and was

617
00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.140
like, Hey, I want to
do a video with you.

618
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.970
I think what you're doing
is interesting. And so I

619
00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:41.800
just kind of went along
for the ride and it's

620
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.400
been phenomenal and really, really
well sort of produced and

621
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.240
well thought out. So hopefully
that'll be dropping soon. I

622
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.240
don't have an exact date,
but I'm going to continue

623
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.120
to kind of push that
and, and promote the other

624
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.250
stuff that I've been working
on with, on that same

625
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:03.160
project. Because I think people
are starting to like, I

626
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.800
don't know, I drops it
in may. And I feel

627
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.770
like recently people have been
like, Oh, this is kind

628
00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.680
of cool. So I'm going
to be promoting it a

629
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.720
little bit more. I think,
Well, you know, what will

630
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.850
happen of course is you'll
become an overnight success in

631
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:19.780
just 10 short years. Exactly.
And just, just the short

632
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.630
timeframe of about 15 years,
I'm going to blow up

633
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.960
and, Well, this has been
just a joy to talk,

634
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.250
talking to you today. I'm
going to make sure we

635
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.580
add links to everything we
talked about, including the shots

636
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.440
from your video, shoot that
