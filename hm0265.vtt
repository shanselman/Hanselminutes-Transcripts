00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.530
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.470
online@wwwdottlerik.com. In this episode, Scott
talks with Travis about available

7
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.870
mass options. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

8
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.350
episode of Hansel minutes and
today a very special guest.

9
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.640
The man who invented the
word Hansel minutes. How's it

10
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.220
going? Travis? I'm doing pretty
well. Scott, how are you?

11
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.380
Okay. Out of curiosity, before
we start talking about network

12
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.400
attached, storage and appliances, do
you remember when you invented

13
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.640
this? I'd have to look
it up on my blog,

14
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.610
but I'm thinking it was
a many years ago sitting

15
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420
in your office over here,
you know, Hey, we'll code

16
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.000
this thing up. It'll it'll
be done in like 10

17
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.550
minutes. And then, you know,
later on that week. Oh

18
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.850
no, no. 10 more minutes.
It's fine. So it's 10

19
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.770
Hansel minutes. So this is
in fact people think that

20
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.380
it means that I get
things done quickly. In fact,

21
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.040
it means that I have
awful estimates. Yeah. And it's

22
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.450
just estimates, right? 10 minutes.
Everything's 10 minutes. You got

23
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.160
to, got to make a
whole blog new blog engine

24
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.420
at 10 minutes. Give me,
give me 10 minutes. I

25
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.270
missed you. Good times. Good
times. So my windows home

26
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.200
server, which I had talked
about forever on my blog

27
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.530
is starting to die. You
have a home server and

28
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.910
I have one, but it's
just, it's getting really sick.

29
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.890
It's, it's hanging. It's, I'm
getting, I have four hard

30
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.750
drives in my windows home
server. And one of them

31
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.770
is going back and forth
from healthy to unhealthy. Have

32
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.870
you had any issues with
your home server now that

33
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.890
it is nearly five or
six years old? Actually I

34
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.100
did. And what my problem
turned out being is actually

35
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.420
a, a, an entire line
of unreliable drives in a

36
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.050
server capacity. I don't know
what kind of hard drives

37
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.710
you ended up extending yours
with. I ended up getting

38
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.510
some of these, you know,
nicely priced Western digital green

39
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.680
drives. And some of them,
it turns out are, you

40
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.160
know, perfect in a server
environment, but others, if there's

41
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.870
any sort of like heavy
IO, like SQL server, you

42
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.130
know, sort of thing, and
imparts, then they just fall

43
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.600
down. And so I had
problems where if you were

44
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.450
storing some photos or something,
everything was fine, but once

45
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.170
you start running defrag or
whatever, red lights start flashing

46
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.660
and, you know, fire shoots
out the back and you

47
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.690
know, your house explodes, it
ended up falling down pretty

48
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.750
hard. I didn't actually lose
any data, but you know

49
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.330
what, I did lose his
confidence in the whole solution,

50
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.050
even though it wasn't necessarily
the home server's fault or

51
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.930
the defrag program's fault or
anything, it was like, wow,

52
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.770
you know, this, this looks
like it's a fairly fragile

53
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.750
sort of a thing. And
that's actually what kicked me

54
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.410
off starting to look at
potentially other solutions. Cause you

55
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.010
know, if you did end
up losing data or something

56
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.620
like that, you know, you've,
you've read probably some of

57
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.880
the, the blogs with horror
stories about trying to recover

58
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.850
your server and certain things,
you know, aren't working or

59
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.780
whatever. And, and I was
also having some performance issues

60
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.170
where it wasn't, it wasn't
accessing data super fast, again,

61
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.280
potentially part of the, the
drive issue. But you know,

62
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.730
a home server is kind
of also a little notoriously

63
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.600
slow on the, on the
data access as well. Yeah.

64
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.580
So let's, let's talk about
why someone would want a

65
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.260
home server and then we'll
dig into some of the

66
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.690
issues that we've both had
and what we're doing about

67
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.990
it. I think performance is
definitely one. So why would

68
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.050
someone want a server in
their home for the first

69
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.120
and how is this different
from me? Just getting a

70
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.950
bigger, hard drive because I've
told a lot of people

71
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.110
have just said, Oh, we'll
just go and buy a

72
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.450
big, hard drive, hook it
up to your main computer

73
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.520
and problem solved. Well, honestly
my original desire for a

74
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.460
home server was to store
media. I have a fairly

75
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.590
sizeable DVD and movie library,
and it was getting kind

76
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.560
of to the point where
you couldn't really store it

77
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.280
in any sort of accessible
format. If I wanted to

78
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.750
browse through my movies or
watch something in particular, you're

79
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.070
looking through, you know, binder
upon binder of movies without

80
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.770
any covers or anything on
them because they just took

81
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.270
up so much space, media
storage is a pain. So

82
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.620
I started looking specifically to
store media, my music, my

83
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.040
movies, that sort of thing.
And I didn't go for

84
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.920
the larger hard drive because
I wanted all that stuff

85
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.610
accessible from any machine on
the network. And I didn't

86
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.790
want it to be subject
to, you know, I'm sitting

87
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.140
here surfing on, you know,
the web or whatever, and

88
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.350
something happens and I have
to reboot the machine, suddenly

89
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.630
all the rest of the
machines on the network, no

90
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.630
longer have access to that,
that media. And that's not

91
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.090
really an acceptable solution. So
it just, it just made

92
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.960
sense for me to start
looking at centralized servers and

93
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.370
the home server seemed like
it was a pretty reasonable

94
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.670
solution for that, especially with
all the additional features that

95
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.400
it offered, like, you know,
the image based backup and

96
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.870
the integration with, with windows
showing you network health status

97
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.180
and that sort of thing.
It was, it seemed pretty

98
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.020
slam dunk at the time.
Yeah. It seemed to me

99
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.890
that the primary reason that
I got a home server

100
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.250
was the image based backup
to people who aren't familiar

101
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.830
with them. I'm a windows
home server as a small

102
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.440
PC. That's an appliance. It
originally ran windows 2003, and

103
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.070
now it runs windows 2008
and it has been extensively

104
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.540
customized. And one of the
most impressive features of it

105
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.230
has been this image based
backup. So you basically install

106
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.930
a connector on all of
your machines and you have

107
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.890
a complete image. And if
you've ever restored from a

108
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.740
disaster with a home server,
it is amazing. I mean,

109
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.050
you literally back up in
time. I have you ever

110
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.770
had to do that? I
have not, but I've talked

111
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.470
to a few people who
have, have worked at, and

112
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.680
it's always been just super
simple, almost just like the

113
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.990
whole system restore points, sort
of a thing, you know,

114
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.220
boot up magic happens. And
you're back to where you

115
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.640
were at your last nightly
backups. So, you know, again,

116
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.760
very impressive. Yeah, it has
been, it has saved my

117
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.060
butt probably four times, including
just a couple of weeks

118
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.690
ago when I an SSD
died, you boot off a

119
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.790
CD, you pointed to the
home server, you pick the

120
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.950
time of day you wish
to go back to and

121
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.140
you're back and that's it.
And I've, I mean, I've

122
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.050
literally had like massive crash
buy a hard drive, plug

123
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.950
it in restore, keep working.
And, you know, I think

124
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.410
elapsed time, two hours kind
of thing. I don't know

125
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.600
how many Hanselman say all,
but it was, it was,

126
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.640
you know, w w w
I broke it in the

127
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.590
middle of the middle of
the day and I was

128
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.800
working by that evening. So
that, that of course is

129
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.930
not new. You've got things
like a Kronos, true image

130
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.720
and Norton Norton ghost, but
it was kind of the

131
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.240
first example of an extremely
clean populist restore process that

132
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.220
just works. So that was
Automated basis where you don't

133
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.260
even have to think about
it, it's kind of remote

134
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.180
and you set it up
once, set it and forget

135
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.580
it sort of a thing,
which was a big draw

136
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.100
for me. Right. And you
can do your whole house.

137
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.680
I think I had up
to seven machines running kind

138
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.530
of at the same time.
The second thing that was

139
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.110
amazing about home server was
the thing called the drive

140
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.800
extender. Can you talk to
me about scuzzy versus a

141
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.430
scuzzy rather, but raid raid
versus driving center and what

142
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.000
was, so why was that
so significant? So drive extender

143
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.070
was actually another one of
the selling points for me

144
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.360
in a classic sort of
a raid solution, you know,

145
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.760
raid being a redundant array
of independent disks. You have

146
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.820
to kind of know how
many disks you have. You

147
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.790
have to have them basically
match all the same size.

148
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.400
You have to, you know,
there's a lot of setup

149
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.040
and whatnot, and it's, it's
very fault tolerant depending on

150
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.850
which, which configuration you have,
but it's kind of like,

151
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.130
it's not very easily expandable
historically. So, you know, doing

152
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.480
that and, and setting all
that up, it's not quite

153
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.300
as slam dunk easy. Can
it be done yet? Can

154
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.090
it be done by, you
know, your mom or something

155
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.300
as simple as that? Probably
not, probably not so much

156
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.810
the beauty of the drive
extend or feature in windows

157
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.110
home server was you turn
windows home server off, you

158
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.360
plug a new drive in,
you, turn it back on

159
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.570
and you know, again, magic
happens and you can just

160
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.710
add this new drive to
this, this one unit unified

161
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.770
storage pool. So you don't
have to worry about, you

162
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.470
know, moving data off the
raid array, moving data back

163
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.560
on the rate array, trying
to extend the, you know,

164
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.720
the array size, that sort
of thing. You don't have

165
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.720
to worry about it. It's
just, you know, it's seamless

166
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.530
and very simple, which was
something that, again at the

167
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:58.080
time was offered only in
a couple of other products

168
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.890
and mostly a Unix or
Linux based and was not

169
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.650
something for, you know, somebody
who did like me who

170
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.410
wanted more of an appliance
that would just make things

171
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.200
happen so that I wouldn't
have to fiddle with it

172
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.750
or set a bunch of
stuff up. My wife can,

173
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.980
can work with it. And
it's, it's super easy if

174
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.770
something goes wrong, which it,
you know, it doesn't go

175
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.520
wrong, but if something goes
wrong, it's simple to fix.

176
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.910
As opposed to, you know,
me, a windows guy, not

177
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.650
really into the whole Unix
Linux world, it's, you know,

178
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.300
that would have taken me
a lot longer to fix

179
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.250
something if something happened. Right,
exactly. The driver said center

180
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.800
thing I can attest to
being amazing. I started out

181
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:45.410
with 500 gig, 500, yes,
500 gig drives. I had

182
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.530
three of them. And then
later I removed one of

183
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.510
them, which was trivial. You
basically just right. Click on

184
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.940
the drive, say, remove it
goes and make sure that

185
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.970
everything from the three drives
is now on two, you

186
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.610
add in a couple more
terabyte drives. And I'm currently

187
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.280
on my home server, I
have two, one terabyte drives

188
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:06.350
and two, 500 gig drives.
And it just, you know,

189
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.400
it just works. It's totally
fine. But the machine that

190
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.870
a lot of these homes
are, the new homes are,

191
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.850
was meant to be an
appliance. And it was sold

192
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.210
by partners like HP. The
machine tends to be a

193
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.300
little bit inexpensive and as
such a little bit underpowered,

194
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.260
I've got the original HP
media smart. And I have

195
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.230
one of those, I think
mine's the four 75 model.

196
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.140
Exactly. And I even went
so far as to break

197
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.960
the warranty and upgrade the
memory because it came with

198
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.090
a half gig of Ram.
Right. And I think I

199
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.690
upgraded it to two, but
it is notoriously underpowered because

200
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.480
anyone who just needs a
home server and a backup,

201
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.600
it's great. You want to
back up your photos and

202
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.720
backup your, you know, your,
your life. Fantastic. But I

203
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.530
also wanted to throw videos
on it and I wanted

204
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.600
to transcode or dynamically Incode
those videos I've got, I

205
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.740
have photographs going digital photographs
going back to 1998. So

206
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.600
we've got 14 years of
photos. Basically. I've got videos

207
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.570
of my kids birth in
various formats, you know, going

208
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.870
back five plus years and
I want to be able

209
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.960
to watch them on my
Xbox. So now suddenly my

210
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.800
simple backup solution starts becoming
more complicated. I need to

211
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.840
support multiple codecs, multiple video
codecs, multiple formats. I need

212
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.020
to be able to talk
this DNA. Was it DNA?

213
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.600
What's the, what's the thing.
Digital living network Alliance, I

214
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.330
believe is what that stands
for. Right. Which is a

215
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.700
fancy way of saying your
Xbox and your PlayStation can

216
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.200
talk to it using UPNP
in some standardized XML formats.

217
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.260
And, you know, it sounds,
sounds silly. And maybe, maybe

218
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.050
I'm going over the top,
but really being able to

219
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.300
view your photos and videos,
whenever you feel like it

220
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.880
on your big screen TV
using an appliance, like an

221
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.240
Xbox or PlayStation, or even
a wi is really cool.

222
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.790
And you know, I can't
tell you how many times

223
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.970
we've had folks over to
the house and said, Oh,

224
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.380
you want to see pictures
of such and such a

225
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.720
trip. And we fire up
the Xbox and boom, we're

226
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.870
watching them. So then that
becomes interesting. Those, those kinds

227
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:17.430
of disc intensive processor, intensive
activities suddenly became an issue

228
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.880
because the home server device,
not the product, but the

229
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:27.150
device was underpowered. Yeah. I
ran into a similar issues

230
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.260
trying to stream, you know,
DVDs off of the, off

231
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.980
of the server. You know,
you stream one DVD and

232
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.130
you don't bother fast-forwarding or
pausing or anything, and everything's

233
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.330
fine. But if you start
needing it to do some,

234
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.210
you know, major, random access
stuff, or you need to

235
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.420
start streaming something, that's a
little more, you know, maybe

236
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.900
high Def video, that sort
of thing. It definitely becomes

237
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.180
a bit of a performance
bottleneck. Exactly, exactly. So this,

238
00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.210
this was an issue. So
then fast forward, a little

239
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.560
while, and home server as
a product goes from the

240
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.910
original home server to 2011,
I think they call it

241
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.090
windows home server 2011. And
it's, you know, it's, it's

242
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.470
all refreshed new UI bunch
of new features, but for

243
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.380
whatever reason, they got rid
of this drive, extended technology,

244
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.980
there were, there were rumors
that it was not reliable,

245
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.100
which, which I didn't find
to be the case, but

246
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.170
there were rumors that it
was unreliable. There were, what

247
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.420
else did you hear about
why they removed Travis gender?

248
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.380
I think that they, they
were talking about some, you

249
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.470
know, some of the performance
issues around it, having, you

250
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.740
know, when you w the
part of the drive extender

251
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.790
thing, I think was also
the file duplication and the,

252
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.160
when you, so, so that,
that was sort of their

253
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.860
version of raid that was
built in the drive extender,

254
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.570
right. Where you can right.
Click on a certain file

255
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.290
share and say, anytime you
store files in this particular

256
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.230
share, I want you to
actually store two copies of

257
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.630
the file on two different
disks. So if one disc

258
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.860
dies, there's another copy on
the other desk. I think

259
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.990
that they were saying, you
know, I remember early on

260
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.360
in the, in the home
server lifetime, there was a

261
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.400
bit of reliability around that
where the synchronization process was

262
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.490
corrupting some files. There was
some, there was a patch

263
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.130
that came out very quickly
that resolve that issue. But

264
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.590
I think that they were
talking about some of the

265
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.900
reliability, as well as the
performance on that. Yeah. Yeah.

266
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.260
I, that, I forgot about
the, the duplication issue. That,

267
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.740
that is one thing. There's
a process that runs in

268
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.670
the background that will do
that duplication. So when you

269
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.190
copy a big file, for
example, if you decide to

270
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.610
just go in, you know,
dump five, five gig files

271
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.590
on the machine, that it
needs to go and duplicate

272
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.100
those, so it will go
and do that work. And

273
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.570
that can take some time.
So, yeah, definitely there were,

274
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:56.680
there were, I understand all
of a sudden I'm going

275
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.810
to beat the engineering of
it. I mean, it's a

276
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.660
complicated thing. It's a big
feature. Somebody, some smart people

277
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.340
got to work on that.
You can't lose any data.

278
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.360
So they, anyway, they removed
that feature and that became

279
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.920
a big scandal. Everyone was
like, this is, this is

280
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.500
the death of the, of
the windows home server. Because

281
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.670
even though it has all
these features for, for many

282
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.000
people, that was the feature,
right. Drive extender was the

283
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.180
feature. And without it, all
the other stuff is, is,

284
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.670
is not a, a, a
distinguisher. Yeah. It was definitely

285
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.100
one of the huge selling
points for me over some

286
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.420
of the other, you know,
similarly priced NASA products, network

287
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.690
attached storage products, the ability
to just, you know, jam

288
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.940
in a new drive. And
like you were saying, swap

289
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.010
out one drive for a
new drive, that sort of

290
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:50.020
thing, without even really thinking
about losing data or anything

291
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.430
like that, or, you know,
complex mounting and unmounting or

292
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.530
anything like that. I mean,
it was, it was just

293
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.000
so drop dead simple. And
that was, you know, one

294
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.970
of the top five things
that just totally said, windows

295
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.830
home server. So the way
to go for me, You

296
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.350
know, and I think that,
that what you just said,

297
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:12.610
the idea that it was
drop dead simple, it was

298
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.840
like a network attached storage
for, you know, your mom,

299
00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.190
That's absolutely what it was.
And, you know, it's funny,

300
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.920
actually, one of the stories
that I always told that

301
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.160
was totally true was I
was hiring a guy to

302
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:31.180
put in our backyard. And
while he was looking around,

303
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.270
he happened to see the
home server and ask where

304
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.650
I worked. And the old
conversation discussed where he says,

305
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.600
well, gosh, you know, I've
got five machines at my

306
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.520
small office is small landscaping
company. And I said, well,

307
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.900
you know, I could probably
set that up for you.

308
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.520
So I basically bought him
a home server and set

309
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.010
it all up and we
traded, so we did a

310
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.920
bartering thing where he puts
in my backyard in, and

311
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.330
I traded him for our
home server. And, And that

312
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.520
took you what, like, you
know, two hours or something

313
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.950
to put in, I'm sure
It was two or three

314
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.230
hours basically. I mean, it
was literally by the home

315
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.900
server go and install the
back of software and all

316
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.210
of his machines and then
pop in a couple of

317
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.540
drives. And that was pretty
much, it, it was, it

318
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.870
was ridiculously easy, but, you
know, for him, it was

319
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.680
a miracle and wonderful and
amazing. And, you know, I

320
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.790
don't even think he realized
he probably could have done

321
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.280
it himself. That's how it
kind of easy. It was.

322
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.570
Yeah, absolutely. You know, and
then of course, even once

323
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.670
you handed it over, one
of those concerns, when you

324
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.020
do something like that, is
are they going to be

325
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.900
able to maintain this themselves
and the answer and now

326
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.990
in that case was absolutely.
Yes, because it is literally

327
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.300
that simple. It's just, you
know, you don't have to

328
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.570
be a tech person even
just plug it in, hook

329
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.690
it up. It's as simple.
It's like Xbox simple. It

330
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.010
is so appliance oriented. It
was so nice. Exactly. Exactly.

331
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.180
Hi, this is Scott coming
to you from another place

332
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.270
in time. Are you using
agile practices to manage your

333
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.550
software development? There's lots of
tools in the market that

334
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.560
manage the steps of a
project, but most of them

335
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.800
focus on individual roles, get
ready for a solution that

336
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.230
caters for the success of
the whole team. Guys at

337
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.340
Tellerik introduced team pulse. It's
an agile project management tool.

338
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.700
That'll help you gather ideas,
estimate plan, track progress in

339
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.540
a common workspace. Finally, companies,
regardless of their size can

340
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.460
use a lightweight and convenient
tool that makes all the

341
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.820
stakeholders work as a United
team. Even if they're in

342
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.380
different countries by combining intuitive
user interface and the power

343
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.270
server light team poles removes
the roadblocks that you typically

344
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.390
face and applying agile in
an effective manner, no more

345
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.350
lost data, no disparate systems,
no lack of critical analytics

346
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.960
regarding the health and philosophy
project. So if yourself, you

347
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.620
get a free copy for
five users in one project

348
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:52.280
at tellerik.com/team pulse. And please
do thank Tellerik for supporting

349
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.050
Hanselman it's on their Facebook
fan page, facebook.com/t L E

350
00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:01.070
R I K Tellerik. We
do appreciate it. There wouldn't

351
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.050
be a Hansel minutes. If
there wasn't, Tellerik helping us.

352
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.470
So all of this preamble
to the point where my

353
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.700
home server is dying, the
product is fine. The OS

354
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.610
is healthy, but my hard
drives are starting to go,

355
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.260
you know, all hard drives
have a MTBF a meantime

356
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.910
before failure. And that typically
is five years. If you're,

357
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.060
if you're lucky and I'm
somewhere around five years and

358
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.410
you know, you can always
look at your hard drive.

359
00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.990
Look at the top of
it. They usually have a

360
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.840
born on date and manufacturing
date, minor dying. And I

361
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.020
had to ask myself, do
I want to go and

362
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.800
buy more hard drives and
keep going with this? Do

363
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.310
I want to upgrade to
an all new, a home

364
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.840
server 2011? Or do I
want to try something else

365
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.510
that that's come out in
the last couple of years,

366
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.540
then that might give me
the more, the, the power

367
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.410
that I want. Am I
my primary frustration with the

368
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.380
home server? Hasn't been with
the software it's been with

369
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.400
the, the product from HP,
just being not powerful enough.

370
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.390
I want not only a
big, giant array of disks,

371
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.900
but I also would like
some processor power. Like that's

372
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.120
not on my main desktop
so that I can go

373
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.910
and have a do some
work for me. Absolutely. Yeah.

374
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.820
Some of that video transcoding
and audio transcoding and things

375
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.090
that you're mentioning, definitely you
need a little more, a

376
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.910
little more beef to it
than, than just, you know,

377
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:37.550
500 megs of Ram with
minors level processor. Right? So

378
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.490
I went and I bought
a Dromo F S a

379
00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:46.110
couple of days ago because
their marketing department is fantastic

380
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.730
and they, they seem to
have a very impressive product.

381
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.730
I brought, and I was
warned on, on Twitter that

382
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.910
this was probably a mistake
because the drill bows are

383
00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:02.310
notoriously weak and underpowered. And
I've heard that they are

384
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.000
very slow and you know
that I run gigabit ethernet

385
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.680
at the house here. So
I've got the whole house

386
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.050
wired. I don't like to
use wireless. I can avoid

387
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.570
it. Everything I do is,
is wired. Cause if I'm

388
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.900
moving any, anything of any
size around even a three

389
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:20.160
or four megabyte image, you
know, gigabits always just going

390
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.580
to kick wireless is, but
yeah, but I bought it

391
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.170
anyway. So I went and
I got the darn thing

392
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.660
and guess how long it
lasted, What, you know, like

393
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.970
a half a day or
something before we print that

394
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.220
back in a month, Pretty
much I got the entire

395
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.710
thing hooked up, put all
the drives in half a

396
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.710
day later, I was like,
this is BS. It was

397
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.880
so slow. I, I, you
know, I'm used to transfer

398
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.130
speeds upwards of 30 to
50, 60, 70 megabytes, a

399
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.340
second mega bits make a
bytes. And I move a

400
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.010
lot of VMs around and
I've got a couple of

401
00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.180
terabytes of data, you know,
loading this thing up was

402
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:05.070
going to take an eternity.
Are you getting that 75

403
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.220
or whatever megabytes a second
from your home server, The

404
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.040
home server with jumbo frames
turned on. If you use

405
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.150
gigabit ethernet, remember that TCP
IP and these things were

406
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.400
kind of developed in a
time that did not expect

407
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.680
the kinds of speeds that
we're getting right now. But

408
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.170
the easiest thing that someone
who has a gigabit ethernet

409
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.380
at their home can do
to get faster speeds is

410
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.750
first confirm that you've got
the latest version of windows

411
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.020
because you want to use
SMV too, but then go

412
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.740
into your network adapter in
the driver settings and turn

413
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.370
on jumbo frames and set
your size to, to nine

414
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.150
K 9,000 bytes. And that
I've got a whole blog

415
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.580
post on this. If you
search for gigabit ethernet enhancement.

416
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.220
And I was regularly on
the little crappy HP getting

417
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:54.590
50, 60 megabytes, a second
copies. Very nice, very nice.

418
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:59.060
But I was getting 15,
20, maybe on the <inaudible>

419
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.670
and if I copied two
things at once, it would

420
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.100
drop down to like three.
Oh, that's that's just painful.

421
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.490
Yeah. So that was not
only painful. It was absolutely

422
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:15.100
unacceptable. It was Holy and
woefully underpowered. So it went

423
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.580
home Home to home to
the <inaudible>. I went home

424
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.280
to the dribble home. I,
I, I sent it back

425
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.090
and, and, and surprisingly, they
were very cool about it

426
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.710
and they, they didn't make
me pay a, a restocking

427
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.070
fee. So then I did
a little more research because

428
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.000
I think that the Dobo
was basically a panicked maneuver

429
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.670
on my part. You know,
I needed something. I felt

430
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.680
I was going to lose
photos pretty soon. I knew

431
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.200
my hard drive was, you
know, there were literally days

432
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.650
left in my hard drive.
So I went and I

433
00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.870
got a, I did a
little more research. The choices

434
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.050
then were either a Q
nap, a build it myself

435
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.840
and use a Linux system
like free NAS free NAS

436
00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:00.880
NAS, basically, right. Go and
buy a shuttle, PC little

437
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.000
tiny one at Fry's electronics
for 500 bucks, 300 bucks

438
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.320
even, and then use a
free Linux system or one

439
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.680
called a Synology. Now you
bought a recently bought a

440
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.190
new NAZ drive. W how
did you make your decision

441
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.100
and what did you end
up with? So the stuff

442
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.780
that I looked at, I
actually looked at a lot

443
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.870
of the things that you
mentioned. I also looked at

444
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.990
some of like the net
gear readiness and Seagate black

445
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.800
armor. And I mean, I
spent probably a good month

446
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.680
or so, because I didn't
have quite the urge the

447
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.930
sense of urgency around it,
that it sounds like you

448
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:40.330
had, I narrowed it down
based on reviews and that

449
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:44.590
sort of thing too. The
Synology the DRO bow, and

450
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.420
one of the net gear
products, I got re I

451
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.220
exed out the Dromo because
again, I was reading reviews

452
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.850
of things that sounded just
like you had where it

453
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:59.080
was performance issues. And then
it was down to the

454
00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.620
net gear. The Synology I
ruled out free Nass pretty

455
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.970
early on, because part of
my decision criteria was I

456
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.880
want an appliance. I want
just like the home server.

457
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.010
I want to be able
to plug it in, not

458
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:15.460
think about it, let it
run and do its thing.

459
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.540
And I've messed around with,
with free Nass a little

460
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.750
bit before. And, you know,
it's one of those things

461
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.790
where if you don't mind
sort of being, you know,

462
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.920
having that be a hobby,
you know, tinker with it

463
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.720
every once in a while
to check out why this

464
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.450
is working, or that's not
working and stuff, it seemed

465
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.430
like it was going to
be less than appliance. And

466
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.490
then some of these other
things, and I also wanted

467
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.180
some ability, some supportability, right?
So if I have a

468
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.800
problem, I don't want to
have to be spending three

469
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.210
days going through forums and,
you know, asking people in

470
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.030
IRC chat rooms and all
these other things, how to

471
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.530
fix this thing. I want
to be able to call

472
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.500
somebody and say, Hey, you
sold me an appliance, the

473
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.990
appliance isn't working, and I
need you to help me

474
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.260
fix it. So I got
it down to that. And

475
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.810
then the net, the net
gear and the Synology, and

476
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.210
the reason I, I ruled
out the net gear was

477
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.190
actually expandability the Synology that
I ended up getting the

478
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.190
DSP 10, 10 plus, which
I think is last year's

479
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:18.540
model of what you have.
Now. It has five drive

480
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.550
bays in it to start
with where the net gear

481
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.850
product I was looking at
only at four. And the

482
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.150
Synology has an expansion port
on it where you can

483
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:32.700
actually attach another sort of
drive Bay house thing that

484
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.980
has another five bays in
it. So you could have

485
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.260
up to a total of
10 disks in this thing.

486
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.710
Whereas the net gear, there
was no, you know, he

487
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.720
sat a plug, there was
no USB on it. You

488
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.660
were stuck with the four
drives. So knowing that I

489
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.040
was trying to, you know,
store literally, you know, 800

490
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.760
plus DVD images, not compressed
into, you know, WMV or

491
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.840
anything like that, but actually
full on video, Ts rips

492
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.300
of the disks. I knew
I was going to need

493
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.570
that extent expandability. So I
went ahead and went with

494
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.030
the Synology product And which,
which, which Synology number did

495
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:12.170
you go with It? Mine
is the DS 10, 10

496
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:16.070
plus. So it's a one
zero one zero. Plus if

497
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.870
you actually go to their
website, I think right now

498
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.990
they're advertising the 15, 11
plus it looks like it's

499
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.380
the same, the same body
on it and everything. So

500
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.420
it's basically the same thing
that you're looking at there.

501
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.410
But I think the, the
new part of the 1511

502
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.150
is that you can have
two of those extension boxes.

503
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:36.920
So you can have up
to 15 drives instead of

504
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.920
just the 10 drives that
mine is quote unquote limited

505
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:44.360
to, I bought the DS
15, 11 plus, and they

506
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.690
have a whole series of
these. The 15, 11 plus

507
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.840
is kind of mid, mid
range in the small business

508
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.790
server area of their, of
their site. They also have

509
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.610
home to small office. So
I did go a little

510
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.920
bigger than maybe appropriate, but
it will do up to

511
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:05.360
15 drives, like you said,
so this particular one, you

512
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.350
can have the extenders I
put in to me for

513
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:14.420
two terabyte drives. It'll also
support the new three terabyte

514
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.000
drives. So you can have
up to 45 terabytes on

515
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.800
this particular thing, and it
runs up a custom, you

516
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.420
know, Unix, distro that they
call DSM three. I think

517
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.720
I'm running DSM 3.1, actually.
Yeah, I think it's big.

518
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.440
Yeah. DSM is disk station
manager, but their product line

519
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.380
being disk stations. Yeah. And
the whole thing is run

520
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.500
over this very kind of
Ajax web interface. Although they

521
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.830
have a series of iPhone
applications as well for looking

522
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.830
at your files and managing
them, they, they usually anticipate

523
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.530
that people are going to
have multiple ones of these

524
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.920
set up. So if you
outgrow one of them, you

525
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.290
can make additional volumes or
you can make additional disk

526
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.460
stations. So apparently they're very
popular in universities and places

527
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.730
like that. So right now
I've got, let me see

528
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:11.410
here, I've got, I've got
5.5 0.4 terabytes free, even

529
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.200
though I put eight terabytes
of disc in and that's

530
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.960
because of the disc duplication.
So they basically have their

531
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.470
own drive extender. And like
you said earlier, there are

532
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.960
a number of vendors that
have their own file systems

533
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.300
that do a drive, extender
like experience. So because the

534
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.690
feature that I wanted in
windows, home server, isn't there

535
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.240
anymore, the drive extend, or
the ability to add any

536
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.340
drive of any size to
an array. That's kinda my

537
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.330
primary reason for going with
the Synology because I feel

538
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:48.420
like I get drive connect
back. So are you using

539
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.930
then the, I think they
call it hybrid raid solution

540
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.960
that, that on the phonology
disc, that's their sort of

541
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.810
drive extender thing. If I
recall correctly or use, is

542
00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.410
that what you're They have
all the standard rate options

543
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.620
and then they have their
Synology hybrid raid, which is

544
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.730
what they call their drive
extender. Excellent. Yeah. I, I

545
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:12.450
actually have fi I have,
I filled mine up the

546
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:16.200
day on day one with
two terabyte drives. And so

547
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.240
since I had it already
filled up and everything, and

548
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.120
I figured there was going
to be a pretty reasonable

549
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.600
investment costs to get another,
you know, five drives and

550
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.600
the little Bay extended thing,
I just went ahead and

551
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.860
went straight with the raid
five. I see. So, yeah.

552
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.260
Okay. So you went with
a technology you understood more,

553
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.840
felt comfortable with, with the
knowledge that you can have

554
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.660
another volume on a separate
extension on a, on a,

555
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:44.550
on a sidecar. Yes, exactly.
So things that I've been

556
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.500
impressed with with this is
it has all the usual

557
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.960
things you'd want. It has
FTP and it has dynamic

558
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.460
DNS. It has the media
server. It can pretend to

559
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.870
be an iTunes server. It
has audio and video streaming.

560
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.180
It can be a, I
don't use it, but it

561
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.520
could be a bit torrent,
a service you can actually

562
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.800
source bit torrent and B
make it be a download

563
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.840
station. Now, a couple of
the things that I've been

564
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.230
extremely surprised about that I
did not see coming. It

565
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:13.530
has a thing called surveillance
station and I've blogged about

566
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.740
my IP phones. I've got
20 IP cameras. I've got

567
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.540
a number of Panasonic webcams
around the property here. They

568
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.360
have a thing called surveillance
station that magically knew the

569
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:29.670
brand of my phones. Again,
I keep saying fun, magic

570
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.490
number, the brand of my
camera, connected to them over

571
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.100
IP, and then can now
record them. So if you

572
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.620
had a small business and
you had a number of

573
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.200
inexpensive, a hundred dollar cameras
scattered around your business, the

574
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.510
surveillance station within use the
NAS storage to store effectively

575
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:52.010
a DVR digital video recorder,
many, many hours of video

576
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.090
from your, your, your camera.
So suddenly my cameras, which

577
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.030
right now stream live, but
only record the last few

578
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.610
minutes could potentially, if I
left the property for a,

579
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.660
you know, a couple of
days, I could even store

580
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.540
a week of a video
from multiple places. So it,

581
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.170
it really expanded the abilities
of what I already had,

582
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.500
which I thought was pretty
amazing. That is pretty cool.

583
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.530
I haven't actually used that
specific feature on it yet.

584
00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.810
And I was going to
start searching around to see

585
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.910
if somebody had, and it
sounds like it's a pretty

586
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.700
impressive feature there. Yeah. The
only thing I didn't like

587
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.400
was that by default, you
only get one camera. So

588
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.620
you have to basically buy
licenses to up to like

589
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.290
20 cameras or whatever their,
their main number is. So

590
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:34.270
they basically, they tease you
with one license and you

591
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.940
pay a couple of bucks
for the rest. But if

592
00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.670
I was running a small
business and I wanted that

593
00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.510
kind of functionality, I I've
already got it. I don't

594
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.700
have to go and spend
thousands of dollars more on

595
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:51.010
IP surveillance, camera equipment, which
is an investment. The other

596
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.230
thing that it's got that
I'm impressed with is you

597
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.800
can actually back up directly
to S3. So I was

598
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.750
able to go up to
Amazon, sign up for an

599
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.570
account, make a total, a
bucket to put all of

600
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.180
your S three storage in
there, and you can back

601
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.150
up directly to the cloud.
So right now it's backing

602
00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:12.100
up 68, 68 gigabytes of
photos up into the S3

603
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:17.620
system. Interesting. I also haven't
done that because I figured,

604
00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:21.820
you know, I've got what,
like a 10 terabytes on

605
00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.590
it at seven and a
half or so in the,

606
00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:28.630
in the, in the, in
the partition, after you account

607
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.150
for the rate overhead. And
I think I've got like,

608
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:36.190
you know, five terabytes or
something of a DVD ribs.

609
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:38.680
So I didn't, I haven't
bothered working on trying to

610
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.360
back those up to the
cloud. Cause I've got the

611
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.960
original media anyway. No, I
don't count those. You, you

612
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.230
have the DVDs, you have
a backup. Yeah. And I

613
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.120
figured, you know, even if
I was to back it

614
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.720
up, what's 5.4 terabytes going
to cost me at Amazon.

615
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.390
Right. That's going to, it's
going to be just astronomical.

616
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.390
So I just decided not
to. Yeah, it's actually, it's

617
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.910
less than you'd think, but
it is expensive. I think

618
00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:03.400
68 gigs is going to
cost me like four or

619
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.540
five bucks a month, but
you're right. I mean, it

620
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.550
is, it is, there is
a cost there, but of

621
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.100
course I've also got external
drives. So what I'll be

622
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.450
doing is continuing with my
existing backup strategy and actually

623
00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.310
what we're running out of
time. So I'll just close

624
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:21.130
with this. What I'm doing
now is I've got the

625
00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:25.540
Synology 15, 11, I've got
eight terabytes in it. I've

626
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.900
got five available. I went
and I got an inexpensive

627
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.190
version of Acronis true image.
I'm backing up my main

628
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.680
desktop and all the PCs
in the house on a

629
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.340
schedule twice a week with
a Kronos, except for my

630
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.580
work machine, which is backed
up daily. So I've got

631
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.570
disc images of my system
going to the, the Synology

632
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.850
I've got personal, personal files,
family videos, and family photos,

633
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.120
all going to <inaudible> and
they've got all sorts of

634
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.990
choices for encryption and such.
Then I'm backing up the

635
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:02.640
Synology itself to a multi
terabyte, external drive of which

636
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.010
I have to. And then
I just go back and

637
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.400
forth to the, to the
bank every month with an

638
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:14.040
offsite backup sounds complicated, really
not complicated once it's set

639
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.160
up. I haven't, I haven't
given it any thought. And

640
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.680
I was very impressed with
this particular device. So I

641
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.740
recommend this analogy for people
to check out if you

642
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.730
don't need drive extender. I
certainly recommend the home server

643
00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.490
and I don't mean that
tongue in cheek. And I

644
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:32.250
don't mean it as a,
as a Microsoft shill. I

645
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.790
mean, it's a great product.
It's just, it totally sucks

646
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.730
that they removed the drive
extended functionality, but I don't

647
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.640
think my dad needs that
the two terabyte drive is

648
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.880
huge. I'd probably set up
hardware rate or something, but

649
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.100
I don't see if he
needs that. I agree. I

650
00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.540
I'm, I've still got my
home server. I love my

651
00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.720
Synology. It really just kind
of depends on what you

652
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.570
need. If you still just
want a little bit of

653
00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.460
storage, you know, and you're
not too worried about the

654
00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.810
drive extender home server is
still a fantastic product. Yeah.

655
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.650
Cool. So thank you very
much, Travis, for chatting with

656
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.900
me today about the network
attached storage. And I'm glad

657
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.480
that we both are happy
with our, our new Synology

658
00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:16.370
choices. So thanks for having
me. This has been another

659
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.160
episode of Hansel minutes. I'll
see you again next week.
