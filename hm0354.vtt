8
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.550
episode, Scott talks with Kyla
McMullan, the first African American

9
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.680
woman at the university of
Michigan to graduate with a

10
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.160
PhD in computer science about
how to increase diversity in

11
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.920
engineering disciplines. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

12
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.410
episode of Hansel minutes and
I have on the Skype,

13
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.860
dr. Kyla McMahon. How are
you? I'm doing well. How

14
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.640
are you? Well, congratulations on
your recent, is it a

15
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.410
graduation? Is that what it's
called? When you become a

16
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.290
PhD? Yeah. Well, we'll call
it that. Yeah. Is there

17
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.480
like an official thing? Like
I graduated from college, but

18
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.340
it doesn't quite seem like
a big enough word for

19
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.940
a PhD. You defend your
dissertation and that's the one

20
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.250
that sounds like it has
lightning and all that stuff.

21
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.380
So, you know, you have
a defense and then you

22
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.100
attend commencement. You know, we
just call it convincing at

23
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.380
that stage. But yeah, that's
about it. I imagine that

24
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.500
defending your PhD dissertation is
like, like, I don't know.

25
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.300
I think of it in
my mind is like an

26
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.150
episode of glee where you're
like, it's all alone up

27
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.190
on the stage with a
single microphone and then way

28
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.350
in the back. There's like
three PhDs that are all

29
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.080
staring at you. Or is
it bigger than that? You

30
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.470
know, that's a pretty accurate
assessment though. You do get

31
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.770
to have, your family can
come. It's an open defense.

32
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.930
So typically you have, you
know, family, friends, anyone who's,

33
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.450
you know, help maybe your
lab mates, but yeah, it's

34
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.420
you up there, you're running
the show and they hurdle

35
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.030
questions at you and they
pretty much want to tear

36
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.400
apart everything you've done or
ask questions about why you

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.790
chose this or why you
chose that. So, yeah, but

38
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.640
it's, it's not too bad.
Mostly. You've been in contact

39
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.090
with your committee during most
of that process so that

40
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.530
there shouldn't be any surprises
at your defense. And if

41
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.740
there are, then you haven't
been in good communication with

42
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.590
your committee, You said something,
if a question came up

43
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.020
that you didn't see coming,
you didn't have a good

44
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.770
relationship with your, Well, you
can't anticipate every question, but

45
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.040
if there's something that they
ask fundamentally, like why did

46
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.580
you choose this metric to
analyze your data? Typically you

47
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.680
have a data meeting and
they would have seen that

48
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.840
before at some point. So
it's a, if it's a

49
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.410
fundamental question of something you've
done, then yes, you did

50
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.570
not have such a good
relationship, but if it's something

51
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.190
like, Oh, well, how could
these results extend to area

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.590
a that you have no
idea about that's something you

53
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.380
can't anticipate them asking and
no amount of preparation would

54
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.180
have, you know, done that
or no amount of meetings

55
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.190
would have made you be
able to anticipate that When

56
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.010
you are a PhD in
computer science, how does that

57
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.130
differ in your mind from
like software engineering, which I

58
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.990
ended, like I have a
degree in software engineering, which

59
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.240
I made a conscious choice
to get that degree rather

60
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.020
than computer science. And while
I find talking to you

61
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.230
as a PhD in computer
science, very intimidating, I I'm

62
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.020
thinking to myself, like, are
you like an amazing programmer?

63
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.370
Or what do you, how
do you see the differences

64
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.240
between computer science and software
engineering? Okay. So I'm on

65
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.940
the undergrad level. I think
that there really isn't a

66
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.110
difference between software engineering and
computer science, because what are

67
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.270
you doing at the undergrad
level at both in both

68
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.750
majors, you're just making software.
When you get to the

69
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.490
graduate level, typically you're finding
your niche. You're finding your

70
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.570
area that you'd like to
discover and make, just make

71
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.860
a contribution to. So on
the surface in undergrad, there's

72
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.680
no real difference, but in
graduate school, it's not just

73
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.500
about being the best programmer
on earth. It's about taking

74
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.650
the tools that, you know,
and helping to either add

75
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.170
to like a body of
literature where there's a hole

76
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.380
or make something new and
discover new things. So it's

77
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.620
more the inquisitive side, I
guess, of computer science. So

78
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.530
it's not always about writing
the correct program or solving

79
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.510
this problem. Yes. Writing code
is a part of the

80
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.480
process, but it's not the
end. Like once you make

81
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.670
the program, now you have
to, for example, I'm in

82
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.550
human computer interaction. So now
I have to have people

83
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.130
test the code and then
people, I get data and

84
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.530
I have to analyze that
data in accordance to other

85
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.890
studies that have happened. So
Couldn't you be a great

86
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.880
computer science PhD, but a
lousy programmer could one. You

87
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.950
could, I know some lousy
programmers that are appeased. These

88
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.230
are computer science, not to
say. I mean, it's, it's

89
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.750
a lot harder if you're
not a good programmer, because

90
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.020
then you'd have to outsource
your programming. Let's say, if

91
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.260
you're in a lab and
you have undergrads, sometimes our

92
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.350
master students where they'll pay
them to do the coding,

93
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.690
then that may work out
for you because all you

94
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.420
really need to do is
to, you know, run the

95
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.510
study or do the thinking
behind it. Like you're telling

96
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.170
them what to code, but
the problem is a lot

97
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.150
of times they're not as
well versed in the area

98
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.050
as you are. So they
may make a mistake. Or

99
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.420
if you don't understand the
code, they may have inserted

100
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.850
something that's wrong and you
don't find out until well

101
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.830
in the process. So it's
better if you're a coder,

102
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.630
because you can just make
the system exactly the way,

103
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.430
you know, it needs to
be. And if you get

104
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.010
a question during your defense,
like, Oh, well, why did

105
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.500
you implement this as a
stack versus a queue? And

106
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.240
this has a better run
time than this. And you're

107
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.300
trying to improve latency. You
can't answer that question because

108
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.130
you can't code and you
had someone else do it.

109
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.990
Yeah, I see. So it
would be like trying to

110
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.300
be a poet without being
a real master of your

111
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.110
language of preference. Exactly. You're
telling someone else your feelings,

112
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.280
but you don't exactly know
what they've done with your

113
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.860
thoughts. Yeah, exactly. So you,
you're a PhD in computer

114
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.020
science and I know lots
of PhDs in computer science,

115
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.320
but why is your recent
achievement a big deal? Like

116
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.960
why is it notable in
any way? One? So that's

117
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.540
actually something I've been sort
of, I guess, struggling with

118
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.960
in, you know, in the
recent week. So I think

119
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.680
it's notable because number one,
just having the first in

120
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.510
general, but I think it
was, Well, the first, what

121
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.000
we haven't seen said, why
you, you are the first

122
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.600
black female computer science PhD
out of the university, right?

123
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.240
Correct. In 2012. Yeah. I
think it re it just

124
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.570
brings a light to the
fact that number one, we're

125
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.030
still having first like this
across the nation. So was

126
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.070
showing just the problems or
just the, I guess the

127
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.400
lack of people who look
like us who are getting

128
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.950
high level degrees, because there's
many more first to get

129
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.050
out there. I'm pretty sure
there's lots of other universities

130
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.170
that have not had a
first black female computer science

131
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.300
PhD. And the crazy thing
is a lot of my

132
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.660
friends are first, like my
best friend Alfie. She's the

133
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.690
first, the first biophysics PhD,
first black one at Michigan.

134
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.180
And I think maybe like
fifth in the nation, I

135
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.080
have another friend who's like
the first genetics PhD at

136
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.990
university of Chicago. My other
friend, he's the first black

137
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.870
person at produced. So it's
not so much about me.

138
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.850
It's the fact that we
can bring light to the

139
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.690
fact that we're not attaining
high level degrees at a

140
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.720
fast as fast rate as
the, the rest of the

141
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.860
population. So kind of asking
some of the, the obvious

142
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.360
questions are the hard questions
from the perspective of a,

143
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.170
of a white guy and
for white people that are,

144
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.470
that are listening. Why should,
why should a white person

145
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.720
care? Like why should I
care if I, if I

146
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.930
think of myself as being,
let's just assume I'm not

147
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.070
racist and I want everyone
to succeed. I might, I

148
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.190
might say to myself, what
does programming have to do

149
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.960
with color? And, you know,
I just want to hire

150
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.360
the best person for the
job. Why should I, why

151
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.460
should I care either way?
Whether there are a lots

152
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.910
of black folks programming or,
or none at all. Okay.

153
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.460
Okay. That's a very, I
mean, I could see where

154
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.760
that question would come from,
but number one, the minority

155
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.240
populations are growing at a
very, very fast rate in

156
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.180
the country like blacks and
Hispanics, I believe are about

157
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.990
12 or 13%, but we're
the fastest growing population. And

158
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.820
if this is the same
underserved population that is receiving

159
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.490
the worst healthcare, the worst
education that we're not going

160
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.000
to have people to create
these computer systems. And I

161
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.220
believe I read a statistic
that said, I think by

162
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.450
2025, that 70% of the
jobs were going to have

163
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.360
some sort of computer aspects.
So if we're make, if

164
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.480
we have more people who
aren't getting educations, who in

165
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.310
the world that we think
are going to program all

166
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.610
of these jobs, who who's
gonna, who's gonna work all

167
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.010
of these computers that are
necessary for work. So, I

168
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.340
mean, I guess white people,
I mean, but they're, but

169
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.020
the white population is diminishing
and shrinking. So even if

170
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.320
you had every white person
operating a computer, that would

171
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.750
still be a small fraction
of the population. So we

172
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.910
need to make sure that
we have things in place

173
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.520
to make sure that Latinos
and that black people and

174
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.240
all underserved communities, that everyone
has an equal access and

175
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.320
equal opportunity to major in
anything, not just computer science.

176
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.820
I think computer science, I
want everybody to be a

177
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.810
computer scientist, but it's really
important to make sure that

178
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.230
we have people too, to
step up and be just

179
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.750
able to take the place
of the people who are

180
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.760
retiring and, and getting out
of these jobs. Okay. So

181
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.630
that's, so that's one perspective.
The idea that the population

182
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.890
is changing is it is
less, less all white folks.

183
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.830
And now it's very, it's
very diverse. Is there, is

184
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.920
there really value as a
white programmer? Should I value

185
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.660
diversity in my workforce? Yes,
Definitely. There's studies actually that

186
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.390
show that the more diverse
a team is like on

187
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.210
a group project, the more
diversity there is the better

188
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.150
the solution usually is the
more diverse the solution. The

189
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.970
more versatile it is. So
yes, as a white person,

190
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.310
as a person in general,
as a person who breeds

191
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.370
you should be a whole,
you should be very, very

192
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.250
concerned with diversity because you
want to make the best

193
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.800
overall product. And that doesn't
have to do with color

194
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.350
that has to do with
making sure you're including everyone

195
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.730
in the decision making process.
Interesting. So a number of

196
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.820
people commented on a, a
Google plus thread that I

197
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.250
started earlier and they were
saying, well, what does computing

198
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.090
have to do with, with
color? And while we're, we're

199
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.640
saying, you know, it's significant
and interesting that you are

200
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.040
the first black female, and
you may have other things

201
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.600
about you. Like you could
say, wait, maybe you're the

202
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.710
first, I don't know, you
know, black female diabetic, short

203
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.600
person, dah, dah, dah, whatever.
Like, you know, you could,

204
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.190
you can narrow it down
as much as you want

205
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.260
and make it as, as,
as narrow as possible. But

206
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.310
the point is that your
experience in, in, in growing

207
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.710
up in being educated and
becoming a member of the

208
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.920
workforce is different than mine.
So when you say a

209
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.240
diverse workforce, we're not saying
like pie chart, diversity, like

210
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.180
United colors of Benetton, like,
do we have everyone of

211
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.570
all shades, right? We need
someone who's a little, a

212
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.550
little darker here. We need
someone who's a little taller

213
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.720
here. I hear you saying
that we need diversity, which

214
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.360
usually thinks about color, but
diversity of thought, diversity of

215
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.220
age, Diversity of life experience,
diversity of all sorts of

216
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.370
things. Age is definitely one
that should, you should have

217
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.880
a diverse team in terms
of software development, like human

218
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.430
computer interaction. You don't make
the same software for an

219
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.980
elderly person as you would
for a teenager as for

220
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.520
an adult. So there definitely
has to be not only

221
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.030
a person who is either
expertise in designing for those,

222
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.360
for those softwares or those
types of software, or just

223
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.980
someone of that age to
evaluate it. Because as we

224
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.170
said, you have to make
sure everyone's being represented so

225
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.330
that the people who use
the software in the end

226
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.610
don't feel like they're being
left out because, Oh, I

227
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.630
don't that terminology, or this
is choke out for me

228
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.510
to understand. So making sure
everyone's at the table and

229
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.970
the decision making process. Yes.
There's no one size fits

230
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.520
all software program, but we
can make sure that we

231
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.110
include the most part. Right.
Do you think it would

232
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.710
be interesting if we said
that maybe someone was the

233
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.340
first over 60 person who
ever got a PhD from

234
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:19.020
a university? Definitely because their
experience is completely different than

235
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.450
anyone else. Like, for example,
if they're over 60, they

236
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.690
probably have kids. It was
probably a very, a huge

237
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.360
challenge for them to go
back to school. The learning

238
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.470
just there's so much, that's
so different about that person's

239
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:37.950
experience. That is, it's definitely
notable. The, I had, I

240
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.710
had Kimberly Bryant from a black
girls code. You can go

241
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.130
to black girls code.com and
she's got this great nonprofit

242
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.760
that runs around and puts
together. I think of them

243
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.010
as kind of like exposure
days. Have you, have you

244
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.250
worked with them? Yes, I
have actually saw them when

245
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.950
they were in Detroit. I
believe it was in October

246
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.850
and they are doing an
awesome job, exposing the girls

247
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.330
to, to coding and computer
science, the activity, they have

248
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.700
lots of activities, but the
activity that I came for

249
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.060
was the build a webpage
and a day activity. And

250
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.830
I actually had a chance
to talk to the girls

251
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.050
before they started their day.
And I just told them

252
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.860
about, you know, how much
they were needed in computer

253
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.930
science. And I gave them,
you know, the statistics that

254
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.440
I gave you and I
told them that that they're

255
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.440
definitely needed. And even if
they're not computer scientists, whatever

256
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.870
they end up going into
will most likely have some

257
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.650
computational aspects. So it's very
important for them to, to

258
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.440
understand computing and know how
to code. So a lot

259
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.320
of them, they made web
pages. They, they really liked

260
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.480
it and they were, we
could not get them off

261
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.580
the computers. Like it was
time to eat lunch and

262
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.770
they were like, Oh, just
five more minutes, five more

263
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.070
minutes, please. We almost miss
lunch. But they were so

264
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:53.340
excited. What do you think
is, has kept black people,

265
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.940
people of color and also
women out of computing? Is

266
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.550
it because there's just so
many white folks that it's

267
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.550
intimidating or is this something
that started in first grade

268
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.850
when maybe women aren't being
pressured to go into math?

269
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.280
I mean, I know it's
a very nuanced question, but

270
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.590
where did it start? I
mean, we could just say

271
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.570
entrenched institutional racism, but that's
an easy, an easy answer.

272
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.160
That's definitely a cop out.
So I think the answer

273
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.830
is so obvious that it
just does not make sense.

274
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.380
So my answer, and I
can just give you an

275
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.980
anecdotal story. So I remember
being in high school and

276
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.830
we had a computer science
track in our science and

277
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.410
technology program at my high
school. And I really loved

278
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.650
computers. And I remember battling
like, man, should I take

279
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.320
computer science? I'm not going
to have any friends. And

280
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.660
then I really remember having
a vividly, remember having the

281
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.760
thought in my head, how
in the world am I

282
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.650
going to turn to a
white boy, I need to

283
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.110
turn into a white boy
to take this class. So

284
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.590
just, you know, thinking back
about that, I'm just like,

285
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.490
okay, if the only people
who you see in a

286
00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:00.110
certain major don't look like
you, then sometimes that may

287
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.750
tell you, okay, well maybe
I'm not maybe people who

288
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.600
look like me, don't do
this. For example, like there's

289
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.220
lots of positive white male
reinforcement for every single field

290
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.410
or someone who does it.
But in terms of black

291
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.500
women, we can be singers.
We can do hair, we

292
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.450
can do lots of stuff.
Cause that's what the media

293
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.750
reinforces to us that we
can do name a black

294
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.590
female, famous computer scientists. I'll
give you some time. So

295
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.250
Yeah. I mean, I'm like,
I don't want to may

296
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.980
Jemison, she's an astronaut. Does
she program bio? Probably not.

297
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:31.810
That's a good question. I'd
be digging in the archives

298
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.000
to find one. Okay. So
it's kind of few and

299
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.240
far between, so one I
think is just not seeing

300
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.670
anyone who looks like you,
like not having a role

301
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.480
model of someone who looks
like you who's successfully done

302
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.370
what you want to do.
So I was fortunate enough

303
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.220
to have lots of role
models along the way. So,

304
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.410
you know, first I took
the course and the class

305
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.170
was taught by. I remember
my teacher was mr. Where

306
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.570
he was very young, not
really young, but I think

307
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.640
he was like maybe 22
or 23. And he had

308
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.670
just got his master's and
like computer science and math.

309
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.830
And I was like, man,
mr. Where is cool. Like

310
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.230
we would come in and
talk about the basketball games.

311
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.310
He was a black man,
young black man who came

312
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.160
back to teach. And I
mean, I tell him all

313
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.140
the time, like mr where
you're the whole reason I

314
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.110
went into computer science because,
and he was brand new

315
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.270
that same year. I decided
that sign up for computer

316
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.610
science. He was brand new
to the school and the

317
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.580
fact that he could come
in, be normal, talk about

318
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.220
like, what happened that weekend
and music and things. We

319
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.650
were all interested in and
then say, okay, now this

320
00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.840
is how you program a
four loop or even bring

321
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.170
those examples to the classroom.
Like it was just, it

322
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.570
was amazing. It was really
amazing. Do you think that

323
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.060
that is like, that is
the fundamental issue? I mean,

324
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.440
I, I remember kind of
growing up in the seventies

325
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.460
and eighties that I was
always hearing about peop from

326
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.830
people who were not white,
that I'm not seeing people

327
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.820
that look like me in
TV, on commercials, in magazines.

328
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.500
And from my perspective, I
can intellectualize that. But I,

329
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.360
but at the same time,
I really can't see it.

330
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.520
I'm just like, well, I
mean, what's, what's the big

331
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.870
deal, like Who cares? Because
it's this implicit reinforcement that

332
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.140
you get growing up. Like
yeah. There's nothing that someone

333
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.930
who looks like you has
not done. So there's lots.

334
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.220
So, but for me, it's
like, okay, well maybe we

335
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.890
don't do that. Maybe that's
not something I thought I

336
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.410
wasn't going to have any
friends, but that's one of

337
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.160
the reasons I think another
reason also is also the

338
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.790
lack of exposure to the
possibilities of the field because

339
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.280
of the fact that I
don't know anyone or didn't

340
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.760
know anyone. I didn't have
anyone who could tell me

341
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.460
about the field or anything
about computer science. I thought

342
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.960
it was all making web
pages. I thought I was

343
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.820
going to get a PhD
and making webpages when I

344
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.660
stopped. But that was the
extent of my knowledge at

345
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.180
that time. But if you
don't have anyone who's been

346
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.660
there, then it's hard to
exactly. Imagine a future for

347
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.280
yourself within that field. So
that's another component of that

348
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.890
Getting a PhD and making
webpages. I think that, I

349
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.850
think if I asked my
relatives, like what I do,

350
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.480
we make webpages, right? Yeah.
That's pretty much it. And,

351
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.990
and actually let's shift a
little bit. What your, what

352
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.030
is your PhD in, I
believe I know because I

353
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.970
read your paper, but share
with us what your dissertation

354
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.260
was about. Sure. My dissertation
was in virtual spatial audio

355
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.070
and how we can design
interfaces that help people to

356
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.920
re recall the configuration of
the environment. So I know

357
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.840
that's a lot of words
that don't sound like they

358
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.480
go together, but an analogy
would be virtual reality, like

359
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.000
3d, virtual reality, how you
can put on the glasses

360
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.670
and you can see a
virtual world and you get

361
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.950
all that depth and, or
even putting on three D

362
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.780
glasses at the movies and
how you put on the

363
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.030
glasses. And you feel like
things are coming at you

364
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.990
and placed at different areas
around you. The same analogy,

365
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.230
except for sound. So you
can put on a pair

366
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.710
of headphones and there's ways
that we can change the

367
00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.620
signal that goes in both
of your ears to make

368
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.050
it sound as though a
sound is coming, like, you

369
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.750
know, directly over your shoulder,
in front of you, behind

370
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.650
you, like anywhere in virtual
space around you. So taking

371
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.520
that environment, I studied number
one, how in the world,

372
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:20.000
can we get an accurate
virtual sound display for lots

373
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.270
of people, because we all
hear sound differently just because

374
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.930
of our physiological aspects, because
of the shape of our

375
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.210
ears, the placement of our
ears on our head, our

376
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.090
shoulders, lots of things influenced
the way we hear sounds.

377
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.690
So it's kind of like
another analogy would be prescription

378
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.760
glasses. So everyone pretty much
needs a different eyeglass prescription.

379
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.780
So I came up with
a way of making sort

380
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.380
of, I guess, ear glass
prescription, where it's sort of

381
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.710
akin to going to the
drug store and picking up

382
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.360
some glasses that are already
have some prescribed, I guess,

383
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.810
plus two. So I don't
really wear glasses. So yeah,

384
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.260
the diopter. So it has
already some prescribed thing and

385
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.150
you just put it on
and see which one fits

386
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.000
you the best. So I
came up with the procedure

387
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.520
for that and the next
part. So now that people

388
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.640
can actually hear spatial sound
in this three D space.

389
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.650
So hang on, let me
see if I understand you

390
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.560
came up with a way
to describe a profile that

391
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.570
says, you know, your head
is one size and your

392
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.400
ears are one shape. And
my head is one size

393
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.740
and Myers one shape. And
you can, can balance that

394
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.630
out so that we are
on a level playing field.

395
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.110
And then you can apply
spatiality to that. Yeah, somewhat.

396
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.250
So it's more so than
just taking the, the ear

397
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.060
and, you know, head, shape
and torso. We actually led,

398
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.760
we didn't care about the
ears or head or torso.

399
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.910
We just let the listener
listen to some sounds and

400
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.160
tell us which one sounded
like they were coming from

401
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.880
up versus down left versus
we're not left versus right.

402
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.930
Cause that's pretty simple, but
forwards versus backwards. And from

403
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.340
there we had already let's
say a set of eyeglasses

404
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.010
or fixed set of measuring
eyeglasses. So we used that

405
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.380
to narrow it down, which
one would be the best

406
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.250
for that user? How many
different types? I think there

407
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.880
were maybe 20, no, wait.
Yeah. Maybe 22 or 23.

408
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.990
Interesting. That reminds me of
the in windows. There's the

409
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.720
clear type thing that says,
which of these looks best

410
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.160
to you and then you
click it and it goes,

411
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.570
well, which of these look
best to you? And it's

412
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.750
like, absolutely. And then you
just narrow it down and

413
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.610
then you have, it's like
blood typing. Oh, you're a

414
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.910
type C here. And then
now I can apply spatiality

415
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.430
to sound spatial. Spacialness I
don't know if that's a

416
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:34.410
word. Oh, okay. Wow. So
that sounds like a lot

417
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.890
of math. Yes, it is.
It's a lot of math,

418
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.540
a lot of coding, but
it's a means to an

419
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.000
end, you understand the math
that needs to go on

420
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.120
behind it and you code
it up. And the fact

421
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.140
that you can invent something
that was never before possible

422
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.810
to be created, that just
drives the whole process. You're

423
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.160
like, okay, I'm going to
do this. I'm going to

424
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.840
do something really cool with
this. So it helps you

425
00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.900
to just get through it.
It seems so overwhelming though.

426
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.570
The idea that you're, that
you're a, like in a

427
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.940
place that no one's ever
been for, like exploring new

428
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.540
territory, but also that you
can do it and getting

429
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.210
back to what you're talking
about before, does that, is

430
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.090
that taught that I can
go and make this happen

431
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.720
no matter what color you
are or, or is that

432
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.810
a drive that you were
born with? I can only

433
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:26.070
speak for myself. So I'm
generally an optimist. So I

434
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.140
tend to think I can
do anything. If someone tells

435
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.820
me I can't, I can
show them five ways I

436
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.660
can. And I think that's
just, that's just generally something

437
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.370
I'm born with. I have
met a lot of people

438
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.830
along the way where, you
know, for whatever reason, I'm

439
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.310
really interested in what keeps
people of color in graduate

440
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.890
school, in PhD programs. And
I mean like people who

441
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.500
have all the credentials and
the scores, like what keeps

442
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.630
them there versus not. And
I was having a conversation

443
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.250
with a friend and we
were saying, it has to

444
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.620
it's it's, it's that hustle.
We call it the hustle.

445
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.480
Like you have to be
that person. That's like, look,

446
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.540
even though this has never
happened before, or someone says,

447
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.060
I can't, I have a
certain amount of hustle in

448
00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.490
me that says, you know
what I can, and I'm

449
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.500
going to, and if I
can't, I'm going to figure

450
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.930
out who knows this one
aspect, talk to them and

451
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.700
we'll figure it out. Like
you have to have some

452
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.040
element of hustle because everything
is not going to be

453
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.850
easy. I love that. I
was, you can't teach hustle.

454
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.550
You know, you just gotta
get ahead of it. But

455
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.550
I, that makes me think
about, I've got a niece

456
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.400
who is going into college
now and she's 18. And

457
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.320
I keep trying to tell
her, don't live your life

458
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.220
by default. Like if you
make no decisions, then decisions

459
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.530
will be made for you.
And the next thing you'll

460
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.040
know, you'll be managing a
McDonald's and that's fine. If

461
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.330
that was your goal, like
if your goal was I

462
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.760
to go out there, I'm
going to manage the hell

463
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.490
out of this McDonald's then
that's great that you do

464
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.470
that. But if that's not
your goal, and then you're

465
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.040
like, wow, how did I
end up managing this? McDonald's

466
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.980
then you've lived your life
by default. And you didn't

467
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.600
hustle. That's really good advice
living your life by default.

468
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.390
Yeah. That's really good advice.
And I agree a hundred

469
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.940
percent. Like you need to
make the choices that, that

470
00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.150
affect what you do and
not just say, Oh, well,

471
00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.520
I guess this didn't work
out. So maybe I'll go

472
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.130
home. No, you have to,
you have some control over

473
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.670
your life. When you were
going through this process, this

474
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.550
multiple year long process to
become a PhD. And as

475
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.700
well as you know, all
your postgraduate work, were you,

476
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.340
were you looking around and
feeling like isolated? Were you

477
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.230
thinking like, Oh, I don't
know. What was I thinking?

478
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:24.340
Why spatial audio and PhD
and all of these white

479
00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.740
people. I mean, D was
that a motivator that, did

480
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.450
you think about that every
day? Or is that something

481
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.020
you think about once a
year? Oh, well, it was

482
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.870
definitely something that I noticed,
but I've gotten immune to

483
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.540
it. And when I was
an undergrad, like I went

484
00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.810
to a pretty diverse university.
So I was pretty used

485
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.940
to being, you know, one
of the few people of

486
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.940
color, one of the few
women actually at Michigan, I

487
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.920
had to get used to
being one of the few

488
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.250
Americans, let alone black people
let alone people of color

489
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.920
because I'm not sure if
people are aware of this,

490
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.150
but there is a dearth
of Americans in PhD programs

491
00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:01.990
across the sciences and engineering.
And I'm not saying this

492
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.540
to say, okay, we shouldn't
have international students, but we

493
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.450
are not properly educating our
kids over here so that

494
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.000
they can be competitive in
graduate school and go on

495
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.360
to attain these higher degrees.
So it was actually a

496
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.940
meeting we had during orientation
and they said, okay, raise

497
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.280
your hand. If you're from
West of the Mississippi to

498
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.880
raise your hand East of
the Mississippi three hands, go

499
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.860
up then international, the whole
room lights up everyone's hand

500
00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.750
goes up and I'm like,
yeah, we need to do

501
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:32.290
something about it. Right? Because
then we're giving people PhDs,

502
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.380
and then they leave. Okay.
Yeah, it's the brain drain

503
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.780
is what they call it
because we're spending all of

504
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.080
our, our, you know, States
are funded, I'm sorry, States

505
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.920
and the federal government fund
colleges and universities. And what

506
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.790
we're doing is we're educating
international students and then they

507
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.490
go home. So we've invested
all of our money in

508
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.560
these people who aren't going
to sell back into our

509
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.710
own system, our own economy
and our own jobs. So

510
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.530
I'm not saying that, Oh,
we shouldn't allow international students,

511
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:01.540
but we definitely didn't need
to make sure that our

512
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.820
students are in the room
too. It means that we

513
00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.150
should prioritize, right. I mean,
we, we, you and I

514
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.100
happened to be in America
and we happen to have

515
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.580
gone to American universities. Probably
that should be the focus.

516
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.930
And I don't think that
that's being too exclusionary either.

517
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.590
I don't think so either,
but there definitely has to

518
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:24.160
be some balancing or something
because we have a brain

519
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.860
drain and there's gonna not
be enough Americans to field

520
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.110
American jobs. And that's going
to be a problem when

521
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.720
you have to enlist help
from other countries to come

522
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.500
and just run your country
because you're not servicing a

523
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:40.360
highly growing population. There's a
huge underserved population whose numbers

524
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.790
are on the rise. And
then you have people who

525
00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.500
really see the purpose of
having diverse people in these

526
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.960
sorts of positions. So it's
a setup for a huge

527
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.620
problem. We had talked a
little bit at the beginning

528
00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.670
about where this starts and
I go back and forth.

529
00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.580
I tease my wife a
little bit about like just

530
00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.030
random physics stuff. Right. You
know, like I think that

531
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.620
there's a joke. I always
tell what this is actually

532
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.540
true. It's a story where
I was sitting around with

533
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.640
a bunch of relatives. They
were all young relatives, like

534
00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.130
the teenager types. And one
of them just says, Oh

535
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.660
gosh, what time is it
in South Africa right now that

536
00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.430
could have just answered the
question. Right. But I'm geek,

537
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.920
I'm geek uncle. So I
grabbed an orange. I'm like,

538
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.080
hold this, you're the son.
Okay, hold this Apple. You're

539
00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.670
the earth. All right. That's
not, as the earth is

540
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.680
tilted and it's spinning. And
then you can just see

541
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.770
their little young eyes just
roll. There's like, ah, just

542
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.090
tell me what time it
is. I don't want to

543
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.700
know how the solar system
works, but I'm thinking to

544
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.720
myself, how can you not
want to totally geek out

545
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.330
about this? And I feel
like that's lost, like I'm

546
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.780
meeting kids that are 11
and 12 and whatever happened

547
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.950
between preschool and 11 or
12, they missed. And they're

548
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:50.630
not totally geeked out about
that. Hmm. That's a really

549
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.890
interesting, I'm not interested in
the how one I could

550
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.590
speculate. One could be just
the fact that we're in

551
00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.710
such a fast paced technology
age, where they're used to

552
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.530
having answers that quick. They're
not used to having to

553
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.050
sit around and wait and
figure out things. They're very

554
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.510
used to just, okay, I
want something, press a button.

555
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.660
There it is. So there
may not be that patience

556
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.210
to sit and wait to
figure out an answer. They

557
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.070
have it. They're just like,
I need the answer right

558
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.880
now. That is actually very
insightful. The idea that, well,

559
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.310
I just Google whatever. And
then somebody else figured it

560
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.470
out. Right. And I don't
need to know the, how

561
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.210
I just need to know.
And they may not even

562
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.030
understand time zones. They may
just know, okay. Whenever I

563
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.650
want to know what time
it is somewhere, I'll just

564
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.830
Google it. Is that why,
if I understand correctly, you're

565
00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.560
going into being a professor.
You're going into academia rather

566
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.130
than into the private sector.
Yeah. Well, I'm going into

567
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:44.030
academia one because I love
research. I really love being

568
00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.180
able to solve questions that
interest me and not just

569
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:52.010
the company's bottom line and
two, just because I really

570
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.250
enjoy students. I really enjoy
students and the whole academic

571
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.210
process. I love mentoring. Apparently
it comes natural to make

572
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.280
that lots of mentees. I
never have a form, had

573
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.920
a formal mentoring program, but
I've lots of mentees. So

574
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.560
I've been told that something
that just comes very natural

575
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.750
to me. So it was
a no brainer that, I

576
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.130
mean, I've been in school
long enough. It was one

577
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.230
thing I know at school.
So I can definitely help

578
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.990
people who are, you know,
on that path and the,

579
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.970
or they're kind of unsure
about what to do or

580
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.920
they just need some guidance.
So it was a no

581
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.440
brainer for me. And do
you think that it will

582
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.870
make a difference that you
are out in front in

583
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.790
that, in that case you're
going to be seen by

584
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.140
people now? I definitely think
it does make a difference

585
00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.460
definitely for women and people
of color who may not

586
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.740
have thought that, Oh, okay,
this is something that we

587
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.480
do. This might not be
though. Cause there may be

588
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.910
little girls who are like,
Oh, I really like computers.

589
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.300
There's nobody who looks like
me, who does this? Okay.

590
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.520
I can be one of
those faces, like the fact

591
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.790
that I'm out in front,
just in people like me

592
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.460
are out in front and
we're getting slowly, we're getting

593
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.610
more and more. But the
fact that we're here definitely

594
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.270
helps. I'd never had a
black computer science professor ever.

595
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.640
I had a few women,
but never had a black

596
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:05.260
female or black computer science
professor. But all of that

597
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.140
to say like just, I
think being in the classroom

598
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.930
and being that resource for
people who look like me

599
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.490
will definitely help. So given
some of the statistics you

600
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.070
mentioned before, like for example,
in the U S African

601
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:21.570
Americans are about 13% of
the population, would success look

602
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.960
like 20 years from now?
You know, 13% of computer

603
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.300
scientists are, are black and
we stopped thinking about it

604
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.810
in the sense of it's
a representative group. Yeah. I

605
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.260
think that's succession mapped match
the population. That means that,

606
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.680
I mean, as a naive
statistic, that everyone has an

607
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:40.920
equal chance at the exact
same jobs and careers. So

608
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.110
I think we should try
to meet her as closely

609
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.680
as possible the national population.
Yeah. Yeah. If some people

610
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.650
had commented on these, some
of these different threads about,

611
00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.130
about the scholarships and things,
and they'd said, well, I'm

612
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.770
just gonna hire the best
person for the job, which

613
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.840
then makes you wonder though,
well, if, if only one

614
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.590
kind of person applies for
that job, then you know,

615
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.840
how do you know you
didn't get a representative group?

616
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.810
You may have got it.
Who knows any number of

617
00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.920
things can conspire to give
you a list of candidates,

618
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.580
but it isn't necessarily affirmative
action to simply, you know,

619
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.010
make sure that women are
hearing about this job or

620
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:18.450
make sure that people of
color are hearing about this

621
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.190
job when they sh they
like gets them in the

622
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.170
door, they still have to
achieve the interview and be

623
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.530
hired on their merits. Exactly.
So it's not though you're

624
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.630
saying, okay, well let's just
find a black person and

625
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.430
hire them. And they know
a little bit about computers,

626
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:33.390
make sure that the qualified
pool of applicants, that there

627
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.850
is like, like you said,
the information gets out to

628
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.940
everyone because when there's an
interview process, there may be

629
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.870
a call for interviewees that,
you know, a whole population

630
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.940
does not see. There's lots
of list serves and lists

631
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.030
products and probably things that
may not have any people

632
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.630
of color on it. So
if you're only sampling one

633
00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.400
group of people, then of
course, you're not going to

634
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.440
get any people of color.
So if you don't care

635
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.600
about diversity, you're never going
to find the list of

636
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.430
people. We have email lists.
People were like, where all

637
00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:00.930
the black people in computer
science, we don't have an

638
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.000
email list. We have, we
had a conference at one

639
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.840
point, we were out there.
But if you don't value

640
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.960
diversity, they won't get those
applicants. And some people feel

641
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.210
like, Oh, it's charity to
go and find them. No,

642
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.120
these people are just as
qualified if not more qualified.

643
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.060
So why not? Yeah. Why
not give them that opportunity?

644
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.850
And, and hopefully in the
future, we won't have to,

645
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.280
we'll just have a representative
group of people to pull

646
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.560
from and everyone will feel
like they can be anything.

647
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.370
Yes. That would be an
ideal teacher. Well, thanks so

648
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.930
much for chatting with me
today and I wish you

649
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.180
all the best in your,
in your coming academic career.

650
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.820
Thank you so much. It
was a joy talking with

651
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.060
you. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

652
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:44.350
you again, next week. <inaudible>.
