10
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.720
episode, Scott talks with dr.
Henry segment about visualizing mathematics

11
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.950
with three D printing. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

12
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.530
is another episode of Hansel
minutes today. I'm talking with

13
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.470
dr. Henry <inaudible>. He works
at the department of mathematics

14
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.650
at Oklahoma state, and he
has a great website called

15
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.080
three D print math, where
you can learn about his

16
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.990
book, visualizing mathematics with three
D printing. How are you

17
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.880
sir, for doing free? Well,
thanks. Yeah, I, so the

18
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.680
website is, I mean, it's
sort of a sister to

19
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.170
the book, right? It's, it's
maybe not so much in

20
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.830
the ad as, as you
know, it's like the book

21
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.950
really uses like three D
models and you want to

22
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.740
be able to see those
models virtually at least on

23
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.360
the website. So you, you
want to really use the

24
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.090
two together? No, absolutely. I
mean, and this, this, this

25
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.460
book is, is a book
that you would use in

26
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.710
class, but I also kind
of as a three D

27
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.070
printer fan myself, this is
almost like the coffee table

28
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.130
book for three D printers
and math. Yeah, I mean,

29
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.130
right. So I haven't actually
taught with it yet. It's

30
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.940
I view it more like
a popular math book, but

31
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.990
you know, people who are
interested, you know, maybe know

32
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.150
a little bit of math,
but you shouldn't need much

33
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.190
in terms of background and
it doesn't really a textbook

34
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.570
it's sort of conversational and
here's some cool ideas and,

35
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.990
you know, use the, the,
these three D printed models

36
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.070
to show what's going on.
And yeah, it doesn't go

37
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.350
into, you know, there's not
a lot of technical notation,

38
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.710
but there's some interesting ideas
and some things you might

39
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.800
have to think about, but
yeah, when did, when did

40
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.950
this is, this is just
a practice. Is this a

41
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.670
must get discovered? I mean
like the three D printing

42
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.970
is burgeoning and, and, you
know, math certainly is not

43
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.350
well, right? It's not, it's
not starting up. I mean,

44
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.540
math is well, so there's
something of a, it's got

45
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.340
something of a, a reputation
or an unwanted that mathematics

46
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.640
is sort of written in
stone. And what happens is

47
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.000
it gets passed down to,
you know, students and, you

48
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.120
know, what is it the
professional mathematicians do anyway, they're

49
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.250
just doing more hard sums.
And that's really not the

50
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.010
case. I mean, there's, there's
new mathematics getting invented all

51
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.900
the time and that's what
mathematicians do. So, you know,

52
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.130
there's new stuff happening all
the time and, and new

53
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.450
ways of thinking and about
mathematics. And it's often useful

54
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.840
to have a three D
print, for example, something to

55
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.100
visualize some idea. So, yeah,
I mean, so three D

56
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.740
printing has been around, at
least since the eighties, it

57
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.980
was originally used in manufacturing
or design. And I guess

58
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.320
only in the last few
years, as it got accessible

59
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.560
to people in the general
public and academics and so

60
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.140
on. And so, you know,
that combination of take something

61
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.070
that's mathematical and try and
produce a model of it.

62
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.740
That's got a lot easier
now that there's three printing

63
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.520
than, than, than it was
before. So I'm in around

64
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.470
the turn of the previous
century. So 1900, there are

65
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.200
a bunch of people who
are sort of getting into

66
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.880
making plasta models and models
out of string and warden,

67
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.590
so on, and those are
still around, but it's a

68
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.660
lot harder to do, you
know, if you have to

69
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.820
sort of make it from
scratch, whereas if you've got

70
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.450
a three D printer, then
it's yeah, well, it's, it's

71
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.340
a lot more accessible. Interesting.
So you're saying that if

72
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.500
I go back to the,
you know, the early days,

73
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.240
if I go a hundred
years back, yeah. I'll be

74
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.540
doing my math on a
chalkboard on paper, you know,

75
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.220
in, in pairs, in groups
and they were themselves building

76
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.460
models so that they might
get there. Yeah. So, so

77
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.540
there's another sort of interesting
thing throughout mathematical history is

78
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.350
sort of whether or not
you want to draw pictures

79
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.470
and make models has gone
in and out of fashion.

80
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.540
So, so there were people
back in the day, making

81
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.040
plastic models of algebra accepts
is who knows what and

82
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.180
beautiful, fantastic craftsmanship. And I
mean, given the technology at

83
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.080
the time difficult to do,
and then there was a,

84
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.070
there was a long dark
period when people decided, well,

85
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.890
you know, pictures are sort
of squirrely, right? You can,

86
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.890
you can think that you're
seeing something when actually, you

87
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.470
know, it's not, it's not
really rigorous that the argument

88
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.630
doesn't quite follow the you're
not drawing all of the

89
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.420
different cases. And so there
was a long period when

90
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.150
sort of pictures and diagrams
were frowned upon, and maybe

91
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.720
there's this sort of in
the modern era, you know,

92
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.940
people are saying, well, you
know, there's different ways to

93
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.100
do things. And you want
to find different ways to

94
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.350
communicate, say mathematics, different ways
of communicating work for different

95
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.900
people. And so for some
people, the pictures are really,

96
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.360
really helpful. And so, yeah,
it's, it's come back in

97
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.520
and out of fashion. And
I guess at the moment,

98
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.130
there's a lot of, you
know, emphasis on how do

99
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.730
you get people into STEM
subjects? And so, so people

100
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.300
sort of, well, whatever goes
right. I mean, if you

101
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.750
can find something that interests
people then go for it.

102
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.010
Interesting. So it almost is
a matter of how to

103
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.430
different people think there's public.
There are probably math people

104
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.830
who are for lack of
a better word, a little

105
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.240
more snooty that they're like,
well, we don't need to

106
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.240
visualize this. Right. Surely surely
you can hold that. You

107
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.600
know, that three manifold There's,
I mean, there's plenty of

108
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.770
mathematics that doesn't require pictures
at all. I mean, mathematics

109
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.830
is a very broad endeavor
and, you know, there's some

110
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.870
things we agree on, right?
You should always need to

111
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.530
prove things, any of your
statements, but the kinds of

112
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.980
objects that people think about,
you know, very hugely the,

113
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.370
the, this, this is another
sort of unusual thing about

114
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.610
mathematics as a subject is,
you know, I don't really

115
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.560
know what the guy in
the next door office does.

116
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.890
Right. It's sort of too
far away from what I

117
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.230
do for me to really
be, I, you know, I

118
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.040
know the broad outlines, but
very, very broad. And so,

119
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.900
yeah, I mean, there's, there's
somebody down the hall who

120
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.080
never draws any pictures at
all. Whereas I'm drawing pictures

121
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.630
all the time. And a
lot of the priests that

122
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.780
I write are in terms
of pictures, you, you know,

123
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.520
you, you have some sort
of, you have some sort

124
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.280
of common tutorial diagram and
you say, well, you know,

125
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.600
if I do this kind
of move, then this thing

126
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.100
happens, right. It's it's the,
the argument is infectious. And

127
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.930
for a lot of people,
no pictures at all ever.

128
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.820
Yeah. Was the first person
who really got excited about

129
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.270
visualizing things physically. Was it
Felix Klein in the late

130
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:47.680
eighties? I mean, I would
go back to the prehistoric

131
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.020
era. I mean, it's, it's
sort of hard to see.

132
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.660
Right. Well, so the, the
Greeks, the ancient Greeks were

133
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.360
very into, you know, geometry.
I mean, that was sort

134
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.600
of the first, you know,
that the Euclidean geometry was

135
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.680
maybe the, the really first
instance of what we'd think

136
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.890
of as rigorous mathematics, where
you actually prove things rather

137
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.130
than, you know, just sort
of, there's plenty of mathematics

138
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.500
in Babylonian times and so
on where you need to

139
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.800
calculate, you know, areas of
land or, or, or taxes

140
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.960
or whatever it is, but
they weren't proving things back

141
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.310
then. But yeah, so the
Greeks, you know, 2000 BC

142
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.660
maybe don't quote me on
that. We're, we're drawing pictures

143
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.670
and he goes, it goes
back even further than that.

144
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.960
So there were sort of
neolithic carvings on stone that

145
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.980
appear to be, you know,
there's sort of, there's a,

146
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.460
there's a stone which sort
of carved in with nodules

147
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.590
and it looks like it's
a cube or maybe a

148
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.260
dodecahedron, there's some debate over
exactly what was going on.

149
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.240
And it, we don't have
any, any history of that,

150
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.200
but people were, you know,
saying here's this pattern of

151
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.230
dots on a sphere, which
sort of looks like a

152
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.510
cube back in, you know,
before any written history was

153
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.180
there at all. Hmm. When,
when Klein in Germany went

154
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.830
and drew and created these
plaster molds, then they started

155
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.980
to manufacture them. Right. And
give them, like, it seems

156
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.380
like you could go to
all the work of doing

157
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.270
this yourself, but that would
be a lot of, that'd

158
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.910
be a lot of, yeah.
Right. Right. Well, I mean,

159
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.880
and it's amazing, you know,
that the craftsmanship of how

160
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.030
they did it, they, so
you, you're building some shape

161
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.900
of some surface out of
plasta, as I understand it,

162
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.150
what they did is they,
they did it in slices.

163
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.660
So they would, you know,
very carefully plot out, you

164
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.610
know, he has, he has
a slice at a particular

165
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.650
height and they would have
to figure out what the

166
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.190
contour line was and, you
know, cut that out or

167
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.720
whatever it is they had
to do and then stack

168
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.390
them up and then somehow
smooth it down. But yeah,

169
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.570
very, very hard work these
days, of course, with three

170
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.600
D printing, it's a lot
easier, there's all kinds of

171
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.690
programs and we can write
your own programs to generate

172
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.150
the, the geometry and then
get it three D printed

173
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.600
and yet much, much easier.
Yeah. That was my, kind

174
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.900
of my, my subquestion there
was looking at this and

175
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:08.150
thinking about there's no computers,
there's, there's minimal mechanical help.

176
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.400
Is there not to get
it right. Right. Well, back

177
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:16.370
in yeah. 1900 or so.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, right.

178
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.250
Well, the, the, the modern
computer certainly didn't exist back

179
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.040
then. Yeah. So it was
just sort of hand calculation

180
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.830
and, and, and they came
out with these amazing things.

181
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.890
Yeah. I mean, I can,
I'm trying to put this

182
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.960
in the context of someone
who is, you know, who

183
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.050
did college math and then
stopped. Right. You know, and

184
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.810
I understand how tedious it
would be to, you know,

185
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.600
take a parabola and plot
it out, you know, in

186
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.140
some detail in just two
dimensions. Right. And then you

187
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.320
add two or three and
then Just stack them up.

188
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.830
Well, I mean, somehow this
is, this is just more

189
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.370
general, more generally true, right.
That people spend a long

190
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.240
time doing things that now
we wouldn't want to wait,

191
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.290
you know, a half an
hour Patience, patience existed in

192
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.450
the old days. So all
of these stories of people

193
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.070
calculating, you know, the N
digit of PI or something,

194
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.000
and, or one of these,
you know, just calculate out

195
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.460
this thing that today you
can run in, you know,

196
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.760
seconds on a computer and,
you know, somewhere in year

197
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.950
three, they made a mistake
and all of the digits

198
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:24.230
afterwards of wrong, you know,
I mean, it's just, I

199
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.530
guess a, you know, I
mean, looking back, right. It's,

200
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.160
it's a, yeah, it was
a, it was a slower

201
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.910
time and the same with,
with, with math research and

202
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.750
just the flow of ideas,
you know, back then, the

203
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.690
way that things happened was
that, you know, people would

204
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.240
send letters to each other
via snail, snail mail, and

205
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.960
maybe they'd wait for, you
know, a publication to come

206
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.730
out in a journal. And
you know, that the, if,

207
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.800
if the, if the journal
was well, this is still

208
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.720
sort of true. If the
journal is in Russia, then

209
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.030
you know, it doesn't, it
doesn't make it over to

210
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.940
the English speaking world or
the French speaking world for

211
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.900
another 20 years or so.
And now, you know, so

212
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.100
there's electronic archives where people
figure something out and they

213
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.940
posted on, on the, the
archive. And, you know, the

214
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.360
email gets sent out to
everybody who's following that subject

215
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.430
and people know about it,
you know, the next day.

216
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.020
So yeah, things are much,
much faster than it used

217
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.280
to be at well. So
has the world of visualizing

218
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.310
mathematics with three D printing
exploded with the idea that

219
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.230
I can go to home
Depot and buy a three

220
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.590
D printer? I dunno if
it's exploded as, I mean,

221
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.610
I mean, well, three D
printing as you know, is,

222
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.380
is getting to be more
and more mainstream. I'm the

223
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.320
combination of the two, I
don't know, there's a few

224
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.380
people sort of doing this
and figuring out how to,

225
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.570
you know, how do I
teach a class using three

226
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.840
D prints? How do I
teach a math class? I

227
00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.150
think there's a lot of
intersections between what any new

228
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.720
technology and an academic subject
there's going to be, well,

229
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.140
how can I use do
this? I mean, I've also

230
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.830
started thinking about using virtual
reality or augmented reality for

231
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.860
this kind of thing. And,
you know, it's sort of,

232
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:20.370
well, whatever, w w what
is a good way to

233
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.530
use this technology to do
something that couldn't be done

234
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.300
before to reach other people?
So, yeah, I mean, I

235
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.210
guess my, my, the question
underneath that is when you're

236
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.110
hanging out, wherever mathematicians hung
out, you know, in the,

237
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.470
in the mathematician, you know,
kitchen at a conference or

238
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.590
at a conference, and you're,
and you're going on about

239
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.240
how you just built something
and it's with a three

240
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.550
D printer and how it
helped you understand it, or

241
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.830
to help the class understand
it. Okay. Do the other

242
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.940
mathematicians look at you like,
Oh, you know, Henry, This,

243
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.980
this, I mean that you
get both. Right. And it

244
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.520
depends. So I, you know,
a lot of people are

245
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.230
really excited and, you know,
want to get hold of

246
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.010
a model of, of something
that I've made or, or

247
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.990
quite a few of the
things I've made come out

248
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.540
of conversation, whereas where somebody
is like, you know, so

249
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.100
the start of all of
my talks, I spend 10

250
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.890
minutes explaining this thing. If
only I had a model,

251
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.170
then I could just sort
of show people. And then

252
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.910
they tell me what the
thing is. And we try

253
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.180
and work out how to
make a model. So yes,

254
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.000
there's, some people are really
enthusiastic and particularly, I guess

255
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.990
people think in pictures, there
is some resistance. And, and

256
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.090
there's just, this is sort
of a more general thing.

257
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.940
There's some resistance to communicating
with the outside world in

258
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.220
a sense. I mean, there
was some, there were some,

259
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.920
well, yeah, there was some
mathematicians who were like, well,

260
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.400
you know, if you, if
you didn't make it, if

261
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.980
you're not at least a
graduate student, then you never

262
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.050
got on to sand what
I do. So there's not

263
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.700
really any point in talking
to you. I mean, you

264
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.940
know, I may be exaggerating
a little, well, yeah. But

265
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.350
I mean, there's a lot
of mathematics, which, I mean,

266
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.370
I mean, I'm lucky, right.
In a sense that the

267
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.320
area that I've gone into
lends itself to an illustration,

268
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.980
which can be appreciated by
members of the, the general

269
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:15.020
public. And there's lots of
very beautiful, you know, meaningful

270
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.700
and difficult mathematics, which you
can see unless you've spent,

271
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.190
you know, at least a
couple of years in graduate

272
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.980
school to understand what the
objects are that we're talking

273
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:32.060
about. So, you know, that
there's not necessarily a Royal

274
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:37.070
road to the mathematics that
you're interested in, in some

275
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.230
cases there is well on
the, you can get a

276
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.570
sense of things. And in
some cases, that just isn't

277
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.330
true, which isn't to say
that the stuff that, that,

278
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.480
that, that people are doing
isn't useful. I mean, you

279
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.720
can't really tell, or, you
know, good, right. You can't

280
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.330
tell what's going to be
useful down the line. And

281
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.930
well, there's this whole other
debate of, are we doing

282
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.450
mathematics because it's useful to
society, or are we doing

283
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.480
mathematics because for its own
sake, you know, as a,

284
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.420
as a sort of art
form in a way, but

285
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.650
yeah. I mean, if you,
if you want to go

286
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.490
the useful route, then it's,
it's impossible to tell what's

287
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.740
going to be useful a
hundred years down the line.

288
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.080
This is exactly what people
need in order to solve

289
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:19.150
whatever problem they're trying to
solve. Well, Thinking about it,

290
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.180
there's the artistic, you know,
benefits of it. There's the

291
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.390
practical applications of it. Right.
But, you know, just using

292
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.640
one of your videos as
an example, and I would

293
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.810
encourage people to go and
check out your YouTube channel.

294
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.570
You have one that's called
tetrahedral racks, tetrahedral rack, tetrahedral

295
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.090
racks. And it's, it looks
like, you know, it's almost

296
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.700
like a kind of gear
on three different axes, but

297
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.370
it moves in a way
that this is what got

298
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.600
my Cool. Yeah. So, so
I mean, maybe just to

299
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.800
describe what's going on for,
for people who haven't seen

300
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.980
the video. So it's, it's
a three D printed mechanism

301
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:01.750
and as these four different
kind of rod pieces that

302
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.090
slide into each other, well,
actually each, each of these

303
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.670
rods has sort of three
different sticks on it and

304
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:10.150
they've got teeth like gear
teeth. Well, so, so rack

305
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.120
is, is so like a
rack and pinion mechanism is

306
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.760
where you have sort of
an ordinary gear, like a

307
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.450
circular gear, then it's, then
it's, the teeth are pushing

308
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:24.370
a straight beam, which has
teeth in it as well.

309
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.220
So you can move this.
So this changes between sort

310
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.050
of rotational and translational movement
anyways. So that's racks, that's

311
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.200
what, that's what the term
means. And so there's these

312
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.050
four of these, and they're
arranged in the symmetries of

313
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.620
a tetrahedron, so tetrahedral racks
and all four of them

314
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.370
somehow move through each other
in this sort of complicated

315
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:50.220
way. So, I mean, so,
right. So this is, this

316
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.820
is maybe closer to art
than, than mathematics will perhaps

317
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.320
engineering, right? I mean, there
was sort of a, an

318
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.610
engineering challenge. Can you make
geared things that move in

319
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.970
this way and can only
move in this way? But

320
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:13.380
yeah, it produces this surprising
motion. I mean, I guess,

321
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.030
I don't know if the
question is, is this useful

322
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.060
for anything or is it
What I'm saying is that

323
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.790
when I look at that,
or there's another video you

324
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:24.050
have on number file called
three gears are possible where,

325
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.660
you know, one might say,
this doesn't look practical, but

326
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.490
it is a kind of
three dimensionals constrained gear that

327
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.640
might very well be possible
or would be useful rather.

328
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.940
Well, someone might be looking
at that from a manufacturing

329
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.830
perspective and saying, that's exactly
what I needed. I didn't

330
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.410
even know that was possible.
It's possible. I mean, you

331
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.010
know, I, frankly I'd be
skeptical because you know, the,

332
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.490
the, well to the, the,
I mean, both of these,

333
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.920
these mechanisms and other things
I've done, you know, I'm

334
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.920
not worrying about it, you
know, efficiently transferring force, of

335
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.070
course, you know, so if
you want something to be

336
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.840
actually part of a motor,
there's all kinds of other

337
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.000
things that you need to
need to worry about. So

338
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.560
I'm sort of more interested
in just like, what are

339
00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.960
the possibilities, but yeah, absolutely.
I mean, you know, these

340
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.920
good, if not this mechanism,
then, then be an inspiration

341
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.300
for somebody else to, to
say, Oh wait, maybe I

342
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.670
can modify what I'm working
on using this idea or

343
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.720
something like that. I mean,
well, just, just the sort

344
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.960
of broader point there, you
know, what is, what is

345
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:29.990
math good for you? You
don't necessarily model the real

346
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.650
world very well, right? You
model sorta aspects of it.

347
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.570
And this is one of
the ways in which you

348
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.960
can sort of see that
math started is you've got

349
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.090
the real world is complicated
and messy and you take

350
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.400
some aspect of it and
you, you say, okay, if

351
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.260
I throw all of this
stuff, all the other stuff

352
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.060
away, then I can actually
say something, I can actually

353
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.090
prove something. Right. But, and
then maybe that is useful.

354
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.000
And maybe it isn't, and
then you sort of get

355
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.660
interested in the, in the,
you know, the questions and

356
00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.650
the, the, the setting in
its own. Right. And then

357
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.570
maybe it comes back into
contact with the real world

358
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.110
later, or maybe not. That's
also cool. What are the

359
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.740
other thing that I'm finding
fascinating. And again, please do

360
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.190
forgive my lack of proper
math, but there's a, the,

361
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.730
the, the dementia, the addition
of, of other dimensions that

362
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.570
dimensionality of this has been
amazing. So starting with the,

363
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.860
with the racks or the
gears where the extra dimension

364
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:30.680
is time you're seeing and
experiencing something, that's, three-dimensional moving

365
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.930
through time, you can move
it with your own body.

366
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.080
So as, as a learner,
it's very, it's very kinesthetic.

367
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.070
You know, it, it reinforces
what you already know or

368
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.890
what you think you already
know, so that the addition

369
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.990
of time seems really powerful,
but then you also have

370
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:50.680
a whole series on four
space. Yeah. Something looks cool,

371
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.560
and then you look at
it as a shadow and

372
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.820
then it looks impossibly. Cool.
So, I mean, just on

373
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.420
the sort of point of
kinesthetic. So I think there's

374
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.790
a really good point though.
Like, you know, what is

375
00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.010
three D printing good for,
as, you know, if you're

376
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.380
looking around and saying, what
can I do with this

377
00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.260
thing that I can't do
in some other medium than

378
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.330
the you're able to touch
it, you're able to, to,

379
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.110
you know, see it in
your full stereo vision in

380
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.010
real life. The bandwidth of
reality is really good. So,

381
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.940
so, so yeah, that, that's,
that's an, so you can,

382
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.690
you can get quite that
sort of level of fidelity

383
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.030
with, you know, a fancy
computer animation or something. So,

384
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.250
so, yeah, so, so I,
you know, I liked three

385
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.090
D printed things, you know,
you can that move and

386
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.010
you can move with your
own hands so that you're

387
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.890
not just watching a movie
of something. And also, you

388
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.500
know, there's some interaction with,
with the real world to

389
00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.860
say, I mean, you mentioned
these, these shadow things. So

390
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:51.540
there was sort of two
different levels here. So this

391
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.260
casting shadows of three-dimensional things
onto the two dimensional table

392
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.070
with an actual physical lights,
right? So, so this sort

393
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.760
of goes into the, again,
the, the, the three D

394
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.460
printing is an object in
the real world, and you

395
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.000
understand bits of plastic and
you understand, you know, a,

396
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.300
a flashlight. And so, you
know, it's real in a

397
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.150
way that a computer animation
of some shadows is less

398
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:19.110
real somehow. So, so, so
that's the one point that,

399
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.380
you know, casting shadows from
2d, some, sorry, from 3d

400
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.990
to Tootie. And then as
you say, the sort of

401
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.460
the next level up is
casting shadows of four dimensional,

402
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.960
some things into three dimensions,
which, you know, we don't

403
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.810
have, as far as we
know, physical four dimensional things,

404
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.500
but we can imagine what
they will be like, and

405
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.480
we can calculate what their
shadows would be like. So,

406
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.970
right. So shadows take you
from something dimensional thing too,

407
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.120
as something minus one dimensional
thing. So if you have

408
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.870
afforded to you who cast
a shadow down into the,

409
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.180
under the table, which is
three D, which is a

410
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:05.190
three dimensional slice through four
dimensional space, and then, then

411
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.200
it's in three dimensions, so
I can print it. So

412
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:12.150
Leah, that that's right. So
I guess this is another

413
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.350
direction that mathematicians or some
acquisitions go is, is try

414
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.720
and figure out what's going
on in, in other contexts.

415
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:23.100
Right. I understand two dimensional
geometry. I understand three dimensional

416
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.680
geometry. Well, what happens if
I try doing it with

417
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.320
four and one of the
ways to try and see

418
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.810
what's going on is, is
this sort of casting shadows,

419
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.990
and there's, there's a few
other checks it's sort of

420
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:38.730
difficult because, Mmm. We did
not evolve in a world

421
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.410
which had any four-dimensional things
in it. So, so, you

422
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.220
know, our visualization skills need
a lot of help to,

423
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.610
to try and get some
sort of sense of what's

424
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.890
going on. Have you ever
made something or printed something

425
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.920
where you didn't fully understand
what you were going to

426
00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.900
get until you got the
led and projected? So well,

427
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.050
so, so this is the,
the flashlight chatter thing. I

428
00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:09.580
mean, so, so, so this
one, those ones, I, I,

429
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.100
well, usually what happens is
I know what the shadow

430
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.590
is going to be first.
And then I make the

431
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.590
three D object that's going
to cast that shadow as

432
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.330
a result. Right. So I
already know what I want

433
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.080
to draw, but that sort
of broader question was it,

434
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.720
I guess there's two levels
of that question. One, when

435
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.400
I finally get the 3d
pen in my hand, do

436
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.870
I notice something new and
too, there's this sort of

437
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.360
step of an even when
I, when it appears on

438
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.940
my computer screen and I've
drawn this thing in three

439
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.550
dimensions, do I see something
new and both of those

440
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:44.230
can happen? Yeah. So, so
an example, when, so, so

441
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:49.600
I mostly use Shapeways, so
that selective laser centering fancy

442
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:54.520
stuff, rather than that kind
of desktop. So you prefer

443
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.190
to order your three D
prints. I mean, I sort

444
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.740
of started out that way.
I was sort of cheaper

445
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.350
to start up and, you
know, the quality's really nice

446
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:08.200
sort of the, you know,
centered plastic. You don't really

447
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.120
see the layers so much
and it kind of has.

448
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.970
Yeah. I mean, it's a
really nice aesthetic. The downside

449
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.820
is you can sort of
iterate very quickly because, you

450
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.200
know, it takes a week
for them to send you

451
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.250
something. But yeah, I mean,
the, the, the, the, the

452
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.870
shape way stuff is, is,
is really nice. And it

453
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.420
sort of has this sort
of is this white plastic

454
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.740
that sort of it's matte,
you don't really see how

455
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.750
it was made. And it's
just, it has a sort

456
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:39.670
of, almost kind of almost
other worldly in, in some

457
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:44.890
ways, right. It, it doesn't
look like, it looks like

458
00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:48.250
it's sort of just made
out of, of prime primordial

459
00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.950
substance. Right. And it doesn't,
it doesn't look like it,

460
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.620
it just looks like geometry.
And, and for, for displaying

461
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.780
the mathematics, that's sort of
what you want. You just

462
00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.210
want it to be, yeah,
That's a really good point.

463
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.790
You wouldn't want the, you
know, the three D printing

464
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:04.330
and inexpensive desktop, three D
printers have that, that textured

465
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.670
look where it's clear, each
layer has been put there

466
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.060
and it would take away
from Sometimes you do want

467
00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.190
that, right. If you, if
you're saying, look, look, here

468
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.490
are the contours of this
shape. And you can see

469
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.190
how they, how the, you
know, like consoles on a,

470
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:23.230
on a, a geographical map.
And, and so the printer

471
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.570
gives you that for free,
but you don't always want

472
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.040
that. But, but yeah, so,
so, so one time this,

473
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.050
this, you know, do I
notice something new when I

474
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.900
get the three D print?
So, so there was one

475
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.020
it's called Hilbert cube, I
think will help it curve.

476
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:41.470
Something like that. This is
a very squiggly curve that

477
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.450
kind of fills up a
cube in space. And this

478
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.640
is there's. This whole area
of mathematics is interested in

479
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.610
space filling curves, which is
somehow COEs that are so

480
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.450
squiggly that they, they kit
every point. So it's a

481
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.390
one dimensional curve somehow, but
it hits every point of

482
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.420
a two dimensional square or
a three dimensional cube. So

483
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.790
there's some sort of strange
things going on there, but

484
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.660
anyway, so, so, so, well,
it wasn't hitting every point,

485
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.160
this three D print, it
was just sort of a,

486
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.010
an approximation of it, which
is, it looks a bit

487
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.240
like ramen noodles. And, and,
and I sort of, you

488
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.780
know, I I'd known it,
you know, I know I

489
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.090
knew if this shape for
a long time, and it

490
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.910
was always this sort of
rigid mathematical thing with lots

491
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.280
of right angles. And then
I get it and it's

492
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.790
real springy because it's like
ramen noodles. And I guess

493
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.710
I hadn't realized that it
was going to be like

494
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.120
that. It was, it was
a big shock. Yeah, it

495
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.280
was, it was, it was
hard in your mind. It

496
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.620
would, it didn't flex. Right,
Right. In my mind is

497
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.260
this rigid mathematical object. And
then the real, the real

498
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.170
world, it's got all of
these engineering problems and then,

499
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:51.290
well, right. That's a whole
other story that you, you

500
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.050
end up with a w
when you want to make

501
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.560
a model, you'll your mathematical
objects does need to deal

502
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.550
with gravity and, you know,
technical problems of actually printing

503
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.050
things. And then, so there's
a whole lot of sort

504
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.990
of engineering problems that sometimes
go into this, which leads,

505
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.530
it leads to interesting questions.
Yeah. So one of my

506
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.180
questions is how many of
these will I be able

507
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.260
to print versus with my
first, Which we just won't

508
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.140
be supportable. Right. Right. So,
I mean, some of them

509
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.690
are just not going to
be possible on today's desktop

510
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.700
printers. I mean, this is
sort of things with hinges.

511
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.030
Like, I mean, you can
do hinges on desktop printers,

512
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.640
but I've got models with,
you know, hundreds of hinges

513
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.300
sort of flexible surface that
I think will be very

514
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.270
difficult to do on a
desktop printer. But I've actually,

515
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.430
I've been surprised. I mean,
you know, when I was

516
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.070
writing the book, I, I
was sorta thinking my mind

517
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.580
in the back of my
mind. Well, hopefully people actually,

518
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.410
I was hoping by the
time I'm done with this

519
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.440
book, surely the technology will
have moved on so far

520
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.170
that everybody will be able
to print everything at no

521
00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.380
cost. And that hasn't happened,
but maybe in the future,

522
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.640
but there's, there's a surprising
number of them that people

523
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.470
are having a lot of
success with. So, I mean,

524
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.870
that's well said, so all
of the, well, almost all

525
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.360
of the models on thing
of us and, you know,

526
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:07.880
somehow that's the point is
he put the stuff up

527
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.690
and then people print it
and show, look, I made

528
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.520
it, here's a photograph and
here are the settings that

529
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.920
I used. Or sometimes people
get back to me and

530
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.660
say, you know, could you
make the base of it

531
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.820
thicker so that it sticks
to my they'll play better

532
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.340
on this. Oh, okay. I
can do that. And sometimes

533
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.250
people, you know, modify them
themselves. And that's a really

534
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.400
great thing about, about a
site, like thing of verses

535
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.380
that, you know, it's sort
of built in to let

536
00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.110
people share the things and
modify them and get them

537
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.170
working on their printers. So,
so some not all of

538
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.380
them, but quite a few
of them seem to work

539
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.310
well. And, you know, lots
of people are printing. I'm

540
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.470
working on printing. The you've
got one that is a

541
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.300
stereographics projection. Yeah. The, the
sort of, it's a, it's

542
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.840
a sort of sphere with
the top missing. And a

543
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.460
lot of people seem to
have done that. And I

544
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.270
was surprised Little vase that
you put in, and what's

545
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.610
interesting about it is that
it's almost like a puzzle

546
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.470
in the sense of, it
just looks like pretty vase,

547
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.720
and then you move the
light around and nothing particularly

548
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.480
interesting happens at cast some
nice shadows. And then there's

549
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.330
a moment when, if you
get the shadow, right, right.

550
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.740
It turns into a grid
and it's just impossible. A

551
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.870
square grid. Yeah. It's a,
it's a, it's a surprising,

552
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.430
yeah. It's a good, a
good payoff. That one is

553
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.340
sort of like it's, as
you say, it's a magic

554
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.940
trick, but it's real because
it's a piece of plastic

555
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.480
and a flashlight. Right. You
know, that we know how,

556
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.660
how these things work. So
I, and, and this is

557
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:35.010
a yeah, and this is
a illustrating a stereographics projection

558
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.280
is a particular way to
map a sphere onto, onto

559
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.470
the plane. In fact, this
is the, I, I think

560
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.680
the ancient Greeks knew about
this. It's sort of in

561
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.990
the same class of things
like the Makeda projection, right?

562
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.170
So the, the ordinary map
of the earth, well, it's

563
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.910
sort of out of favor
favor these days, because, cause

564
00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.270
it, you know, Africa RPA
as much smaller than relative

565
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:04.400
to Greenland or so, so
things near the equator seems

566
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.430
smaller than they, they are
income incapacity things away from

567
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:11.940
the equator. So that's sort
of social regions, not to,

568
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.220
not to really favor that
map anymore, but anyway, that

569
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.540
aside, so the Makeda rejection,
all of these other ways

570
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.970
of drawing maps are ways
to try and solve the

571
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.690
problem of drawing the surface
of a sphere on the

572
00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:28.140
plane. And, you know, this
is impossible to do without

573
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.920
breaking something. Right. You, you
know, if you get your

574
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.600
orange peel and you try
and lay it flat on

575
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.410
the, on the table, then
it has to crack. And

576
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.410
yeah. So Sarah got from
projection was I think maybe

577
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.320
the first or one of
the first ways that people,

578
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.860
the people forward to draw
a picture of, of the

579
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.320
earth on, on the plane.
And so it's in that

580
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.030
tradition of sort of mapmaking
mapmaking, but it's a, it's

581
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:59.040
a really beautiful, it's a
really beautiful way to map

582
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.200
things. It's, it's got a
lot of very nice properties.

583
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.570
It's very simple to write
down and yeah, I mean,

584
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.750
this is sort of a
really great way to see

585
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.780
it and to see what
the map is doing. Cause

586
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.550
you just follow the light
rays and you can do

587
00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:16.470
it. I I've thought right.
The next thing is, well,

588
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.470
can you take a three
D printed, you know, sphere

589
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.940
with the continence and somehow
put a light inside of

590
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.500
it. So there's some way
you got to shadow this,

591
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.770
the Makeda projection. And unfortunately
that appears to be impossible.

592
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.080
I wish it would possible.
I don't know how to

593
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.710
do that. That would be
amazing. I mean, that would

594
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.610
be pretty constant. Yeah. Be
classy. So people can go

595
00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:42.560
to D print, math.com. I
can click buy now at

596
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.800
the top and they can
see you visualizing mathematics for

597
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.830
three D printing. They can
go to Shapeways. And if

598
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.710
they just Google for Henry
sacrament printing, you have a

599
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.500
beautiful website at Shapeways. And
even if you don't have

600
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.420
a three D printer, you
can go and order some

601
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.190
of these inexperienced, this, this
magic yourself. All right. So,

602
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:06.430
so at the website, there's
also, there's an embedded sort

603
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.330
of 3d viewers from Sketchfab.
So, so you, you don't

604
00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.980
even need the three D
prints if you want to.

605
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.900
Well, I mean, you can
look at the photos in

606
00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.570
the book, but you can't
turn them around sort of

607
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.240
that there's an irony there
in writing a book about

608
00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.900
how awesome three D printing
is for illustrating things. But,

609
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.450
but yeah. So on the
website, you can, there's these

610
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:29.200
little embedded windows where you
can move the model around

611
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.480
and zoom in and fly
around it and get a

612
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.460
sense of what it is.
Maybe not quite as good,

613
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.110
a sense as if you're
holding it in your hands,

614
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.890
but still pretty good. Cool.
Well, thank you so much

615
00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:42.490
for chatting with me today.
Great. This was fun. This

616
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.770
has been another episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

617
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:45.700
again next week.
