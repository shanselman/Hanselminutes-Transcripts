Our weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.540
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number 562. In this episode,

10
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.950
Scott talks with us air
force veteran, Jerome Hardaway about

11
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.510
vets who code. This is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

12
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.930
episode of Hansel minutes today.
We're talking with Jerome Hardaway

13
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.350
from veterans who code vets,
who code.io. How are you,

14
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.810
sir? Hey, how are you
doing? Thank you for having

15
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.530
me to, yeah, absolutely. So
you were in the air

16
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.320
force, right? Yes, sir. I
was the United States air force

17
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.770
security forces and a part
of the Phoenix Raven program.

18
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.710
And how long were you
in? I was in for

19
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.580
about five years and 10
months. And it was that

20
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.260
something that where you had
a career and then you

21
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.330
joined the air force and
then you left or did

22
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.930
you go straight in from
school? I went straight in

23
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.000
from a high school. I
was initially going to go

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.640
to college to turn around
the side of it. I

25
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.360
wanted to go use the
air force and see what

26
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.340
type of opportunities are there
from where they're from me.

27
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.460
Most of my family they've
served. So I wanted to

28
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.910
do my part before I
went on to the rest

29
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.250
of my life as well.
Is that a, is that

30
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.100
really a common path for
folks to go in right

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.870
out of high school? Yes.
There's a enlisted, enlisted, which

32
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.510
is, you know, most people
either go to high, go

33
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.790
right out of high school
or some with some college,

34
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.280
but to be an officer
it's not like how it

35
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.740
was in world war one
and world war two, where

36
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.100
you can, where they could
like make you an officer.

37
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.320
Even if you were enlisted,
you have to have a

38
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.490
degree for that to be,
to become a military company.

39
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.710
Great officer. And when folks
come out, so like, I'm,

40
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.180
I'm just, I'm imagining you're
in high school, your high

41
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.940
school, you consider your different
options. You go into the

42
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.970
air force, you do five,
six years, and then do

43
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.130
people stay in for the
rest of their lives or

44
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.720
do they come out and
say, all right, now I

45
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.290
will go into college with
my GI bill money for

46
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.460
50% of the military. Now
that answer is they get

47
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.950
out the military and try
to go to school or

48
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.170
try to pursue other things
right now the military and

49
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.440
like marriage has liked the,
or has liked the same

50
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.480
divorce rate as we like
to say about 50%. Yeah.

51
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.570
About 50% of all people
get divorced about 50% of

52
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.430
all people that enter the
military get out of their

53
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.240
first time. So interesting. Okay.
And how long does the

54
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.260
term first term King any
go in or from four

55
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.070
to six years? They you're
usually you're considered a first

56
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.790
term veteran if you are
first. Yeah. First time veteran,

57
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.260
I guess be the best
way to say, is there

58
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.540
any branch for only four
years? So that's usually what

59
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.330
a, they that's how the
military does. It is four

60
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.370
years and the eight year
Mark, then the 10 year

61
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.820
Mark is those all like
big deals in the military

62
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.030
then 20 years. And you
could retire after 20. So

63
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.160
when you come out and
it's like, all right, I'm

64
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.780
going to go get a
job. Let's say, then you

65
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.960
put on your suit and
you start doing interviews. When

66
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.740
people look at your resume
and they see, they see

67
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.860
that you were in the
military, what does the hiring

68
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.310
manager think? Do they think
this person had a very

69
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.010
important job for five years
or do they think that's,

70
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.900
did they do? They imply
that that's a gap and

71
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.430
that's not valuable time first
and foremost, the first thing

72
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.980
is you'd be amazed how
many veterans don't even own

73
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.980
a suit when they get
out of the military. The

74
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.570
transitional process of getting out
of the military to the

75
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.730
becoming a member is civilian
society is extremely broken. We

76
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.630
have what is called a
taps broke program, but outside

77
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.980
of the most extensive part
of it is prepping to

78
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.670
get you out of the
military system and not prepping

79
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.660
you for your new life.
On average, it's about two

80
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.090
to three days. I've seen
some, I've heard they're getting

81
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.180
better, but I know when
I was in years ago,

82
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.940
it was one day. And
one of our veterans told

83
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.880
me that like it lasted
maybe four days at his

84
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.380
base. So the transition assistance
programs are, you know, there's

85
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.590
not a lot of money
or time invested in it.

86
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.400
And usually it's somebody who,
you know, they served 20

87
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.950
years in the military and
then after they got out,

88
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.370
they took over there, the
transition assistance program as a

89
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.030
civilian. So a lot of
times you're learning about transition,

90
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.690
transitioning out of the military
for somebody who, you know,

91
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.750
was a lifer in the
military and then their, their

92
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.980
transition into the civilian sector
was taking a government job

93
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.350
with the military. You know,
it's like their second job

94
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.860
that they've ever had. So
that's the first hurdle that

95
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.970
we usually see as veterans.
So then we encounter second

96
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.730
hurdle is most people, even
though you see how big

97
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.220
the military is, when you
think of that and correlation

98
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.670
to the United States, about 1%
of all people have served

99
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.840
and in our country. So
as a result, most people

100
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.100
then when it come to
hiring managers, they have no

101
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.210
idea how to read a
military, a resume. So the

102
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.950
second big hurdle is doing
resume interview prep for veterans,

103
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.000
just so we can show
those trans transferrable skills to

104
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.890
a civilian hiring managers and
hiring partners. So outside of

105
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.520
those two big hurdles, that
leaves a lot of room

106
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.640
for misinterpretation by hiring managers,
by civilians, a lot of

107
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.720
people in general. And that's
why you see most veterans.

108
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.390
They try to go back
in a government service, but

109
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.200
in another format, because those
are like the only jobs

110
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.050
or careers that really understand
them. Or if they join

111
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.400
the military, they automatically, you
know, they understand they understand

112
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.480
what you've gone through. So
it's not by choice. Yeah.

113
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.580
You know, I'm thinking, I'm
trying to think about different

114
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.620
kinds of analogies to put
it. There's so many different

115
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.440
ways to look at it.
You're in another, in another

116
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.010
world and another very insular
dimension. You know what I

117
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.900
mean? I would recommend, I
will compare it to the

118
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.680
bubble effect that people are
talking about these days. Like

119
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.870
the military is its own
little bubble. W when I

120
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.630
was in, I had no
idea. I had no idea

121
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.400
about the recession until I
is 13th of 2009. And

122
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.190
that's the day, that's the
Friday that I was out

123
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.770
of service. And then I
was getting, getting into the

124
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.740
civilian world and I just
happened to be watching news

125
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.470
and afternoon. I heard something
about the recession and my

126
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.380
uterus session had been going
on since 2007. I had

127
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.750
been literally a God. Yes,
I'm two years behind the

128
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.260
rest of the world what's
going on. So I'm like,

129
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.520
that is how the military
is. It's almost like a

130
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.730
world within his own self.
The ecosystem is really small.

131
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.490
It's really tight. A lot
of the things that you're

132
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.220
doing are already provided for
you, especially if you're a

133
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.360
young air, a young troop,
young veteran, a lot of

134
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.430
things you don't have to
leave the base or an

135
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.210
installation for. And if you're
in a career like I

136
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.850
was, it had a lot
of high deployment rate. You

137
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.750
didn't really have to, no,
you really don't have that

138
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.660
time to be that outside
of things that really require

139
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.880
your job, paying attention to
you. You didn't have the

140
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.650
time to pay attention to
stuff like CNN. My wife

141
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.200
today makes fun of me
because ever since I was

142
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.700
like 1920, I was watching
CNN for global affairs. And

143
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.660
like, it's just happened like
that. So this bubble, I'm

144
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.430
thinking of all the other
bubbles that are out there,

145
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.770
that someone could be in,
you could be in academia

146
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.050
and then come out of
academia. You can be in

147
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.020
the military and come out.
You could be in the

148
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.810
nonprofit sector. Or like you
said, working for the government.

149
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.110
It's very different than the
private sector. And it sounds

150
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.020
like your people are coming
out with a kind of

151
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.150
a, Hey good luck. You
know, here's some, here's some

152
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:59.160
pamphlets, good luck. There's literally
what we're seeing is getting

153
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.670
better, but it's not getting
better as fast as you

154
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.900
know, when you look at
the numbers, 250,000. No, I

155
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.990
believe it's 25,000. I'm sorry.
25,000 troops are leaving the

156
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.600
service every year. So that's
25,000 new people. They are

157
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.290
needing transition assistance, trying to
get jobs, trying to learn

158
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:25.740
skills every like every year.
It's pretty harboring numbers when

159
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.600
you think of it. So
I am assume that there

160
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.330
are veterans that are in
tech. They were veterans who

161
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.370
are coding as part of
their jobs, but you said

162
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.010
you were in security services.
So I assume that other

163
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.100
than checking email and Skyping
home, there's not a lot

164
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.410
of time to be like
keeping up on what's going

165
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.640
on in the tech industry.
Yes and no. My last

166
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.870
job was a B dot
controller, which has really take

167
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:56.270
heavy in the military. Yeah.
Basically it was in charge.

168
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.690
I was in charge of
a lot of security devices

169
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.560
as well as equipment to
make sure that everybody could

170
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.040
communicate effectively with, in case
of missions. Like we were

171
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.400
outside of the person who's
in charge of the entire

172
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.220
flight or a team, which
is around 52 people who

173
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.850
was there called the flight
Sergeant and the flight commander.

174
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:22.580
Who's the officer in charge.
The, the BDR controller is

175
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.730
beneath them and they are
those. So I was basically

176
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.110
three IC and making sure
that everything was, that our

177
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.340
team was taking care of
the installation correctly. So how

178
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.440
are you keeping up on
what's going on in there?

179
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.330
Like the world of tech,
you just reading blogs and

180
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.220
reading the news. And, and
Well, for me, I wasn't

181
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.530
merged. I was, I did
a lot of Google. I

182
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.110
was a Google. And what
happened, w I had to

183
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.190
take bug bite me around
2006. I had a roommate

184
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:58.550
in Korea who they were
in tech. So they actually

185
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.800
worked on servers on the
installation in South Korea. So, so

186
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.760
picking his brain every once
in a while, seeing what

187
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.140
he was doing really had
me intrigued. So that's how

188
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.440
part of it started. The
other part of it was

189
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.990
basically like, like you said,
when I came out, that's

190
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.040
what I started doing was
devouring. Every book, he's a

191
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.760
literature that I could think
of around 2010, especially when

192
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.330
it came to sequel SQL,
that was like my first

193
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:36.230
like serious, serious job. So
you had, then@whatpointdidyouseeanadvertisementforcode.org? It was

194
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.860
around 2010, 2010. The same
time. Yeah. That's when I

195
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.920
saw that advertisement. And that's
when I started devouring everything

196
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.060
about code. I said, I
worked as a TWIC analyst

197
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.870
for an apartment home security
services or whatever it's called.

198
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.170
I don't even remember the,
these days everybody's name is

199
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:59.110
changing. And part of that
was doing on SQL as

200
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.800
their analyst and handling people's
security clearances, sort of get

201
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.570
on like waterways and things
of that nature. So that

202
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.960
was what my first technically
technical job. Cause I, you

203
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.530
know, it was a lot
of SQL involved, a lot

204
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.950
of search queries, things of
that nature. Then as I

205
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.880
moved on, took a break
cause my, she ended up

206
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.110
getting really ill. So I
came home from my last

207
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.620
duty station to come back
to my hometown, Memphis to

208
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.650
help her. And after about
a year, I was trying

209
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.710
to get back into the
field, started working in a

210
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.730
nonprofit and helping that nonprofit
with his tech and digital

211
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.990
marketing. And then before I
realized it, I had my

212
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.400
all crazy situation. It fell
in my lap to where

213
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.460
I would end up having
to start that Sukkot. Do

214
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.240
you think that your, your
story is a typical one

215
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.760
that, that everyone who is
a vet should get on

216
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.760
code Academy and code.org, or
don't you think that there's

217
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.240
people who have that inner
fire, that they can self-learn,

218
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.310
you know, that autodidact where
it's like, I want to

219
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.860
learn this on my own,
or do you think most

220
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.090
people need some framework within
which they, I do not

221
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.460
think people need a framework
and the work, I think

222
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.990
people can do whatever, like
whatever works for them. Like

223
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.500
I heard about covid.org and
the HTML CSS on code

224
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.200
Academy, but then I moved
right to SQL and they

225
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:34.500
never had SQL course until
like 2015, 2016 or something

226
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.400
like that. And I never,
so I started using a

227
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.680
lot of books, a lot
of likes, a lot of

228
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:46.230
Googling self-learning and doing everything
I could learn SQL. So,

229
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.540
and the same with JavaScript
and PHP. So I think

230
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.590
veterans, you know, we have
that unique tenacity where I

231
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.670
think it has the misconception
is it, we have everything

232
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.410
handed to us where they
don't people aren't sending it.

233
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.710
You know, we regularly deploy
without all the tools needed

234
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.400
to do our job, to
do, to like pricing, you

235
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.130
know, price cuts, things of
that nature where the note

236
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.740
is trying to save money
and we're, you know, innate

237
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.070
problem-solvers because a you're in
a, you know, third world

238
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.680
country and the whole, the
whole goal is to come

239
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.320
back home. And one piece
for Christmas, you have to

240
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.740
figure out the best way
to solve problems that you

241
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.520
may not always have the
best tools for and what

242
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.920
I'm seeing. And what will
we find? The veterans that

243
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.200
we help live at Sukkot
is a lot of these

244
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.870
veterans, they have done a
lot of self study on

245
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.050
their own, and they're just
at a sticking point. So

246
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.310
yeah, there several veterans had
gone through, we were like

247
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.000
on average with our data,
we were about the third

248
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.640
resource they've used after they've
either hit sticking point or

249
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.500
they've expanded all of their
other resources to learn how

250
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.350
to code. Then they come
find us. You'd be amazed

251
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.770
how I'm now 70% of
the people who we set

252
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.930
up, they already have get
hubs. And they've already been

253
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.050
pushing yes. Try and learn
how to code things of

254
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.410
that nature. They, you know,
they're not, they're go getters.

255
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.900
And that's, those are the
people we look for for

256
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:20.210
vet Sukkot. We are not
community-based. We, I take the,

257
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.000
our partners seriously. I take
our donors very seriously and

258
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.310
I want to find that
best talent for us. So

259
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.310
that way we can focus
on finding really talented people,

260
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.000
who agent, they deserve this
opportunity to learn how to

261
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.240
program or have access to
really pull partners or really

262
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.280
pull resources and help them.
They just, you know what

263
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.080
things they're may be standing
in their way or things

264
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.230
like, you know, I have
a family or one, one

265
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:53.330
individual, his steps on it
is a really ill and

266
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.870
other individual. She was working,
she's a spouse and she's

267
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.520
working with her family, but
her husband's overseas. So we

268
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.580
find these people who are
talented, they just need help.

269
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.130
And then now be close
to, you know, a big

270
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.950
coat school city or something
like that. And we take

271
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.780
them and we train them
and we help them get

272
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.230
jobs. And we focus on
a lot of open source

273
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.570
technologies to get that done.
<inaudible> so where does open

274
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.420
source come in? Cause you
described basically all the things

275
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.680
you're using PHP and Ruby
and JavaScript and Python, is

276
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.870
it, was it significant that
you didn't have to go

277
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.210
on a register for something
and download a commercial project?

278
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.030
Like is opensource fundamental to
what you do in your

279
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.030
learning process? Yes. It's one
of the most important why

280
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.900
open source the open source
community is like the lifesaver

281
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.840
of a lot of, not
just myself or a vesicle,

282
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.470
but a lot of programs.
And in general, because that,

283
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.130
that community can make, you
know, they make the best,

284
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.620
some of the best products
for learning how to code

285
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.200
some of the, some of
our products are better than

286
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.280
commercial. Like we were just
on, on Twitter talking about

287
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.130
this earlier this morning, in
regards to how a book

288
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:08.110
is usually recommended for beginner.
Programmers is actually a horrifying

289
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.230
book. If you're a beginner
programmer, trying to learn JavaScript

290
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:16.360
is like, is the scariest
book ever. And we were

291
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.790
talking about how like, you
know, JS for kids is

292
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.940
a better book, or if
you had didn't want to

293
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.000
note school, which is free
and open source is a

294
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.140
great resource. And the Mozilla
tutorial, that's like amazing that,

295
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.230
that their tutorials are beautiful
in regards to a JavaScript.

296
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.380
So just, that's one of
the biggest thing about these

297
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.980
organizations that focus on open
source community, like the no

298
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:47.260
community, the Ruby on rails
community there, they really, if

299
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.950
you wanted to learn how
to program the speed at

300
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.930
a JavaScript's going and the
capabilities that you have with

301
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.940
Ruby and Ruby on rails,
those are some of the

302
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.480
best buy open source products
out there on the web.

303
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.400
And you can learn so
much from just investing time

304
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.190
in the product. Someone brought
up a really interesting phrase

305
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.830
to me recently that I
knew, but hadn't really absorbed.

306
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.260
And they said that we
can teach people to code,

307
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.710
but we're not teaching them
digital literacy. What do you

308
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.810
think about that? Someone said
like, well, you type in

309
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.080
cnn.com and you hit enter
and then a miracle happens.

310
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.960
And the page renders, how
deep do people have to

311
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.690
go? How intuitive to these
things have to be, can

312
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.210
you go and teach someone
node without teaching them about

313
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.240
IP addresses and FTP and
things like that? Or, you

314
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.640
know, where does it Negative?
You need to know how

315
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.580
to deploy an app. Like
for us, we, we teach

316
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.630
Capistrano. We talked to FTP
things of those nature, that

317
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.210
nature. But yeah, you need
to learn how to do

318
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:51.110
stuff. I would compare that
I would compare that to

319
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.460
how veterans are trained when
it comes to borrowing their,

320
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.780
I guess there's one. Now
everybody uses it. Now the

321
00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.260
<inaudible> when it comes to
our, the weapon of choice

322
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.750
to train on the range,
you have to know that

323
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.200
weapon forwards and backwards. You
have to know which type

324
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.020
of rounds can you use
on this 5.5, six or

325
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.360
7.62, are you using fiber
optic Knights Knight skills? Are

326
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.700
we using IRR night skill?
Or if you're going to

327
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.160
using an iron Saigon, I
know the weight have know

328
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.260
all this. How many rounds
per minute, things of that

329
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.930
nature, you have to have
a take it apart from

330
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.620
together, the equivalent of true
troubleshooting it in case something

331
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.480
happens, The brains are wired
this way already. It's like,

332
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.490
okay, I need to know
all these little details. And

333
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.340
I have to be very,
very regimented and very focused

334
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.430
and, and recognize how things
are put together and take

335
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.020
them apart and put them
back together again. So you're

336
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.210
saying the military brain is
set up for this kind

337
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.460
of work, right? It's not,
I wouldn't say set up.

338
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.430
I would say that they
force you to, they ran

339
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.680
that knowledge. I wouldn't say
it that way, but you

340
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.830
get to, yeah, I was
there. So it was either

341
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.040
minus stuff or do pushups.
And if only do something,

342
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.040
maybe we need to do
code school like that more

343
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.330
pushups that would be, I
don't know how people for

344
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.030
profit schools are like that,
but I think it'd be

345
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.810
fun. Be fun. One of
the things that I'm, that

346
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.510
I'm passionate about is trying
to use, you know, the

347
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.090
privileges that I have to
as my friend and Juan

348
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.090
says to lend that privilege
to others. And I know

349
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.020
that you're passionate about helping
underprivileged communities. Would you plug

350
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.890
veterans that are coming out
into the world of coding

351
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.920
as, as being underprivileged? Or
does that word, how wide

352
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.550
does that word go for
you? I think underprivileged and

353
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:49.660
underrepresented is unrepresented a word
I I'll use for veterans.

354
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.940
If you think you just
look at, you have no

355
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.760
further look at how I'm
looking at where veterans are

356
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.150
in Congress, or even in
your community. A lot of,

357
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.490
you know, a lot of
veteran issues and veterans in

358
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.820
general. It's a, especially when
you get out, it's a

359
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.850
uphill battle because you don't
have that advantage of relationships.

360
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.880
All you have is your
service. And hopefully, you know,

361
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.300
out, you know, hopefully you
are a Marine and you

362
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.610
were like how my Marine
groves are. They can live

363
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.160
the rest of their lives,
easy peasy cause they're Marine.

364
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.110
So they can just say,
I'm a Marine. And it's

365
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.340
very, we have a joke
about how a Marine and

366
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.140
army ranger and a airborne
Tru all walk into a

367
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.660
bar. And we know that
because, you know, they told

368
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.630
us the first two minutes
and it's like, and the

369
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.240
civilian sector, that would be
your CrossFitter and your vegan.

370
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.350
So those guys, they tend
to be okay, but it

371
00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.180
still is very underrepresented, like
a community in the civilian

372
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.670
sector. Mm. So do you
think that the, you know,

373
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.410
the, the way that we're
moving in the state of

374
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.980
tech inclusion is getting better
and this will help, you

375
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.920
know, veterans that we're, now
that we're aware that, you

376
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.200
know, I'll use the word
diversity in a, in a

377
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.840
broad sense that different kinds
of people from different kinds

378
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.390
of backgrounds make for a
better team that, you know,

379
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.830
we should be considering veterans
for per our projects, because

380
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.630
it's going to make for
a better. Yes. And now

381
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.240
it's really difficult for me
to answer that question because

382
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.920
I see multiple different communities.
And there are some communities

383
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.680
that are white just on
the ball. When you go

384
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.100
to New York or you go
to San Francisco or Atlanta,

385
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.210
those communities, they are, you
know, they're serious, they're taking

386
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:36.180
tech inclusion, be it minorities,
women, veterans very serious. And

387
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.470
you see some communities that
they're not taking it as

388
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.160
serious, but you also have
to realize about the money

389
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.000
generators and things of that
nature in those communities, for

390
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.580
instance, and my hometown, because
health care and transportation are

391
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.920
the main two financial generators
in that city, outside of

392
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.390
tourism. No one really cares
unless you're going to do

393
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:09.720
like a Java or asp.net
type of program, things of

394
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.380
that nature. And when it
comes to inclusion, a lot

395
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.930
of things when it comes
to inclusion or falling through

396
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.380
the cracks, and they just
weren't as effective where I'm

397
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:25.140
like, hi, Jess came from
a Facebook on veterans veteran's

398
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.470
day, week. And they were
just so on the ball

399
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.860
when it comes to tech
inclusion and particularly in a

400
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.950
veteran asset, you know, I
was like, I don't even

401
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.290
know why I need to
be here. And while you

402
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.720
guys invited me here to
talk about this stuff, like,

403
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.900
you know, yeah. Like they
had a guy from NASA

404
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.280
they're like, they just hired
this for, he's been there

405
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.060
for like a month prior
to like the event. And

406
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.000
he was his job for
NASA. He was air force

407
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.610
and worked at NASA. His
job was putting satellites in

408
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.390
the frequent sky. And that's
what he did. Like, ah,

409
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.940
I put things in space
and that's what he does

410
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.570
for Facebook. He puts things
in space. I'm like, wow,

411
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.110
I totally like you. Don't
like Facebook is so huge.

412
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.450
And there's so many different
moving parts of it that

413
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.930
you don't even think of
jobs like that. And Hey,

414
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.930
you can work at Facebook.
It put things in space.

415
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.260
So they're hiring people from
NASA. So you ever want

416
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.780
to move to California and
you're into NASA. You should

417
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.260
look at Facebook. So I'm
pretty sure that there's going

418
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.600
to be some NASA scientists
that hits me up now

419
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:38.500
and be like, yo, stop
poaching. Our people That, that

420
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.500
just makes me feel though,
that, that having different people

421
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.680
from different places is useful.
Like having people with degrees,

422
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.960
having people, without degrees, having
scientists that can go to

423
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.170
space, you know, who knows
all kinds of flavors of

424
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.670
people. Yes, you're absolutely right.
That's I think the inclusion

425
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.270
and the diversity of having
people, having different people of

426
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.620
thoughts, ethnicities backgrounds, and that's
what makes a great community

427
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.800
and a great product. Those
are the two things that

428
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.560
people really want. I think
that's one of the big

429
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:14.080
things that civilian community doesn't
do well versus the military

430
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.000
community, because we're all unified
on one course or inside

431
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.880
the military. It's not our
military bubble. A lot of

432
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.240
that stuff, especially when you're
overseas, a lot of the

433
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.670
more bureaucratic or first world
problems that, you know, just

434
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:34.570
parts people. We don't stress
about splitting that comes. And

435
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.540
we start getting more attuned
to that, more empathetic about

436
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.680
that as we come back
home and we start reintegrating

437
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.250
back society. But like, because
of all my deployments and

438
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.260
things of that nature, I
remember when I first came

439
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.350
home, it took years for
me to start understanding like

440
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.480
what was a big deal
for certain things. When it

441
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.960
came to civilian side, my
wife, she would tell you

442
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.720
she would come home. And
she would tell me how

443
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.350
bad her day was. And
my idea was, did anyone

444
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.110
die? And then you'd be
like, well, no. And then

445
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.090
I turn back around and
get back to Kodak. And

446
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.540
I was like, am I
in my world? No loss

447
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.000
of limb. I'll also eyesight.
And I'll also live. Everything's

448
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.800
good. So, but I've changed.
I've gotten older and wiser

449
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.480
and smarter. Cause I'm trying
to stay married. I'm pretty

450
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.120
sure. But like put, did
you die is probably not

451
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.820
what my wife wants to
know, wants to hear. One

452
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.440
thing that makes me, that
makes me think of though,

453
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.740
is when, when someone gives
an order, when there's a

454
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.620
chain of command and someone
gives an order, is there

455
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.620
any debate? Is there any
like, well, here's how I

456
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.270
was. Another way I could
think we could do that.

457
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.060
You know, because that's very
common in the coding environment,

458
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.750
right? Yes. That's Very like,
yeah, you can do that.

459
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.000
A lot of people cause
a lot of people's ideas

460
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.640
of what, how the military
has operated cause of like

461
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.060
mash and things of that
nature where you're just like,

462
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.490
Oh, you just follow orders.
So just the shows that

463
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.150
show only basic training. I
know you can question orders

464
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.210
if you have good reason
why we actually is against

465
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:08.100
the, is against the UCM
UCM J to follow on

466
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.340
lawful orders. So for instance,
if you get an order

467
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.680
and you are on a
question and this is unlawful,

468
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.290
you don't have to follow
that order. And I've seen

469
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.350
people fight that all the
way up to the Pentagon

470
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.010
and you can always suggest
better, different ways as well.

471
00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:28.150
And that's what makes great
leadership. They understand the military

472
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.120
use. They understand that there's
not, there's more than one

473
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:35.160
way to solve a problem
and create solutions. So they're

474
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:41.690
not against younger, more junior
troops understanding, understanding this. But

475
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.100
I, from my own personal
experience, I never forget when

476
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.490
I was at, we were
leaving camp Buku Iraq. And

477
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.620
I was, we were all
waiting for the, the NCO

478
00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.920
CO's to come up with
a plan for how we're

479
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.670
getting all our bags off
this convoy and into the,

480
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:00.150
these conexes. So they could
be shipped home. And there

481
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.060
were six of them and
they were just still debating

482
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.450
Baden debating. And I just
got up and I walked

483
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.990
to the Conex to convoy.
You've got 'em on an

484
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.990
18 Wheeler, start taking bags,
taking them off. They looked

485
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.120
at me and then they
went back to talking, well,

486
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.670
15 minutes later, another airman
came up to me and

487
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.320
they were like, well, I'm
going to help you because

488
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.390
you seem to be the
only one that's doing something.

489
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.300
30 minutes later, I had
an entire fire team with

490
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.630
me. And I had actually
realized that I was taking

491
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.830
a leadership decision, a role
in getting our gear ready

492
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.430
to get, go home while
the tech sergeants or in

493
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:40.380
support. So things like that.
I mean, I, in people's

494
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.270
ideas of what would have
happened on TV, I would

495
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.510
have gotten regaled. It either
gotten chewed out. I'm like,

496
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.390
no, that didn't happen at
all. People started helping because

497
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.060
I was the only person
taking action. And I was

498
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.520
like, well, you know what?
I'm started building. And then

499
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.440
I'm start solving and working
on the problem. Then I'll

500
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:58.050
figure it out as I
go, which is very much

501
00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.040
like how programming is. And
that's what most people do.

502
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.500
Let me build something. Then
as I get a problem,

503
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.390
let me research it, let
me think of better. You

504
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.290
know, the first program is
not a beautiful piece of

505
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.450
art. That's just one of
the things that we tell

506
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.540
our troops has never delete
your first program because it's

507
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.930
going to be crappy, but
you are going to learn

508
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.270
to appreciate that five, 10
years down the road. You're

509
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.700
not talking, you know, you're
not thinking about epics and

510
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.150
user stories. And you know,
all of these things that

511
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.450
are TDD, like no one
cares about test driven development.

512
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.850
When we first learned how
to code, as only as

513
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:37.620
you get more senior, more
into like how, like I'll

514
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.620
have to say more into
like the professional grade of

515
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.500
programming. You know, you have
to think about what we

516
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.990
say, the three users, you
know, you have to think

517
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.600
about a user. That's your
boss, the user that's going

518
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.880
to come after you eventually
and look at this code

519
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.990
and the user who's the
consumer. And the second user,

520
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.820
you have to treat, the
users can come and look

521
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.150
at your code, like a
psychopath that knows where you

522
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.140
live. So that's where you
start thinking about that stuff.

523
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.420
But outside of that, you're
just doing stuff and solving

524
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.270
problems and putting out fires
as it goes along. I'm

525
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.060
pretty sure Facebook was like
that when it was getting

526
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.300
made in some kid's dorm
and Twitter was like that.

527
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.120
And we are in no,
the Twitter story didn't get

528
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.200
off the ground the first
two times and four, it

529
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.820
became what it is today.
So that's how the military

530
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.370
is wrong. You're, you're there
to solve a problem and

531
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.470
to solve a problem with
the least amount of pain

532
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.410
as possible, or at least
not of time, like, you

533
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.060
know, that's what we want
to do. Cause in the

534
00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.580
end, we all just want
to get home and go

535
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.030
back to like playing video
games, just like normal people.

536
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.570
I just like civilians. There
were no different. We want

537
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.520
to know. We want to
play our video games, eat

538
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.850
barbecue, sleep in. Well, not
sleeping. I'm not gonna lie

539
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.990
that I hate sleeping. So
I guess to be in

540
00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:02.760
trouble So people, people can
learn about vets who code@vetswhocode.io.

541
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.000
It's been around since 2014
and it's a nonprofit so

542
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.240
they can donate it's tax
deductible. Yes, sir. It is

543
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.540
fantastic. Well, thank you so
much. Jerome Hardaway for talking

544
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.820
with me today. Thank you.
Thank you for having me.

545
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.570
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

546
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:26.910
you again next week. <inaudible>.
