Hi, This is Scott Hanselman.

14
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.970
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

15
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.070
talking with Ben Wheeler. He
is a teacher and a

16
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.370
developer who has taught both
kids and teachers. How to

17
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.980
code, how are you, sir?
I'm doing well today. Thanks

18
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.960
so much, Scott. I'm excited
to be here. Yeah. I'm

19
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.150
excited to talk to you,
you know, a whole bunch

20
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.940
of stuff about scratch and
pretty soon you'll be working

21
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.820
on scratch. Is that right?
Yeah. Well, I think of

22
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.760
myself very much as a
beginner and I really encourage

23
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.620
a lot of the teachers
that I work with out

24
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.740
there and parents to not
worry about being an expert.

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.170
So I guess I do
know a lot, but really

26
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.900
there's tons of kids out
there who use scratch everyday,

27
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.720
who probably know more than
I do, but you're going

28
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.820
to be working at the
MIT media lab on scratch.

29
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.620
So there's some kind of
bonafides that you get for

30
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.290
doing that. Yeah. Well, I'm
going to be a beginner

31
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.620
at doing that for them
for awhile too. And you

32
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.780
know, that that's a mentality
that I really try to

33
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.180
encourage in the students I
teach and in my daughters

34
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.080
of, you know, going into
these new situations and starting

35
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.690
at the beginning and learning
from there, that's a really

36
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.960
important perspective. I think I
I've always used the term.

37
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.020
I'm a professional amateur, you
know, I mean, I'm learning

38
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.480
every day. I just do
it professionally, but that doesn't

39
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.100
mean that I have any
idea what I'm doing. It's

40
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.320
funny. I just came today
from Staten Island. I visited

41
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.720
a school where there were
some teachers who had taken

42
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.660
a workshop I had done
in February and they had

43
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.210
done scratch for the first
time in February. And I

44
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.700
got to see them doing
it with their third graders

45
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.030
today and also doing some
robotics. And then we met

46
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.210
afterwards to talk about it
and they were talking with

47
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.220
such excited energy about how
much they love being beginners

48
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.890
at this. It was really
amazing. They said, you know,

49
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.220
it's funny, we've been teaching
for 30 years and we

50
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.780
sort of thought there was
nothing left for us to

51
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.840
learn. And now we're doing
this thing and we feel

52
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.640
like we're really not that
good at it yet, but

53
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.240
it's actually really exciting to
be in that state and

54
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.920
to, to be exploring with
the kids, definitely to not

55
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.930
lose that sense of freshness.
I mean, I've been in

56
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.930
software 25 years, professionally in
35, if you count, you

57
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.540
know, since I was a
little kid and I'm still

58
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.340
finding myself a couple of
times a week looking at

59
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.280
something on code pen saying,
how did they do that?

60
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.660
That is insane. Oh my
gosh, absolutely. I've been coding

61
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.060
for 30 years and I
still, I mean, all the

62
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.490
time, I'm seeing things that
people do and I'm thinking,

63
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.200
Oh my gosh, I wish
I made that. How did

64
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.450
they do it? I don't
know if you know, Nikki

65
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.650
case JavaScript online sort of
interactive storyteller, but Nikki case

66
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.830
does stuff with JavaScript. That
is so brilliant. It makes

67
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.260
me feel like the first
time I ever saw a

68
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.020
program running on my computer.
Oh, wow. We'll make sure

69
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.150
to put links in the
show notes so that people

70
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.150
can see that. So here
we are two old people

71
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.900
on a podcast, you know,
with, with, with the, with

72
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.200
the weight of history. And,
you know, I was looking

73
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.550
at God of war five
earlier, just, just staring at

74
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.090
it, just staring at the
graphics of the thing. And

75
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.400
I ended up watching a
20 minute video about how,

76
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.550
when he hits like a
tree with his acts, how

77
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.100
they make the acts stop,
but the bones in his

78
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.370
arm keep moving. So then
it's not, it's not purely

79
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.310
an animation of him swinging
his arm. It's literally the

80
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.890
physics of he hit the
thing and then his shoulder

81
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.200
and his elbow and his
muscles kind of go jiggly

82
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.970
because that's what happens to
your arm when you hit

83
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.920
something with an ax. And
I thought that was just

84
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.560
so fascinating. And then I'm
realizing that I'm trying to

85
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.470
teach my 10 year old,
how to do hello world

86
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.540
at the, at the text,
you know, the text level

87
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.600
on a console. Am I
teaching my child computer's wrong?

88
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.600
No, it's, it's so funny
that you bring that up.

89
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.030
That's something I think about
all the time. And it's

90
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.050
really a constant dynamic in
my work with kids and

91
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.380
in the teaching that I
do to teachers, because when

92
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.080
I was a kid there,
wasn't that big, a difference

93
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.570
between the program that you
could make in a couple

94
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.390
of days as an amateur
programmer who just learned last

95
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.480
week and the sort of
professional code that's running on

96
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.600
the computer, it might be
something like Oregon trail. And

97
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.080
that might be impressive. But
really if, if you learned

98
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.660
everything that you could for
a year, you could make

99
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.540
Oregon trail back then. And
then there were lots of

100
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.780
programs that were really just
sort of texts simulators. I

101
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.530
remember there was a really
popular one in high school

102
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.070
that kids would just play
on their Texas instruments, calculators.

103
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.460
That was text-based and, and
that was fun and catchy.

104
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.930
And you could make those
kinds of simulators, lemonade stand,

105
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.500
you know, launching a star
ship and how much fuel

106
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.870
you have to put in
to get it, to get

107
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.320
to escape velocity. And you
could write those in text

108
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.920
in an hour and have
people be playing them, you

109
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.520
know, that day on the
same machine and that the

110
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.900
distance between thought to execution
and how proud you'd be

111
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.020
w w was very short.
And now it's a tricky

112
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.480
thing because when I show
intro to coding apps on

113
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.960
a tablet that are very
flashy looking, a lot of

114
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.140
the times, those flashy looking
ones, don't actually get very

115
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.290
deep into the programming from
a creative perspective at all.

116
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.550
And then vice versa, the
programs that do actually give

117
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.260
them near infinite expressive power,
whether they're text-based programs or

118
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.110
a block based program, like
scratch, that has a lot

119
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.070
of flexible creativity. Those don't
initially seem as impressive. The

120
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.130
graphics seem simpler because it's
not, it's not doing as

121
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.320
much for you. It's waiting
for you to invent things.

122
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.670
And it's tricky. It means,
I think that you need

123
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.870
to show students some of
the end products that they

124
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.900
can make with this kind
of power and then almost

125
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.990
rewind from there and say,
okay, let's, let's look at

126
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.510
this impressive scratch program. And
let's look inside and look

127
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.900
at the code. All that
code looks a little overwhelming

128
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.360
and hard to understand. Now
let's rewind. And let's just

129
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.970
look at a few of
those blocks at once. And

130
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.200
I find that it really
helps to illustrate that connection

131
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.320
so that students are saying,
Oh right. I'm at the

132
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.940
beginning of a process that
can lead there. It does

133
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.300
make you wonder though, have
we made such a stack

134
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.960
of stuff that's so high?
It was so many layers

135
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.750
of abstraction. Are we asking
a lot of them to

136
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.190
say, now work hard for
two years or four years

137
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.230
or five years, right? Like,
there's always the talk about

138
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.610
how old do you have
to be before you were

139
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.470
a senior engineer, you know,
and like, Oh, the young

140
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.510
people today, they want to
be senior engineers in a

141
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.660
week. We've built such a
large stack. I don't even

142
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.750
know where to start. Yeah.
I mean, I find this

143
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.750
as a programmer because in
addition to my teaching, I'm

144
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.050
a professional programmer and I've
programmed in a lot of

145
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.690
different capacities for a lot
of different companies and clients,

146
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.200
and it's harder and harder
to keep up. Really. I

147
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.230
feel like, you know, I
don't want to name particular

148
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.530
past years, but when I
was in college, say it

149
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.520
still felt like you could
pretty much know everything as

150
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.250
a programmer. And of course
that wasn't quite true, but

151
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.390
you could, you know, be
reasonably caught up with where

152
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.970
AI was at and you
could be reasonably caught up

153
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.230
with where kind of flashy
front end HTML interfaces, where

154
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.600
it just had a touch
of JavaScript and you could

155
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.540
be reasonably caught up with,
you know, high efficiency code.

156
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.020
That's really, you know, getting
close to the metal. And

157
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.350
it feels like that stuff,
you know, with the broadening

158
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.430
of the field, there's been
this sort of enforced specialization

159
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.220
where now I feel like
I've had to just kind

160
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.530
of let go of some
domains that I used to

161
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:37.060
be pretty cut up on.
And, you know, just knowing

162
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.050
something like react or angular
or view, or, you know,

163
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.220
these frameworks that have a
tremendous power to make these

164
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.850
interfaces that we couldn't have
dreamed, you know, a few

165
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.410
years ago, but that takes
so much constant, you know,

166
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.450
not just learning a particular
language like JavaScript, but then

167
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.500
learning these ever evolving and
ever-changing conventions. I mean, I've,

168
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.160
I've been sort of steadily
learning react now for the

169
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.430
last two years. And I
feel like it's, it's like

170
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.310
trying to catch a jellyfish.
Like it's always squirming. And

171
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.860
you know, by the time
you learn one version of

172
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.430
redox, now there's this new
version that's supplanting it. And

173
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.790
everybody's using this different set
of plugins and now it's

174
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.110
Webpack, it's no longer grunt
or golf or it's harder

175
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.850
and harder to keep up.
And that is a real

176
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.200
challenge of the field. Doesn't
it lead that we should

177
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.960
teach the kids the fundamentals,
right? Yeah. Like there's always

178
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.730
going to be a new
wrench or a new screwdriver,

179
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.620
but if you learn the
fundamentals of carpentry, you should

180
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.590
be okay, so then doesn't
it follow them? We should

181
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.990
teach the low level stuff
and the historical context of

182
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.710
computer science. Yeah. I mean,
historical context is really interesting.

183
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.080
And I think it's somewhat
of a separate question in

184
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.760
some ways, but I really
think it's incumbent on us

185
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.410
who are working to push
computer science education forward to

186
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.180
really emphasize that it's the
thinking of a computer scientist

187
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.830
and the process of debugging
and iterative development. Those are

188
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.810
the things that I really
think we need to make

189
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.230
sure kids are, are having
experience doing. And a lot

190
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.780
of people who don't know
as much about computer science,

191
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.590
they thinking of it from
a vocational perspective, which is

192
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.620
totally reasonable that they want
the kids to know things

193
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.080
that are going to be
practical immediately, and that are

194
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.290
going to lead into jobs,
whether it's a job in

195
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.770
computer science, or it's just
knowing about how computer science

196
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.840
works and being able to
apply that to their work

197
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.590
and in lots of other
domains. And that's totally reasonable.

198
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.560
And sometimes I feel the
urge to resist it and

199
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.130
to say absolutely, but in
order to be able to

200
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.630
guide themselves towards wherever the
particular technologies are when they're

201
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.800
graduating high school in 10
years, or however long, we

202
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.650
need to make sure that
they have the ability and

203
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.060
the experience sort of learning
how to learn and learning

204
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.630
how to work through computer
science kinds of problems. And

205
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.840
to think the way that
you have to in computer

206
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.300
science, because it's, it's a
different kind of thinking just

207
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.570
like visual art is a
different kind of thinking than

208
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.620
math or then music and
English vocabulary, you know, that

209
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.890
they all sort of use
these, these somewhat different, but

210
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.600
overlapping parts of our minds,
Someone on the show recently

211
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.440
told me to try to
avoid using the term squishy

212
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.690
or soft skills because it,
it diminishes the, the real

213
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.910
science behind those things. You
know, we've heard the terms

214
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.830
like IQ and EEQ emotional
quotient, but I still find

215
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.690
myself coming back to trying
to figure out a word

216
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.290
to describe those kinds of
things. And as someone who

217
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.870
has been programming for so
long, it's so hard to

218
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.140
define what feels like you
use the term jellyfish. You

219
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.340
know, when you describe how
do teach people how To

220
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.650
think there's science behind that
though. Right. And the teaching

221
00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.560
in the educational psychology world.
Yeah. I mean, there's, there's

222
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.070
a lot of different kinds
of science that come to

223
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.560
bear, you know, you can
bring to bear from different

224
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.240
angles. I mean, there's a
lot of research around learning

225
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.550
how to learn and I'm
forgetting the name of this

226
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.850
wonderful professor, this woman, I
was just listening to an

227
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.570
interview with her on the
phenom street podcast. And she's

228
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.000
the author of this book
learning how to learn. And

229
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.760
she runs an online course
called learning how to learn.

230
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.450
And she does a lot
of distilling and summarizing research

231
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.980
into Barbara Oakley. Yes, that
might be, but she talks

232
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.640
a lot about what we've
learned about the processes of

233
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.410
going from familiarity to proficiency
in different areas. And she's

234
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.020
really thinking about that from
the perspective of say a

235
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.690
college student, who's trying to
really learn a lot of

236
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.770
history that they're going to
use on their test and

237
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.830
in our paper and refer
to in future years and

238
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.670
how just reading and even
reading and rereading and underlining

239
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.770
those things that we think
of as kind of active,

240
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.390
attentive, reading those things alone.
Don't quite make the information

241
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.940
stick in your mind. You
have to run into a

242
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.000
problem with it and have
a moment of not being

243
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.970
able to solve it and
then push your brain to

244
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.760
dig deep and find the
information. So if you're learning

245
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.900
about the Spanish Armada 1588
or whatever it is, you

246
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.960
have to have some moment
where someone's saying, and you

247
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.290
know, what was the greatest
crisis that faced Spain in

248
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.050
the 16th century? And you
have to think, gosh, what

249
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.050
was the biggest crisis? Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

250
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.230
yeah. That's the crash of
the Spanish Armada in what

251
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.290
year, 1588. And when you,
when you have that problem

252
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.930
and then you work through
it, all of a sudden

253
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.920
the pathways are lit up
and they're connecting in this

254
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.570
new way. And you know,
that situation, you know what

255
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.160
I described as almost more
of a, sort of a

256
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.150
memorization example, but I think
it really translates broadly into

257
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.970
all kinds of ways that
you learn how to think

258
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.730
in computer science. I think
a lot of that is

259
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.690
learning how to hit a
wall with a bug, which

260
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.170
happens over and over for
everybody who does programming, you

261
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.990
hit a bug and you
think this is impossible. There's

262
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.480
no way this is going
to make sense. Something is

263
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.960
going wrong. I'm looking at
the code. It's, it's wrong.

264
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.660
It's this is a bug
that will never be understood.

265
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.590
And always, if you persist,
you always eventually is. And

266
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.570
I can't tell you how
many times. I mean, hundreds

267
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.840
of times I've had that
experience and it's only having

268
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.630
had it dozens and dozens
of times before that, I

269
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.170
can tell myself, remember Ben,
you're going to get through

270
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.150
this bug and you're going
to figure it out. So

271
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.640
what's the next step. And
what's the next step. And,

272
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.910
and students really need to
have that experience because it's

273
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.640
very different. I think in
a lot of ways than

274
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.730
the kind of schoolwork that
we're asked to do in

275
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.380
other ways, schoolwork that's perfectly
worthwhile. It just doesn't involve

276
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.490
that, that absolutely getting stuck
and having no idea how

277
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.920
to proceed. A lot of
the time, you know, we

278
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.750
have so much experience ramping
up math slowly and steadily,

279
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.450
and that doesn't mean that
people don't feel totally left

280
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.680
behind sometimes, but when they're
totally left behind often, they

281
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.560
don't necessarily have a way
to get past if you

282
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.140
haven't learned long division and
you're faced with a long

283
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.570
division problem. I mean, you're
not going to invent long

284
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.890
division on the spot using
somebody else's terminology. So what's

285
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.790
kind of amazing about computer
science that can apply to

286
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.240
students experience in other areas
as well is this idea

287
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.940
that you have an algorithm
and you have an approach

288
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.460
and maybe your code has
an algorithm that's not quite

289
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.530
working and you have to
go and change it. And

290
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.430
maybe sometimes you have an
algorithm that's not quite working

291
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.240
for doing a homework assignment
or for learning a particular

292
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.000
concept. And you have to
go back and revise that,

293
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.390
but there's always a way
to revise the algorithm in

294
00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:01.510
question so that you can
proceed. Definitely. I feel also

295
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:06.130
that understanding that there's no
black boxes in computers, that

296
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.960
there's always a way to
kind of crack it open

297
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.950
and look underneath if something
goes wrong, right? Yeah. If

298
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.500
the website doesn't look right,
once you know that F

299
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.990
12 tools exist, you can
do that. And if you,

300
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.200
you know, you can see
the HTTP on the wire,

301
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.480
but I think people get
stuck where they don't know

302
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.450
that like the HTTP is
a thing because they learn

303
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.880
at a boot camp and
they learn CSS and HTML,

304
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.030
and don't understand the network
that the network exists. They

305
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.690
type Google, they hit enter
and a miracle happens. Absolutely.

306
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:39.400
And those practical techniques of
debugging, I think it's so

307
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.190
important to really focus on
those when they come up

308
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.180
in class, that's actually something
that we come back to,

309
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.470
again and again, in the
training sessions that I've run

310
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.280
with the New York city public
school teachers. We talk about

311
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.960
how inevitably, when you're teaching
technology, you run into bugs

312
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.150
that get in the way
of the lesson that you

313
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.580
were going to do. Oh
my goodness, by problem. Or,

314
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.430
I mean, just today, a
teacher was using dash and

315
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:12.130
dot robots from wonder labs
and always with Bluetooth, there's

316
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.580
going to be some kind
of problem. Things always go

317
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.540
wrong with Bluetooth. But instead
of thinking of that, as

318
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.240
a reason why you shouldn't
even try the lesson in

319
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.830
the first place, because it's
not going to be perfect.

320
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.130
I was really encouraging the
teachers when that happens, get

321
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.070
everyone's attention together and say,
okay, what's our plan. How

322
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.220
are we going to debug
this? Because sometimes I feel

323
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.290
like the worst thing I
can do in my moments

324
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.140
as a teacher, when I'm
in a rush is, you

325
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.910
know, I think I just
have to turn this off

326
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.070
and on again. And I
just, you know, take it

327
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.750
out of a student's hands
and I just do it.

328
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.280
And, and in my best
moments, I tell myself, no,

329
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.120
wait, even if the only
thing that student comes away

330
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.860
with today is realizing that
then the all-knowing teacher didn't

331
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.190
know the answer to that
question and sat down with

332
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.500
me and we made a
list of things that we're

333
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.810
going to try. And we
tried each thing on that

334
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.380
list. And even if it
ends up not working, just

335
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.650
that experience of saying, all
right, we, we have this

336
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.690
black box problem where this
thing just simply isn't working,

337
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.520
but that's not the end
of the story. That's the

338
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.010
beginning of the story for
us. And there's actually something

339
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.620
that we can learn every
time something goes wrong. So

340
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.530
in, in my classes with
students, I use a phrase

341
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.480
sort of a catch phrase
of the class, which is

342
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.490
cool malfunction. And we've had
a lot of cool malfunctions,

343
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.030
a lot of short circuits,
some batteries that start to

344
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.260
have smoke come out of
them. I was trying to

345
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:44.900
explain to my nontechnical spouse
that this seems to be

346
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.190
a thing where every time
I go on a business

347
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.470
trip, something in the house
breaks, it just seems it's

348
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.500
Murphy's law of the person
that travels for work. And

349
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.140
every time I leave, it's
probably, I have to get

350
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.090
a certain number of miles
away before something in the

351
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.210
house breaks. And now with
all the, you know, all

352
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.210
the voice activated devices that
I dare not speak their

353
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.590
name and IOT stuff. I
left last week, it was

354
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.130
a light bulb. I left
the DVR, broke and I,

355
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.050
and then she calls me
and says, how can I

356
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:17.150
fix X? I have no
idea. I really truly have

357
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.430
no, like, so I just
walk her through the checklist,

358
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.040
you know, turn it off.
Does it have an IP

359
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.890
address, reboot the router, you
know, those kinds of things.

360
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.940
Why have we put a
barrier between us, the techies

361
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.120
and the normals, even in
the labeling of them, just

362
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.490
now in that sentence, such
that they feel that they

363
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.460
can't experiment or turn things
off or poke it, black

364
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.700
boxes. We really need to
Breakthrough that. Yeah. You know,

365
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.310
there's, so there's the book
Zen and the art of

366
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.060
motorcycle maintenance. And I often
think back to that, because

367
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:52.010
that book opens with this
episode where the author is

368
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.900
taking a trip with friends
and he's on a motorcycle

369
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.720
that has a million things
wrong with it. And it's

370
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.050
far from state-of-the-art, but he's
taken that thing apart and

371
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.680
put it back together dozens
of times. And so when

372
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.280
things inevitably go wrong, it's
not a crisis, but his

373
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.710
friend who bought a beautiful
state of the art motorcycle,

374
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:18.920
the first time something's not
working, he's got to just

375
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.260
wheel it to the garage
and wait for somebody else

376
00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.560
to, to solve their problem
for him. And the author

377
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.760
presents this as sort of
a philosophical difference to some

378
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.340
degree, but it's also, it's
really a statement on the

379
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.550
direction that things are going.
And you look at at

380
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.500
vehicles, cars. I mean, my
parents and their friends used

381
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.510
to do a little bit
of tinkering with their VW

382
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.820
bugs in the sixties. And
a lot of the time

383
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.190
they could fix things, but
nowadays more and more in

384
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.740
a car is run by
a computer that you just

385
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.090
don't have access to. And,
and there's even laws and,

386
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.780
and real active legal debates
with groups like the electronic

387
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.730
frontier foundation, taking a big,
active voice because there's laws

388
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.050
that make it illegal, literally
illegal for you to open

389
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.770
up certain types of computers
and, and modify them and,

390
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.500
you know, have them do
what you want instead of

391
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.150
what the company has decided.
Okay. Friends, this is Scott,

that I wrote, I wrote

415
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.810
a blog post a while
back called is technology killing

416
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.710
curiosity. And I'm wondering if
he He's have access to

417
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.940
the sum of all human
knowledge may have, may make

418
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.280
my 10 year old, less
impressed, you know, when we

419
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.090
do hello world in a
loop. Yeah. You know, that

420
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.570
that's such a great point
because there that, that ties

421
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:56.340
back to the concept of
how impressive things are today.

422
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.400
You look at legend of
Zelda, breath of the wild,

423
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:04.380
and it's literally all inspiring.
And it's the product of

424
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.960
tens of thousands of hours
of human effort and, and

425
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.120
me or my class, we're,
we're never going to make

426
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.460
something that can approach that
in a lot of ways.

427
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.830
But at the same time,
there are technologies that still

428
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.670
very much are low fi
that do inspire awe. And,

429
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.130
you know, you look at,
at fiction writing, for example,

430
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.790
I mean, my daughters are
big fans of plenty of

431
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:35.130
flashy apps, but they also
really like reading because it

432
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.660
still has the power to
give them experiences that no

433
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.100
most movies and TV shows
don't often get, get close

434
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.750
to matching. And they like
the Harry Potter movies, but they

435
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:51.860
don't stop reading the Harry Potter
books. And so I take

436
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.950
some hope in that, that
even though we have this

437
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.940
magic access to information and
to things that are dazzling,

438
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.290
that it hasn't meant the
end of that curiosity, even

439
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.630
though it's, it can be
quite a lot of competition

440
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.320
with it. Yeah. I'm really
trying to push my kids

441
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.630
also, in other ways and
media, I was trying to

442
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:14.680
get them to watch, what
was it Buffy the vampire

443
00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.330
Slayer, cause this is classic
literature, right? Yeah. The television

444
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.820
equivalent, or as, you know,
what was the other one

445
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.650
Smallville? And my, my 12
year old got like three

446
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.260
episodes in and he says,
I couldn't do it. The

447
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.130
graphics were so bad. I
don't know whether he means

448
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.960
the special effects or the
fact that it's four by

449
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.320
three, but then it's like
recorded on VHS tape, but

450
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.750
he called it the graphics.
And I was like, yeah,

451
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.940
but the story, you know,
it reminds me of when

452
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.530
my parents tried to get
me to watch black and

453
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.540
white films and say like,
but it's so good. You

454
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.670
have to get to push
through. I feel like we

455
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.300
can, we can do that
with raspberry PIs and Arduinos

456
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.480
and, and still force them
that there's joy in a

457
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.260
blinking and led. Yeah. I
mean, there is a lot

458
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.570
of joy in that. I
just been doing a little

459
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:07.030
bit of microbit with, with
my daughters mostly. And there

460
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.870
is still an excitement of,
wow, here's this thing who's

461
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.470
circuitry I can see and
I'm deciding what it's gonna

462
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.360
do, and then it's doing
it. And that does still

463
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.370
have some magic, even though
it's just a few blinking

464
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:23.380
LEDs, but, but just about
the movies and TV shows,

465
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.960
I mean, that's something I've,
I've really definitely encountered that

466
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.510
with my daughters. I love
movies. And sometimes it's been

467
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.940
a success when I've tried
to introduce my daughters to

468
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.190
movies that I really think
they'll love. And sometimes it's

469
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.320
not, I tried to get
them to watch adventures in

470
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.140
babysitting and they just found
it too slow. Yeah. Yeah.

471
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.210
Something just that it'll make
your mind. Like I just

472
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.390
recently watched Cobra, Kai, not
a hobby, but not appropriate

473
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.610
for kids, but appropriate for
people who like credit kid.

474
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.980
So I had a kid
it's fantastic. So I had

475
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.740
the kids watch karate kid
and they didn't get it.

476
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.090
And I was like, why
didn't they get it? It

477
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:02.230
turns out that the protagonist,
the problem, the, the, the

478
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:07.870
crisis is bullies and there's
a zero tolerance bully situation

479
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.180
at like every school now,
like I'm not saying bullying

480
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.880
doesn't happen, but it doesn't
happen in that way that

481
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.640
it did in the nineties
where like, EV like from,

482
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.790
from, from pretty in pink
to the breakfast club, it's

483
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.970
all bullies, bullies, bullies, bullies,
bullies. And they're like five

484
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.620
minutes into karate kid. They
were like, Oh, where's the

485
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.450
principal. The principal would have
stopped that it's not going

486
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.850
to go. You know, that's
so funny that you mentioned

487
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.710
it just the other day.
My daughters were kind of

488
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.620
asking me about bullies. And
again, it's not that there

489
00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.640
aren't paradynamics and cool kids
in their class and kids

490
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.390
who are too rough sometimes,
but you're right there in

491
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.550
first grade and third grade
and bullying just, isn't really

492
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.870
something that they've run into
yet. There's nobody who is

493
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.080
at the bottom of the
pecking order. And sometimes in

494
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.720
my stories of my childhood,
I've talked about, you know,

495
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.370
that there was a kid
who was having a hard

496
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.330
time and people were picking
on him and they sort

497
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.790
of don't quite know what
I mean. And that's not

498
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.450
to say that they don't
sometimes feel like one member

499
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.450
of the friend group is,
is not getting her her

500
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:14.880
fair share, but that dynamic
doesn't seem like it's a

501
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.710
problem anymore. And I guess
there's a lot, that's really

502
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:21.960
wonderful about that. Sometimes I,
I do wonder if we,

503
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.590
as adults are managing so
much for kids that they're

504
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.860
not having the chance to
discover and work through some

505
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.470
of those problems. Yeah, that's
true. And to be clear,

506
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.330
before we get Or tweets,
we do recognize that bullying

507
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.540
is a huge problem, particularly
if you are ever underrepresented

508
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.750
group or if you are
LGBTQ, but I think we're

509
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.560
just pointing out that it
has changed in some fundamental,

510
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.200
measurable way. Since the, since
the nineties, I'm just using

511
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.270
karate kid. As an example,
one thing I wanted to

512
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.710
pop back to talking about
the, the LEDs my kids

513
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.400
learned on scratch, they learned
their first programming language, I

514
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.780
would say, was scratch. Can
scratch, talk to Arduinos and

515
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.880
LEDs and flash things. Cause
I've never really felt like

516
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.180
there was an attachment between
this draggy droppy four loop

517
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.570
thing that makes a cat
spin and the physical world.

518
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:17.540
Yeah. So the answer is
sort of, there's a website

519
00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.890
called scratch acts and it's
not advertised very much by

520
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.550
scratch. It's considered experimental. And
there are a lot of

521
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:30.260
different extensions that different people
have written for scratch that

522
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.300
all generally involve a fork
of the scratch code to

523
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:41.420
add this, this extension code
in, and then a plugin

524
00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.650
for a browser like Chrome,
so that the scratch code

525
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.370
in the webpage can connect
to the computer and the

526
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.720
computer's own USB connection or
whatever it is, maybe Bluetooth

527
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.360
to be able to communicate
to the device. So there

528
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.700
is a lot of that
stuff out there. It's still

529
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.390
mostly in an experimental state.
And I think it's gotten

530
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:06.380
the F the farthest along
with Lego, we do, which

531
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.850
is, you know, one step
simpler than the Lego Mindstorms

532
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.530
robotics environment. And the, we
do stuff is really wonderful.

533
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.830
It's I have seen a
lot of student creativity with

534
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:23.150
it. And, and like I
said before, part of the

535
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:27.860
scratch team's excitement with this
new version of scratch, scratch

536
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:32.780
3.0, that's coming out this
August is that there's a

537
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.040
whole long list of applications
that are, are going to

538
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.220
be built that connect to
scratch and, and provide this

539
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.180
kind of bridge. So one,
one of the very big

540
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:48.130
ones is Lego Mindstorms <inaudible>
is, or Eva, whatever it's

541
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.570
called is going to have
a scratch three component. I'm

542
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.210
not sure exactly what the
date is on that, but

543
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.020
that's the plan. That's good
to know. I mean, I

544
00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.200
feel like that getting, you
know, fixing that, or, you

545
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.680
know, making that happen would
definitely open up a world

546
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.330
that would be even more
interesting, like the internet of

547
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.300
things as it relates to
scratch would be definitely powerful.

548
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.030
Yeah. And I don't know
how much you've played around

549
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.630
with different robotics, that dash
and dot robots, for example,

550
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.020
which are really wonderful. They
kids light right up when

551
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.270
they see them and they
immediately want to touch them

552
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.670
and press the buttons and
explore them and control them.

553
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.380
And if you use their
kind of block-based programming environment,

554
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.220
it's based on, Blockly, there's
a lot of cool stuff

555
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:36.270
there, but there's also stuff
that I feel sometimes like

556
00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:41.580
I wish was there that's
missing and scratch, connecting to

557
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.400
more and more of these
robots, I think is really

558
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.790
exciting because as these students
that I was working with

559
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.490
today, for example, who were
using dash and dot, they're

560
00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.010
getting very familiar with scratch
in their third grade class.

561
00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.120
And if they could use
that knowledge and translate that

562
00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:01.470
even more directly and be
able to use the events

563
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.980
and the, you know, the,
when background clicked kinds of

564
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:10.050
things so that they could
be programming more in depth

565
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.200
even than they're able to
do with the somewhat more

566
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.140
limited set of blocks that
are available. Now, I just

567
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.910
think it would be sort
of a win for everybody

568
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.100
all around. Yeah, absolutely. And
it's going to be nice

569
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.500
to have you a, as
it were on the inside,

570
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.510
working with the MIT media
lab to make scratch even

571
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.330
better. Sure. Yeah. I mean,
I'm, I'm just about to

572
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.780
begin and I'm hoping that
I can dive in and

573
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:36.840
contribute. That's fantastic. Well, people
can check you out@adaandleo.com. This

574
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.790
is a nonprofit. Yeah. It's
the kids technology afterschool and

575
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.670
weekend program that I've been
teaching kids through for several

576
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:50.100
years. Very cool. I have
a technology and education newsletter

577
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:56.340
called robot owl that, yeah.
I've been writing about these

578
00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.690
issues and making recommendations and
talking about what teachers are

579
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.240
telling me in the field.
And so it's basically for

580
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.880
teachers and parents and anybody
who wants to spark an

581
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.880
interest in kids and in
all this sort of thing,

582
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.130
innovation and technology and creativity.
So that's robot, owl.co. Alright.

583
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:17.400
And I will put links
to robot owl to your

584
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.420
own website@technohyphensocial.com, as well as
ADA and Leo and all

585
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.850
of the different robots and
things and scratch a microbit.

586
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.980
And all of these links
have been collecting and I

587
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.510
will all be in the
show notes. So be sure

588
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.320
to check those out and
follow Ben on Twitter. Fantastic.

589
00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.430
Great talking to you, Scott.
And I'm excited for this

590
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:39.260
kind of creative message to
go out there. Absolutely. This

591
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.840
has been another episode Of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

592
00:32:41.840 --> 00:33:03.070
you again next week. <inaudible>.
