When you need to focus
on building, do you want

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.770
to get bogged down by
your database? Mongo DB is

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.590
an intuitive, flexible document database
that lets you get to

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.250
building Mongo. DBS document model
is a natural way to

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.430
represent data so you can
focus on what matters. Mongo

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.220
DB Atlas is the best
way to use Mongo DB.

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.160
It's a global cloud database
service that gives you all

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.370
of the developer productivity of
Mongo DB. Plus the added

9
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.850
simplicity of a fully managed
database service. You can get

11
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.250
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

12
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.510
today and breaking with my
no Scott's rule. I've got

13
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.810
Scott Bergen on the show
author of now his eighth

14
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.600
book. How design makes the
world? How are you, sir?

15
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.880
I am good. I am
happy to be a rule

16
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.820
breaker right off the bat.
That makes me excited too

17
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.150
many Scots, too many Scotts,
but you know, I've got,

18
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.940
gosh, I think five or
six of your books and

19
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.680
three of them behind me
on the shelves just right

20
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.970
here. Wow. You went and
became a bestselling author. I

21
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.650
did. And that is pretty
fantastic. How many books are

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.210
you doing? You doing a
book a year? What's your

23
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.340
schedule? No. Well, I think
I've averaged a book every

24
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.950
two years. Cause I quit
to try to equip Microsoft

25
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.770
to try to become a
writer in 2003. It's now

26
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.360
20, 2017 years close, close.
Are they all hard? Cause

27
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.420
the books that I've written
are technical books and at

28
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.440
the beginning of the process
of writing the book, I'm

29
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.030
like, eh, you know, I'll
just bang this book out.

30
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.250
It's it's gonna be great.
And then halfway through I'm

31
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.360
like, what have I done?
You know, it's just fun,

32
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.600
starting a project, right? Because
your ambition is really big

33
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.370
and it's all in your
head and the vision is

34
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.510
grand and then the work
is always the work, no

35
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.850
matter how great your vision
is. And you're passionate at

36
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.570
the beginning, it's, that's just
the nature of creative projects

37
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.260
I think. But writing is
hard. It's just, you're taking

38
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.920
on a lot of, you're
trying to take on these

39
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.880
huge burdens of covering a
subject that you know, really

40
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.670
well and try to distill
it down in a way

41
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.430
that people can benefit from
in a fraction of the

42
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.500
time that it took you
to learn all that stuff.

43
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.920
That's just a cognitively, an
enormous challenge to do at

44
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.590
all. And yeah. How do
you decide on the length

45
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.250
of your books? This book
is a comfortable, roughly 200

46
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.060
pages. It's not a book
that is, that is weighty.

47
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.820
That is, that is, has
a lot of emotional weight

48
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.680
where like, Oh, I'm going
to slog through this book.

49
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.650
One of your other great
books the year without pants

50
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.040
also, it's, it's a good
clean read on a fast

51
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.870
read. There's a lot of
depth and a lot of

52
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.870
density, but it's not 800
pages that you would hit

53
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.000
someone over the head with.
How do you decide you

54
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.450
have made this book 10
times longer? Well, I don't

55
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.590
know that I could anymore.
I think, I think, but

56
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.840
the, the, I think of
everything. That's what the book

57
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.700
is about. And even talking
about the book reveal some

58
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.830
of the same topics that
are in the book, is

59
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.780
it a book as a
design thing and you have

60
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.870
to be thinking about well,
who you're designing for and

61
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.820
who you're trying to reach.
And for this book I

62
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.470
wanted to reach everybody. I
want it to be a

63
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.080
book that someone could read
on an airplane, on a

64
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.480
car, on a short flight,
which we don't really have

65
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.770
at the moment, but someday
we'll fly again and wanted

66
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.390
it to be a two
hour read that required. No,

67
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.550
no, no, no preconditions, no
pre qualifiers that you don't

68
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.060
need any knowledge of design
or engineering or anything to

69
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.010
be able to get into
the book. And so that

70
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.340
was the goal. And two
hour, a 200 page book

71
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.190
is probably about a three
hour read for most people,

72
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.070
two, three hour read. That
was, that was my frame.

73
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.200
When I sat down to
start working on the project,

74
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.260
That's a really good thing.
Like you're thinking about not

75
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.920
just audience, but also context,
which is really significant because

76
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.490
every example in the entire
book is about context because

77
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.940
design only exists within context.
For sure. Yeah. I think

78
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.710
that's one of the lessons
of the book is people

79
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.410
think how design makes the
world like design is like

80
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.100
fashion and like interior design,
like isn't it a bit

81
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.430
pretentious to claim that design
makes the world or design

82
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.890
makes a nation or anything
like that. And that's what

83
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.840
I try to do with
the book is that that

84
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.950
word design, it's a verb
that applies to everything. Our

85
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.420
public transportation systems are designed
our policies for healthcare and

86
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.890
for a criminal law, those
things are designed borders between

87
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.280
nations are designed when you
really let it get its

88
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.700
legs out. There is about
everything and the things that

89
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.520
frustrate us or the disappoint
us, they make us angry.

90
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.390
They have those affection by
design because someone created it

91
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.020
and they are failing us.
And so I'm a Jajuan

92
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.180
I want to try to
cover it as broadly and

93
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.590
as intimately as I could
possibly do. No, the, the

94
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.830
kind of ultimate example are
the, the, the, the off

95
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.980
to cited design book would
be the design of everyday

96
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.980
things by Norman, who you
evoke within just a few

97
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.490
pages, because you, you share
the Norman door, maybe you

98
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.920
could tell us what the
Norman door is. And then

99
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.810
I have a question about
it. Sure. Yeah. The Norman

100
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.660
door is his classic example
for anyone who works on

101
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.660
product design, if any kind
and it's in his book.

102
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.990
And he talks about affordances
and affordance means how a

103
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.540
design presents itself to you
and what it suggests its

104
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.360
behavior is. And so a
door handle, if it has

105
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.150
a handle, like a handle
on an umbrella, a rounded

106
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.210
handle that implies to any
human being who lives in

107
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.150
the modern world, that it
should be polled a Norman

108
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
doors, any door that has
an affordance like that, but

109
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.100
as a message on it
that says the opposite, like

110
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.920
push. So you can find
these all over the place

111
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.100
doors that have confusing messages
about how you interact with

112
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.040
them. And it's used as
a canonical example for anyone

113
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.360
interested in usability or good
product design of any kind

114
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.380
as a fundamental mistake that
designers often make or engineers

115
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.900
often make when they're making
UI for things of not

116
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.810
thinking through the mental models
that people have and how

117
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.470
to interact with them. And
in writing this book, the

118
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.870
burden I was taking on
is really ambitious, a book

119
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.260
that will explain good design
to everybody. And I couldn't

120
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.290
think of doing that without
making some nod to the

121
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.240
books that have done that
before, try to do something

122
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.940
like that before. And when
I did the research for

123
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.460
this book, I asked everyone
who I knew had an

124
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.680
opinion about design, well, what,
what's the first book you

125
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.340
give to an executive or
manager or a client when

126
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.500
you're trying to explain good
design to them and designed

127
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.150
a very things was one
of the ones that came

128
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.730
with the most. So I'd
read it before I went

129
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.310
back and read it again.
And I felt like, well,

130
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.440
this book has done a
great deal, a great deal

131
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.600
of service to the whole
community of trying to make

132
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.960
things suck less for sure.
But the book itself is

133
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.590
not really designed to solve
that problem. It goes far

134
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.010
too deep into cognitive psychology
and how our memory works.

135
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.930
It's really more of a
guide for someone who's really

136
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.030
going to spend a lot
of time designing UI. So

137
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.300
I included that example for
two reasons, one as a

138
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.090
sort of homage to Don
Norman and the work that

139
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.300
he has done, but also
to help everyone who knows

140
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.120
that example get past it.
So I introduce it, explain

141
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.790
how this is an example
of bad design, but if

142
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.980
you go on Twitter, you'll
find people who call out

143
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.140
Norman, door's all over the
place with outrage. How could

144
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.960
there be another Norman door?
How could there be another

145
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.870
parking lot meter that's hard
to figure out. And there

146
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.210
are really good reasons why
there's so much bad design

147
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.950
in the world. And so
the next chapter, the second

148
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.130
chapter starts to unpack those
reasons. Some of the reasons

149
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.370
why Norman doors exist are
about aesthetics, that the choices

150
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.310
that people who do interior
design or architecture make, they're

151
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.710
trying to make a door
that looks good or fits

152
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.710
into the overall design of
the building, or they'll make

153
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.540
them that, or make design,
they'll choose doors that are

154
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.410
glass with metal bars, which
are more confusing, but it

155
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.070
allows natural light into places.
So there's actual trade offs

156
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.380
that are involved. That explains
why some of these things

157
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.420
exists. And that's where I
wanted to go with the

158
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.960
book to explain why bad
design happens. Cause that's really,

159
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.390
if we want more good
design, it's not just the,

160
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.490
it's not just like someone's
being an idiot and designing

161
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.790
a bad doorknob. There are
structural and organizational reasons that

162
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.040
lead. And in the middle
of that, you called out

163
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.260
something important, which was the
Mexican to be my next

164
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.930
question. But you answered it
for me, which is, is

165
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.070
it hard to write a
book when a book is

166
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.270
considered? That's the book, right?
The Norman book is considered

167
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.980
the book, but you're calling
out that this is not

168
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.250
that book. That book got
really deep into, you know,

169
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.460
the cognitive psychology of it.
This book I would have

170
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.380
to say is more accessible.
I found it to be

171
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.270
an easier read. There's a
lot of density in that,

172
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.230
that Norman book. Was it
intimidating to go in and

173
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.220
tackle this space when everyone
for right or wrong thinks

174
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.100
that the book has been
written? I, well, I think,

175
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.780
I think there's always, we
all believe in progress and

176
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.540
progress happens when people are
willing to take on the

177
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.790
standard and say, you know
what? There's a better way,

178
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.790
or at least a different
way that can be accessible

179
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.800
to a different group of
people or solve a different

180
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.340
problem. One of my earlier
books, a confessions of a

181
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.800
public speaker, I did the
same thing where I was

182
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.840
told, you know what, there's
already a hundred books on

183
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.600
public speaking. Why should there
be another one? And like,

184
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.380
that's just, that's the basis
for creativity is people who

185
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.770
think a different approach to
take. And so I have

186
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.960
a lot of respect for
Don Norman. He is truly

187
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.870
a luminary and hero in
the field, but that book

188
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.140
is 20 years old and
it takes a certain approach

189
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.180
by how it was, how
he chose to design that

190
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.030
book. And I'm going after
a different, I'm trying to

191
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.370
solve a different problem. I
want to invite everybody in

192
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.290
to be thinking more clearly
about good design. Yeah. And

193
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.640
I really feel like you
did that. And I would

194
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.410
even go so far as
to say that I've shared

195
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.530
this book with my 14
year old, it is a

196
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.690
very accessible book. And one
of the things that I

197
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.150
really appreciate about all your
books, this one in particular

198
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.920
is you really give a
sense of historical context. I

199
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.020
wonder if you do that
consciously, you always kind of

200
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.410
call back to here's. Here's
the thing that I've identified.

201
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.510
Here's the thing that I've
researched. Here's some people who

202
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.070
thought about that, and then
you put it into a

203
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.900
context kind of temporarily. You're
always going forward and backwards

204
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.900
in the 20th century throughout
this book, thinking about why

205
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.600
this design happened, what the
thinking behind it and what

206
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.150
was going on in the
world when this, when this

207
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.700
thing happened, I'm glad that
you noticed that. Cause it

208
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.590
takes a lot of work
to pull that off. I

209
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.590
think that, I think that
it's grounding. I think that

210
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.300
we're so fond of believing
that it's a term Tom

211
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.840
Standage who writes for the
economist uses called the Kronos

212
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.000
centric that everything is new.
And we're the first, we're

213
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.810
the first group of people
ever to face design problems,

214
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.910
engineering problems. And that's just
patently untrue. It just, it's

215
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.670
a shallow understanding of the
history of your own field.

216
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.950
If you tend to think
that way. And I think

217
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.480
there's a power to stories
when they come from further

218
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.840
back in history, there are
also more stable stories. If

219
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.180
I were to write this
book and all my examples

220
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.510
are about the latest, the
latest iPhone or the latest

221
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.770
laptop in a year, those
stories are going to be

222
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.750
out of date. They're not
going to have any power

223
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.740
relevance anymore, but by carefully
choosing interesting stories from the

224
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.800
past that have power, that
those are stories that I

225
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.860
hope and think will stay
with people longer and be

226
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.470
more applicable because there'll be
able to refer back to

227
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.970
something that comes from a
deeper, a deeper place. How

228
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.230
did you decide about the
story arc your, your chapters

229
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.560
in this book? You've got
about 20 chapters and there's

230
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.300
a bit of a bell
curve there and the kind

231
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.880
of the, the, some, some
discussion around design as a

232
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.550
verb and a great chapter
called the pass in your

233
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.080
pocket. I want to talk
about in a little bit,

234
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.900
how did you figure out
how to end? How did

235
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.590
you slide down the other
side of the story arc?

236
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.510
Well, that is mostly about,
I always have a rough

237
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.390
outline. I have, you know,
I usually have, as I'm

238
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.430
thinking of the early draft
of the book is usually

239
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.170
ideas from 2030, 40 chapters.
I do the same. We're

240
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.680
going to project management technique.
Any smart person would use,

241
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.390
you make a big list
and you start refining it,

242
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.120
prioritizing it. And then you
write the first draft. And

243
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.430
then in writing the first
draft, you realize, all right,

244
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.050
chapter seven, I thought it
was going to be great.

245
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.690
And it sucks. I'll rip
that one out. And then

246
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.850
chapter nine and 10, you
realize, you know what, they're

247
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.610
separate now really should be
merged. Like you discover all

248
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.830
these things to the iterative
process of making stuff. So

249
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.340
I do that a lot,
but I don't know what,

250
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.560
what the, what the anchoring
stores are going to be

251
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.460
yet. I'll have guesses, but
it's only through the writing

252
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.380
a whole draft and then
reading it and giving it

253
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.150
to beta readers. I start
to get a feel for

254
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.190
it. That story just doesn't
work here. So I do

255
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.960
need to replace that story
with a better one or

256
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.450
rip out that part of
the chapter. And so I

257
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.800
think the book ends, you'll
ask you about the tail

258
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.360
end of the bell curve.
The book ends with the

259
00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:01.870
story, a chapter that talks
about how solutions become problems,

260
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.530
the designs that succeed because
there's generate problems. And all

261
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.540
the first part of that
chapter is about the medical

262
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.000
community. And what goes on
in a hospital room with

263
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.740
all the alarms and the
bells that compete with each

264
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.410
other. I didn't come to
that as being the anchor

265
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.930
for setting up the last
chapter until it was a

266
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.960
late draft. It's probably draft
four or three or four.

267
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.350
And as I'm working, doing
research, I make a huge

268
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.660
document. It's got all these
cool stories in it, just

269
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.180
reference from all the things
I've been reading. And as

270
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.210
I'm doing revisions, I Mark
each of the stories in

271
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.210
that big document is marked
with notes for where it

272
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.700
might, what chapter it might
work in. So as I

273
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.160
am writing, if I get
stuck and realize this story

274
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.650
sucks, or the fact I
thought was true, I did

275
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.170
more research and I'm totally
wrong. It's not true. So

276
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.630
it doesn't work. I can
go back to my notes

277
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.700
and go, what else did
I have that could tell

278
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.710
the story of exclusion and
you know, gender bias in

279
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.080
design? Oh, I can go
back to that section and

280
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.520
see if I have another
story and I can put

281
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.540
it back in and see
if it works. And you

282
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.000
get into, I think that's
chapter 19, when you say

283
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.400
solutions create problems. But then
what I like about the

284
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.460
book is when you think
you're at the end, there's

285
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.910
basically 20 pages of notes
of references of other books

286
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.700
to read. You share your
entire process here, and you

287
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.120
actually have a call to
action to improve the design

288
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.040
of the world. I love
this one particular line that

289
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.500
I highlighted. You said, it's
a big world. And then

290
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.470
this is a small book.
You actually give a list

291
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.230
of the things that we
can do to kind of

292
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.840
ask. And I liked the
way you phrased this. What

293
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.110
can you ask of the
things that you see around

294
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.930
you when you see a
thing that is designed that

295
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.450
doesn't meet your needs or
that you feel some kind

296
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.780
of way about what do
you ask of that object?

297
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:48.390
Yeah. I wanted to make
it actionable. I think it's

298
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.610
a, I think I'm good
at storytelling. I think I'm

299
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.440
good at structuring a narrative
experience. People will hopefully say

300
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.470
it's a good read, but
I really have the ambition

301
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.810
of, I want a better
design world. That's all that

302
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.590
stuff that doesn't work well,
that should, and the people

303
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.320
who make stuff. And I
know you from your career

304
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.290
were around a lot of
people who make stuff, developers

305
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.650
and designers and entrepreneurs, everyone
who I know who wants

306
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.560
to make stuff wants to
make something good. So there's

307
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.780
a gap there in their
knowledge about it. And so

308
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.550
I want anyone who makes
two goods to get through

309
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.560
the book and feels, ah,
I think I see the

310
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.200
world better. Well, I want
them to be, have some

311
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.200
tools for how they can
apply that knowledge and ask

312
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.320
better questions when they're in
meetings or when they write

313
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.510
a product review, think about
it in a more critical

314
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.990
way, or I wanted to
make it an, I wanted

315
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.790
to make what they get
out of it, something that's

316
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.530
active and help them help
them on their way. One

317
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.020
of the best questions that
you ask that you mentioned

318
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.180
a little bit at the
beginning of our conversation is

319
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.430
what hidden constraints can explain
this things. Weaknesses. I think

320
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.340
a lot of us just
assume that, well, the only

321
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.310
explanation for why this is
this way is because the

322
00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:00.880
people who made it are
idiots, but there are other

323
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.940
kids in constraints. Okay. Yeah.
There, there is. Although, you

324
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.710
know, I don't want to,
I don't want to defend

325
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:10.810
a, I don't want it
to be clear. I see

326
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.960
as a problem, but yeah,
we all kind of know

327
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.800
it in our own lives,
that when we work on

328
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.550
projects, we know that we
didn't get enough budget and

329
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.560
that's why it's not that
great. Or there was a

330
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.580
political fight between one department
head and another, or a

331
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.480
team or teammates weren't useful
or PR we know at

332
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.960
work for ourselves. How many
of the constraints that limit

333
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.940
the quality of the work
that we can make on

334
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.610
projects is really about all
these tough things that are

335
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.430
hard. But when you are
in the world as a,

336
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.120
as a, as a person
using things, we're not really

337
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.060
interested in being generous to
these teams, we don't know

338
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.270
about. So we take it
at face value when there's

339
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.000
a confusing intersection that we
drive through or, or we

340
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.150
miss an exit because the
sign wasn't clear, you know,

341
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.450
we're rightfully mad because we're
living in the world with

342
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.840
that experience. But that anger
about a stupid design. You

343
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.840
don't learn anything from just
assuming the team was stupid.

344
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.600
There's far more lessons to
be discovered as you go,

345
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.530
wait a second, let me
find out why that sign

346
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.200
was made that way. Like,
what's the story behind this

347
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.290
design failure. That's really where
you start to learn just

348
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:24.610
flippantly saying something is terrible
or flippantly, flippantly saying something

349
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:27.460
was great without starting to
ask questions, you don't want

350
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.680
to learn anything. And I
really wanted this to be

351
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.190
a book that people even
just one chapter on its

352
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.370
own, people will go, Oh,
now I can see why

353
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.710
maybe this thing I experienced
last month or a year

354
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.500
ago, or think this thing
that frustrates me now, I'm

355
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.800
starting to get some insight
into what's really going on.

356
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.710
You know, a really great
example of exactly what you

357
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.240
just said is chapter 12,
you talk about an airplane

358
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.200
boarding pass and you show
kind of the classic Delta,

359
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.070
you know, airplane boarding pass.
And it's, it's not really

360
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.980
interesting or useful. It's just
a boarding pass, right? And

361
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.130
then you call out an
example of a very talented

362
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.740
designer who went through and
redesigned it. And then you

363
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.830
show the, the, the more
readable, more attractive boarding pass.

364
00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.180
And you look at, and
you go, Oh my God,

365
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.480
this is gorgeous. Like we
should, this is amazing. We

366
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.880
all need this boarding pass,
but then you look at

367
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.580
it and you're like, wow,
it's a lot less readable.

368
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.970
It's kind of like a
star Trek. You know, Ella

369
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.580
car's kind of interface. I
don't really like, where am

370
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.780
I sitting in? Cause I
don't even know where the

371
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:36.150
seat is. It's, it's initially
gorgeous. But what is the

372
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.630
word for these kinds of
redesigns Drive by redesign? All

373
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.460
right. He jumped in the
whole team, did a bunch

374
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.550
of research. He applied his
is excellent. I it's a

375
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:51.890
gorgeous thing, but it's, it's
not better. Yeah. Well the,

376
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.890
the chapter gets into why
it's just impossible. Like the,

377
00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.670
the, the, the dry by
design thing, I think is

378
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.890
a phenomenon of any creator
on Twitter or Facebook where

379
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.280
they, they use something and
they see a terrible logo,

380
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.560
or as a software developer,
they use something that just

381
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.500
is very slow and buggy.
And then on Twitter there's

382
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.970
so I can design it
better when I could do

383
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.040
a better one and they
just start typing what they

384
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.020
would do. That would be
so much, it's so obvious

385
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.560
from the outside. And so
this example, the boarding pass

386
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.930
is a great one because
that we do this all

387
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.790
the time and just, we
redesigned things on our own,

388
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.370
or we like, we watched
the last star Wars movie

389
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.510
and we're like, Oh, I
could have written a better

390
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.960
script. And we just presume
that it's all, it's all

391
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.780
superficial and obvious in the
case of the boarding pass

392
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.140
design, the real constraint of
why boarding passes look the

393
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.570
way they do. And this
is true also for like,

394
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.540
if you fill out a
medical form or an insurance

395
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.960
form, it's confusing, there's often
constraints that have to do

396
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.410
with how they're printed, what
printing services are available at

397
00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.410
that scale. And so it
turns out that in most

398
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.460
airports, there's a limited set
of printers that were installed

399
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.840
in the late eighties. Mostly
that have limited abilities. They're

400
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.110
not dot matrix printers, but
they can't do multicolor there's

401
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.260
there's limits on the sizing
options that they have. And

402
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.220
so the constraints are purely
physical. They're about, they're about

403
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.550
bits and they're about atoms.
And that's why those boarding

404
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.940
passes are designed the way
that they are, because the

405
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.150
costs of putting a new
printers in every gate in

406
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.950
every airport would be astronomical.
And this is where designers

407
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.860
and engineers. You start thinking
through constraints now that yes,

408
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.070
maybe you could design something
that was better in one

409
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.490
way, but the expense of
it to actually achieve that,

410
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.210
given all the logistics required
would be, make it ridiculously

411
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.870
unaffordable. And so what's what
is design then is design.

412
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:49.390
Then this abstract commentary that
we're, we offer things, or

413
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.030
are we in the real
world where to really make

414
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.130
a better boarding pass, you
have to deal with the

415
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:59.260
real constraints. And it's often
way more fun to skip

416
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.080
over the real constraints and
just pretend like, well, I

417
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.730
could do a better job.
I'm going to make fun

418
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.490
of this, this thing I
just saw on social media.

419
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.510
We see that a lot.
When we see people go

420
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.000
and redesign Mac or redesigned
windows, or they say, why

421
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.940
doesn't the start menu look
like this? And I'm usually,

422
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.010
even though I work at
Microsoft right now, I go

423
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.750
and say, Oh my God,
we need to stop everything.

424
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.090
And we need to redesign
the start menu to look

425
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.940
like that. Yeah. But again,
it doesn't think about the

426
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.810
billion people using the thing,
the, and the usability, the

427
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.740
usability, the inclusion, the accessibility
constraints. There are a ton

428
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.350
of hidden constraints that designers
face. And I think, as

429
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.500
you said before, we just
tend to go, well, that's

430
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.840
just, it should just be
like this. And it should

431
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.720
just be like that. It's
very, very human to minimize

432
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.390
the complexity of a, of
a thing. Yeah. Especially when

433
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.400
you don't actually have to
do the work, you're just

434
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.270
driving by for five minutes,
you're going to rail against

435
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:55.290
how stupid the people at
Microsoft or Google, how dumb

436
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.910
they are. They designed it
this way. And then you

437
00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.410
move on in your life
and you never have to

438
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.550
actually discover how much harder
it is to do these

439
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:07.530
things. Then it seems from
the outside, Hey, friends, I

440
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.870
want to thank one of
our sponsors. The company text

441
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.990
control. They're the creator of
TXT tax control. It's a

442
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.370
Microsoft word, inspired document editor
library. It's basically a document

443
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.880
processing engine for your web
applications. They've got libraries for

444
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.240
asp.net, MVC for angular, for
no JS. And they just

445
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.050
released a.net core version. It
lets you basically integrate a

446
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.800
Wiziwig document editor into your
web applications. You can edit

447
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.130
docs, you can do merge
templates. You can include data.

448
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.490
You can even create Adobe
PDF documents. It's a fully

449
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.520
featured API. It's really pretty
amazing. You can try it

450
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.010
free. And I encourage you
to check out the live

451
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:52.260
demos@textcontrol.com slash demos, text control.com/demos.
It's really pretty amazing piece

452
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.190
of work. Do you think
that the close door button

453
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.650
in an elevator does anything
or has you done the

454
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.500
research and confirm that it
in fact does not. I

455
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.120
did all the research. So
I confirmed that the, it

456
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.390
really depends, but in most
cases they don't do anything

457
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.730
in the United States. The reason
is in part because of

458
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:19.050
the American disabilities act and
that required that doors stay

459
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.760
open long enough that someone
with on a wheelchair or

460
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.980
on crutches, or who's just
older and a little slow,

461
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.340
has time to get to
the door up until then.

462
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.480
They probably worked more often.
But in general, these things

463
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.320
are what are called placebo
buttons that like a placebo

464
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.810
your mind, or your mind
may think that it's actually

465
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.710
doing something which can have
an actual beneficial effect on

466
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.370
your experience. But in reality,
the button doesn't do anything.

467
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.150
So crosswalk buttons at intersections
are another common example. The

468
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.900
wiring to maintain those is
expensive. And also the traffic

469
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.990
systems in many cities are
controlled based on time of

470
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.680
day and other factors. And
if they incorporated individual user

471
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.310
commands into that system, it
would just be untenable and

472
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.910
it wouldn't work. And then,
But it would feel weird.

473
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.650
It wouldn't match my mental
model. If there was only

474
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.020
an open button, because you
need two sides, you need

475
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.390
to open it up. Yeah.
And some again, though, it's

476
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.660
people complain, why isn't there
a closed door button? So

477
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.490
what are you going to
do if you're the person

478
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.890
that you're the superintendent of
the building you're putting in

479
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.870
a closed door button and
now people are happier because

480
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.270
it lights up. Even though
it doesn't do anything, that's

481
00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.690
way cheaper. It solves the
problem. But it's way cheaper

482
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.540
than actually having to do
engineering and wiring. It. Actually

483
00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.390
elevator control systems are fascinating
in a way, because they're

484
00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.630
not controlled by the elevator.
They're controlled in some cases

485
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.960
by the whole master system
that links together how, which,

486
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.870
which the elevators are gonna
go, where elevators are talking

487
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.890
about constraints. Elevator design has
way more complications than, than

488
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.610
most people think that they
do. The, the point that

489
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.940
you made about complaints and
how people complain. There was

490
00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.370
another great story. When we're
thinking about mental models and

491
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.910
people were complaining. So the
design change was to move

492
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:05.860
when someone lands and they
want to go get their

493
00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.550
bags of the baggage system
to move the carousel far

494
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.640
away, because people were complaining
that they'd show up and

495
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.280
they'd wear my bags. Why
is moving it from our

496
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.130
way, fix it. This is
a fascinating story. And it's

497
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.250
a fascinating story in part,
because it's not, it's probably

498
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.160
not entirely true. Now, when
I do research, I try

499
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.270
to be, I wrote a
book on the midst of

500
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.180
innovation, which is all about
showing all these things we

501
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.390
think we commonly know about
creativity and innovation, that many

502
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.240
of those stories are terribly
mistold and unfounded and not

503
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.270
really based on actual evidence
for things like Newton's. Apple

504
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.790
is a very contentious story
when it comes to history

505
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.770
and how all that stuff
gets told. So I try

506
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.780
to keep a really high
bar for anything. I include

507
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.390
that story was written in
the New York times in the

508
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.950
early 1990s about an airport
in Dallas, or then they

509
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.950
never say which specific airport,
which is usually a problem.

510
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.200
But as the story goes,
I'll tell, I'll tell it.

511
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.900
As it's usually told, they
were having complaints about how

512
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.140
long people had to wait.
And what they had tried

513
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.630
at first were different options
for like speeding up baggage

514
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.660
handling and automating the system.
They tried all the logical

515
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.260
rational approaches, but it didn't
help enough. People were still

516
00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.260
complaining. So as the story
is told, what they did

517
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.950
instead was something that seems,
it seems, it seems irrational.

518
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.020
What they did instead was
they made it that the

519
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.170
walk to get, when you
get from the gate, the

520
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.600
walk from your gate to
where your bags are was

521
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.050
longer. And by making it
longer, it made it so

522
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.330
that there was more time
for your bags to arrive.

523
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.730
So the percentage of time,
when you got to where

524
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.720
the bag is, where the
baggage claim area, number five,

525
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.530
the bags were there and
people stopped complaining. Even though

526
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.000
it took longer, there's something
about our mental models for

527
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.520
how time passes. When we
wait for things, we get

528
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.460
irritated. But if we are
walking to a place and

529
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.610
the stuff is there, we
feel good. And this was

530
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.840
in the chapter, just reflect
that engineers and people who

531
00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.630
are very smart and rational.
We try to solve problems

532
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.150
rationally. We want to really
solve the problem, but our

533
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.180
brains don't work that way
all the time. People who

534
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:10.740
are users and consumers and
customers, their relationship to rationale,

535
00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.580
we're more emotional creatures. And
our perceptions of time are

536
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.470
not as rigorous as engineers
tend to think. So the

537
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.210
lesson from that story, even
if it's not entirely true,

538
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.380
is that by understanding human
psychology, you need to understand

539
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.560
human psychology better in order
to design and engineer things

540
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.690
better for people. If you're
not doing that, you're going

541
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.120
to make the mistake of
trying to solve the problem.

542
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.820
One way, when there's a
much easier approach, that's just

543
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.770
as good. That requires a
lot less effort and a

544
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.790
lot less work. And there's
a ton of people out

545
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:45.350
there who think about waiting
like time and temporal management,

546
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.590
how people think and how
people experience time. That's a

547
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.340
whole world of psychology. Like
that's designing so that we

548
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.530
don't get irritated. Whether it
be waiting in line at

549
00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.100
Disney Disneyland or on an
elevator or at the DMV,

550
00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.670
all of those things you
want to basically reduce the

551
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.980
anxiety of the people waiting
in line. Yeah. And so

552
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.340
that's a Disney, world's a
fantastic example because people don't

553
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.560
think of it this way.
And Disney Disney would never

554
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.260
advertise their amusement parks this
way, but they're really not

555
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.510
amusing parks. They're more like
waiting in line parks. You

556
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.900
spend most of your time
waiting in line. And, and,

557
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.990
but they've made a whole
bunch of very big investments

558
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.080
to make that entertaining and
pleasant and as fun as

559
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.840
interactive things along the way
you get food, they also

560
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.750
give you estimated wait times,
which is a smart thing

561
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.420
to do. And the estimated
wait times are always inflated,

562
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.900
but as much as possible.
So even though you waited

563
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.750
45, you thought you were
gonna wait 45 minutes. If

564
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.400
you only wait 30 minutes,
do you feel like you

565
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.430
got a good deal? And
that's again about anchoring a

566
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.760
principle about psycho psychology, that
when you anchor something, it

567
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.530
could be the price of
the most expensive food item

568
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.380
on a menu. It sets
your perspective for what good,

569
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.940
bad, and great are. And
so that's another technique that

570
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.340
you couldn't, they could have
spent all this time trying

571
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.090
to really figure out. Maybe
we can have five rollercoasters

572
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.340
go at the same time,
one after another. And we

573
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.100
can up the speed of
the, and the engineering capacity

574
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.610
of the system or Wallace
let's, let's focus on psychology,

575
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.520
let's design for psychology and
make it better. So I

576
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.760
think the door opened or
closed button. You might not

577
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.190
need that. If it said
closing and five seconds, four

578
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.710
seconds, three, if it actually
gave you a time estimate,

579
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.920
also when you're waiting for
an elevator, same thing, you

580
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.050
push that button and then
it lights up and then

581
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.520
we all push it again.
And we push it again,

582
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.420
push it again. Like it's
entirely irrational. The button is

583
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.910
lit. Like we know the
system knows that we want

584
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.730
it, but yet we still
feel like if we don't

585
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.640
do something because we don't
know. But if it said

586
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.810
estimated for next car, you
know, two and a half

587
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.540
minutes, all right, I'll just
read an article on my

588
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.440
phone. We know that we're
being taken care of. I

589
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.080
feel like we need to
go and fix the windows

590
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.590
Explorer file copy dialogue. Because
when they estimate the time

591
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.090
that's going to be like
this final copy is going

592
00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:58.980
to take a month. You
know, I don't feel like

593
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.380
I'm winning when it only
takes five minutes and there's

594
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.410
no button, there's no placebo
button. The, I really mean

595
00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.890
it. You know? No, I
really want a copy that

596
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.260
I need that. One of
the last things I want

597
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.910
to ask you about is
that you call that some

598
00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.050
broken organizational problems that need
to be overcome designed by

599
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.100
dysfunction, designed by committee and
designed by regulation. If you

600
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.740
could share those problems and
why solving them is so

601
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.710
important. Well, I think that
gets back to constraints that

602
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.470
when we use something that
frustrates us, we have in

603
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.140
our head, that there was
just one overlord in the

604
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.720
project that controlled every decision
that was made. And the

605
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.300
reason why the thing is
bad is because that person

606
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.960
was an idiot yet in
our own world, our own

607
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.320
working world, we know there's
a head of engineering. There's

608
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.840
a head of project management
for every, for every product

609
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.610
team, right? There's a head
of engineering is a head

610
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.040
of program management. There's a
head of testing. If you

611
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.920
have quality assurance as a
head of marketing, and if

612
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.140
the head of engineering and
the head of the design

613
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.630
team or the head of
the project management team hate

614
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.810
each other, that's going to
ripple down through the organization

615
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.210
in all kinds of dysfunctional
ways is not going to

616
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:06.450
be respect for the contributions
of different roles and different

617
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.970
people with different knowledge. Have
there's not going to be

618
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.060
a healthy schedule process because
it's going to be fighting

619
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.030
and in fighting over which
things get prioritized. If the

620
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:20.280
goals aren't clear. So I
think that usually it's possibly

621
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.220
the primary reason why so
much of the world is

622
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:27.030
so many things that were
poorly designed. This most organizations

623
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.670
don't work very well. They're
there, there are, they are

624
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.270
dysfunctional. People don't communicate well
or decisions are not made

625
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.660
clearly, or there isn't a
good vision, or there's a

626
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.510
thousand things that have to
be done well to make

627
00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.000
an organization a healthy place.
And it's hard to do,

628
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.850
but even though it's hard
to do, you can't expect

629
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:49.290
an organization that's just bad
at making good decisions to

630
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:53.370
make good design decisions. That's
just improbable. Design is one

631
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.340
of many kinds of decisions
that an organization has to

632
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.800
make. And I think one
of my critiques of many

633
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.580
books on design, including a
design of everyday things and

634
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.730
Steve Krug's don't make me
think there are many great

635
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.880
books about design. They rarely
go to these places that

636
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.990
are the fundamental reasons why
things end up as in

637
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.390
the product as not working
well. It's about how, how

638
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.120
the project team has led,
how it's managed, how, where

639
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.910
the, where does the budget
come from? You can't really

640
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:24.960
worry about your, does your
design or usability experts, ability

641
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.810
to contribute if there's no
budget for it. And if,

642
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.280
or if the schedule is
a mess and there's no

643
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.490
time for it. So there's
a fundamentalist of just projects

644
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.720
that are integral to thinking
about how good design of

645
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.930
any kind happens. So dysfunctional
teams don't work design by

646
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:46.430
committee basically means designed by
consensus people, just trying to

647
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.480
come up with the least
awesome hospital solution. And then

648
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.630
of course, designed by regulation
can almost suck the life

649
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.710
out of design completely. For
sure. Yeah. And that's anything

650
00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:01.610
that we see it's in
the public like traffic, traffic,

651
00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.480
traffic design, a traffic sign
design, like the highway signs,

652
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.260
you see public transportation systems
and where, whether you have

653
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.690
there's a bus stop, a
block from your house or

654
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:15.650
50 blocks from your house.
There's a lot of regulation

655
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:18.260
and public process that goes
into making any kind of

656
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.160
design change. We're getting design
approvals. And we like to

657
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.710
make fun of some people
like to make fun work

658
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.760
in the private sector, how
clumsy and foolhardy government projects

659
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.890
can be. But part of
the, part of it is

660
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.370
the challenge of those constraints.
Many of which were created

661
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.760
for a good reason, but
managing those constraints effectively now

662
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.240
becomes as big a challenge
as coming up with the

663
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.800
ideas and developing them is
as well. Yeah. You've got

664
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.560
to, actually, one of my
particular favorite chapter is the

665
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.660
one on design as it
flows with regards to how

666
00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:55.670
people move through space, how
people move through airports, garages,

667
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.520
transportation as a whole design
issue as well. Yeah. Well,

668
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.380
thank you so much, Scott Burke,
and for chatting with me

669
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.200
today about your book, how
design makes the world, I,

670
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.240
I really enjoyed it very
much and I appreciate the

671
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.100
opportunity to chat with you.
Thanks for having me on

672
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.800
it was a great conversation.
It was a pleasure. This

673
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.440
has been another episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

674
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:28.060
again next week. <inaudible>.
