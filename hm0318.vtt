this episode, Scott talks with
Pete Brown about making real

9
00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.170
stuff. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

10
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.810
of Hansel minutes. And today
we're talking to Pete Brown.

11
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.850
Pete has been on the
show a couple of times

12
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.520
before, and they do it
on this developer's life. But

13
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.960
Pete and I always have
fun when we talk. So

14
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.580
I wanted to chat with
Pete today. How's it gone

15
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.610
now? Good. How are you
doing Scott? Pretty good. I

16
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.270
just, I'm just literally, as
we're sitting here, got into

17
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.350
my office and a Fitbit
came in the mail. If

18
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.940
you remember, I was playing
with a Fitbit a couple

19
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.810
of couple of years ago
and it, it died. Did

20
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.480
you ever try a Fitbit?
No, I think my wife

21
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.850
was interested in one, but
you know, my, my exercise

22
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.600
Generally walking from upstairs to
downstairs might Commute to work,

23
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.480
right? Yeah. My, my exercise
is usually rolling out of

24
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.000
bed directly onto my iPad.
Right. So, so did you,

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.300
is this something you ordered
or just like random products

26
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.490
showing up? I'm trying to
do it. Yeah, of course.

27
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.770
There's always random product showing
up at my house. No,

28
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.370
I wish no. I just,
I just kind of rebooted

29
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.040
my fitness life about three
weeks ago when, when it

30
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.120
got sunny and the thing
is, man, you know how,

31
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.250
like nobody wants to admit
that they have that stuff.

32
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.570
It's called sad, seasonal affective
disorder, which is the, I

33
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.170
get depressed when it's not
sunny disease, which is like

34
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.810
most of the year up
there. Right. Yeah. Which is

35
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.260
basically always right. But, but
man, when the sun comes

36
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.320
out, it is just like
dancing in the streets in

37
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.710
Portland. I tell you, there
was a, there was this

38
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.910
amazing science fiction. I can't
remember who this was. It

39
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.910
was a science fiction, short
story that they made us

40
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.040
read when I was in
eighth grade. And it was

41
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.430
so unbelievably powerful. It was
about these kids who all

42
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.150
live on Venus and it
rains always. And what I

43
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.160
mean, always, I don't mean
just 24 hours a day.

44
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.610
It rains 24 hours a
day, 265 days a year

45
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.900
or whatever. Venus here is
always. And every, I think

46
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.650
11 years the sun comes
out and it stops raining

47
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.010
for like 10. So the
first part of the beginning

48
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.790
of this short story is
the building up of this.

49
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.460
It's depressing and it's draining
and they've lived their entire

50
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.970
lives and they've only ever
seen clouds and rain. And

51
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.760
then the sun comes out,
but there's this little girl

52
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.730
that they're really mean to,
and without thinking on the

53
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.680
day that the sun was
going to come out, they

54
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.830
lock her in a closet
and she ends up. Yeah.

55
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.930
And she ends up seeing
only like a sliver of

56
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.580
sun to the door and
then comes out like as

57
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.440
the sun is gone and
then she has to wait

58
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.770
11 years to see the
sun again, you just totally

59
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.440
make me sad. It's like,
Yeah, I'm picturing well, that,

60
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.360
that may be sad, but
so we'll need to, it

61
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.250
can only go up from
there, right? No, that was

62
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.110
in eighth grade. That made
me cry. Like a baby.

63
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.310
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I
I'm picturing like Seattle and

64
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.800
Portland, that whole area up
there, like some big 80

65
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.110
song and dance number, you
know, like everybody's out in

66
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.300
the street and confetti and
throwing up their hands and

67
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.310
stuff. Yeah. That's pretty much
like, it it's like that.

68
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.820
Yeah. That's what I thought.
But I'll give you an

69
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.990
example though, of something extremely
Portland. We were, this is

70
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.640
like a classic Portland. I
don't know how it works

71
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.500
with anywhere else in the
world. Cause I've only ever

72
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.100
lived here, but my wife's
in school right now. So

73
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.440
I watched the kids on
the weekends and it was

74
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.750
a Saturday and I was
like, okay boys, what do

75
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.130
we want to do today?
Like, I don't know, what

76
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.930
should we do? So I
go to like, this PDX

77
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.600
PDX is the code for
Portland. I go to this

78
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.460
PDX calendar website and it
says, Oh, there's a pirate

79
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.580
scavenger hunt today. I'm like,
okay. And it's in the

80
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.420
Hawthorne part of town and
Hawthorne is the most granola

81
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.630
part of town. So like
you're more likely to see

82
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.360
a lot of white people
with dreadlocks and sandals and

83
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.030
Mo in bare feet than
anywhere else in Portland. It's

84
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.630
just a very clever classically
Portland place and pirates apparently.

85
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.050
Yeah. So we go there
and it is literally a

86
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.940
pirate of scavenger hunt. There
are like adults, full adults

87
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.170
dress like Jack Sparrow, wandering
the streets, looking for stuff.

88
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.640
And it's all coordinated by
this, this dollar store. And

89
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.770
basically the idea was they
wanted you to visit all

90
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.800
the local businesses and then
every local business had a

91
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.580
challenge. And the challenge was
in basically related to you

92
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.770
knowing their products. So it's
like, you know, go to

93
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.980
the futon store and find
three pieces of pirate gold.

94
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.500
And they're no hidden under
the futons that they want

95
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.250
to sell, but the kids
just loved it. And everyone

96
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.370
gets dressed as a pirate
and get pirate booty and

97
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.610
candy. And it was just
got just a classic Portland

98
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.980
thing to do. But you
can only do that for

99
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.050
the 12 days of the
year that it is sunny

100
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.950
in Portland. So anyway, it
got sunny and suddenly I

101
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.660
got all the energy in
the world and all the

102
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.500
vitamin D decided to start
working out in earnest, again,

103
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.440
trying new diabetes medications and
like really working at it.

104
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.490
And I work out, but
now I'm really working out

105
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.070
to the point where I
hurt. Right. Sure. If that's

106
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.740
a good thing or not.
So I'm like, well, my

107
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.580
Fitbit had been broken cause
I washed it. I'll usually

108
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.830
break it. Yeah. Yeah. So
I washed my Fitbit and

109
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.480
now I went and got
a new one because they

110
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.540
have a new Fitbit it's
called the Fitbit ultra. So

111
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.900
it's a wireless pedometer that
watches your background movement. It's

112
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.050
effectively a gyroscope. And what's
nice about it is that

113
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.630
you, if you don't want
to, it just picks up

114
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.770
the data by walking by
your computer. Right. So I'm

115
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.260
guessing that you plan the
washing of the old one

116
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.150
just to get the new
one and have an excuse

117
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.540
for your wife. That would,
that would not be true,

118
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.250
but I could totally see
where you would think that.

119
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.500
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think
you're just saying that would

120
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.510
not be true. Sure. If
Rachel listened to this podcast

121
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.150
okay. Possible considering that she
has been on the show

122
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.510
now there's, there's, it's very
possible that she might get

123
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.960
me in trouble. Right. Right.
But the point is that

124
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.050
you got to understand that
I'm plugged into an insulin

125
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.960
pump, which is doing stuff
to me 24 hours a

126
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.410
day. So the idea of
like plugging something into me

127
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.350
to get more data is
totally reasonable thing to do.

128
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.320
Like everyone should do that.
You're like just shy of

129
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.170
being an access point at
this point. You know, actually

130
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.260
I am an access point.
I have a clear 4g

131
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.960
hotspot that I put in
my bag because I keep

132
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.390
using more than four gigs
on my iPhone data plan.

133
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.760
So it's on most of
the time as a way

134
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.820
to keep me from going
over. Okay. If, if the

135
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.510
pirate thing didn't have people
screaming nerd at their, at

136
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.460
their speakers here, then I
think that maybe just did

137
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.310
it. Yeah. Well the next
part is that I used

138
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.990
allowance to buy the, the
Withings scale. So wifi scale.

139
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.620
Oh that, yes. I saw
that it was at like

140
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.140
one of the big trade
shows and I thought, who

141
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.540
on earth would buy one
of those? And I think

142
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.700
I have the answer now.
Yeah. Thank you very much

143
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.270
for that. And when you're
making the argument to the,

144
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.340
to the wife or the
spouse, it's like, but it

145
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.780
automatically recognizes the user, you
know, like that, that, that,

146
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.980
like from my perspective, that
should be enough to sell

147
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.590
it, but he knows who
you are. You know? It's

148
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.800
like, it's like buying a
more expensive car because it

149
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.570
has preset power seats. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, so what

150
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.030
does it do? Like, can
it, can you program it

151
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.190
to like insult you and
stuff or motivate you? Stuff

152
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.860
like that. Although interestingly, if
you go to the website

153
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.470
and you look at their
clip art, when you show

154
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.260
up there, there's a picture
of the scale. And then

155
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:25.420
the LCD screen says, hi,
H I, yeah. Which I

156
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.900
immediately took to mean you're
too fat. I can't even

157
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.280
give you a number. So
I'm just going to put

158
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.500
the number. Hi Tilt. Yeah.
That's cause that's what an

159
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.460
insulin pump says. When you
go over 400, it's like,

160
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.710
no, I have no idea.
You're high. Like, you know,

161
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.850
stratosphere Tips for listeners don't
ever greet you with just

162
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.010
a high, it should be
a low. So walk up

163
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.540
to me and just say,
hi, I'm going to immediately

164
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.270
take insulin. And that will
be extraordinarily bad. So the

165
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.950
thing that I thought was
interesting about these is not

166
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.000
just that I'm a, you
know, a fat person getting

167
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.450
less fat, but more that
it's body hacking and hardware

168
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.820
hacking. And I know you
have an interest in that

169
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.600
kind of stuff. And it
made me wonder if, if

170
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.180
these things had open SDKs
that you could plug into,

171
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.430
wouldn't you be more likely
as a geek to want

172
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.960
one, Oh, heck yeah. You
know, it's, it'd be almost

173
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.390
worth getting some of the
diseases that some of these

174
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.210
things treat just so you
can, you know, hook up

175
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.970
these tools, Just like, Oh,
I'm sorry, I'm eating this

176
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.430
cheesecake. Cause I need diabetes
so that I can exactly

177
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.490
scale so that I can
hack into it. Exactly. It's

178
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.150
for science. Exactly. Exactly. But
yeah. I mean, if they

179
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.330
have like open protocols and
stuff and you know, safety

180
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.180
factors aside because, you know,
that's, that's a separate issue,

181
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.150
but like one of the
things I always like, what

182
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.000
was that, that sleep device
that you and I both

183
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.960
tried, that we had looked
on the <inaudible> like, I,

184
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.990
I wanted stuff like that,
that you could hack. Like

185
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.480
I wanted it to be
able to send data to

186
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.580
things of my choosing and
I don't know what the

187
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.960
heck I would do with
it. Figure out what I'm

188
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.870
dreaming about at night maybe,
but you know, I wanna,

189
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.060
I want stuff like that,
that I can hack into.

190
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.460
I mean, having it be
open hardware and having it

191
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.490
be, you know, open protocols
and stuff is a big

192
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.490
deal for these devices. I
don't, I don't understand why

193
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.660
this isn't the immediate first
obvious thing. I mean, people

194
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.470
go and build these companies
and then build a whole

195
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.630
website around it and a
whole data system around it

196
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.530
and all these things. Why,
why do that? Why not

197
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.480
build it and say, look,
I have some open hardware.

198
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.330
You guys go and build
a website because the Fitbit

199
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.870
guys have been fooling around
with their website, trying to

200
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.390
get it right for a
long time, you know, a

201
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.510
couple of years. And it's
just not very good. The

202
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.610
product is amazing, but the
website is so other people

203
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.300
have hacked into their stuff
and made better, you know,

204
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.930
better Fitbit sites, like the
alternative sites for you to

205
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.470
look at Fitbit stats. Right.
They would have done that.

206
00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:00.020
Had you just said, Hey
FYI, Some companies. And I

207
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.090
don't know what Fitbit's background
is and like where they

208
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.120
came from. But some of
these hardware companies totally get

209
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.460
that and they start off
that way. And then you

210
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.500
get sites like patchbay right.
It's PA C H U

211
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.070
B E. Okay. That sort
of grew up just for,

212
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.100
just for that reason to
make it so everybody can

213
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.380
connect their devices and stuff
to it. But no, seriously,

214
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.480
some do. And you'll find
a lot of those on

215
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.760
Kickstarter. That's one of my
favorite places to hang out

216
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.460
lately. But then other other
ones just have that kind

217
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.490
of old school mentality around,
you know, they need to

218
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.970
provide the whole product. And
maybe that's what most consumers

219
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.690
want. I don't know. Well,
Kickstarter, I mean, man, every,

220
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.570
it seems like everything innovative
is coming out of Kickstarter.

221
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.170
Have you seen the pebble
watch? No, I haven't seen

222
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.190
that. Oh, great. Google. Or
is that the, No, go

223
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.130
ahead. No, this is the
wa so this is the

224
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.060
tragedy of too, is that,
you know, they, they come

225
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.190
up with all this amazing
right. ProSoft research stuff. We

226
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.300
even bring products to, to,
to market. And then like,

227
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.970
w it's like the standard
Microsoft thing is one year

228
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.640
after we come out with
an amazing innovative product and

229
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.150
then shut it down. Yeah.
Someone else comes out with

230
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.090
the same thing. Everyone's like,
it's amazing. It's a watch

231
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.230
a smart watch, an internet
connected smartwatch. It's a brilliant

232
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.050
idea. You know, after having
spent the last year crapping

233
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.940
on the smartwatch. Yeah. So
10 years ago or whatever

234
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.380
it was that we first
came out with a spot

235
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.640
watch. Right, Exactly. Yeah. So
the pebble watch is this

236
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.980
watch, and this is what
it's really brilliant. You can

237
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.870
see the get pebble PEBB
ele and it just hit

238
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:43.110
$10 million on Kickstarter. No kidding.
$10 million. That, that, that was

239
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.490
their original goal was a
hundred grand. Let's see. Okay.

240
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.120
They have paper watch. Yes,
there is. What's great. Is

241
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.320
E paper. So it's effectively
a Kindle screen, which means

242
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.520
that it's going to have
a longer battery. Yep. It

243
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.300
hit a million dollars in
28 hours and they're going

244
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.830
to have an SDK for
it. And they're going to

245
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.870
have, like, you can control
music with it and they're

246
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.450
going to have different apps
you can download. They just

247
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.390
have some different ideas, like
rangefinder and run. And of

248
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.330
course, you know, plugging it
into my, my blood sugar.

249
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.710
My pump is gonna be
the first thing I'm gonna

250
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.260
want to do. Oh yeah.
Unclear if I'll be able

251
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.520
to do that, but you
can try. I can try

252
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.760
exactly Right. Yeah. This, I
remember seeing it thinking this

253
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.310
was gorgeous. I, for some
reason, was this the one

254
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.590
that needed an iPhone to
program it was that what

255
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.210
it was? I think so.
Yeah. I think that now

256
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.640
it's going to support Bluetooth
four and then the presumption

257
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.770
is, it will, as long
as it talks Bluetooth, anyone

258
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.590
could do anything, could talk
to it. Okay. Well, that's

259
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.620
very cool. Yeah, totally. I
just think that's a brilliant

260
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:52.020
idea. Yeah. We have this
weird watch of some kind.

261
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.770
I do. I've got the,
the, the TEI watch sitting

262
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.950
in the back in my
closet here, but it was,

263
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.780
they had a lot of
stuff that was kind of

264
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.720
proprietary about the, you know,
use their compilers and the

265
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.600
STK and the kind of
the usual microcontroller things. So

266
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.700
I just haven't had a
chance to do much with

267
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.090
it yet, but I got
it when they were, you

268
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.410
know, it was one of
those things. You, you said

269
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.880
you went to this conference
and you got it. Dirt

270
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.860
cheap. So I did that
and I got it, but

271
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.570
I haven't done anything with
it yet. Right. I think

272
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.470
it was like $19. Right.
It was crazy cheap. Yeah.

273
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.130
And the idea was that
it's an open SDK and

274
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.020
then the TEI wash that
you, that you and I

275
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:34.080
have was really just a,
a prototype in the sense

276
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.850
of like, here's a playground.
What if we, what if

277
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.940
we were coming into the
watch world, what would that

278
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.400
look like? And it was
One of their sort of

279
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.890
dev kits for one of
their processors. I don't remember

280
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.290
if it was the Stelara's
or, or one of their

281
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.030
other processors, but I think
that was sort of the

282
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.370
big, the big thing about
it is like, here's a

283
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.610
cool idea for how you
could use our processor. Right,

284
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.470
Right. Right. The interesting thing
about buying something on Kickstarter

285
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.800
is the, is the kind
of the dream of what

286
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.990
it could be. Yup. Cause
you know, they have a

287
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.810
great really polished video and
they've got a prototype that

288
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.330
they've kind of wrote out
of plastic and they built

289
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.740
up and they're off trying
to figure out how to

290
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.190
build this thing. But it's,
it's unclear if it's going

291
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.590
to be everything that we've
dreamed, but the vision people

292
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.920
have paid into, you know?
Yep. Yeah. I mean, I

293
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.100
have funded a number of
projects on Kickstarter. I think

294
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.410
you have as well. Cause
there's just, I mean, there's

295
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.480
a lot of cool stuff
on there. Not just from

296
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.810
kind of open hardware, which
is definitely very cool, but

297
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.510
even like, there was a
local band that wanted to

298
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.210
get a CD done and
I sent them funding their

299
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.150
way and a kid's monster
alphabet book. I mean, there's

300
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.820
just all kinds of stuff
on there. How, what, what's

301
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:45.010
the average price that you've
been paying? I, it depends

302
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.340
on what the reward is,
but it's usually like 20

303
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.200
ish, you know, for different
things. Interesting. Because the thing

304
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.900
with Kickstarter is that like
I was explaining Kickstarter to

305
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.150
a friend recently and they
were like, well, so are

306
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.060
you investing? I was like,
well, I'm kind of investing.

307
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.730
I mean, I'm investing in
the way that I am.

308
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.910
I am pre-ordering. And in,
in the pre-ordering I am

309
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.850
expressing my confidence that this
is going to be awesome.

310
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.780
Right. Exactly. The way I
use it. Cause my wife

311
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.840
was like, what? You're giving
people money. You're like, you're

312
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.120
acting like a VC here
and you're not getting anything

313
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.070
in return. Right. And I
said, no, no, no. I'm

314
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.780
generally only funding things where
I'm getting something reasonable in

315
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.020
return. So yeah. I'm totally
kind of mercenary about that.

316
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.550
Right. You're you're funding, you're
funding their dream, but it's

317
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.860
not like you're giving them
thousands of dollars. Right. It's

318
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.100
it's not like a VC
or an like, it's funny,

319
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.230
actually a lot of people
have been calling themselves like

320
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.410
angels. Like I noticed like
Tim Ferris is like, I'm

321
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.740
an angel investor. So apparently
if you give someone 25

322
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.980
grand or 50 grand, you
can be an angel now,

323
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.530
which I think is a
lot of money. But I

324
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.850
don't think if I, you
know, I don't think of

325
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.200
someone being an angel investor,
if they're giving someone on

326
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.060
the order of thousands of
dollars, as opposed to giving

327
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.920
them, I don't know, a
couple of hundred grand or

328
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.980
something like that. Right. But
am I an angel investor?

329
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.690
Because I spent a hundred
dollars on a, on a

330
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:17.470
pebble. Yeah. Why not? Yeah.
I'm just looking at like

331
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.750
some of the projects I
funded here and it's like,

332
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.680
like the Atari history book,
right. That remember that idea.

333
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.620
Yeah. I mean this one
has already been funded and

334
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.940
it was, who's working at
Kurt Vendel and Martin Goldberg.

335
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.180
Right. Okay. So that's really
cool book. It's like the

336
00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.970
comprehensive history book of Atari,
something that would not get

337
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.630
printed without this kind of
funding and you know, you're

338
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.820
getting a copy of it.
And then there's a layer

339
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.010
of the clockwork book, which
is a nice book that

340
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.570
has like a foil cover
and hand drawn steam, punk,

341
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.330
illustrations and stuff. So yeah,
there's a lot of cool

342
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.450
stuff on here. I'm looking
at back 20 some odd

343
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.700
projects. Have, have you received
any of these yet? No,

344
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.360
actually. Cause I've only been
backing recently, so I'm looking

345
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.750
here. Oh no. I did
receive the CD from the

346
00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.460
local band, which wasn't bad,
but I haven't received a

347
00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.200
bunch of other stuff yet.
Cause most of these seem

348
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.930
to take, I don't know,
six months from the time

349
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.510
that the, you give them
the money before they actually

350
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.460
get something in production. Yeah.
Or longer even it's it's

351
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.040
interesting. I have done a
lot of Kickstarter stuff, but

352
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.770
I haven't received really anything.
You know what I mean?

353
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.100
Other than emails with updates
of what they're working on.

354
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.560
It's, it's, it's hard to
put together a piece of

355
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.680
hardware or hardware product. Oh
yeah. I mean like the,

356
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.220
the monster alphabet book, which
is, you know, just a

357
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.650
book with a lot of
nice hand, drawn hand, illustrated

358
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.740
alphabet stuff for kids, I'm
hoping my kids don't outgrow

359
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.590
it by the time I
get it. But that like,

360
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.420
I just finally got an
update from them that they've

361
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.340
got their boxes of books
in, are going to start

362
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.410
shipping it out soon. So,
so that could be kind

363
00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:02.090
of cool. The hardware projects
on there, unless you're doing

364
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:07.340
something like really populous, like
yet another iPad holder, which

365
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.980
there are always zillions of
those on there. They, they

366
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:15.470
seem to have difficulty getting
funding. A lot of those,

367
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.390
like some are just playing
cool. But then there are

368
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.760
other things that are really
kind of niche that are,

369
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.240
that are taken a while
to take off like this

370
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.880
there's one here, there's this,
the play surface, which is

371
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.660
basically a surface, right. This
guy has got it on

372
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.260
here and he's offering kits
to build your own surface.

373
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.330
Okay. That's good. Sounds like
a good thing. How much

374
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.180
is that? Well, see the
here's the thing is it's

375
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.800
there, what's it 150. If
you want a PCB two

376
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.080
50, if you want PCB
and electronics and it starts

377
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.750
to get fairly expensive. So
like this is one that

378
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.430
I think is a really
cool idea, but I look

379
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.170
at the cost and think,
well, you know, that's not

380
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.870
kind of in line with
what some of the other

381
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.870
projects go for. I mean,
because I think the things

382
00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:01.130
that are really successful are
the projects where you're getting

383
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.050
your, you're not only funding
these guys, but you're actually

384
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.280
getting a pretty good deal
upfront because you funded them.

385
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.610
Exactly. The ones where it's
like here, you're also going

386
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.830
to fund our R and
D costs tend not to

387
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.870
do so well, even though
you would think that would

388
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.210
be the idea behind it.
Well, that's what I thought

389
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.570
was great about the pebble
was that it was $115,

390
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.690
which is a little expensive
for an electronic watch, but

391
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.780
you know, definitely cheaper than
way. That's awesome. It shows

392
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.910
up in target. Yeah. I
think that is $115. Seems

393
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:37.100
like a reasonable, expensive gadget
price for something like that.

394
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.890
Watch I would say. Yeah,
exactly. And that's kinda what

395
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.650
I'm counting on. Have you
noticed any of these guys

396
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.720
using like Arduino or net,
do we know, are these

397
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.580
different kind of like gadget
assembly kits or are they

398
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.660
doing all this stuff? Yeah.
Some of the kits are

399
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.110
like Arduino and stuff. I've
noticed. I haven't, I did

400
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.840
fund early on, but it
didn't go through one project

401
00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.290
that was a.net micro framework
board. But quite honestly, I

402
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.670
mean, net MF is a
much smaller audience than Arduino

403
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.070
or something is so those
it's really hard for them

404
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.430
to get funding on something
like this, but okay. They

405
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.960
know that or would I
even have to know like,

406
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.520
would the pebble be based
on that? And I would

407
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.030
have, I wouldn't even know
what was inside. It Usually

408
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.070
they'll tell you, like, they'll
say, Hey, you can program

409
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.430
it in X, Y, or
Z. Right. So it kinda

410
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.490
depends. And then there's yeah.
I mean, for the ones

411
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.910
where they aren't telling you,
I don't know. I like

412
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.440
there could, there could be
ones out there, but it

413
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.570
seems unlikely. I mean, most
of the ones where they

414
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.450
aren't telling you what's inside
it, they're usually they just

415
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.370
have a chip and they're
coding it and C right.

416
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.260
Doing it, doing it from
scratch. Yeah. I mean, it

417
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:50.100
seems to be the Haven
for like open source stuff,

418
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.070
not so much software as,
you know, open source hardware

419
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.280
and open, open source designs.
Like that's always a big

420
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.100
selling point. Like they'll, that'll
be part of the title,

421
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.330
you know, open source, whatever,
like open source, CNC, machine

422
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.710
opensource, you know, microcontroller. And
so that's obviously a very

423
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:12.330
important thing there. And also
Inventables has started getting into

424
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.140
this as well, where Inventables
was a site that always

425
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.840
just had kind of interesting
things on there. But now

426
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.450
they're doing a little bit
of a Kickstarter model where

427
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.750
you basically preorder things. And
if the preorders get up

428
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.720
to a certain number, it
starts the factory and they

429
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.070
start making this stuff. What
is Inventables, if you go

430
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.450
to inventables.com, I presume that
I could go to the

431
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.020
website and find out, but
what, Oh yeah. So sorry

432
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.820
that Scott Go to your
browser type in G O

433
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:50.700
O G Dart run. Yeah.
So, but if, if you

434
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.120
go there, so they, Inventables
has lots of really just

435
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.480
kind of unusual pieces of
material and stuff that you

436
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.430
can use to make things
like they'll sell you plastic.

437
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.010
That will keep it shape
after you've put it in

438
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.470
water for a second, right?
Like, you know, just like

439
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.600
sheets of plastic that you
can deform and then heat

440
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.360
up and then they keep
their shape. Or there'll be

441
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.290
like other bits on there,
like, like maker slide type

442
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.900
stuff, which is a, you
know, an aluminum extrusion that

443
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.020
you can put the groove
wheels on and kinda make

444
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.970
linear motion stuff out of
light. So they have a

445
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.850
lot of things like that
and putties and just kind

446
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.930
of really random things that
companies have produced, but are

447
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.550
typically only available in really
large quantities to, you know,

448
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.240
to regular manufacturers. You can
go there, pay more for

449
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.190
it. You know, you're not
buying it in quantity, but

450
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.890
you at least have access
to it. But they have

451
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.440
again started putting together like
real projects and kits. There's

452
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.900
a CNC machine on there.
There's a three D printer.

453
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.460
I think there's a laser,
a laser cutter on there.

454
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.710
And some other stuff where
if the orders get to

455
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.960
a certain number, then they're
able to go and start

456
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.900
the factory as they call
it and preorder the things

457
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.380
and get them to everybody.
So Kind of cool stuff.

458
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.490
I'm glad that you brought
up a three D printers.

459
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.620
Cause I was over at
star Trek, which is a

460
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.610
conference in Ohio a couple
of days ago. And I

461
00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.480
saw my friend bill Steele
who quit Microsoft awhile back.

462
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.290
He kind of retired and
is now working on marketing

463
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:28.150
three D printers. And we
talked very briefly while back

464
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.250
about three D printers and
the concepts behind three D

465
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.560
printers and stuff like that.
But I don't think I

466
00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.310
really got, I don't think
I really got it. And

467
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.660
then I saw it print
stuff. And then yesterday my

468
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:46.030
son's bicycle broke the a,
what do you call it?

469
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:49.600
The peddle fell off. And
I looked at it and

470
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.050
it's like the molded kind
of injected molded plastic pedal

471
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.590
fell apart. And I said
to myself, well, this is

472
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.420
like a, it's like a
$10 bike. It's like a

473
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.840
dude. I was like a
target disposable bicycle, but I

474
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.550
don't want to go on
a throw away this bike

475
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.580
just because this thing broke.
But I'm thinking to myself,

476
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.760
this would be the perfect
scenario for a three D

477
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.030
printer. I could just print
him a new pedal. Yeah,

478
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.060
Yeah. I mean, and then
there's all the, you know,

479
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.700
the action figures that aren't
out there that your kid

480
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.090
wants suddenly you're printing action
figures in the basement and

481
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:27.370
other toys and adapters to
go between Lego and, and

482
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.300
connects and tinker toy and
everything else. So there's, there's

483
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.370
just tons of stuff you
can go do with a

484
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.160
three D printer. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, do you have

485
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.470
one, have you made anything
with three D printers? I

486
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.800
don't have one yet. So
I'm, I kept going back

487
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.610
and forth between buying and
building and they're expensive enough

488
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.170
that I'm like, wow, I
don't know that I want

489
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.020
to spend that kind of
money on buying one, but

490
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.240
then a lot of the
build ones out there, aren't

491
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.460
really what I'm looking for.
So I'm sort of in

492
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.590
that weird limbo space where
I can't make up my

493
00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.620
mind and I really just
need to go and do

494
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.220
something one way or the
other. Yeah. Well, my buddy

495
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.130
says that he he'll sell
them for a, a thousand

496
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.470
dollars is not again, that,
is that a good deal?

497
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.540
Yeah. A thousand dollars is
about right for like the

498
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.540
mid range stuff. I think
rep like rep rap, which

499
00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.490
it looks like from the
picture I saw, he's kind

500
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:23.020
of based on is anywhere
between, you know, 400 and

501
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.180
a thousand dollars, depending upon
how much of the stuff

502
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.200
you make yourself versus buy.
Then the MakerBot, there are

503
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.830
new one that replicator is
like 1700. If it has

504
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.320
one print head in 2000,
if it has two print

505
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.250
heads and then there's Ultimaker,
which is another one, which

506
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:43.500
is really nice and very
fast. And that's like, I

507
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.030
think it's about $1,300, But
then you have this all

508
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.350
sounds like a lot of
money, but I know I

509
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.260
spent a thousand dollars for
my first laser printer. Yeah.

510
00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.840
I mean, it, it really
is a lot of money.

511
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.250
Like it's a lot of
money to part with all

512
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.890
at once, but the utility
of something like that is

513
00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:01.610
just amazing. I think more
than a CNC machine and

514
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.440
more than just about anything
else, I could see that

515
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.140
getting use. And not just
if you have kids, cause

516
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.180
I don't know about you,
but I would definitely be

517
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.770
making tons of stuff for
my kids. I think they

518
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.200
would find it cool. And
I would probably even stick

519
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.030
it upstairs on the table
and let my kids design

520
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:18.110
stuff themselves because it's, it's
just that easy to use

521
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.750
in a lot of cases
here, but there's also just,

522
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.300
you know, little things that
you need, like people make

523
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:27.890
holders for their headphones, you
know, just little like adapters

524
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.930
that you might need that
might cost you hundreds of

525
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.810
dollars to say attach a
camera to a microscope or

526
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.090
something like that. Right. Right.
Well, the idea that I

527
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.190
like so much about it
is that I can ship

528
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.400
something from overseas and pay
Lord knows what for all

529
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.110
the shipping and the gas
and all that kind of

530
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:46.310
stuff. But if I, if
everyone had a, a, a

531
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.960
three D printer, they could
just say, Oh, I need

532
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.520
to come. I'm going to
print a comb. Yeah. I

533
00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.340
could just imagine like, Oh,
like five years from now,

534
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.050
maybe even three years from
now, we all have three

535
00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:01.010
D printers. Right. And this
pedal falls off of my

536
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:06.380
son's bike. I go and,
and scan the broken pedal

537
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.930
with an iPhone app. Maybe
I pointed at the pedal

538
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.320
and it gleans that it's
3d figures it out. Right.

539
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.850
Yup. And then repair it
digitally and then print it

540
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:20.690
out. Or you go to
some, or you go to

541
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.300
like a manufacturer website or
you go to like some,

542
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.440
a place like thingy verse
or something and somebody else

543
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.170
has already designed one and
you just download it and

544
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:35.540
print it. Right. So that's
actually where folks are getting

545
00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.550
a little concerned that the
lawyers are going to start

546
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.530
stepping in because they've kind
of stayed out of it

547
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.540
so far, but you know,
they're not going to stay

548
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.540
out of it forever. Do
you think that you think

549
00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.070
I'll be able to go
to office Depot in five

550
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.380
years, buy a three D
printer or is there too

551
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.950
much calibration and too much
complexity? Well, there are several

552
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.510
out there that are starting
to be very like, like

553
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.980
just plug it in and
it works. So I don't

554
00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.230
know about five years, but
I can definitely see this

555
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.720
happening. Cause they're already online.
You can buy some that

556
00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.210
you just, you bring it
home and that's it. And

557
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.660
then there was there's one
that's specifically meant for kids

558
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.050
where it's completely sealed. It
looks kind of like a

559
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.780
toaster almost, you know, and
it's got a little window

560
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.370
in it. You can see
what's going on, you upload

561
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.100
the design and that's the
end of it. So I

562
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.820
could definitely see this stuff
becoming really mainstream. I mean,

563
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.300
laser printers, certainly weren't mainstream
for a long time and

564
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.570
color printers. Weren't mainstream for
a long time. And this

565
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.870
is far more enabling than
any of those things. Is

566
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.090
it, is this the beginning
of that kind of replicator

567
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.310
from star of star Trek
where it's just like, I

568
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.840
need this. And then you
just said, go ahead and

569
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.820
give it to me. Cause
like right now they're all

570
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.710
kind plastic and they're one
color. And unless you want

571
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.780
to switch the ink out
or the, the ink rather,

572
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.510
but the plastic stuff in
the middle, it's going to

573
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.570
be all one color. But
could you imagine where they'll

574
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.910
figure out mixing and we'll
be able to go and

575
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.830
make like print and action
figure? Yeah. I, I do

576
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.650
think that we're, we're getting
there, like the commercial ones

577
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.840
can do that. Cause they
use sort of like an

578
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.890
inkjet, almost technology that's in
like a powder bed and

579
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.340
they can already do multiple
different colors and, and print

580
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.950
all that stuff. Right. They
also have ones that do

581
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:18.120
printing of metal. And then
I saw something where there

582
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.790
was a three D printer
that not so much 3d,

583
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.130
but at least it can
do two D was putting

584
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.730
down traces on a circuit
board. So you could print

585
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.740
a circuit board, you could
print all the hardware that

586
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.890
goes with it. I'm not
sure how much hand assembly

587
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.650
would be required afterwards, but
it's definitely getting to the

588
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.170
point where you'll be able
to just plug something in

589
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:41.130
and say, you know, I
want some new star Wars

590
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.800
action figure and it prints
it out. But the real

591
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.620
big question for me is
going to be, you know

592
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.680
what ha like what happens
with the companies in this?

593
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.280
Are they going to start
making available as a product,

594
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.620
like a downloadable design? And
there's going to be some

595
00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.690
legislation that says you can
print it once and then

596
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.150
it disappears. Or you're like,
how is that going to

597
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.480
be handled longterm? Right. Right.
Or if you, if I

598
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.670
printed an Oregon, there's no
sales tax. But if I

599
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.840
printed in whatever there is
sales tax, I mean, you

600
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.510
know, whether or not you
can copyright these things and

601
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.670
how much people can share
them and stuff is starting

602
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.700
to become a concern with
different people. And the hope

603
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.350
of course is that it's
going to be open for

604
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.810
a long time. But you
know, think about how the

605
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.200
software industry started way, way
back and kind of most

606
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.140
everything was open for a
while. And then eventually you

607
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.950
started getting, you know, a
lean towards far more proprietary

608
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:36.000
stuff and that made it
much more consumer friendly. Cause

609
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.130
everything was in a box
and you got it, but

610
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.020
you did lose freedom as
part of that. Yeah. I,

611
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.530
I can't, I can't, I
have as much say though,

612
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.060
I can't think of a
time that I've been that

613
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.270
jazzed about something though. I
mean, the idea that I

614
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.940
could print, like replacement parts
was the most attractive aspect

615
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.030
of this, you know what
I mean? Yep. Yep. Because

616
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.720
the boys are always breaking
something and you could, And

617
00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.440
presumably, you know, you can
print a plastic jewelry. There

618
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.940
you go. Right. Or if
you get the ones that

619
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.060
can print metal eventually, then
you could certainly print all

620
00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:11.640
I, you can purchase basically
anything Could, could you like,

621
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.020
isn't there a limit of
size? Like if one of

622
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.240
the boys broken arm and
an action figure, they know

623
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.390
they have like, It's a
good thing. You added on

624
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.010
an action figure for a
second. I thought you were

625
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.620
asking about printing a replacement
arm. No, no. I'm just

626
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.890
thinking like, you know, small
stuff like that has real

627
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.990
detail. So the Neatest MakerBot
will print something that I

628
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.730
believe is about the size
of a loaf of bread.

629
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.570
No, that's pretty big though.
I want to print something

630
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.280
that has a lot of
detail, like the fingers of

631
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.030
an action figure. Yeah. So
The, a lot of the,

632
00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.350
the current printers that basically
melt plastic and extruded out

633
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.630
of a nozzle, they do
have an issue where they're

634
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.420
only going to get so
find a resolution cause it's,

635
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.080
it's building things up with
just layers of plastic. And

636
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.300
when you look at them,
you can actually see the

637
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.210
kind of the stair stepping
on it, but there are

638
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.200
other technologies and there are
some open source projects, as

639
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.100
well as some closed source
projects going on where instead

640
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:13.460
of extruding a plastic, they're
hardening a liquid resin. So

641
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.330
they have a, a, like
a projector, like you would

642
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.900
use to project stuff at
a presentation, right. And they

643
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.740
have this resin that will
harden at certain wavelengths of

644
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.070
light. And so it basically
projects the picture on the

645
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:31.130
top of that, that layer
hardens. And then the whole

646
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.370
thing moves up some tiny
fraction of a millimeter and

647
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.820
then it prints the next,
the next one. And so

648
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.060
the resolution there is roughly
the same as a projector.

649
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.290
So, you know, 1600 by
whatever over say like five

650
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:50.270
inches by five inches. So
those are, you know, if

651
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.020
they might have a very,
very fine texture, but they're

652
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.060
absolutely going to be able
to print fingers and do

653
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.940
all that. That's pretty amazing.
I might be a little

654
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.470
early then if I jump
in now, this will be

655
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.170
like, I'll buy a 300
DPI laser printer. And then

656
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.620
the 600 will come out
like two days later. But

657
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.810
you know how this stuff
is, is always something coming.

658
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.300
And that's, that's part of
the, kind of the paralysis

659
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.430
that I have, or I
would really want one of

660
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:17.180
those liquid resin printers, but
also the liquid resin is

661
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.510
really expensive. And you have
a big VAT of toxic

662
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.680
resin in your house. Whereas
the, the, the extrusion ones

663
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.040
do a pretty decent job,
but they aren't so toxic.

664
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.870
There are some fumes given
off as it melts it,

665
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:34.250
but nothing like the, the
resin process does and they're

666
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.290
getting better every day. And
if you get an open

667
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:40.070
source design, most of those
can be, you know, kind

668
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.080
of hacked and modified over
time to get better and

669
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.470
better. Very cool. It's always
fun to talk to you

670
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.950
about building things, people. Yeah.
I love building stuff. It's

671
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:52.370
kind of my therapy to
account for all the time.

672
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.190
I spent staring at a
screen. Yeah. Making things with

673
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.130
your hands or making physical
things that will exist and

674
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.860
can't be easily deleted is
a nice way to get

675
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.130
over making things that will
be obsolete next week. Yes,

676
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.730
absolutely. Thanks for talking to
me today. Hey, thanks, Scott.

677
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:11.090
Always fun. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

678
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:12.320
we'll see you again next
week.
