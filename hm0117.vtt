this episode, Scott talks internationalization
with developer Michael Kaplan. Hi,

12
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.020
this is Scott Hanselman and
this is another episode of

13
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.940
Hansel minutes. And I'm sitting
here at tech ed with

14
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.330
my friend Michael Kaplan, a
developer in windows international. How's

15
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.980
it going, Michael? Thanks for
sitting down with me. Oh,

16
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.020
pretty good. Glad to do
it now. You don't have

17
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.460
known each other for a
long time. And I think

18
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.040
we ended up meeting because
I commented on your blog

19
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.300
with regards to my interest
in Ethiopian languages, specifically Amharic.

20
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.060
I actually, I think the
first time came up was

21
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.450
that Turkish bug, but the,
the Abigail Actually, what was

22
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.130
interesting about the Turkish book,
cause you know, I'm in

23
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.680
an, I'm interested in internationalization
and you're a full time

24
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.370
developer and internationalization. Why is
the Turkish language so interesting

25
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.710
for Microsoft developers? Unfortunately, it's
most interesting because of the

26
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.520
bug that commonly happens and
that's to do with the

27
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.000
Turkish eye where they have
a dotted uppercase version and

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.120
a dateless lowercase version and
they case it the way

29
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.970
you'd expect where the doubtless
and dotted go together. We

30
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.370
don't do that, but it
means that they expect something

31
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.970
totally different, done it framework
supports it well, but it

32
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.790
means all kinds of apps
get broken all the time

33
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.520
because they case something, they
can't find a character later.

34
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.310
I think that your blogging
right, actually broken at one

35
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.990
at one point because of
that or not the whole

36
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.410
thing, but part of it.
And then you, you track

37
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.270
down the bug, you find
the one line of code

38
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.540
that is responsible for bringing
everything down. Right? Exactly. And

39
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.940
a very good example of
that would be say that

40
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.890
you had an application that
was going to check for

41
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.620
the word fail in a
text box and the user

42
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.740
typed in fail F a
I L all lower case

43
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.410
with a, an I with
a dot on it. And

44
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.620
in your code you said
text box dot two upper.

45
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.720
You would get in Turkish
F a capital I with

46
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.300
a dot on it. L
and then you would check

47
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.030
to see if that equals
fail and it wouldn't right.

48
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.740
Your application would fail. Right.
Makes total sense when you

49
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.800
explained that the Turks have
four eyes. Yes, but it

50
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.670
was very, not intuitive, But
all a wonderful things in

51
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.520
the language about vowel harmony
and the way that, the

52
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.330
way that the words flow
together is lost on everybody.

53
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.470
What people remember is that
darn Turkish. Yeah, exactly. But

54
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.260
that's an example of, you
know, you can't test your

55
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.010
application on every single language.
Exactly. What are the languages

56
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.750
someone should pick when they're
trying to get a good

57
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.660
coverage. That's definitely a good
core language to look at

58
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.200
because that's, that's one of
those main bugs Romanian came

59
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.530
up recently as another one
because of letters that they

60
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.990
wanted added that don't exist
in the code page, but

61
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.420
exist in Unicode. So it's
a good way to test

62
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.630
whether or not they're doing
the right thing using, using

63
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.920
Unicode properly. And actually we
were talking about Ethiopic, which

64
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.070
was another interesting case because
there were, there were three

65
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.280
core languages that were scheduled
to be added to Vista

66
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.560
that I felt really strongly
needed to be because they'd

67
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.590
been Unicode for like five
years and I was sick

68
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.500
of waiting. And it was,
There's an example where there

69
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.200
was a language in the
Unicode spec that you felt

70
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.690
visiting to do the support.
Well, the Microsoft hadn't supported

71
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.560
yet, but they could have,
and it was sin Holly's

72
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.620
Mongolian and Ethiopic and sent
Holly is we sort of

73
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.110
got in. We snuck in
because the government wanted to

74
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.540
help us after tsunami. We,
they needed help actually collecting

75
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.020
names and things so that
we did an XP patch

76
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.080
so they could use Sinhalese.
So we knew that was

77
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.700
going in. Cause we had
a font and everything, and

78
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.310
Mongolian they'd done a bunch
of work on an Ethiopic.

79
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.200
They also did a bunch
of work on. Right. And

80
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.210
when you say Ethiopic, you're
referring to what's called the

81
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.010
<inaudible>, which is the Herrick.
Yes. Deliberate Ethiopic I usually

82
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.810
call it, we don't, I
don't know. We, I don't

83
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.300
usually call it either. My
understanding is Ethiopic is a

84
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.970
compromise thing that was done
in the standard for the

85
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.960
standard itself to come up
with a neutral name for

86
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.020
the script that isn't actually
how even native speakers think

87
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.970
of the script, The native
speakers call it the feed.

88
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.810
L a but there's just
as there's the Latin script,

89
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.000
we call it like when
we write English it's or

90
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.890
French or whatever, there's this
Latin script. Cause that's the

91
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.750
root language Ethiopian Amharic, and
the languages of similar languages

92
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.930
have their Latin, which is
called <inaudible> is the, you

93
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.450
also uses that script. Okay.
So rather than calling it

94
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.180
is or calling it M
hierarchy, you call it Ethiopic

95
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.120
and that's the compromise. Okay.
So the one advantage you

96
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.220
would think of Arabic with
scripted language or the same

97
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.230
people get confused all the
time. So there's an advantage

98
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.240
to having a separate name,
although kind of a made

99
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.220
up name does seem odd.
Well, yeah, but like you're

100
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.010
using, you know, the Indian
language, right. You know, using

101
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.900
the <inaudible> scripts. Exactly. If
someone who knows about Hindi

102
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.180
and <inaudible> and Punjabi and
all these other languages wouldn't

103
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.570
necessary, think of Devanagari as
being it doesn't exactly roll

104
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.620
off the tongue. Very true.
Describes the script. So back

105
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.080
to my original question, what
are some languages that I

106
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.240
would pick do I pick,
I mean, people usually say,

107
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.920
well, you know, English, Spanish,
and maybe, but I, you

108
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.530
know, when I was doing
internationalization, I would go Arabic,

109
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.540
Chinese, and then I would
make a pseudo internationalized language

110
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.590
that had, you know, funky
accents and stuff like that.

111
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.450
Yeah. I, I probably wouldn't.
I mean, German is a

112
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.670
common one people use because
it's a good example of

113
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.210
a language that takes up
between 30 and 50% more

114
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.060
space in the dialogues. So
it's a good way to

115
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.270
check for really, for dialogues
that are too tightly spaced

116
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.510
because you want English to
look good, but you don't

117
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.610
want to make the localizer
work too hard. You don't

118
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.650
want to clip stuff either.
Ah, right. That's a very

119
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.830
interesting thing. You're pointing out
that the length of the

120
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.290
string, the leanest thing will
change will change the way

121
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.660
that your pages will. And,
and the English is fairly

122
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.050
wordy too, but German is,
is just more wordy and

123
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.700
German is also a good
one. Cause it's, it's a

124
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.610
tier one language for many
types of marketing, many types

125
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.100
of markets where people are
producing software. So it's a,

126
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.640
it's a good, typical language
to use, right? Then beyond

127
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.300
that, getting into languages with
other internationalization issues, Turkish is

128
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.180
a great one to use
because of the, the various

129
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.530
Turkish issues that happen with
the Turkish. I, I usually

130
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.390
pick Arabic rather than Hebrew.
I like to do one

131
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.480
right to left. Right. An
Arabic has more issues related

132
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.210
to it because Hebrew is
very simple, other than being

133
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.660
a right to, Because it
doesn't have any ligatures. Exactly.

134
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.590
There's no shaping, what's a
ligature. You're combining two letters

135
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.460
together and producing something. It
doesn't look exactly like they

136
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.880
would separate, Right? Like cursive
script in English. Exactly. In

137
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.100
fact, if you look at
all the unit scrap examples

138
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.320
that are on, that are
in MSDN and the platform

139
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.100
instigate don't even mention Arabic,
they give cursive Latin examples

140
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.830
so that people developers actually
can say, Oh, I know

141
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.870
what that is. Instead of
saying Arabic, I don't know

142
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.340
it. So it's actually a
wonderful, it's exactly what we're

143
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.100
talking about. Right? So Arabic
is a cursive by, by

144
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.370
default Because essentially, I mean,
they're there, their block script

145
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.950
is actually a very cursive
script. It's very flowing. It's,

146
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.020
it's actually a beautiful, not,
not the kind of font

147
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.540
you use every day, but
some of the very, the

148
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.340
fancier fonts look like the
way typographers put in and

149
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.600
it's beautiful, but it, it
certainly you find more problems

150
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.290
with Arabic than you would
with Hebrew because they should

151
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.080
right to left. You have
all those shaping things. I

152
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.100
usually like to pick something
like Thai as well, because

153
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.180
Thai has other issues related
to word breaking. And you

154
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.210
want those things to work
well by defaults. And sometimes

155
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.120
they do, but not all
components do so well. In

156
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.950
fact, one of the main
problems with it and it

157
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.410
framework is there are so
many things that are, I

158
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.010
mean, some controls are fully
spaced out in summer, just

159
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.470
thin wrappers around something else.
So you end up with

160
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.500
support that varies and you
can find that one piglet

161
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.140
girl doesn't work with a
script where another one will,

162
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.990
especially when using third party
ones. And so it's, it's

163
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.720
a good tie, becomes a
good test of whether or

164
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.180
not you can handle, you
described things like, Oh, a

165
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.290
unit scribe is the component
in windows that does of

166
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.650
the work to shape any
script that requires extra work

167
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.370
and extra work, any kind
of extra work, whether it's

168
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.600
right to left or checking
for legal sequences, a ligature

169
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.550
formation. So anything that's not
just putting up straight English,

170
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.630
Latin characters pretty much. Huh.
You know, when I was

171
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.190
doing a internationalization, we were
working in banking. We thought

172
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.550
about the German example. And
we thought about, you know,

173
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.760
more complicated examples. One of
the things, one of the

174
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.910
bugs that we wanted to
catch was pushing UTF eight

175
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.820
code all the way through
the system and back and

176
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.490
making sure that as it
moved from web server to

177
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.550
middle tier, from military to
database and back that we

178
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.890
didn't screw something up, we
didn't go turn into black

179
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.450
squares. So testing the system
all the way through to

180
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.240
make sure that something wasn't
lost, Right. And sometimes people

181
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.120
skip my, the Thai case
because Thai has a code

182
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.800
page and they skipped, they
move right into one of

183
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.270
the Indic languages like Hindi,
because then you can test

184
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.350
if anything ever gets into
a code page and you

185
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.000
are using Hindi, you better
hope they speak fluent question

186
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.740
Mark. Cause that's all you
have left by the time

187
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.600
you're done there, We worked
with the bank of Bangkok.

188
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.870
So we learned that really
quickly. And, and, and so

189
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.660
actually for Thai actually, I've,
I've had clients who we've

190
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.620
actually used Laotian. Basically we
usually ocean because it doesn't

191
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.380
have a code page, whereas
Tai does. And it's another

192
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.330
easy way to test for
which is the question marks,

193
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.190
you know? So let's back
up a little bit to

194
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.560
the, to some of the,
some of the basics because

195
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.110
you know, we're both language
geeks and we're both, you

196
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.040
know, Unicode type geeks. But
I think we understand ASCII.

197
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.480
I think that one of
the, one of the demos

198
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.190
I like to do when
I talk to high school

199
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.620
students is I go out
to the command line, I

200
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.410
type copy con food dot
text type, ABC control Z.

201
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.420
And then I go debug
food dot text and I

202
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.650
go and look at it
and we say, all right,

203
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.800
67, 68, 69. Now here's
the characters. So I think

204
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.620
people understand some of the
fundamentals of why is a

205
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.890
67. I'm not sure. 69.
I can never remember 41

206
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.680
and 68. I think, I
think in hexadecimal now. Oh,

207
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.570
you think in hexadecimal, right?
Because you're a full time

208
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.300
developer on this stuff. Okay.
I think in, in, in

209
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.700
base 10, this is going
to be a huge problem

210
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.610
as 65. Yes. I do
those in my head now,

211
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.240
but that's okay. So go
to fewer parties because of

212
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.190
that. So yeah, That is
a problem. So then I

213
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.070
go to like a Yahoo
China and I'll select a

214
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.380
Chinese character and I'll paste
it in notepad, in the

215
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.160
middle of my ABC. And
I'll save it as, as

216
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.750
Unicode with a byte order,
Mark. And then I'll go

217
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.040
out and I'll show people
the buyer Mark. And this

218
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.580
is like that buyer or
Mark is just so, I

219
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.260
mean, I cannot tell you
how many times I've received

220
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.270
an email where someone said,
and I looked and there

221
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.100
were these funny two characters
at the beginning of my

222
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.190
string and suddenly everything looked
bad. What is a bite

223
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.780
order, Mark? When do I
need it? When do I

224
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.060
not? Why is it sometimes
there? Why is it not

225
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.090
sometimes there? Okay. So the
biter Mark is actually was

226
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.080
put in by Unicode as
a good way to indicate

227
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.780
what the text is. And
if when it's UTF is,

228
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.500
is where the most common
use of it was and

229
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.050
UTF 32, I guess, might
be the second, most common.

230
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.530
The idea of being to
Mark what the text is.

231
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:08.740
And it's interesting because you,
the character is FFF that's

232
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.720
here, it's there. It's also
doubles as a zero with

233
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.450
no break space. And they
decided it was a good

234
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.030
thing to start with because
there's no purpose to having

235
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.980
a zero with no break
space at the beginning of

236
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.720
a text. So if you
see it the very beginning,

237
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.130
then it must be a
bite order Mark. And you

238
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.290
wouldn't see it because you
wouldn't see it anyways because

239
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.930
it's invisible. In fact, it's
amazing many people complain about

240
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.030
the vital order Mark. And
I say, I've never heard

241
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.640
so much complaint about something
that you can't see has

242
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.840
no width yet. You know,
megabytes are written about it.

243
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.200
Certainly you've proven that you
don't, that your system is

244
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.510
not understanding Unicode because if
you ever see the thing

245
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.090
that shows up with a
question Mark and some silly

246
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.540
character, then you're obviously not
displaying your zero with Noah,

247
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.200
you know, zero. I mean,
to this day, most Microsoft

248
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.250
internal developers actually use windows
to do their, their diffing

249
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.400
and it doesn't understand utfh.
So you always see that

250
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.420
byte owner, Mark, anytime they've
saved something as UTF. So

251
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.450
it's a marker, but also
it, it describes It, it

252
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.720
basically, and, and the place
where it's a problem for

253
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.810
people outside of Microsoft, we
sort of led to kind

254
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.250
of our own people criticizing
us. We include the Bider

255
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:22.380
Mark in UTF as well,
where it's not considered necessary,

256
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.290
but consider it an optional
thing because you don't need

257
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.790
to know the order of
the tests. You don't need

258
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.060
to know whether the binder
Display. It's not just a

259
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.470
marker. It was actually describing
order. Exactly. But in UTMA

260
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.570
theater is always the same
it's byte based, but it's

261
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.050
useful in UCF because if
you go into notepad and

262
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.690
you have just ASCII text
and you save it as

263
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.930
utfh in the dialogue, we
can't, we don't have any

264
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.540
metadata to remember that, but
we do have this bite

265
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.250
order Mark to put in,
but if you load it

266
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.560
up again and you didn't
get what you saved, people

267
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.540
would complain. So we said,
well, let's just add the

268
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.590
byte order, Mark. Unfortunately it
seems, and in our biggest

269
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.380
complaints still comes from people
who write unit shell scripts

270
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.620
in notepad, which is a
market that I don't think

271
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.070
anybody ever imagined Windows. We
know that writing a unit

272
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.890
shell script. Exactly. Okay. And
this sounds like the most

273
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.170
farfetched thing in the world,
but I have hundreds of

274
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.140
emails from people explaining how
common this is. So really

275
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.390
I can't even, Cause I
was thinking to myself when

276
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.060
you were describing that or
marks belong in UTF 16

277
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.130
and UTF 32, I was
like, huh, but I see

278
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.380
them in all my utfh.
Yup. And then you said,

279
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.150
well, Microsoft put it there
and I'm thinking, Oh no.

280
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.970
What did Microsoft do now?
Well, I mean, it, it,

281
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.070
but it sounds like it
makes sense. It does make

282
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.660
sense. It's just that it
doesn't make sense from a

283
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.860
standpoint of people who support.
Utfh not for the characters,

284
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.070
but just because it happens
to work. Yeah. And when

285
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.260
you look at something like
a unit shell script, there

286
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.450
are, there's a specific protocol
that you have to start

287
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.820
with and it doesn't include
starting with these other characters.

288
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.550
So it causes them problems.
So people spend Their time

289
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.610
in whatever their native language
is and it just works.

290
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.100
And when things get, when
things go wrong, it's when

291
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.120
they switch over and they
start to localized things. I

292
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.130
actually, I worked with a,
a bank in Israel and

293
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.590
they were not familiar with
internationalization and it seemed to

294
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.530
me, and this was such
an ethnocentric way of me

295
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.630
to think. And I was
like, how can they not

296
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.510
be familiar with international they're
international? Well, of course they're

297
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:19.190
not, they're domestic, you know,
relative to Israel, but they,

298
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.890
it just worked for them.
But when you start inserting

299
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.370
other languages, you make it
a truly globalized multi-lingual system.

300
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.670
And you mix things, particularly
when you're mixing right to

301
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.380
left and left to right
in the same exact text

302
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.190
file. Things started to get
really interesting. That's something we

303
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.730
still do poorly. I think,
I mean, it's interesting Hebrew

304
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.310
itself has some elements that
are left to right. Basically

305
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.580
numbers. And they certainly have
some English texts. And as

306
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.900
a rule, those things work
well, what doesn't work well

307
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.040
is when you actually have
Hebrew texts, you're kind of

308
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.470
inserting in English, like as
an example or vice versa.

309
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.220
We're very poor with that.
Like true. Bi-directional poor. In

310
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.730
what sense, Portland dense, you
can't really ever hope to

311
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.340
copy paste a sample and
have the same, have it

312
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.430
look the same wherever you
paste it, you have to

313
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.940
worry about the machine you're
on effecting the underlying thing.

314
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.920
I mean, there are markers
you can put in that

315
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.040
have, that will strongly decide
stuff that we never add.

316
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.650
Yeah. I've had that happen
before when doing samples where

317
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.370
I'll, I'll grab like an
Arabic headline and I'll successfully

318
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.950
copy it and I'll paste
it into some application. That's

319
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.710
just not the most clever
application. And I'll look at

320
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.480
it. And I don't, I
have, I took Arabic in

321
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.880
college, but I've forgotten at
all, but I know enough

322
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.120
to say that doesn't look
like a word. Yep. And

323
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.160
it's often ends up being
wrong and things have been

324
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.850
flipped around. Yeah. And, and
there's we, I mean, our

325
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.540
story could definitely be better
here. It's a very difficult

326
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.660
problem to solve. Well, I
mean, in practice, it's actually

327
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.330
easy because I, I go
under simple principle. I believe

328
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.040
that a computer program should
be able to work as

329
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.230
well as an eight year
old would be able to

330
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.900
work in eight year olds.
And as I think our

331
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.480
computers are toddling yet, well,
they're, they're not smart enough

332
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.040
to do this yet, but
an eight year old who's

333
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.400
looking at the tax can
tell you what, what order

334
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.760
things should be in. So
when I look at, if

335
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.690
I look at an MQI
system for windows, a multilingual

336
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.940
user interface, and I look
at the list of languages

337
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.710
that are in the native
scripts. And I look at

338
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.900
the fact that in Arabic,
all of the scripts that

339
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.330
have parentheses in them, on
their lists, like you have

340
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:24.760
a Well Arabic Morocco, Arabic,
We have one, one that's

341
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.520
actually on the list like
a Chinese simplified, Chinese traditional,

342
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.480
the Arabic where basically all
the prints, these get flipped.

343
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.030
So they're look wrong. And
I think even an eight

344
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.040
year old looks at that
and knows that it's wrong

345
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.050
and can describe the problem.
And I think anytime the

346
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.390
eight year old can describe
it, the computer should figure

347
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.710
it out. Well, that's the
thing though. I mean, an

348
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.960
eight year old can describe
that, that it feels wrong

349
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.000
or that they're there because
the human brain has such

350
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.820
a great pattern matcher that
you can notice that this

351
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.780
is wrong. Are those kerning,
that bit of kerning is

352
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.880
wrong, right? But in this
case, how do you write

353
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.700
an algorithm to figure that
out In this case? I

354
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.680
mean, the simple rule is
we basically put in, see

355
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.050
the print, the problem is
the parentheses are considered neutral.

356
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.590
So they take whatever surrounding
them. But if in the

357
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.620
case where you have it's
right to left overall, Okay.

358
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.690
So I have a sentence
that's right to left. No,

359
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.660
no, no. That the system
is right to left systems,

360
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.290
but in this case you
happen to have a bit

361
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.510
of Chinese which has left
or right in the middle

362
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.150
of it. Okay. You want
the left or right to

363
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.330
control. You don't want the
Arabic to inter to intervene

364
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.610
on any of the, the
texts in the middle. Okay.

365
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.590
So you want to put
a marker in front of

366
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.070
that neutral character to say,
this is left to right.

367
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.010
And we have those characters.
In fact, if you call

368
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.380
the get date format function,
there's a flag you can

369
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.780
put in that says, insert
those characters. So, okay. We

370
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.610
do that stuff, but we
do not have it automatically.

371
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.950
And it seems like at
the display level, it should

372
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.980
be something to just notice
the context. And, and we're

373
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.380
smart enough to know, to
write the algorithm for this.

374
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.870
Right. It's just that nobody
really wants to jump in

375
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.760
and do it. That's a
difficult thing. I mean, the

376
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.330
idea that, you know, we
work for the 99% case,

377
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.030
but you know, you never
know when someone might be

378
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.210
writing Arabic and wants to
include a Chinese character and

379
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.910
think about all the Cartesian
products of different combinations of

380
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.160
things that someone could potentially
want to do. You know,

381
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.360
someone's doing Tamel and Ethiopian
side by side and it

382
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.300
doesn't work. You know, how
many kinds of obscure bugs

383
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.190
do you get when it's
only two languages that are

384
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.680
combined in some strange way?
Have you seen anything like

385
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.080
that? Well, it's actually what
I like to focus on

386
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.960
specific languages that are kind
of edge cases when you

387
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.880
mix them in. So like
when you do, when you

388
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.970
include Arabic in the mix,
you find a whole class

389
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.110
of bugs because you're putting
Arabic in the world. Whether

390
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.920
you, sometimes I run the
other UI languages. Yeah. This

391
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.470
is interesting actually, before we
get into that in XP,

392
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.030
I remember if I wanted
to go and visit a

393
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.370
Chinese website, I had to
go into the regional settings

394
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.110
under language tools and say,
install East Asian fonts. But

395
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.370
under Vista, to be clear,
everything's just there. Right. Are

396
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:52.130
there so on any machine,
even moms Vista home, they're

397
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.650
all there. She can go
and start typing Chinese immediately.

398
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.100
Yes. But, but she can't
get the UI in Chinese.

399
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.040
Yeah. The UI requires, that's
an extra thing you include.

400
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.920
If you have ultimate, you
can actually install them directly.

401
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.110
If you don't, then you
can upgrade Was definitely a

402
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.350
decision that I didn't agree
with, which not being able

403
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.550
to have a regular Vista
home have, you know, Albanian

404
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.530
that I agree with. But
I agree with that. So

405
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.900
we both agree that all
versions of Vista should be

406
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.600
able to have whatever language
anyone wants to speak. Yes.

407
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.240
Yeah. Well maybe that'll change,
Know things that were interesting

408
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.610
about it because most people
I've talked to, they have

409
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.650
no problem with, I mean,
they're adding a language, they're

410
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.540
totally, they're doing something extra.
They have no problem with

411
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.390
paying a little extra for
that. But that ultimate, it

412
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.030
seems weird to them. Yeah.
Because I want a home

413
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.220
system. I just happen to
have two people in the

414
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.430
family who speak two different
languages. My mom's a different

415
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:40.820
language. So why do I
have to buy ultimate in

416
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.310
order to exactly. So it's
it's and people don't mind

417
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.010
paying extra, but they do
mind Two different things here.

418
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.850
There's having any version of,
of Vista. I could buy

419
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.910
French Vista or English Vista,
and I'm going to get

420
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.730
either the English user interface
or the French user interface

421
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.060
on both of those though.
I can immediately start typing

422
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.470
Chinese or even Ethiopian. So
any Vista has got Ethiopian

423
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.910
out of the box. You
just go in and you

424
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.430
enable it as a language.
I can start typing Ethiopian

425
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.880
and notepad. Yes. But if
I want to have a

426
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.410
Chinese start menu or an
Albanian start menu, then I

427
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.840
have to go and get
this. Is it a movie

428
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.230
Or enterprise or ultimate. And
then you, then you have,

429
00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.390
okay. The term is multi-lingual
user interface in the movie.

430
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.910
So you use this term
movie. Yeah. Well, I use

431
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.240
MyUI, there's a, there's a
weird, I don't know. Maybe

432
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.100
I'm the only movie guy.
No, no, no, no. Movie

433
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.140
is actually what the team
who owns it, calls it

434
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.920
now, but they're second generation.
And that is so there's

435
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.350
a difference between having an
input language in the sense

436
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.900
of being able to input
this and maybe someone's using

437
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.540
an English or a French
Vista and typing Chinese emails

438
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.620
to grandma versus running the
entire user interface in that

439
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.260
particular way. Yes. In fact,
the list of languages that

440
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.190
are fully translated into translate
into is smaller than the

441
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.140
list of ones you can
actually type stuff into. What

442
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.910
are the numbers? 208 locales
in Vista. And I think

443
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.100
it's four, there's over a
hundred. If you include the

444
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.760
partially localized, the, the language
interface packs that are, those

445
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.950
are Okay. So what's the
difference between a language interface

446
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.940
pack and an a M
UI? Well localization, one thing

447
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.360
they know about it, it's
very expensive. It's very, it's

448
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.580
equally expensive to do it
badly as to do it

449
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.630
well. And I've been doing
localization work for years. My

450
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.930
very first job out of
college was to do English,

451
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.650
Japanese, French on windows three,
one. And one of the

452
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.450
things that I found in
my, in working with international

453
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.230
localization rather is no one
will ever agree with the

454
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.920
translation that the guy picked
Well, it's you, you, I

455
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.600
mean, some people will agree,
but you won't, you'll never

456
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.970
get complete a sense for
any of those things. I'll

457
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.560
tell you how many times
people will. We'll we'll spend

458
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.080
all this money, we'll translate
it into Spanish and I'll

459
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.490
show it to somebody and
go, Oh, we don't say

460
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:52.290
that here. And actually Spanish
is a fun, politically charged

461
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.290
case because most of the
localization work happens in the

462
00:22:55.290 --> 00:23:00.140
United States is done from Mexican
companies, which, you know, the

463
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.480
CA the pure Casiano people
in the Spaniards don't like

464
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.750
at all. And they can
tell the difference. I find

465
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.740
traditionally, if you, if you
work with, you know, Quebecois,

466
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.350
French, the people in France
don't like it, but they

467
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.410
can't always distinguish. And so
I think they don't always

468
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.240
know the same way. The
Spanish can definitely help because

469
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.730
there's so many dialect type
differences that you could spot.

470
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.980
All right. Let's just, this
is a great discussion. Let's

471
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.990
take a, just a brief
moment and thank our sponsors

472
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.900
and we'll be right back.
Do you know how to

473
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.930
make the possible out of
the impossible? Well, the dotnet

474
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.780
ninjas at Telerik do they
just released a huge pack

475
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.000
of web controls, all built
on top of ESPN at

476
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.230
Ajax, that'll help you build
impossibly fast and interactive applications

477
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.590
in no time at all.
They've made the impossible possible

478
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.670
in desktop development. If you
think you can't have a

479
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:50.000
carousel component and wind forms,
well, you can. They're windows

480
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.940
form suite features a super
powerful grid, view control, and

481
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.000
32 other crazy desktop components.
That'll give you a dazzling

482
00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:00.140
WPF like features, but in
wind farms, they do the

483
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.540
same thing in reporting solutions
with a new design surface,

484
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.240
like nothing else looks just
like graph paper gives you

485
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.930
advanced page layout capabilities makes
it feel more like a

486
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.930
graphic design software than a
reporting solution. Go check them

487

496
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.850
I C I O dot
U S. So I'm sitting

497
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.030
here talking about internationalization and
localization issues with Michael Kaplan

498
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.330
from windows international. And yeah,
I've definitely found when doing

499
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.960
translation work, that people are
very passionate about the words

500
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.420
that you use. And they're
very frustrated when things don't

501
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.660
either look or feel exactly
right. You pick the wrong

502
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.660
word and you can alienate
an entire group. I understand

503
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.730
that they had to change
the time zone map inside

504
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.350
of what was the deal
with that I haven't been

505
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.980
in. Well, there was a
huge windows, 95 scandal. And

506
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.380
this was when the, the
lines were removed from the

507
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.620
map. And it just became
this amorphous shapes of, of

508
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.360
landmasses that was safer than
trying to draw lines because

509
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.940
not everybody agrees with the
lines, right? People were disagreeing

510
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.770
with the way, the time
zone, because it was outlining

511
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.710
the edge of their country.
Exactly. Which they may have

512
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.230
been. And when it's in
dispute, I mean, you can't,

513
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.150
you can't talk about places
like cashmere and things like

514
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.700
that, and not have somebody
unhappy with the choice you've

515
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.980
made. In fact, one of
the things that's hard about

516
00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:46.270
being Microsoft is they're languages
that we can't support because

517
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.640
of those things directly, really
like what? Well, we can't

518
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.930
do cashmere for example, because,
well, because you can't call

519
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.970
it cashmere, cashmere, cause some
people really feel like they

520
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.130
own it. And you can't
pick one of those places

521
00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.560
because the people who feel
they own it disagree with

522
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.630
each other about which parts
they own. So what do

523
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.630
you call it a, well,
we can't call it anything

524
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.230
because anything we'd call it
would lead to somebody else

525
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.930
being offended and people go
to war over, stuff like

526
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.510
that. And they'd use as
proof that they are the

527
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.700
winner of an argument. So
does this mean that basically

528
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.770
everyone who speaks cashmere and
wants to run windows just

529
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.960
lose, loses out? Well, they
don't lose that. They lose

530
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.700
out on the, they lose
on our being in the

531
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.220
box. I mean, we, we
don't have a font built

532
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.220
in. I see. And get
it. They can get a

533
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.020
font. Oh, wow. I see.
So like, this is interesting

534
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.830
because when I was doing
Ethiopian work, writing menus for

535
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.640
local Ethiopian restaurants, windows didn't
support it. So I would

536
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.180
go find the font because
some Intrepid Ethiopians would go

537
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.350
and build a font from
scratch. Right. And we'd out

538
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.360
a way to like type
it in and people would

539
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.740
write custom IMS input, method
editors. So I assume we

540
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.660
could probably look around on
the web and find if

541
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.310
there's a language that windows
doesn't support, there may be

542
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.330
a font. Yes. And, and
that's the other thing that

543
00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.910
comes interesting. When people talk
about us supporting a language

544
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.820
they're often talking about, they
want everything there. They want

545
00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.980
the locale, they want the
sorting, they want the font,

546
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:07.250
you know, the, the whole
package, we kind of think

547
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.640
the same way where, and,
and this actually gets back

548
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.080
a long way back. But
I was very concerned about

549
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.460
Ethiopic about MRX specifically, because
I really felt strongly we

550
00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.090
needed it in, but there
was some concern because we

551
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.520
kept getting promised the input
method by the vendor we

552
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.620
were working with, that we
were going to have. This

553
00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.020
is a really important note
that you've got your font

554
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.240
and you just called out
your locale. And you're sorting

555
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.520
with the input method editor.
We've got all of these

556
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.610
keyboards that have, you know,
mostly English characters on them.

557
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.740
And you can certainly buy
Japanese keyboards and you can

558
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.310
buy Arabic keyboards, but Ethiopic
Herrick. The fetus has got

559
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.300
something like 236 characters. It's
not an alphabet. It's a

560
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.630
syllabary. And they, they need
a input method that actually

561
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.350
will work. That's intuitive for
them. And we were promised

562
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.000
this, that it would work.
We could do it with

563
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.890
them as they claimed we
could do with ms. Kelsey,

564
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.260
they're going to have it
any day. Obviously the keyboard

565
00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.950
layout creator, which just built
center keyboards. And I, at

566
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.340
the time didn't really know
to differ with them, but

567
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.010
it turns out then the
vendor kind of disappeared. That

568
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.380
was kind of a minor
snafu. We were worried that

569
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.960
we would have to pull
out all of it because

570
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.120
we can't say we support
a locale and not let

571
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.520
you type in it. Right.
And I was morally and,

572
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.600
and technologically in every sense,
opposed to taking it out.

573
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.160
Cause I said, you know,
this is one of those

574
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.780
scripts. That's been there for
a long time. We have

575
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:31.160
no business waiting. So I
pushed really hard on a

576
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.980
different technology, which was being
used because people found that

577
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.710
creating IMS was very complicated.
Okay. So if I wanted

578
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.840
to make Scott language or
cling on, if I want

579
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.760
clean on support and I
want an IME for cling

580
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.950
on, I would have to
go and write a bunch

581
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.870
of code. Right. And, and
that they, I mean, there's

582
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.390
hundreds of interfaces. There are
no good samples. It's very

583
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.920
hard to do. I mean,
people have done it, but

584
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.580
it's incredibly hard. Okay. And
because of that in Vista,

585
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.640
they created a text based
system that would wrap the

586
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.060
hard stuff and you create
a text file with the

587
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.800
core information that's needed. Everything
else would happen automatically. Sounds

588
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.930
cool. So I said, you
know, maybe we could use

589
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.020
this and just build one.
They built something for Amharic.

590
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.390
So we went through and
I, so I worked out

591
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.480
the technological issues, which was
easy because I had another

592
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.180
language. So I didn't have
anything that would be useful

593
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.910
for a native speaker yet,
but I said, okay, so

594
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.440
we can actually do this.
And we're playing with the

595
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.110
settings, what we need. So
we started kind of trolling

596
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.960
around, looking for experts in
the language who would be

597
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.480
able to give us a
big list that amounts to,

598
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.590
if I type this letter
or these letters, this is

599
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.420
what I want. Right. And
this wouldn't just be any

600
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.190
old, random Ethiopian guy on
the street. This would be

601
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.320
someone who knows the language.
Yeah. We want something. We

602
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.660
want a native speaker. We
want, I mean, I've, I've

603
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.190
written keyboards, even for governments
where they're, where they're transcribing

604
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.710
information, the keyboard they would
use is very different than

605
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.390
what a native speaker would
need. So we want people

606
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:51.460
who, just whatever they'd intuitively
inspect we've in the end,

607
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.750
it turned out that what
we did was fairly intuitive

608
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.480
because we've had external people
actually say that it was

609
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.370
very quick for them to
do. Most of the guesses

610
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.370
were what they were expecting.
Right. And one of the

611
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.680
things that's interesting about a
bet Ethiopian is of course

612
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.800
in English, you've got five
vowels, Ethiopia, and you've got

613
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.830
seven and there's this non
vowel. So, and it's a

614
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:15.000
syllabary. And when Ethiopians learned
to say their alphabet, they

615
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.280
don't, they don't sing ABC.
Like we do. They sing

616
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.480
who he ho <inaudible>. And
if it's they go on

617
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.970
this grid and it's the
syllables and they go, you

618
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.100
know, the first column is
law and it is the

619
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.610
Oz example. And then the
second column is the Lu

620
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.820
Ashley and people who speak
Japanese would be familiar with

621
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.640
that kind of stuff. If
you know, Katakana, or then

622
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.920
you would feel comfortable or,
or Hebrew, you would feel

623
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.020
comfortable in it in Ethiopian.
Cause Ethiopian is actually an

624
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.410
Afro Semitic language. And when
they type it, if you

625
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.720
were going to type haha,
you would type H a

626
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.170
but there's actually two Haas.
So you have to know

627
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.300
which one is which Todd
did you mean? Because they

628
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.420
both sound like ha but
the, a, the vowel is

629
00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.030
a different vowel, right. And
it's subtle. So then you

630
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.890
have to pick, and we
only have five hours to

631
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.330
pick from on the keyboards.
You have to pick another

632
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.000
one. So there was a
keyboard that there was a

633
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.840
program that was called GEZ
pro on windows 3.1. And

634
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.050
that was the first custom
input metadata method editor. And

635
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:18.090
it was basically a custom
Ethiopian notepad, only it only

636
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.340
typed Ethiopian. And it only
worked with this one font.

637
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.010
And then you would basically
type your Ethiopian script in

638
00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.770
this editor, which was an
edit all in one editor

639
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.920
IME. And then you would
copy paste your, your, your,

640
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:34.200
your work into, into word
and visual basic three at

641
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.360
the time did not support
any, anything internationalized. So people

642
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.540
would create, but it, interestingly
it did at runtime, but

643
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.660
the designer didn't. So what
would happen is you would

644
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.370
re you would go and
you'd say, I want a

645
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.950
label that says first name,
and you would write it

646
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.410
in, in American goes pro
you put it in the

647
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.080
clipboard, you'd paste it into
designer. It would show up

648
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.530
as black squares, you'd hit
F five and you'd run

649
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.870
visual basic. And then it
would show up and look

650
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.990
correct. And that's, that's still
a way that many Ethiopian

651
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.680
developers work today, which is
very scary, which is really

652
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.590
pretty bad. And, and, but
still some of that's today.

653
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.050
In fact, I was actually
talking to, I'm doing a

654
00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.210
panel later on SQL server.
And I was talking to

655
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.390
my person I'm doing with,
they were asking me why

656
00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:23.430
it was that in the
results pane of, you know,

657
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.890
when they're, when they're running
queries, they were able to

658
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.220
see any language. But in,
in the actual, when they're

659
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.080
typing it, they just see
square boxes. Right. And we,

660
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.300
we kind of went through
and I showed them what

661
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.710
was going on. And it's
just, you know, some metal

662
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.860
controls don't support particular languages
or things. And, but they

663
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.120
were just floored. The, some
things work perfectly and other

664
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.570
things just don't work at
all. Exactly. Exactly. So an

665
00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.450
input method editor, they would
type H and then they

666
00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.520
would get a combo box,
like an autocomplete. It would

667
00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.200
pop down and it would
show them, here are the

668
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.100
things that you might want.
Exactly. And as you're continuing

669
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.650
to type, that list gets
smaller. Okay. So this is

670
00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:59.500
a list of candidates, Basically
the end. And that's literally

671
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.540
what it's called. It's called
the candidate list for IMTS

672
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.320
and basically ha and in
our case, we had basically

673
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.350
an H lowercase, a and
H uppercase, a for the

674
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.660
two different letters that were
there and that that's, you

675
00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.650
know, what, we ended up
choosing the technology itself, doesn't

676
00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:17.260
distinguish them. Right. So basically
it just shows the two

677
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.720
in the same candidate list,
but maybe there were some

678
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.210
other letter that would be
hae or something like that.

679
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.940
So you actually maybe have
more candidates as well. Eventually

680
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.470
you just get down to
one or two and then

681
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.530
you basically choose one and
you're there. The typing is

682
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.090
very fast, although it'd be
faster if we told the

683
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:36.280
difference between those two. And
it's interesting to see more

684
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.970
languages with more mature support
like Japanese, you know, in

685
00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.610
the, you would use an
IME and you could type

686
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.770
like Domar I got don't,
you it's like D O

687
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.320
and then pick a character.
Oh. And it would pick

688
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.350
a character. But for some
people, when the tablet PC

689
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:52.750
came out, it was faster
to just draw it because

690
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.910
they would just draw the
stroke and that would provide

691
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.130
a candidate. So then there
was that tablet, PC based,

692
00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:04.060
Japanese IME, Well, people enjoyed
a lot more. And really

693
00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.120
all it requires is some
work on the actual hindering

694
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.300
recognition side, which is easier
for some languages than others,

695
00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.600
but also requires the effort
and Great about that. And

696
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.730
what's so interesting about it
from a Japanese perspective is

697
00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.870
that stroke order is important,
right? In, in, in the

698
00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:22.120
U S you can draw
a, an a, and it

699
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.790
doesn't matter which, which side
of the AAU pick, or

700
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.430
if you draw the middle
part first, there's no concept

701
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:30.190
of that. But that stroke
order can provide a way

702
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.860
to narrow down your candidates.
Well, and although in English,

703
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.690
I mean, I I've, I
was told, and I certainly

704
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.110
did very poorly in pinion
penmanship going to school because

705
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:40.180
for example, Oh, you're supposed
to start at the top

706
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.840
of the, of the circle,
says, who, okay. Says the

707
00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.600
teacher now I have always,
and to this day, still

708
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.440
start from the right. That's
just what I do. And

709
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:52.300
on the right of the
circle, I have no idea

710
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.910
why it's just what I
do, but I used to

711
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:56.710
get in trouble because you
always end up with, you

712
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.020
see the residual, you see
some little tiny thing. And

713
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.810
so I'd always get marked
off because of my own

714
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.480
that were, And apparently 30
years later, you're still deeply

715
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.640
bitter about this. I'm a
little bitter about it. And

716
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.250
I think that even though
you failed handwriting that you're

717
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:13.780
doing so well and internationalization,
I think is the best

718
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.750
revenge is living well. Exactly.
Well, thanks so much for

719
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.490
sitting down with me today,
Michael. I really appreciate it.
