episode of the startup series,

7
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.570
Scott talks with Alan Mendelevitch
about creating the startup ad.

8
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.480
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman,
and this is another episode

9
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.810
of Hansel minutes. And today
I'm talking to Alan, Mendelevitch

10
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.410
from Lithuania. You're calling me
from Lithuania. You sound very

11
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.270
clear. Yes. I'm calling from
this way and we are

12
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.290
like the fastest internet speed
country in the world. According

13
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.470
to some stats, actually, I
don't have the fastest internet

14
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.590
here, but it's good enough.
I think So I would

15
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.930
think that this is a
small country and that it

16
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.540
would not be the center
of the internet, but you're

17
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.190
having no trouble with bandwidth.
Not really, actually we have,

18
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.940
I think we have our
main uplink to Sweden and

19
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.460
we, as we are a
small country, it's not that

20
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.130
difficult to have fiber optics
everywhere. It's pretty great. That's

21
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.490
congratulations to you and your
country. And I think I

22
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.260
wanted to talk to you
in the context of a,

23
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.980
of startups because you have
a startup and you've done

24
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.670
startups before. And I wanted
to understand some of your

25
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.390
early attempts to make a
startup, as well as what

26
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.700
kind of challenges that you
have to deal with doing

27
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.170
a startup from, from a
small Eastern European country, nothing

28
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.230
against us mania, but it's
not exactly San Francisco. Yeah,

29
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.030
it's definitely not San Francisco
in disregard, but it has

30
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.690
its ups and downs it
because of that too. So

31
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.350
we have like, we have
no pressure as people in

32
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.400
San Francisco to raise a
million million dollars before you

33
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.850
have anything working, we actually
have to do something before

34
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.960
we can even think about
it. So that's good. I

35
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.200
think on the bad side,
actually, if you want to

36
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.650
raise money at you, you
would definitely need to start

37
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.510
thinking about moving somewhere. There
are some venture capitalists over

38
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.050
here, but it's not as,
as, as vibrant as it

39
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.980
is in Silicon Valley. I
guess I've heard, as I

40
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.070
talked to people who do
startups, that they prefer to

41
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.760
have those startups be. Self-funded
like I use get hub

42
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.700
as an example. And these
kinds of like personally bootstrapped

43
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.310
pro you know, companies, don't
you think it's better not

44
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.950
to take money and wouldn't
it be ideal to be

45
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.440
in a small Eastern European
country and run a run

46
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.390
a boutique? I mean, does
everyone need to have a

47
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.130
hundred employees and $2 million in
venture capital? No, no, not

48
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.180
really. I actually a big
fan of not, not going

49
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.710
anywhere big, but sometimes some,
some business ideas, you know,

50
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.430
they are like, you ain't
gotta go big or are

51
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.900
you going over? If you
want to make next Facebook,

52
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.220
you can do it from
your bedroom because that's, they

53
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.340
need some mass of users
to be successful. That that

54
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.800
totally depends on your idea.
And I know people who

55
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.310
are very successful, do we
not raising a cent of

56
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.090
money? Not, not doing any
paid advertising and stuff like

57
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.630
that, but that's not what
you call a startup in

58
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.130
Silicon Valley terms. It's just
a nice, good, small business.

59
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.150
That's providing a great lifestyle
to peoples. Yeah, I guess,

60
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.180
I guess you could call
it a lifestyle, a startup,

61
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.690
or I like to use
the word boutique. Like I've

62
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.510
never understood why someone would
have a perfectly good company

63
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.480
with a couple of people.
Maybe even 10 people. Everyone

64
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.600
is making a nice living
and they're paying their mortgage.

65
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.550
Why would you want to
rush off and try to

66
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.800
make that too big when
you've got a good thing

67
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.200
going, you know? Yeah. Some
people have a rash to

68
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.950
be important, famous, insane region
instead of just reach. So

69
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.970
Do you think that the
cloud and the introduction of

70
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.570
the cloud has democratized for
lack of a better word

71
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.720
has democratized things for people
who live in small in

72
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.960
small countries. I mean, you
could be a giant company

73
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.650
and I would never know,
right? Yeah, Definitely. With basically

74
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.520
we currently my current startup,
a duplex, we run on

75
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.430
Azure and it helped just
in a sense that I

76
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.920
would never be able to
start this thing if I

77
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.460
had to, to, you know,
run servers or something like

78
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.610
this. And that's important for
many people, obviously it's not

79
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.150
necessarily that you have to,
to, to use some, you

80
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.410
know, this cloud services like
Azure and Amazon, but, but

81
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.500
to tell us a lot,
So you have no it

82
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.260
department, right? Is it just
you or are there anyone

83
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.380
else helping you? So right
now I have one employee.

84
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.480
I was, yes, I I've
started it. And I did

85
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.290
it alone for almost a
year. But when, when you

86
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.760
start doing some like business
stuff, you basically have no

87
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.760
time for development and that's
annoying and you start doing

88
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.940
development, but not doing business
side of it. And then

89
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.420
you start doing business side
of it and not moving

90
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.140
the project forward in terms
of features and stuff like

91
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.330
that. So I figured that
I have to have someone

92
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.310
to help me with this
part of things. So the

93
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.270
startup is ad duplex, a
D D U P L

94
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.810
E X, add duplex.com. And
it's an ad exchange network.

95
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.230
That's specific to windows, phone
apps and end games. So

96
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.650
what is it that it
provides? So I w I've

97
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.930
been a developer myself the
whole life, and I've been

98
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.420
developing on Microsoft stack and
the past, I don't know,

99
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.400
maybe 10 years and in,
in the last few years

100
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.580
have been doing WPF and
sort of late development. And

101
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.180
then I was excited about
windows phone and basically immediately

102
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.050
after a windows phone launch,
I started seeing people on

103
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.800
Tuesday were complaining about not
getting any exposure for the

104
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.760
apps and not investing, investing
our time into making these

105
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.090
great apps and games, and
then not getting any traction.

106
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.960
And they thought, well, most
of these apps are ad

107
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.840
supported and they are not
making any money from this

108
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.080
ads anyway. So why not
help each other and to

109
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.010
just use that ad space
to promote each other's apps.

110
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.810
So that's how a duplex
was born. Basically, the idea

111
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.180
is that you create an
ad for your app, place

112
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.370
a line of, to it
and start showing ads for

113
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.790
other apps and they show
your ad singers turn. And

114
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.840
that's how it works. And
how many, how big is

115
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.390
this getting? I mean, again,
you're one person with one

116
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.670
employee, but you're on Azure.
So this could be, this

117
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.400
could get pretty large. I
mean, ultimately, where do you

118
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.050
need to scale? So right
now we have more than

119
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.770
an 800 active apps and
we're serving one and a

120
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.080
half million ad impressions today.
So, you know, in, in,

121
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.620
in ad network terms, it's
not that week, but it's

122
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.720
definitely bigger than something you
can host on shared, shared

123
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.440
hosting, which how it started
actually in five, the first

124
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.260
version of it was hosted
on shared hosting. And I

125
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.500
saw it when I crossed
5,000 impressions a day, I'll

126
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.750
move to Azure. And somehow
I crossed that 5,000 very

127
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.820
quickly and I only moved
to Azure and I had

128
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.240
like 50,000 impressions a day
and we have one to

129
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.830
one and a half million.
And we are writing now

130
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.390
on three instances on Azure,
only this ad serving part,

131
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.580
actually, if we optimize our
code better, we could run

132
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.170
them on less, I guess.
But, but you know how

133
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.410
it, how it is with
projects like with startups, you

134
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.620
need to move forward, not,
not just optimize your court

135
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.150
for your own pleasure and
stuff like that. Did you

136
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.440
think about things like that?
I mean, you're growing and

137
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.330
you've now on three instances,
the cloud, but you say

138
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.510
you could maybe make it
more optimized. Isn't it really

139
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.150
more important how fast you
serve the ads that you

140
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.340
can always, I mean, like
how do you balance things

141
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.620
like that? Like you could
really go in and put

142
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.120
in some caching and do
a lot of work to

143
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.200
optimize your code and, but
what are you getting? So

144
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.910
basically we, we do it
this way when we, when

145
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.000
we want to touch that
part of the code that

146
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.680
is responsible for say serving
ads, we, at the same

147
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.370
time, we improve the quality
of it, the optimize it,

148
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:34.490
but not, not, we almost
never do any work just

149
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.690
to optimize things, because know,
there's always a lot of

150
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.370
things on the, on the,
to do list. And I

151
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.310
can pretend that we have
all the best practices in

152
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.660
place. We just move forward
for now, Do you, when

153
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.480
you ever start up, like
you have, and you have

154
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.210
one employee, but it's, it's
going well. I assume if

155
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.490
you're growing and you're getting
more impressions than you thought

156
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.750
you would, do you ever
just hang out for awhile?

157
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.000
Let's just like, do nothing
all week long, or do

158
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.280
you have like a huge
backlog and like all this

159
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.240
pressure to do more things
with the product? Well, w

160
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.620
when I had no employee,
I actually could hang out

161
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.890
for a week and that
was good and bad thing

162
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.870
because basically I felt no
pressure except for, from, from

163
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.250
the passive backlog at now,
where I feel the peer

164
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.700
pressure to do something that
I can, can just tell

165
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.430
the guy to, okay, let's
drink coffee for a week.

166
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.320
So, and I w I
could easily do that like

167
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.010
three months ago when I
was alone, but not now.

168
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.860
So you're saying that because
you have an employee, he

169
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.660
expects you to give him
things to do so you

170
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.690
have to like That, that
mobilizes you a lot. I

171
00:10:53.690 --> 00:11:01.610
mean, you could be a
self disciplined person, but unfortunately

172
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.780
I'm not that person I
can procrastinate. If I, if

173
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.350
I get a chance, What
were you doing before you

174
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.820
kind of went full time
with this? So I worked

175
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.360
on the WPF Silverlight and
windows phone parts of a

176
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:24.200
project called and charts are
actually very popular charts for

177
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.620
web apps, which were based
on flash. And now they

178
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.970
are JavaScript charts to hedge
smell five charts, and I

179
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:40.070
was doing a.net part of
it. So, and I've started

180
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.900
to add duplex at the
same time. I mean, this

181
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.970
year, while I still was
doing charts, and then Microsoft

182
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.040
did a not very nice
thing to all the WPF

183
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.690
and silver lights control vendors
out there by not saying

184
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:04.960
anything about it in relation
to windows, windows eight, when

185
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.280
it first was announced, announced
first, and basically the sales

186
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.820
of the WPF and silver
light part of, of that

187
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:19.180
business went down pretty rapidly.
So it was actually a

188
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.730
very good thing that I
had at duplex going at

189
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.240
the same time, because it
could have been sad for

190
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.520
me personally. So that gave
you an opportunity to kind

191
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:35.130
of get out. Yeah, basically
not, not, I didn't get

192
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.240
out totally. I still support
through the charts and stuff

193
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.990
like that. But, but, you
know, since it was a

194
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.850
time of uncertainty about what's
going to happen to all,

195
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.610
all these things, we we've
kind of halted all the

196
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:56.510
future development for some time.
Yes. So, So I, I

197
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:02.250
had the chance to concentrate
100% on that duplex. Huh.

198
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.740
And was it a, was
it, is it a big

199
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.900
deal? I mean, I don't
know how it works in

200
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.410
Lithuania, but here not only
is there, like, you know,

201
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.310
there's wives and girlfriends and
kids and all those things

202
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.970
that keep you from quitting,
your job and healthcare, how

203
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.550
does it work where you
are? Are you able to

204
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.380
jump in and do the,
you know, kind of take

205
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.720
the plunge and do this
thing full time? Or is

206
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.110
there a concern that if
this fails, you become homeless?

207
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:34.620
So in reality, I've, I
haven't worked for Forman for

208
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.370
like more than 10 years.
We have our own small

209
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.470
consulting company, which at this
point is basically does nothing

210
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.650
as a company, but is
there a place where, from

211
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.350
where we, each of us
are on their own things.

212
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.120
So I I've, I haven't
got a real salary in

213
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.820
more than 10 years. So
it wasn't that big a

214
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.960
deal to me. But at
the same time, I've always

215
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.200
wanted to do something like
products. But, but I, I

216
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.930
did the consulting work for
all these 10 years because

217
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.710
I needed to make money,
you know, to make more,

218
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:20.460
more and more of a
guaranteed money than something that

219
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.960
I maybe could, could make
on art. So, and I

220
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.280
was always afraid to took
with that part of my

221
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.650
occupation. It was just a
good opportunity at this time

222
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:40.830
that I still had income
from Amtrak and, and started

223
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.060
getting eaten, come from a
duplex. So just work out

224
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.260
good. When, when do you
have to worry about healthcare?

225
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.920
Like here, I hear a
lot of people, the United States

226
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.230
say that they would start
a startup, but they don't

227
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.930
want to cause their healthcare
through their employer is very

228
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:01.090
good. So basically we have
a basic health care for

229
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.830
freedom, not for free, but
it's mandatory. Basically you pay

230
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.750
like 20 to $30, I
guess, a month. And you,

231
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.350
and you can't quit paying
it. So you pay it

232
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.950
anyway. Most of the time
you pay through your employer,

233
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.150
but it's not a big
deal to the basic health

234
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.300
care is not an issue
when you create a job.

235
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:29.500
So to do something better,
I mean, if you are,

236
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.720
if you're, if you are
working for minimum wage and

237
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.120
you have no work, then
maybe it's an issue, but

238
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:39.250
if you're a software developer,
so I guess you can

239
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:44.260
always deal with this without
any higher, bigger problems. I

240
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.870
I've heard stories about Americans,
like really, really having to

241
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.570
think about this, the staff,
when they are quitting their

242
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.470
jobs, but over here, it's
mostly, you have to think

243
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.190
about just making money to
buy food. A lot of

244
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.730
stuff, not about healthcare is
not the biggest part of

245
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:09.010
it. Yeah. I've definitely, I,
I hear a lot over

246
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.040
here, people that now, if
you're, if you're 22 and

247
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.850
healthy and have no dependence,
I can think one would

248
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.680
be less concerned, but you
could still get hit by

249
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.600
a bus and go bankrupt
because of healthcare here in

250
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.610
the, in the U S
but I do hear a

251
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.990
lot of people saying that
they wish they would start

252
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.430
a startup, but there's also
retirement. Like we have 401ks,

253
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:34.390
which is our, our retirement
funds. And you don't really

254
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.850
get a pension unless you
work for the government or

255
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:43.300
a local municipality. Do you,
do you guys think about

256
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.250
things like, well, I can't
have a startup because I

257
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.700
won't be able to retire.
So that's a good question.

258
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:53.290
And since we came out
of Soviet union sometime ago

259
00:16:53.650 --> 00:17:00.010
and all our savings just
disappeared, I guess people are

260
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.570
not expecting much from the,
this type of things and

261
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.170
thinking about, you know, you
have to make money for

262
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.750
your retirement while you are,
while you are, while you

263
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.710
can, I'll go slide, not
talking about everyone. Quite a

264
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.440
lot of people are, are
thinking about these things and

265
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:23.590
are afraid to lose it.
But basically pension is quite

266
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:28.090
small over here and you
wouldn't want to live on

267
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:33.460
it alone anyway, so, Huh.
So you had a pension

268
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.060
kind of out there in
the communist times, but now

269
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.970
that's, that's all gone. Not,
not really a pension with

270
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.670
there were, there were savings
and people, you know, in

271
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.660
Soviet union, their salaries were
a small, but you couldn't

272
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.120
buy anything for, even for
that. Anyway. So PE people

273
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.770
used to save money in
the bank and then basically

274
00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:01.380
we get people were saving
all their lives and they

275
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.350
got after the Soviet union
collapsed something like, you know,

276
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.580
you could buy a very
old car for that money,

277
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:14.900
but nothing more. So now
that you have this startup,

278
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.040
is there anything about being
where you are in, in

279
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.150
Lithuania that is going to
prevent you from becoming a

280
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.270
millionaire, just like kind of
the, the new capitalist dream.

281
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.210
Is there anything about the
municipality or the way that

282
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.820
you guys run things in
your country that prevents you

283
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.770
from getting rich on this
startup? There is one issue

284
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.800
over here that when you
create a company over here,

285
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.440
you basically have to put
money into, you know, started

286
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.020
with some start capital. And
if, for example, you agree

287
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.510
with someone that they will
give you, like, I don't

288
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.710
know, hundred thousand dollars for
like 20% of your company

289
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:02.990
that then, then you will
own 80%. And basically you

290
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.790
have to put in the,
what, what did we, 400,000

291
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.290
into the bank anyway, or
you have all, you have

292
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:17.060
to, you know, have your
business appraised by some legal

293
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.510
entities that it's worse, half
a million, and you would

294
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.900
never get it at other
than that. There is no,

295
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.920
no limitations to what you
can do, I guess. So

296
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.320
I don't, I don't quite
understand that if you're saying,

297
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.910
if you want someone to
give you money, you need

298
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.290
to already have money, Basically
by the law, you can

299
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.820
only establish a company by,
you know, putting in the

300
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.470
money in, in equal proportions,
not in equal Bettina. And

301
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.460
if, if you, if someone
pays, you gives you 100,000

302
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.720
for 20% and you own
the rest of it like

303
00:19:55.070 --> 00:20:00.320
80% and you have to
put money. That's like, you

304
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.920
can't, you can't put a
price on your intellectual property

305
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.220
on, on what you do.
You basically have to put

306
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.580
money into the Real money.
So you're saying that if

307
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.230
someone wants to give me
a hundred grand, I have

308
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:15.200
to have 400 grand to
show that there is value.

309
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.720
So I can't, I can't
say these patents are worth

310
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.400
$10 million. You can go through
official channels and try to

311
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:26.430
prove that these patents are
worth $4 million for four, for

312
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:36.230
$200,000, but that's difficult. I'd
say, yes, You just start

313
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.990
a company. You know, I,
I, I guess you can

314
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.910
start a small company and
then, then take money into

315
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:49.540
that company with less problems.
But for young entrepreneurs, I

316
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.630
think that could be a
big problem to start, because

317
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.790
there are quite a few
people who want to give

318
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:59.440
you money, but because of
this limitation it's becomes tricky.

319
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.750
It almost sounds like making
a small boutique or lifestyle

320
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:08.670
startup or bootstrapping your own
startup is, is the way

321
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.480
to go. Doing big investment
is just not feasible. Yeah,

322
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:19.710
basically that, yeah, that's true.
Interesting. So you do advertising,

323
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.160
but you do it on
windows, phone app, unlimited phone

324
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.330
app marketplace, not, not iPhone
or Android, at least not

325
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.790
yet. And I assume that
you do this cause you

326
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.580
were a Microsoft kind of
developer and you were into

327
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.650
Microsoft technologies and you knew
the space, but it is

328
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.840
the windows phone big in
Lithuania, Basically nonexistent and Lithuania.

329
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.440
It's not officially released, even
though we released, even though

330
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.580
you can buy HTC phones
officially here, and I guess

331
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:55.200
you can buy Samsung phones,
LG, but there is no

332
00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:00.360
marketplace in Lithuania and it's
coming this month on the

333
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.870
consumer side. But on the
developer side, it's still not

334
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:08.130
available and no, no dates
were given when it will

335
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:13.170
become available for developers to
submit apps directly. But, you

336
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.190
know, I was quite shocked
when I heard the news

337
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:23.340
first at mix in 2010,
we were like not allowed

338
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.810
to do apps in any
reasonable way, except for, you

339
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.050
know, through friends in, in,
in the first world country.

340
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:37.830
So establishing a company in
some other country, then, then

341
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:42.090
Microsoft introduced the notion of
a global publishing partners inside

342
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.630
like proxies, who help you
help all these countries that

343
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.920
are not in the official
list to, to post the

344
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.750
apps to the marketplace. And
it's doable now, but it's

345
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.030
still not that not as
good as, as you get

346
00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.390
as when you live in
United States or Germany or UK.

347
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.160
So w I often hear
about other, other folks in

348
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.790
other countries that are angry
because some contest isn't allowed

349
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.460
or so, you know, Microsoft
won't allow them to see

350
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.670
something or download something. Do
you, why do you think

351
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:19.020
that, that they do that?
Like, they're not evil. They're

352
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.370
not, I mean, I don't
think there's any people sitting

353
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.710
around thinking, how are we
going to stick it to

354
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.640
the Lithuanians? Yeah, I guess,
I guess the simple answer

355
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:31.530
is that a huge companies
are around by lawyers, not,

356
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:38.880
not businessmen. And basically, I
guess before Microsoft lawyers sign

357
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.430
off on lithium constitution or
something like that, no one

358
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.900
is allowed to move into
Lithion and market. That's my

359
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:53.950
understanding of things. Have you,
okay, so have you found

360
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.700
by dedicating yourself to the
windows phone that you're, you're

361
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.470
limiting? I mean, why didn't
you jump into the iPhone

362
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.170
marketplace and start doing an
ad thing? Or did you

363
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.150
feel like you went to
the windows phone because there's

364
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.830
no competition? So one thing
is that, as you said,

365
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.310
I was in their developer
community on windows phone, and

366
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.330
I knew how to jumpstart
it and how to bootstrap

367
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.070
it without investing money into,
you know, promotion and marketing.

368
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:23.350
I had no money to
start it. And as I

369
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.880
am not an iPhone developer
and developer basically would mean

370
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.640
that I have to invest
quite a lot of money

371
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:37.360
to just start something there.
And there is more competition,

372
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.510
even though I don't think
there is anything exactly like

373
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:45.610
a duplex on iOS and
Android. The basic reason is

374
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.570
that, that I I'm no
one there in that community.

375
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:53.050
And I don't know how
to start it without, without

376
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.990
a huge investment. And I'm
not ready for that at

377
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:59.950
this moment. I see. So
this was almost like it

378
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:06.040
was less risky Initially. It
was, it wasn't even a

379
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.710
business idea. It was like
a community project. I still

380
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.500
like to think that I'm
not in advertising business, but

381
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.950
in developers, developer tools and
services and something like that.

382
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.640
And to, so it was
built like from windows phone

383
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.800
developers to windows, phone developers,
and now it's more like

384
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.850
a business, but I still
think that we have quite

385
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.460
a lot to do on
windows phone. And the better

386
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.860
path for us to expand
would be to bring those

387
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.640
eight then to other platforms
at this point in time.

388
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.070
So do you think that
this, this technology that you

389
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.520
have, and then this, this,
this group of developers that

390
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.530
are all working on windows
phone that are now using

391
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.260
your product will move kind
of cleanly over to windows

392
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.980
eight? I would think that,
that everything that you've done

393
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.320
would move neatly over there.
If you had the controls

394
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.690
ready for people to start
dropping ads in right away.

395
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:12.490
Yeah. That would be my
cheesier. And that should be

396
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.390
more natural way for us
to expand. And I see

397
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.150
a lot of developers, a
lot of renos fund developers

398
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.530
trying things on windows eight.
And I'm pretty sure that

399
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:27.220
quite a lot of windows,
one developers with little release

400
00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.690
apps on windows eight too.
Have you got any windows

401
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.790
eight offering already or is
that something that you're working

402
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.000
on now? No, we don't
have anything yet. We're just

403
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.180
starting our work in that
direction, but we will definitely

404
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:49.670
something before it's released before
it RTMS. Are there any

405
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.380
issues with, with piracy or
intellectual property theft or things

406
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.870
like that in, in, in
your country or in your

407
00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.940
community? So at this point,
it's basically now, I mean,

408
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.410
I mean, it is everywhere.
You can find computers with

409
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.770
fire to software and stuff
like that. But on a

410
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:13.100
global level, we are pretty
clean. Now I would say,

411
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.540
but like 10 years ago,
15 years ago, it was,

412
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:22.480
you know, open season, no
one ever bought any software,

413
00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:28.400
not stuff like that. It
was always free. And, but

414
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:34.100
now I think we, at
least in businesses, it's, it's

415
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:41.720
not often that you find
pirate software used, but in

416
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.660
early days of the independence
and in Soviet union, and

417
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:50.060
especially you couldn't button by
any software, actually, if you

418
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.370
wanted to use it, you
had to steal it. There

419
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:57.650
was no other way. So
you, you have an unsupported

420
00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.310
eye unfettered windows phone, then
that in a, in a

421
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:05.180
country that doesn't support it
with a larger company that

422
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:11.180
doesn't support you. So as
for windows phone, I don't

423
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.480
know, what's the status of
support on it. We just

424
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.250
can't buy apps. I have
to, at this point, I

425
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.190
mean, in a month, we
will be able to buy

426
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.050
apps when it was announced
that we will, we will

427
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.070
be officially welcomed into windows
phone as, as consumers. But

428
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.450
at this point I have
a Metacam live ID and

429
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.970
I have to buy stuff
from American or UK or

430
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:43.640
whatever marketplace. And, and it's
actually quite difficult to start

431
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.480
buying apps on windows form.
You can just input into

432
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.800
the lithium credit card credentials
and start buying apps because

433
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.810
it won't accept it. So
even though it's a small,

434
00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.730
kind of a small market,
are you finding that it's,

435
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.130
this business is growing for
you? I mean, it's able

436
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:07.460
to support you and one
employee. Yes. Like three, four

437
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.380
months ago we had like
800 ad impressions per app

438
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.770
every day. And now we
have like close to 2000

439
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.220
tied impressions per app on
average. So is your ad

440
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:24.680
impressions per, per application? So
if I, every day, yeah.

441
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.420
Okay. So it looks like
the market is growing and

442
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.400
to, I guess, thanks to
Nakia, we start, we have

443
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:40.400
started seeing, you know, fallen
everywhere and people start showing

444
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.920
their interest in those phones.
And I, I, I'm pretty

445
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.760
sure the market share will
grow. How big, I don't

446
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.920
know, this is a analyst
predictions that will overtake windows,

447
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.510
phones or iPhone, but I
know this is Alan, his

448
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:04.810
predictions, but anyway, I think
we will grow nevertheless to

449
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.170
a reasonable place. I think
it's interesting though, because you

450
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.630
have a perspective though, that
is a little bit more

451
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.190
Okay. Kind of grassroots. I
mean, we can, we can

452
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.640
talk about how many copies
of this software has been

453
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.890
sold or how many licenses
or how many phones have

454
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.320
been shipped or how many
people bought phones. But you're

455
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.660
actually on the back end
watching people with phones all

456
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.290
over the world, launched their
apps and how long they're

457
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.270
sitting in their apps. I
mean, how much information are

458
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.660
you able to keep? You
know, what apps are in

459
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.580
there? You know, who your,
who your client is, you

460
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.800
know, how long they're in
the application because you're serving

461
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.870
the mass. Yeah. So basically
now we serve ads to

462
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:54.120
150,000 users a day unique
users. And we don't collect

463
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.660
much information about them at
this point, because as I

464
00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.630
said, it starts at us
as a side project. And

465
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:04.950
I was very worried that,
well, I will get zillions

466
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:10.140
of records of future records
in the logs and I

467
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.660
couldn't pay for it. But
we are in the process

468
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.130
of releasing an S a
second version of our SDK,

469
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.270
which will let us and
developer see more stats about

470
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.230
the users and the usage.
At this point, we only

471
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.590
know the countries, we know
the number of users, number

472
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:32.970
of impressions, but not much
more. And do you, do

473
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.870
you think that, do you
think that that data is

474
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.970
valuable in itself that you
could be giving that data

475
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.560
to someone? Or is that
just something that you're just

476
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.140
going to kind of say?
No, I don't think so.

477
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:50.190
I think that this data
is mostly valuable to the

478
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.070
developers to see who, who
is using their apps. And

479
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.640
honestly, I don't think about
monetizing the data data itself

480
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:04.560
in some, in any way,
because that's not what is

481
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.740
in our plans to do
in, in any foreseeable future.

482
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:13.110
Do you, do you, do
you give the, the, if

483
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:15.120
I have an app and
I put your ads in

484
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.920
it, do you give me
all this data? So I

485
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.820
could log into my kind
of dashboard. You can log

486
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.670
into your dashboard, you can
see it, you can download

487
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.760
it in CSV and do
whatever you want with it.

488
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.650
Didn't you tell me that
you thought that me selling

489
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.760
my application for a dollar
was a mistake. What I

490
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.700
told you is that not,
not, not, not having a

491
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:46.390
trial is a mistake because
of the way people download

492
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.120
and buy apps on windows
phone. Right? If, if we

493
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.310
take your app, let's say,
if a user comes, finds

494
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.370
your app via my Mark.
So it looks for something

495
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:03.350
like this. So my understanding
is that an average, an

496
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.650
average user would go, the
process would be like this.

497
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.340
He will search. He will
look and download all the

498
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.540
relevant free apps. First, if
you find an app, that's

499
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:20.120
good enough for him, then
it's done. If he doesn't

500
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.610
find an app that free
app, that it's good enough

501
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:26.720
for him, then he will
look at trial. He will

502
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.460
download apps with his trial,
and he looks at them.

503
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.600
And if he finds what
he got an app that

504
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.360
is good enough for him,
he may buy that app

505
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.680
and his done. And only
then if all of this

506
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.520
fails, he will look at
your app. That's my understanding

507
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.880
of the process. How an
average consumer looks at apps

508
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.740
in windows, phone marketplace. I
think that I should just

509
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.180
go to a trial or
do you think I'll make

510
00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.820
more money on ads? On
my, on my application, my

511
00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.090
little screenshot application. Yeah. So
your app is probably not

512
00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.270
the best candidate to be
monetized with ads because it's,

513
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.870
you know, people don't try
on your app. Often. They

514
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.590
just ran it once or
twice to do what they

515
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.940
need. And they're done so
pro for ads, you need

516
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:22.750
something more time consuming. And
with some reuse volume like

517
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.930
games or something for the
apps and something like this

518
00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.980
for your app, you probably,
if you want to monetize

519
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.180
it, you should sell it.
If you're thinking about making

520
00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:38.290
money from it should, but
I guess you would, I

521
00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.390
guess you would make more
money if you make it

522
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:45.940
free and to, you know,
play some button to donate

523
00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:51.640
to your diabetes fund or
something like that, then, then

524
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.520
you would make money selling
it. That's my understanding of

525
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.670
how things work. If you
are a game developer and

526
00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:02.800
you are not an Xbox
live game, basically if it's

527
00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.900
clear that you have to
go out support, that you

528
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.380
should want to make any
money. All of the success

529
00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:12.970
stories in games are from
people who made their money

530
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:16.690
from ads. I haven't heard
a single case of someone

531
00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:19.780
making any reasonable money by
selling games, except for Xbox

532
00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.590
live games for apps. It's
a little bit more tricky,

533
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.960
but because of different kinds
of apps and stuff like

534
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.680
that. But for games, it's
definitely, if you're, if you're

535
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.670
not able to become a
expo slide game, then you

536
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:39.680
should, should go free with
ads. And then Are you,

537
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:42.920
are you, are you able
to tell me kind of

538
00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.310
in closing who or which
application is the most successful?

539
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.800
Is that, or is that
a violation of their privacy?

540
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.410
Like other of your people
are the other guys that

541
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:54.500
you work with who make
apps? Is there one that

542
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.290
would be okay for you
to say, Oh yeah, such

543
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.450
and such. If windows phone
app is doing great with

544
00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:06.110
ads. So our, our mission
is not to, to monetize

545
00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:10.730
apps. We are liking more
help promote apps, but there

546
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:14.060
is quite a lot of
public information. For example, there

547
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.780
is a guy <inaudible>, who
is one of the most

548
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.160
outspoken and probably the most
successful independent windows phone game

549
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.350
developer. He has 15 apps,
not fun, but 15 apps,

550
00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.200
15 games. Yeah. High quality
games. No one knows how

551
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.530
he finds the time to
make them, but he actually

552
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.860
quit his job to do
this full time. And he's

553
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:43.010
posting his revenues openly. And
last year he made $600,000

554
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:51.710
from advertising. Only opened that
data point. The other one

555
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:57.590
is a game called crash
Lander. So the guy who

556
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:02.000
makes it actually works only
like an hour and a

557
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.950
half every morning from 4:00 AM
on it. And because he

558
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.290
has, you know, a family
and the real job and

559
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:15.560
stuff like that, and he
made like $25,000 or something

560
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:21.110
like this from advertising on
it, he only has one

561
00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.140
game. That's great. Well, it
sounds like what you said

562
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.750
that it's growing, it's getting
bigger. So that's kind of,

563
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:29.150
what's the most, the most
interesting data point to me

564
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:33.710
is, is what your trend
line looks like. You know,

565
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:35.780
are people buying these phones
or are we just a

566
00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.960
bunch of developers buying these
phones and then developing for

567
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.320
each other? Yeah, it was
a random joke like half

568
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.510
a year ago. But now
I think I see more

569
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:48.770
people using the phone. My
daughter has a phone and

570
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.760
she goes to school and
lots of kids wanted because

571
00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:58.820
it actually costs now comparable
to cheap Android phones. But

572
00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.810
the transmit you're better than
cheap Android phones and no

573
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:05.510
one gives very key iPhones.
So I think in this

574
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:11.570
sector, we are pretty good.
Well, very cool. Well, thanks

575
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.710
for chatting with me today.
Folks, can folks look at

576
00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:19.730
Allen's product to add duplex.com?
You can follow him on

577
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.500
Twitter and check out his
blog. And I will put

578
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:25.100
all that information up in
the show notes. Thank you

579
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.610
for having me. Of course.
My pleasure. This has been

580
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.610
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

581
00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:31.850
week.
