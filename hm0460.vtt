00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:52.280
<inaudible> From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel
minutes, a weekly discussion with

9
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.110
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

10
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.890
show number four 63. In
this episode of Hansel minutiae.

11
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.650
Scott talks with Richard Campbell. Hi,
This is Scott Hanselman. This

12
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.480
is another episode of Hansel
minutes, and this one is

13
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.060
in fact live well, it's
not live if you got

14
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.920
this as a podcast, but
if you're watching it on

15
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.530
YouTube, it's live and we've
got Richard Campbell. How are you,

16
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.890
sir? I'm well, sir, how
are you? Lovely, lovely. Last

17
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.100
time I talked to you,
it was Hansel minutiae, number

18
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.650
14, as I recall, and
I had just got my

19
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.430
iPhone six plus, and now
what is it now? Six

20
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.300
months later. Yes, something like
that. And, and we were

21
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.800
happily anticipating the watch, right?
Yeah. Actually I heard that

22
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.040
the Apple I watch is
going to have glucose sensor

23
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.410
support out of the box.
What I really think that

24
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.320
means, in my opinion, this
is my analysis is that

25
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.040
Dexcom, the people that made
the continuous glucose meter, that

26
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.970
myself and many other type
one diabetics use basically made

27
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.710
a deal with them. And
they're going to hook up

28
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.360
the Dexcom share, which is
kind of the commercial version

29
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.810
of the open source project
that I am involved with

30
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.670
called Nightscout. And this is
the thing that lets you

31
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.040
take your blood sugar data
and put it out onto

32
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.310
the cloud. Since their product
today works with an iPhone,

33
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.790
it makes perfect sense for
them to spend going spend

34
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.080
an hour and a half
and write the code to

35
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.940
put it on a watch
face. I don't have really

36
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.650
high hopes for it, but
it makes a nice press

37
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.060
release. We'll see. Well, in
this instrumentation of the body

38
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.130
thing, I mean, you've been
doing it for years cause

39
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.120
it keeps you alive. But
for everybody else just, you

40
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.520
know, I've got my Fitbit
and things. It's only going

41
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.390
to get more interesting, right?
I'm on the Kickstarter for

42
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.110
a thing called scan Dow,
which is the like a

43
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.180
tri-quarter I was just going
to say, is that the

44
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.270
universal tri-quarter? Well, I don't
know about universal, but it's

45
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.120
a tri-quarter it's a little
handheld gizmo. You put it

46
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.130
up to your head. It
takes all kinds of readings.

47
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.440
I'm on the FDA. Try
forward. I hope that there's

48
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.560
a tricorder, like a remote
tri-quarter app that lets me

49
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.590
get to all the sensors
on my band. I've got

50
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.450
my Microsoft band and I
know it's got a bunch

51
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.910
of information that I can't
see yet. I have a

52
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.370
feeling like this is a
thing where they threw a

53
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.160
bunch of sensors into the
hardware and they just haven't

54
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.840
given me access to all
of them yet. So it'd

55
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.730
be interesting to see, This
is my frustration with Microsoft

56
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.960
research projects. Whether you look
at the old surface, now

57
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.010
they call the pixel sense
and the connect, the band

58
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.440
and presumably hollow lens, they
build an amazing product. It's

59
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.560
comes with a set of
apps and nobody can program

60
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.190
against it. Yeah. Well I
do know a guy over

61
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.080
there and he gave me
a tour and I talked

62
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.850
to them and I kind
of made the comment that,

63
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.800
you know, there's kind of
a gap between like whenever

64
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.260
the SDK comes out, which
will probably have a high

65
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.910
bar things that you can
do and the, you know,

66
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.430
what's, the tinker are going
to do, right. What's the

67
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.830
pebble watch person. I just
want to know the moisture

68
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.600
of these plants that I'm
trying to do. You know,

69
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.170
that's internet of things is
my, my begonias, right? Show

70
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.150
me, show me that on
my band. Hopefully they will,

71
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.770
they will hear us and
they will make us something

72
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.540
like that. Well, and I'm
worried the gap's bigger than

73
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.740
that. It's like you're either
rocket scientists see programmers and

74
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.340
you write drivers for fun
or you can't develop against

75
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.090
this. I think though, not
just Microsoft, but speaking in

76
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.970
general that everyone's got a
cloud IDE now, you know,

77
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.740
and if I can, if
I can write a little

78
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.690
bit of Jason and do
a JS fiddle and I

79
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.400
could put that on my
band, that would be cool.

80
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.950
Yeah. That's what you want.
Yeah. I just want to

81
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.230
ask you To it so
I can do a mashup,

82
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.050
right? It's an old term,
but it's more prevalent now

83
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.870
than ever. Indeed. There is
a, I think it's called

84
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.990
cloud pebble basically. You know,
the pebble is a really

85
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.850
low level, like, and there's
like Arduino and then like

86
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.640
pebble, but you can go
and I think it's called

87
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.460
cloud pebble and you can
basically, you know, drag around

88
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.950
and design your own watch
face and it will compile

89
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.930
to see and give you
the zip file and say,

90
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.060
here you go. So it's
a C code generator. And

91
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.370
that's what I'd like to
see for, for small devices.

92
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.170
And I actually got to
punch it devices funny that

93
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.500
we're talking about devices. I'll
try to describe it for

94
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.210
folks that are of course
listening to this. But I

95
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.680
got my raspberry pie too.
Yeah. Yeah. I ordered it

96
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.340
at one Oh four in
the morning because this is

97
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.230
the thing. Everyone's like a
bunch of people were mad

98
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.760
at me cause I got
this in the mail yesterday

99
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.830
or day before yesterday. And
they said, I ordered my

100
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.990
raspberry pie two on launch
day. And I said, yes,

101
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.350
but I ordered it English
time. Cause it was announced

102
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.290
10:00 AM in England. So I
ordered it five minutes after

103
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.600
they announced it and it
showed up and then I

104
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.360
three D printed a case
around it. Oh no, it's

105
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.510
kinda cool. Yeah. It's kind
of a cage type of

106
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.820
a case and it's pressure
fit, which is quite nice.

107
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.850
And let me just tell
you, it is faster. Like

108
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.220
I don't think I'd make
it my daily driver, but

109
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.370
if I were, I don't
know, in some resource constrained

110
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.040
environment, if I were maybe
overseas somewhere or in a,

111
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.620
and this is all I
had, I put notice the

112
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.760
back here I put on
a USB keyboard, USB mouse,

113
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.550
and I put in a
tiny, tiny little $11 wifi

114
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.720
adapter and max love little
thing there. And a little

115
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.430
edit max is a great,
great, I got to see

116
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.920
bought a pile of them.
I bought like three. Nice.

117
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.560
I could use this as
a reasonable PC. You know

118
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.300
what I mean? I don't
think you could do Gmail

119
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.330
on this thing. Yeah. It's
just a web, a web

120
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.740
surfer. Facebook, Twitter. That's enough.
It's certainly not as good

121
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.930
as like some of these
a hundred dollar Intel PCs

122
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.630
that they're, that they're selling,
but for 35 bucks and

123
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.970
yeah, it's hard to argue.
It's a pretty amazing, I'm

124
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.610
pretty happy with it. Oh,
and then I got this,

125
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.650
this is another thing I
got the, you know, radio

126
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.030
shack is going out of
business. So they going out

127
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.450
of business in Canada. Oh
yeah. So sad. I just

128
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.430
saw who's the daily show
guys just spun off on

129
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.450
his own shows. John Oliver. Yeah.
John Oliver's commercial for radio

130
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.910
show. Yeah, that was pretty
awesome. She checked that out.

131
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.210
Not say for work, but
definitely for work though. So

132
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.650
they work when I have
a business and they had

133
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.020
60, 70, 80% off stuff.
So I went over there

134
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.520
and bought a bunch of
crap that I don't need

135
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.750
like this, like this Arduino
shield, check this out. Oh,

136
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.140
touch, touch, screen, touch, screen
shield. And I got a

137
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.860
little paint program here for
the kids. So we've got,

138
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.770
you know, something I would
never have bought at $50,

139
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.840
but totally bought at 12.
You know, that makes sense.

140
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.570
And then I got a
little adapter here for my

141
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.840
nine volt. So Is it
actually a good deal at

142
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.330
12 or the fact that
it was 50 is now

143
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.610
12. That was one second.
That's a three 20 by

144
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.950
two 40. I could play
doom on this thing. Now

145
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.480
that's a touchscreen shield. You
know what I mean? Don't

146
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.440
don't disrespect my purchase. Richard Campbell.
Yeah. I love your do

147
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.690
measurements. That's great. If I
can play doom on it,

148
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.220
it should be, you know,
you buy it. If there's

149
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.170
a Kickstarter and I can
play doom on it, then

150
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.590
I will, I will make
that purchase. So yes. Curious

151
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.530
about the psychology of a
decision making like that. Yeah.

152
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.710
Well there's also the amount
of money that I'm allowed

153
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.580
to spend without my wife
complaining. Yeah, We have dollars

154
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.650
is below the threshold and
50 is above Is a

155
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.350
psychological barrier at $50. That's
why I make sure all

156
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.410
my purchases is 49 95.
There you go. But when

157
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.650
it comes to gadgets, you
know what I mean? Another

158
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.480
gadget, my friend is loaning
me right now as a

159
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.020
software control radio. Do you
know what these things, you

160
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.990
can basically snatch cell phone
metadata out of the air,

161
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.770
right? You can look at
UHF and VHF. Really, really

162
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.900
cool. So I got that
in the pile and then

163
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.340
I got my three D
printer over here. So I'm

164
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.530
having all sorts of fun.
So which three D printed

165
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.160
would you go with? I
bought a, a printer bought

166
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.450
simple metal and you know,
I feel like this is

167
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.060
a printer that doesn't get
the respect. I got this

168
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.870
magazine recently here, the maker
make magazine. This is one

169
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.020
of those really, really nice
$10 magazines that I wouldn't

170
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.380
never spend. $10. Big, heavy.
Yeah. You want to leave

171
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.450
it on your coffee table?
I would have to show

172
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.000
people that I'm a maker
because that's how pretentious you

173
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.310
spend 10 bucks on magazines.
But I would never do

174
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.900
that because I got it
at radio shack for like

175
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.340
$3. So I'm looking through
this thing and they have

176
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.410
the three D printer annual
guide, the shoot, the shoe,

177
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.260
they call it the shooter,
you know, the shootouts shootouts.

178
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.220
Right. And I'm looking through
the thing here and I

179
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.250
don't feel, I I'm let
me, let me put it

180
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.010
this way. I'm staring at
it a Gog. I am

181
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:18.900
gobsmacked number one, Ultimaker price
as tested 2,500 United States dollars.

182
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:25.530
Wow. Okay. Next page Taz
for crisis tested 2200 United States

183
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:32.340
dollars, right? Printer bought simple
metal, 599 bucks. Basically the

184
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.000
second highest score I'm going
through this page after page,

185
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.280
after page of $2,000 printers,
couple of thousand dollar ones,

186
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.230
the simple metal just crushed
them, but it doesn't kind

187
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.000
of get the respect. Like
no one seems to like

188
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.810
80% of the price. It's
nothing. It's like I went

189
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.520
and gave a presentation at
my kid's school about three

190
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.230
D printing. And they were
like, wow, that's really expensive.

191
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.000
I don't know if I
can justify that. And I

192
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.130
said, does anyone here have
a weed? And they all

193
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.930
raise their hands. And I
say, do you have four

194
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.670
or five games? They all
raise their hands. And I

195
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.110
said, well, you just spent
the money. You could have

196
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.840
bought a three D printer
for, right. Like, I mean,

197
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.280
I realize it's a tinkerers
game, but seriously, if you

198
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.470
want one and you have
an Xbox, I mean, we'll

199
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.500
make the choice. Simple metal
is really impressive. I'm actually

200
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.110
going to have the, we
have a big, exciting thing

201
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.140
going on with my podcast.
This is the first time

202
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.940
I've mentioned this, by the
way, this is an announcement

203
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.610
and a cooperative crossover with
the code newbies podcast that

204
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.700
I've been involved with. We're
going to do March makers

205
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.880
month, basically marches for makers.
And we're going to have

206
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.210
an all month long. I'll
be doing all hardware and

207
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.390
all makers and Soran from
code newbies will be doing

208
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.640
the same thing. So you'll
have 10 great podcasts are

209
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.840
so all about making. And
I've got a Brooke dumb,

210
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.220
the CEO of printer bot
totally unrelated. Like, wow, they

211
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.050
don't, I don't have a
relationship with them. I just

212
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.140
bought the thing, but he's
coming on the show and

213
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.790
he's really cool guy. He
actually has a TV show

214
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.880
now called all American makers.
And he's the, he's the

215
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.010
maker behind printer bot. So
I'm going to have him

216
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.590
come on the show. That's
awesome. It is, it is

217
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.760
exciting. It feels like three
D printers are, are emerging.

218
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.670
Now that this is the
dot matrix printer of its

219
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.910
day or the inkjet printer
of his day. If in

220
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.090
the context of, if you
remember the Epson FX 80

221
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.610
for the two of us
that are old enough to

222
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.610
remember that where you're like,
does this printer that I'm

223
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:31.250
buying support bold. And then
it's to support more than

224
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.580
one font where we support
three fonts, you know, and

225
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.320
then you have to go
into the back of the

226
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.630
printer manual and figure out
what the control code to

227
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.290
enable bold is. Right? And
then write that code in

228
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:46.550
your paperclip application or whatever
you're using, you know, WordStar

229
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.560
and tell it about it.
That's the level we're pretty

230
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.050
print three degrees Pretty much.
I mean, there's some interesting

231
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.880
experiments going on. I've been
looking at some of the

232
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.680
resin printers where they're using
lasers to harden resin, the

233
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.400
carbon fiber bending printer, where
they're combining plastic and Carver

234
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.880
five together. So you can,
the best is your step

235
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.860
ahead is you're making wood
where it's really strong in

236
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.190
one axis, but not so
strong in another, like we're

237
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.820
in an interesting phase now
that the Corp thing, the

238
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.230
PLA abs printers are, you
know, under a thousand dollars

239
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.240
and the new materials are
starting to come into play

240
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.670
And they are extremely competent.
I did a blog post

241
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.050
recently at the, at the
behest of Brandon Potter who works

242
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.950
at a three D printing
shop has a $20,000 printer.

243
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.160
Wow. Print it out, a
coffee cup and then FedEx

244
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.740
it to me. And then
I printed out the same

245
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.070
coffee cup. And basically the
tests are, you can't tell

246
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.150
them apart. Wow. Yeah, you
cannot tell them apart $600

247
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.760
printer and $20,000 printer. Now
this is a coffee cup

248
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.540
and it's a stupid, a
stupid one off anecdote. Certainly

249
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.520
if we were doing like
one of those, you know,

250
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.520
print and engine all in
one piece and then dissolve,

251
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.610
put SoLuRs solvent around it
and dissolve it and make

252
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.520
it run. There are things
that I cannot print because

253
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.600
I don't have dissolvable supports
sometimes different materials. It's a

254
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.150
different material. But at the
same time though, man, I'm

255
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.510
printing some really competent stuff.
I'm willing to very, very

256
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.820
happy with my printer. I've
been putting together notes for

257
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.120
an additive manufacturing show, a
geek out episode for Don

258
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.370
and rocks. And one of
the things that we got

259
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.520
a chance to see was
at space X. There are

260
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.630
parts of the Falcon nine
that are made with additive

261
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.680
manufacturing. They use a laser
centering machine to they, we

262
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.870
held one of these parts.
It looks like a solid

263
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.200
piece of aluminum, a really
light. And then you turn

264
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.120
it at a certain angle
and you can see right

265
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.020
through it. It's as very
fine mesh to make it

266
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.350
really light, but still strong.
And so it's basically transparent

267
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.800
in one direction. Centering is
this kind of weird thing

268
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.060
to make a mass of
something by getting it super

269
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.910
hot and maybe pushing on
it a little bit, but

270
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:01.140
not to the point where
it's melted, right? You're assembling

271
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.040
something from smaller pieces, but
you haven't quite melted it.

272
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.460
Not fully molten, right? It's
sort of in between the,

273
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.540
the, the space X facility,
they have this friction stir

274
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.800
welding, where you, again, you
don't actually melt the metal

275
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.620
because it's, it's aluminum, lithium.
And if you melt it

276
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.580
it'll come apart. Right. You
just humiliate the metal Warming

277
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.290
up enough that it gets
Cuddy with itself. So do

278
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.510
you have these things? I
know you have a lot

279
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.220
of gadgets and stuff. Do
you have any three D

280
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.400
printing equipment? I have resisted
owning a three D printer

281
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.880
because I would use it
the least I am a

282
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.450
house full of crafty people.
Right. I, my wife's in

283
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.870
the CAD business, both my
daughters make stuff all the

284
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.630
time and they don't want
it. So I feel like

285
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.380
it wouldn't get used enough.
So I haven't pulled trigger

286
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.480
yet. I haven't found the
machine that I'm like, no,

287
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.560
I have to have that
anyway. Yeah. Yeah. That is

288
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.450
the fear. And that is
why I went with what

289
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.140
I thought was the cheapest
and most sturdy printer I

290
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.360
could find out there because
if I didn't use it,

291
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.970
like how shameful would it
be? Yeah, no, it's one

292
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.680
thing to have a 500
old things sitting, or you're

293
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.980
not using versus a $5,000
thing is sitting there not

294
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.650
using. Yeah. Well, I could
never justify something like that,

295
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.590
but I am, I am
extremely happy with it. I

296
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.000
would, I would have to
say though that, even though

297
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.690
it was $600, I probably
printed about six different things

298
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.060
to get it to work.
Right. This is the thing

299
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.490
I talked about in my
blog, posts that three D

300
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.220
printer people only print stuff
that makes their three D

301
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:35.650
printer better. Well, I'm impressed
with the case you made

302
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.280
for the raspberry pie too.
Like there you made something.

303
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.590
It was actually a solution.
Yeah. Well, I like another

304
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.910
solution I gave on my
Instagram is we got this,

305
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.720
this Dyson portable vacuum. Right,
right. And between the old

306
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.120
original dice and portable vacuum
and the new one, there's

307
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.340
some cost cutting. And it
doesn't come with the cool

308
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.890
bracket that you Mount on
the wall anymore. Someone at

309
00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.000
Dyson decided no cool bracket.
So I printed my own

310
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.220
seriously. I'm telling you, and
it snaps right in. It's

311
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.240
fricking brilliant. So is it
durable enough? It has been

312
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.270
used full time in the
garage every single day. We,

313
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.340
you know, we can eat
dinner and then we vacuum

314
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.040
up after the little boys
every day. So yeah. I

315
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.670
mean, it's been durable so
far. I like to say,

316
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.830
if it breaks, you make
another, you make another one.

317
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.480
Exactly. I like to say
to my wife that the

318
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.510
worst case scenario with the,
with the three D printers

319
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.960
that will, we'll make it
up in costs by printing

320
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.390
out all of the little
backs for remote controls that

321
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.930
hold the battery door. Right.
So yeah, that alone, that

322
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.720
alone will make up the
five minute. Exactly. Yeah. That

323
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.010
are duct tape Surprising. I'm
on a tape use in

324
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.090
three D printing the blue,
the blue tape. Seriously. It's

325
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.330
Blueprinters tape like painter's tape.
Yeah. That's the thing that

326
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.220
you put on the, on
the bed and that's, that's

327
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.050
actually costing me more than
anything so far. I've gone

328
00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:01.240
through two rolls of that
crap. Yeah. It's funny all

329
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.900
the little details that actually
using the thing. And it

330
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.040
really does remind me of
being jet printers in the

331
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.790
beginning and it absolutely all
of the little fussing you

332
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.130
had to do to keep
it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you

333
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.600
still have to do some
of that. Fussing, you know,

334
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.740
I've got a $40 office
Depot absent printer and it

335
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.110
still wants the heads of
line somewhere, but they've got

336
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.570
it down to a nice
clean in a scenario where

337
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.550
you print out a pattern
and you say, yeah, number

338
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.260
three, looks good. Number four
looks good. And then you

339
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.200
tell it. And now you're
aligned. I spent probably three

340
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.800
days fighting with this printer,
getting it aligned in that

341
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.300
The three dimensional alignment. It's
a little trickier. It's a

342
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.460
lot of holding two wrenches
together and eyeballing stuff. It

343
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.490
was extremely frustrating. I will
have to say, I love

344
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:46.870
it. Yeah. It's fun stuff.
So what else is going

345
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.170
on in the gadget world
and in the online world

346
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.490
of, of hardware? So I
got new monitors. I, you

347
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.740
know, I do a hardware
refresh in the fall winter

348
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.800
time when I have a
few days sort of replace

349
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.400
the machines. It had been
three years, so workstations 2011

350
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.650
get updated, that kind of
thing. And it was finally

351
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.170
time to change out some
of the monitors. And I

352
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.560
have some of the very
first LCDs ever made view

353
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.070
Sonics, like old school. And
the wife was using a

354
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:20.670
pair of 19 inch, 1280
by 10 24, four by

355
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.180
threes. And so got her
up to some 1920s and

356
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.210
I replaced my secondary screen.
The one that I'm on

357
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:33.780
right now with a new
Dell 25, 60 by 1440.

358
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.720
So is that a four
K screen? No, the four

359
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.150
K is 38 40 by
2160. So this is still

360
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.900
it's just below what used
to be the DVI D

361
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.780
the 25 60 by 1600.
This is the lower res

362
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.670
of that, but the quality
of the screen has ruined

363
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.460
me. It's so nice to
look at. So the next

364
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.910
machine over to the left
here is my great triple

365
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.240
rig. I built it in
2006, around the 30 inch

366
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.520
panel by Apple, which is
a 20 by 16 by

367
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.360
1600. And then I hung
two 20 inch, 1600 by

368
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.870
12 hundreds in portrait mode
on each side. So 49,

369
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.720
60 by 1600. And I
came to appreciate that the

370
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.410
1600 highs really important. Cause
it's the lines of code

371
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.460
you can read and it's
big and it's been great

372
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.460
for eight years. And then
I got this screen and

373
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.340
now every time I turned
back to it, it's just

374
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.570
not that bright. It's the
whiteness of the whites. Not

375
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.090
as Chris, just not as
nice. Have you tried to

376
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.780
correct the mall? I I
have, but it admittedly it

377
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.110
is eight years old. This
monitor does know me, anything,

378
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.760
you know, it's, it's got
a lot of miles on

379
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.030
it. The fact that it's
eight years old and it's

380
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.850
still a good monitor. Yeah.
Yeah. And so you don't

381
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.560
want to throw it out.
I don't know what to

382
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.290
do with it. It's beautiful.
It's got my, my microphone

383
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.130
Armanda to it. Like it's
part of this room, but

384
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.620
it's, it's a little stale.
And so I was thinking

385
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.280
I'll just replace the panels
because I can buy 25,

386
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.220
six 30 by 1600 displays.
They're a lot cheaper now

387
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.880
and their IPS and all
the new LCD features that

388
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.780
make it awesome. But I
can't get 1600 by 1200

389
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.810
panels anymore. They're four by
three and they're just, they're

390
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.340
out of stock. They'll never
be again. Hey, this is

You know, this RK that

398
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.670
I've got back here, this
is the simulator back here

399
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.720
that has, I pulled out
the giant 20, 23 inch

400
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.380
CRT and put in the
largest. I think it's a

401
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.860
22 inch Dell four by
three square LCD. And it's

402
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.160
the last one I could
find. And they're gone one

403
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.440
day, I'm going to have
to replace that. And the

404
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.180
only thing I can think
of is putting in a

405
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.000
16 by nine and just
covering up the left and

406
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.630
the right, and basically lying
because that's what you're gonna

407
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.190
have to do. There's nothing
you can do about it.

408
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.320
You know, this, this monitor
right here to my left

409
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.110
is a four by three
cause and it's a nine

410
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.330
year old monitor. But, but
this is other thing about

411
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.250
hardware in general, like someone
was asking me when I

412
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.590
was going to build the
next great computer. Cause every

413
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.290
three or four years, I
build one. Why do I

414
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.320
need to, I am running
a very competent machine from

415
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.950
2007. I added a new
video card and I added

416
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:44.190
an SSD. Yup. SSDs, breathe
new life into machines. It's

417
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.400
transformative. When you get an
SSD, What else am I

418
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.910
going to possibly do? Right.
So I've been looking for

419
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.810
the next monitor, something worthy
eight years later to replace

420
00:21:54.810 --> 00:22:00.270
the giant rig. Have you
seen this? LG, the 34

421
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:07.080
inch 21 by nine curved
display. I was at Costco

422
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.090
recently and I saw the
curb display and I just

423
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.070
don't get it. Why do
I need a curved display?

424
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.120
Cause it's so wide that
out on the edges, if

425
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.150
it was flat, it's sort
of going away from you.

426
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.470
They always show all these
happy people sitting around watching

427
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.750
the super bowl, you know,
and they're so happy that

428
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.330
they have a curved display.
And I just don't know.

429
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.740
I don't have that many
people that are there. I'm

430
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.020
looking at it for a
TV. I'm looking at it

431
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.780
for a monitor. So, I
mean the whole point is

432
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.710
it's one screen and it's
38, 40 by 14. And

433
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.840
how long is a 30
inch monitor? Cause I'm looking

434
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.350
at a 30 right now.
It's a 34. It a

435
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.820
bigger it's very wide. I
do kind of have that

436
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.850
hexagon thing going there. That's
what I have in mind.

437
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.570
Triple two. Right. So I
think as a T V

438
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:59.070
it's questionable, but as a
model, I don't know. I

439
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.610
would have to see the
whole curve display thing. One

440
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.360
of my most popular Instagram.
I don't know if it's

441
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.650
called tweet, Instagram pictures ever,
almost like 400 likes now

442
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.040
was a simple picture of
Damien Edwards set up his,

443
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.070
his computer set up. And
what he's got is, you

444
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.900
know, the standard three monitor
thing, you know, kind of

445
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.750
the 20th. And then he's
got a, like a 27

446
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:27.870
inch, 10 80 P touchscreen
angled below his front monitor

447
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.630
as if it's almost like
a keyboard of its own.

448
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:35.310
It's very star Trek. That
low angle screen. He loves

449
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.390
it. Yeah, everyone does this
whole like, you know, turn

450
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.090
left and right. Look at
your three monitors. But by

451
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.340
having a monitor in between
his main screen and his

452
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.720
keyboard that is also touch,
he thinks it's the greatest

453
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.910
thing ever. And it's like
a $600. It's a $600

454
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.910
monitor. It's got a crappy
screen, but it gives you

455
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.090
touch on the desktop. And
it's totally revolutionized. He says

456
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.200
how he works. Interesting. You
know, who set up like

457
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.100
that is the Microsoft studios.
I did that open source

458
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.240
series a few months ago
and all of the virtual

459
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.170
Academy. Yeah, the virtual Academy
stuff. Where behind that desk,

460
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.520
you have one of these
loading screens. I have my

461
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.500
notes and stuff on it,
which was great. And it's

462
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.660
not right in front of
you, but it's in the

463
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.260
right place that you could
sort of maintain it, but

464
00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.110
still be out of frame.
That is the exact monitor

465
00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.790
type that he has, the
one that you shot at

466
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.560
Microsoft. And if you, if
you people who are listening,

467
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.820
if you go up and
search for asp.net, jumpstart or

468
00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.280
MVA, the Microsoft virtual Academy,
they get lots of free

469
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.070
classes and stuff. And you
can see us using those,

470
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.970
those flat screen, touch, touch
screens. You know, the thing

471
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.760
is though, I've got a
nice setup and unless it

472
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.850
breaks, I can't justify it.
You know, it's going to

473
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.620
touch it. I was watching
TV with the wife a

474
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.790
couple of days ago and
I was looking at the

475
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.670
screen. I was looking for
something to be wrong. You

476
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.270
know what I mean? I
think the blacks aren't quite

477
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.340
black right there, or you
know what? It might be

478
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.400
a broken pixel time to
buy a new TV. And

479
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.140
my wife was like, no,
I think this CV is

480
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.550
just fine. It's a sharp
Aqua that we bought eight

481
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:14.530
and a half years ago
and it won't die. I

482
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.290
can't, I can't get rid
of this high definition television.

483
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.110
Isn't that the word? I
can't find a four K

484
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.840
screen on what I want.
Well, I can't find a

485
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.340
Fort. I can't find a
four K screen that I

486
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.840
want to do anything with
like, what am I going

487
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.080
to watch? Like you can
only get minimal Netflix because

488
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.050
people think that 4k is
the new three 3d. It's

489
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.880
the new thing that will
remake us all Russian by

490
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.400
new TVs. But they're doing
it in such a way

491
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.850
that they're making weird deals
with the Netflix's of the

492
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.480
world. Everyone's filming in 4k,
but they're not giving us

493
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.460
the continent 4k. So if
I want to watch house

494
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.090
of cards, I got to
get sharp with the embedded

495
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.030
Netflix client. I'm like, alright,
then I'm not doing it.

496
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:57.250
Speaking of embedded clients in
your television, have you heard

497
00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.640
about this incident with Sam
Samsung recently? No. What happened?

498
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.920
So the it, the past
week folks watching movies off

499
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.370
their local hard drives, the
first stories came from people

500
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:15.130
watching plaques. They had ads
for Pepsi off their hands.

501
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.810
Okay. Hang on a second.
They injected an ad before

502
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.930
like a pre roll. When
I played my local content

503
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.090
Or end of the movie
movie stops. Yeah. And it

504
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.330
wasn't Plex. It showed up
on some other apps as

505
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.600
well and eventually figured it
out. It was the Sams

506
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.060
Two. Wait a second. You
were saying that the DND

507
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.740
LA server stops the stream
and injects and add. Yeah.

508
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.950
Wow. That is, He's got
all these smart TVs with

509
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:49.130
all these players and they're
plugged into the network. And

510
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:53.240
so they're getting updates. Apparently
it was a mistake. Somebody

511
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.640
ran a test app and
it got out into the

512
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.580
wild. I'm looking here at
Reddit right now and people

513
00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.490
are freaking out. It says,
Plex stops halfway through and

514
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.910
plays a Pepsi ad. Right?
Turns out you can turn

515
00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.150
it off by going into
the smart hub privacy policy.

516
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.050
And you can go to
your Samsung remote. You go

517
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:16.460
to the Samsung smart hub
terms and policy Yahoo privacy

518
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.440
policy. And when you turn
it off, then the ads

519
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.480
go away. That is Oh,
offensive. That is a mistake.

520
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.630
And this mistake on Samsung's
part. And I, wow. I

521
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:30.770
bet it was an accident.
No, somebody, when you see

522
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.260
an accident like this, you're
like, no, somebody wrote that.

523
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.500
You know, I wrote that,
but they didn't mean to

524
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.410
put it out in the
wild, Not cool. I don't

525
00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.210
like that kind of stuff.
That's and this is the

526
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.050
other thing. I don't want
a smart TV. I want

527
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.450
a big monitor. You know
what I mean? Yeah. I've

528
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.930
got an Amazon Firestick and
I've got an Xbox one

529
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.640
pretty much handled. I've got
more crap that can play

530
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.420
Netflix. Then I have screens
to play Netflix on. Yes.

531
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.190
Yeah. From my Roku three,
I do not need my

532
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:08.660
TV plugged into the internet.
Yeah, absolutely. I don't need

533
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.780
all of these things to
play Netflix and I sure

534
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.210
as heck don't want to
replay a smart hub. No,

535
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.770
I don't want a smart
TV. I want a dumb

536
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.860
TV. Yeah, Because the TV's
never going to be a

537
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.370
hub. It's not a hub.
It's an end point. Exactly.

538
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.720
If it is an end
point, I want to throw

539
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.300
stuff to it, which is
another nightmare. So check this

540
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.140
out. I, I had some
friends over and they said,

541
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.940
Oh, we just got back
from a, which you get

542
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.220
back. I got back from
Tanzania and she wants to

543
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.830
show her pictures of Tanzania.
So let's solve this problem

544
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:40.730
for me. Richard Campbell. This should
be trivial. Friend comes in,

545
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.670
has an iPhone. I'll I
will tell you ahead of

546
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.440
time. I didn't know this
at the time, but an

547
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.990
iPhone four. Oh, she's in
your home. You need to

548
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.320
get what's on her iPhone
onto your screen. How do

549
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.270
you solve that problem? See,
I'm not an iPhone place.

550
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.700
Think about it in a
more generic sense. Right. So

551
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.200
do you put her on
your network or do you

552
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.200
have a guest network? So
there's problem number one, right?

553
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.930
Right. Do you try to
use Bluetooth or some non

554
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:13.100
wifi technology? The sort of
Miracast technology, whether it be

555
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.980
attached directly to the screen
and just start showing stuff.

556
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.740
Right. So ideally yeah, exactly.
Mirror cast and an ad

557
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.170
hoc network. I didn't have
that. So I also didn't

558
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.910
have a guest network cause
I don't have guests at

559
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.910
all, but I put her
on my network. So questionable

560
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.250
decision who knows she's on
my network. So now she's

561
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.740
on my network. I don't
have an Apple TV though.

562
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.740
She could have used airplay.
But apparently though this is

563
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.210
an iPhone four, which doesn't
support airplane mirroring. So even

564
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.160
if I did have that,
I couldn't do that. I

565
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.510
have a raspberry PI that
supports airplay, but again, iPhone

566
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:48.130
four, I have a Chromecast,
but the Chrome cast app

567
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.830
doesn't support doing this. Right.
So, so, you know, you're

568
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.930
sitting there like, and then
also remember that these are,

569
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.830
these are nontechnical guests, right?
So what's, what's the half

570
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.990
life on a nontechnical guest,
putting up with the techie

571
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.240
to get the pictures on
the, on the screen, you

572
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.690
know, one drink. Yeah. It's
basically wandering. So about four

573
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.400
minutes into it. And my
wife starts giving me the

574
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.500
side eye and she's like,
you're not as technical as

575
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.080
you think you are Hanselman.
Isn't that the word? You

576
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.870
know what I mean? And
it's like, how, how organized

577
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.270
do you think, how technical
do you think I am

578
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.520
like, well, no, I'm very
technical. You know? Like people

579
00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.390
know me for yeah. For
being, being technical. I just

580
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.600
don't know exactly what I'm
doing right now. But like,

581
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.300
you know, you're trying to
explain this to, I was

582
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.650
like, well, no one could
do this. No one is

583
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.760
technical enough to have done
this themselves. So you've already

584
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.490
done it. I mean, I've,
I've actually described myself as

585
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.540
I'm a race car mechanic.
I don't have an oil

586
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.630
filter for your old Chevy.
Sorry. Yeah. So what I

587
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.660
ended up doing was I
downloaded an application called photo

588
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.080
cast. Okay. On the fly.
And of course I'm having

589
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.540
to ask my guests to
type and install an app

590
00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.610
on their phone. Just give
me your password for your

591
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:03.870
iTunes. So getting full, got
photo cast and threw it

592
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.720
up there. But this was
just a perfect example of

593
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.940
between Bluetooth and NFC and
wifi and guest networks. This

594
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.490
is like an ecosystem problem.
I just want to take

595
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:18.300
that and throw it up
there. The problem is everybody

596
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.140
thinks they have that salt.
Microsoft's got Miracast, can't get

597
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.990
Miracast to work reliably with
my fire, my fire TV.

598
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.950
Amazon's got mirror cast, but
it's Amazon flavored. Miracast of

599
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.030
course iPhone's got airplay. It's
a miracle. I got this

600
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.800
thing to work. And it
was a third party app

601
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.410
that pulled it off and
pushed it into my, and

602
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.030
then, you know what I
ended up doing when it,

603
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.250
when it got, when it
finally became unreliable, I just

604
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.730
copied the files upon Plex.
This is the thing, you

605
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.250
know what I mean? Yeah.
In the end, the phone's

606
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.880
just a big USB key
and you dumped it. Someone

607
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.650
said that they were excited
that we were doing the

608
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.530
show, but they, they thought
they said, can you do

609
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:56.970
it again? I didn't know.
Are you live? Or are

610
00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.970
you recorded? So I said,
well, we, we are we're

611
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:04.410
it's recorded in that. We
are recording right now, but

612
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.020
we are still alive. And
then they were like, Oh,

613
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.990
I figured it was recorded
because otherwise this live stream

614
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:16.590
looks too nice Where the
technology is working. So well.

615
00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.410
Yes, It's working so well
that, that I'm on vacation

616
00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.620
somewhere in Cabo. And this
is, this is recorded. Nope.

617
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.960
This is live. Of course
it's not live. If you

618
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.760
know, it's not live. The
thing is with these, these

619
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.610
kinds of things, you can
actually go and back up

620
00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.410
in time, right. Without YouTube
live. And you can look

621
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.700
at this beforehand. It's good
stuff. I think that the

622
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.380
live thing works very well.
I'm going to say you're

623
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.280
you're, you're, you're very crisp
right now. You're very HD.

624
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.390
Yeah. The camera's great. The
pair of Hunter megabit, hell

625
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.690
connections. Help. So Yeah. And
then of course we're recording

626
00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.210
with really nice. I've got
a, my zoom H four.

627
00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.040
And what do you have
for your mic over there?

628
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.920
This is an 80, 20,
20, and partially should do

629
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.050
a traveler three, but it's
all pro audio gear. It's

630
00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.730
no reason to own this.
And you know, unless you

631
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.670
make several hundred podcasts a
year, But you know, the

632
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.680
zoom that I bought my
age four or my, my

633
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.070
H six rather than, yeah,
That is a fantastic device.

634
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.740
Really. I need to do
a podcast about this. This

635
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.840
is just about the best
little machine I've ever I've

636
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.710
ever had. Oh, well my
chair Campbell, sir. You know

637
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.420
what? I just remembered. Check
this out, hang on a

638
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.460
second. Entertain the people while
I step away for a

639
00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:27.280
moment. Imagine you're a host
of someone else's show, Sorry.

640
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.550
I'm back. Look at this.
My friend, this is called

641
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.970
an I rig. What, what
is that? Is that a

642
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.820
preamp look at that. It's
a preamp that does XLR

643
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.050
to your iPhone and to
your iPhone. It's powered by

644
00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.140
a nine volt battery. And
so it will be Phantom.

645
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.620
It does Phantom power for
up to eight hours. I

646
00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.850
sound like Casey Kasem rest
his soul. Casey. Casey, is

647
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.790
he big in Canada? Well,
he's kind of dead, but

648
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.360
yeah, the voice of shaggy
and Robin. No, it's not

649
00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.490
that he was the voice
of shaggy. Casey Casen was

650
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.940
the, a top 40 Casey's
top 40. Yeah, he's a

651
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.410
radio guy, but he was
also livable shaggy To number

652
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:13.780
nine. I'm counting down the
hits. This. I just felt

653
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.720
like I was sounding like
the Iris is a portable

654
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.230
preamp for your iPhone. It's
I got this. Where do

655
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.140
I get it? I guess
this is a callback radio

656
00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.320
shack. Oh, I would never
pay 12 bucks. I would

657
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.600
never pay $50 for this
thing, but if you can

658
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.490
find an Irish, if you
can find an eye rig

659
00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:32.800
for 20 bucks or so,
lets you plug in any

660
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.040
microphone, any XLR mic into
your iPhone and you could

661
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.100
do kind of on the
fly one shot one channel

662
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.650
recording just for what you
doing. Six is not that

663
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:45.940
small, but it's four preempt
channels. Valid point. My point

664
00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.910
being that if I've got
my, my microphone in my

665
00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:52.360
bag, I can throw this
in there. The IRS, or

666
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.330
I can have my zoom
either way I'm prepared. It

667
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:56.830
just depends on how much
time you have to get

668
00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.770
your show ready. Sure. And
I really recommend this kind

669
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.110
of stuff. It's very inexpensive.
Whether it be the zoom

670
00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.240
for $300 or the I
rig for less than 40,

671
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.810
it makes the difference to
do a, a YouTube channel

672
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:11.020
or a podcast with just
a little bit better. Yeah.

673
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.950
Nicer mic set. Right? Although
let's face it. We're both

674
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.460
amateurs. It's Lawrence in the
back office is that makes

675
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.330
us sound great. Yeah, It
absolutely is Lawrence Lawrence, Ryan, our

676
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.730
editor who is going to
make basically all of the

677
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.920
dumb things we said go
away. And this 30 minute

678
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.920
show will become five minute.
There you go. So be

679
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.410
much left, Always a joy
to talk to you. Richard Campbell.

680
00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.870
Thank you so much. And
for those who don't know,

681
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:36.940
I mean, this is the
conversation we were having while

682
00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.660
you were in the car
before We record, well, this

683
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.310
is a thing. So what
will happen is I'll be

684
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.560
driving around, picking my kids
up or whatever, and I'll

685
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.970
go, you know, I miss
my friend, Richard Campbell, and then

686
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.920
I will call you and
on the phone, this is

687
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.960
true story. I will call
you and I'll go, what

688
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.050
country are you in? Richard?
They could be anywhere, could

689
00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.820
be anywhere. And he'd be
like Istanbul. And I say,

690
00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.380
all right, I'll call you
later. And that's, you know,

691
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.810
the end of conversation. Or
it's like, Oh, I'm in

692
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:04.800
Canada. Home of Canadians where
I live. And they'll say,

693
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.860
Richard, let's do a show
because I so enjoy talking

694
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.690
to you. We used to
do, we used to have

695
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.940
these conversations and not record
them, which is the tragedy

696
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.660
and the conversations go exactly
like this, except for the

697
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:21.000
part and the advertisements. Yes.
Thank you so much for

698
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.380
doing this stream and the
video stream. Yes. I very

699
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.740
much appreciate you. This is
Hansel minutia 15 and also

700
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.920
Hansel minutes. So thanks again.
And now I'm going to

701
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.130
do my radio voice ready
for this. Ready? This has

702
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.500
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

703
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:45.290
next week. <inaudible>.
