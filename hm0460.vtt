from hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,

8
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.730
a weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.020
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 60. In this

10
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.220
episode, Scott talks with engine
works, founder, Carl Smith, about where

11
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.280
he thinks web design and
development are heading in 2015.

12
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.510
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

13
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.260
Hansel minutes, and I'm talking
with Carl Smith, web designer Xtrordinair

14
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.200
and advisor to engine works.
How are you? I'm good,

15
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.690
Scott, how are you doing
I'm okay. And I am

16
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.870
excited to talk to you
because you are always have

17
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.910
some really neat ideas about
web design and where it's

18
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.400
going, whether it be the
business model or the style

19
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.720
or whatever. And since, since
we're closing 2014 or depending

20
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.690
on when I publish the
show open, welcome to 2015.

21
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.900
I figured we'd talk about
web design in 2015. Where

22
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.360
do you think it's going?
Oh, that sounds, that sounds

23
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.460
great to me. I tell
you what 2014 was a

24
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.760
crazy year in the web
design space. If you had

25
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.320
a shop, there was a
good chance you had a

26
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.650
layoff or your best year
ever. And I did a

27
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.380
lot of research on that
talk to almost 140 owners

28
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.770
and still can't figure out
what the hell happened. So

29
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.230
why such extremes? Like I,
I did see a lot

30
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.390
of people saying that, like
this was the year of

31
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.740
templatization and then web design
was, was a under respected

32
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.090
and Oh, I don't need
a web designer. I'll just

33
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.850
pay 10 bucks and I'll
bootstrap it. Well, and here's

34
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.820
the best part. The best
templates were built by those

35
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.610
web design shops who are
now being defeated by the

36
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.200
templates they put out there.
Cause they had a slow

37
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.910
week. Ouch. Yeah. So personally
I think the templates have

38
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.380
a place in the industry.
There are a lot of

39
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.130
shops that can't afford a
$30,000 website. They might not

40
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.020
be custom. It might not
be perfect, but at least

41
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.600
gets them a better start
and it gets them responsive

42
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.370
where they wouldn't be otherwise.
So it at least helps

43
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.140
us get to a web
that, that seems to work

44
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.800
better. The thing that I
found out talking through with

45
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.220
a lot of the owners,
the biggest difference between shops

46
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.280
that were successful and shops
that struggled was if they

47
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.340
had a specialty or if
they were a generalist and

48
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.940
the generalist shops seem screwed.
And I'll tell you, my

49
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.790
company that I started engine
works. We had a layoff.

50
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.740
I mean, it was, it
was one of those things.

51
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.670
You've got a lot of
big companies That are building

52
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.310
in house teams now, and
they don't really see the

53
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.470
value in a generalist, but
if you're a specialist and

54
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.540
that could be that you
focus on an industry like

55
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.530
healthcare, or you have a
certain technology like Django, or

56
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.920
you might have a certain
discipline like UX, they still

57
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.530
see value in those people.
But in the generalist shop

58
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.120
space, you seem to be
losing. Do you think that

59
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.980
the RA, what I, what
I call the rise of

60
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.070
the front end developer means
that there are, I wouldn't

61
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.590
say too many, but an
awful lot of people who

62
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.910
know HTML, CSS and JavaScript
like this is it's almost,

63
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.610
I mean, this is, I'm
not trying to disrespect those

64
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.370
people. So bear with me
here, but like I blinked

65
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.920
and everyone is going in
and learning front end web

66
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.520
development, maybe because server side
where development's harder or less

67
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.820
accessible or you can't just
open a notepad and type

68
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.520
node, you know what I
mean? So we're really front

69
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.430
end heavy right now. Yeah,
no, we totally are. The

70
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.310
other thing that the journalists
deal with is front end

71
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.100
designers can put up a
website real quick and look

72
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.440
just as good as a
shop. That's 15 years old

73
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.920
and they can put whatever
price point they want there.

74
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.410
Especially if you're a solo
flyer. Now, what I've seen

75
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.480
on the dev shops is
a lot of them are

76
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.050
getting acquired. You've got, I
mean, same thing with UX

77
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.600
shops and some of the
specialty shops, but I think

78
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.230
customer or clients, what we
would have called clients now

79
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.410
who are, you know, traditional
companies are smarter and they

80
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.590
realized they're going to have
ongoing development needs. But one

81
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.930
of the things they want
is instead of just a

82
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.560
design, they kind of want
a design system now. So

83
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.380
you can hand over things
at Trent Walton at parallel,

84
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.470
who worked with Microsoft actually
on the new Microsoft site,

85
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.050
Trent was talking about how
that's most of what they

86
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.630
get asked for now is
designed systems. So they may

87
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.030
do a few pages to
show things, but it's really

88
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.520
a lot more about, these
are the types of elements.

89
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.080
These are the types, the
ways you're going to use

90
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.580
them. It's a true system.
What's the new Google flat

91
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.490
design thing that that's a
system, right? For people who

92
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.260
are listening, who may not
be familiar with this concept,

93
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.370
like it's like a branding
book like this. Yeah, It

94
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.080
is. And if you look
at Apple and the way

95
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.770
that Apple gives different direction
on iOS, and they ask

96
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.080
you to try to adhere
to these different standards, which

97
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.760
if you don't, you just
don't get in the store

98
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.760
a lot of times, but
that's exactly right. You have

99
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.200
some of the big players,
which we actually affectionately refer

100
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.800
to as the bigs that
are starting to work this

101
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.000
way as well, material design.
That's what it's called. That's

102
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.370
material design. Right. I think
that's the Google kind of

103
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.340
design system now. Gotcha. Gotcha.
People are saying like, you

104
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.200
know, you can, you know,
how do you make your

105
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.840
app look and feel and
fit within the Google brand?

106
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.250
Like if Google were going
to come up with another

107
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.430
app. Yeah. So it's almost
like a visual language in

108
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.190
that sense, not a visual
programming language, but exactly a

109
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.890
way to say these things
will feel familiar and will

110
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.650
be more readily adopted by
the people you're trying to

111
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.970
reach. Do, do you all
have like a COBOL or

112
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.460
do you get together and
decide like here's flat is

113
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.750
the new, Oh man. DD
beveled is the new black.

114
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.520
When are you, when are
you all deciding that? Because

115
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.940
it seems like the designers,
you know, I'm noticing new,

116
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.140
new things as a user
that I, yeah, Like a

117
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.150
drop shadows are coming back.
I want you to know

118
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.370
that we've been talking about
it and beveled edges never

119
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.780
went away. You know, it's
weird. It's a copycat industry.

120
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.780
That's one of the things
that bugs me, hero images

121
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.600
gave way to hero videos.
Oh the hero. Can we

122
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.570
just pause for a second?
And just, what are we

123
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.430
doing? I do not need
a blurry Fullscreen, MP4. That's

124
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.820
looped of like it's, it's,
you've gone from, you know,

125
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.540
clip art where it's like
women laughing while drinking coffee

126
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.470
has now become women laughing.
Well, looking at tablets alone.

127
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.330
And now it's looped videos
of women laughing with tablets.

128
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.170
A pay. Val is the
worst defender. That one person

129
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.770
in this gigantic office who's
walking by and you're like,

130
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.190
poor bastard. Why do you
have to work today? Everybody

131
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.590
else was either laid off
or left. And you're just

132
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.290
still there. If you know
that that is the nature.

133
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.760
One of the things that
bugs me the most about

134
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.050
the industry is we're lazy.
And I get in a

135
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.000
lot of trouble when I
say this, but it's true.

136
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.640
We will lean on best
practices. We will use responsive

137
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.520
web design as an excuse
for not being able to

138
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.360
do original things. And I
really hope in 2015 that

139
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.360
shifts, you know, in the
UK, they haven't leaned on

140
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.920
it as much as we
have in the U S

141
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.680
but it used to be,
we would tell clients they

142
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.580
couldn't do things because of
web standards, right before that

143
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.000
it was well flashes evil.
So unfortunately we can't do

144
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.790
any animation, you know, and
over time, all these things

145
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.930
become part of an acceptable
tool set, so you can

146
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.630
do them. So I really
hope in 2015, we see

147
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.480
original design come back. I
mean, listen, let's do some

148
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.270
things that enhance the message
and enhance the content, not

149
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.690
over the top. And like
you said, the hijack scroll,

150
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.600
it's like really? Yeah, Jackie,
I went to bill Gates

151
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.970
just released one of the
Gates notes that he does

152
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.220
every year. And when I
showed up there, I was

153
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.500
kind of staring at this
giant hero image and this

154
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.320
big web font. And then
I'm like, what do I

155
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.320
do now? And there's an
actual circle with an arrow

156
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.090
pointing down and it says,
scroll now I'm like, really

157
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.940
like, like, like your design
does not inspire me to

158
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.880
scroll. Therefore you put a
giant arrow pointing down saying

159
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.010
scroll now. But what you
said about being lazy is

160
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.560
really interesting. Like, Oh, we,
you know, we can't, we

161
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.410
can't do animation. I just
had Rachel neighbor's on the

162
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.440
show. And she was kind
of talking about how the

163
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.160
industry kind of pushed out
all the flash designers because

164
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.030
the flash tech was out
of Vogue. But that didn't

165
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.030
mean that the techniques that
the flash developers had designed

166
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.830
and come up with were
out of Vogue, but we

167
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.650
pushed them out of the
industry anyway. And then people

168
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.410
don't realize, Oh, we can
do this with CSS animation.

169
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.620
We do have the technology.
We're just too to do

170
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.260
it. Yeah. And you wonder
whatever happened. I mean, I

171
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.870
actually saw one of the
people from two advanced, maybe

172
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.230
four or five years ago,
and that was the flash

173
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.620
shop. I mean, we used
to have jokes that if

174
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.450
you were to go into
one of their presentations to

175
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.420
a client, there's like somebody
behind the guy presenting going,

176
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.280
and they're just like moving
these boards all around because

177
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.410
the stuff they would do
is insane. But it was,

178
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.870
I mean, it was strictly
entertainment. There was no way

179
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.000
you could look at that
as some sort of transfer

180
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.100
of information. It was more
of a transfer of a

181
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.600
feeling. I mean, they were
just, you were going to

182
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.840
enjoy it. But I think
Rachel's absolutely right through, there

183
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.360
was no reason to get
rid of some of the

184
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.590
concepts. Although I'll say this
too, there's no point in

185
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.550
having flash type animations on
Khan Academy. Right. You have

186
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.950
to know the context of
what you're trying to get

187
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.110
across. So maybe actually there
would be, if you were

188
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.660
showing some sort of a
chemical reaction or you're trying

189
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.600
to share something like that,
maybe it's really applicable. We

190
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.840
actually had a rule where
if we didn't think that

191
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.620
the client was in an
industry where flash was really

192
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.060
going to help them, we
just wouldn't do it. We

193
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.490
had a furniture, a woman
who imported furniture from Italy

194
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.250
and she really wanted this
crazy flashlight. We were like,

195
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.480
the people that can afford
your furniture are really old.

196
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.090
You're going to hurt their
eyes. This is not working.

197
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.090
But if you were a
bar, yeah. Oh man, we

198
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.120
were going to trick that
thing out. Intro. Yeah, exactly.

199
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.000
We had a superhero we
created called skip intro. You

200
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.770
had like an, a hit.
That was his name. Skip.

201
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.220
We drew him up. It
was skip intro. Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.320
I love that guy. That's
a really, actually a very

203
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.210
good idea. You know, one
of the things that I'm,

204
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.360
I'm surprised about, and again,
I understand that you're a

205
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.570
design insider, so you're not
only dropping names. I don't

206
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.280
know that you're dropping names
of companies. I don't know.

207
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.020
So I'm going to ask
you to explain who those

208
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.140
people are because people who
are listening won't know either,

209
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.700
but why is it that
the things that we think

210
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.590
we want from a design
perspective, like a minority report

211
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.280
and, you know, the TV
style animations were the most

212
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.970
significant thing. Our transitions between
States like that's the thing

213
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.290
about television and movie computers
is they all have very

214
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.530
fluid transitions. And the only
fluid transition that seems to

215
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.590
be left on the planet
is minimizing a window on

216
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.930
a Mac. And it there's
a little genie thing. You

217
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.290
know what I mean? And
no one else from like,

218
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.020
I've got a brand new
build here, a public build

219
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.040
of windows 10. And again,
the only cool animation is

220
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.010
the minimizing animation. Why are
we so lazy from a

221
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.860
transitions perspective, as you move
from page to page or

222
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.530
from state to state, we
do this for the movies,

223
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.510
but we won't do it
for the app. The application

224
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.370
that we use every day
does that mean that we

225
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.470
like those are fun to
watch in a movie, but

226
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.200
if you sat in front
of an animated transition system,

227
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.580
eight hours a day, you'd
start to go nuts. I

228
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.080
would have to agree that
that's, that's the situation. I

229
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.960
mean, we've done a ton
of user testing where we

230
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.890
sit with people on their
own equipment and watch, and

231
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.170
we'll, we'll have them open
some other apps that they

232
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.790
use and different things. And
one of the things we'll

233
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.990
see is they turn off
transitions. Really. People will find

234
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.360
a way to turn off
those transitions. Like when the,

235
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.870
that version of iOS came
out on the Mac that

236
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.870
had all those crazy transitions
going around. One of the

237
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.090
first things that hit Twitter
was how to turn it

238
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.490
off. Cause it was just,
you know, it was slowing

239
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.340
people down. And I think
there are people who love

240
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.280
those types of transitions, but
I don't think they're in

241
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.300
the majority. I actually met
a guy. I come blocking

242
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.210
on his name now, but
he does nothing but design

243
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.020
user interfaces for the movie.
Yeah. I saw that I

244
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.810
had a blog didn't they?
And here's all the cool

245
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.870
stuff I did. The movies.
Yeah, he did. Oh, it

246
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.770
was a shoot. I'm totally
blocking on it now, but

247
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.680
it was avatar. He did,
he did all that stuff

248
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.170
for avatar. And he said,
one of the amazing things

249
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.590
is as he's trying to
think through what will want

250
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.310
in the future, he gets
so much pushback that it's

251
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.520
not cool enough. And so
you have to go with

252
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.850
the, the extra pulse and
the different things. But you

253
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.800
know, to your point, if
you, if you look back

254
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.770
at star Trek, like the
original star Trek was Shatner,

255
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.530
they had those little square
floppy drives that were used,

256
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.520
right. <inaudible> little, basically as
an SD card or a

257
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.120
CF cards, the size of
things, very prescient. I grew

258
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.340
up, you know, a lot
of us that were the

259
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.120
nerds that became nerd designers.
Right. We grew up with

260
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.290
that stuff. So I think
it was always in our

261
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.780
mind and we just wanted
to make it real, Like

262
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.750
the M L cars, L
C a R S. That's

263
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.810
the star Trek, next generation
style of colorful design. Yeah.

264
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.540
That that's something that, that
that's sneaks its way in

265
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.530
that we don't realize a
library, computer access and retrieval

266
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.870
system. If you go and
search for that, that's like

267
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.460
the, you know, unlabeled buttons
of a certain color and

268
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.310
a certain color tone. And,
you know, you think it

269
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.920
would be an awesome idea.
And they had like iPads,

270
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.260
you know, 30 years before
anyone had thought of an

271
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:04.200
iPad on the transitions side,
I was watching a star

272
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.590
Wars with the kids, the
original 1977 star Wars. Okay.

273
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.830
And this is what, you
know, 30, Oh gosh, almost

274
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.960
40 years old now. Right.
And the, you know, the

275
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.960
transitions that they would do
between, they would do wipes,

276
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.020
big, big, you know, star
wipe or big wedge wipe

277
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.410
or whatever. And it was
very jarring. And then after

278
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.830
the fifth or sixth one,
I was like, this is

279
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.560
not cool. Like I want
to jump cut, you know,

280
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.930
like just click and go
to the next. And you

281
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.510
know, it's one of the
few things in the original

282
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.080
star Wars that doesn't hold
up, You know, that's, that's

283
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.920
an interesting point because from
a practical effects, their practical

284
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.430
effects are so good. You
think they're CGI. Yep. But

285
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.180
their wipes make it look
dated. My 11 year old

286
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.310
daughter was in a verbal
that got a little heated

287
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.590
with a 13 year old
friend of hers because her

288
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.110
friend said she didn't understand
why everybody felt star Wars

289
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.080
was so great. And I
actually heard her say something.

290
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.210
I probably said at one
point, but she goes, because

291
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.570
it holds up what they
did back then determined what

292
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.790
we do today and, you
know, and she just went

293
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.350
off on it. And I
was just like, you know,

294
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.590
you look at the original
Battlestar or star Trek. And

295
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.890
obviously they weren't in that
same space. And I mean,

296
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.300
I don't know that Lucas
had a whole lot of

297
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.120
money, but he, I had
a whole lot of heart

298
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.820
man. Yeah. And the effort
that they put into that

299
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.610
and the way that they
combined all the different media

300
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.920
and you know, and that,
I think that still reflects

301
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.140
back to the web. Yeah.
Well, again, all these different

302
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.170
techniques, The combination, I think
you're right. Like it's, it's

303
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.920
a subtle effect and a
subtle, a timeless style. If

304
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.840
you look at things like
Indiana Jones, those things hold

305
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.200
up. So what are great
web things from the nineties

306
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.620
and the early two thousands
that hold up today. Wow.

307
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.100
That's a great question. You
know, it's yeah. There's certain

308
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.710
things that just haven't really
changed much. And whenever we

309
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:54.880
try to change them, they
fall back. Like navvies like

310
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.650
navigation. Yeah. The whole, the
whole left side left rail,

311
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.810
whether it be a hidden
left rail that slides in,

312
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.060
there's always a left rail
or a top rail There's

313
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.300
designated content area. I mean,
it's, it's not unlike a

314
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.920
book in that way that
you've got to cover in

315
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.800
pages and you're going to
go left to right. Will

316
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.780
we hit a plateau? Like,
are we trying to make

317
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.660
this thing something that it's
not like, like, why do

318
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.400
we need to keep pushing
the web? Are you guys

319
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.980
you web designers, just so
bored that you need to

320
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.020
come up with a new,
a new, crazy thing, like

321
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.160
scroll jacking. Well, I really
don't think it's that we

322
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.230
get so bored because the,
the thing is there's so

323
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.040
many new devices that keep
coming out. I think part

324
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.900
of it that like you
look at wearables, right? There

325
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.140
are a lot of shops
that are starting to position

326
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.560
themselves right now. I see
generalist shops doing, starting to

327
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.650
position themselves with wearables. They
may just be doing a

328
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.200
blog post on wearables. They
may be talking to a

329
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.490
designer from another shop who's
designed for wearables. There's a

330
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.390
great shop in, in Austin,
Texas called fun-size, which I

331
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.910
think is the ultimate. That
is a pretty good name,

332
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.560
although I'm not sure who
decided that that was the

333
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.290
size of fun because fun
side is always the smallest

334
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:07.570
candy. But yeah. So I
think, I think part of

335
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.690
what happens is we keep
trying to fit the same

336
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.490
ideas into different shapes. And
that's where Ethan Marcott, who

337
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.920
is the guy who came
up with responsive web design

338
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.120
when he actually coined that
term and started looking at

339
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.880
the math and figuring out
doing things based on break

340
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.850
points instead of actual sizes
that really opened up just

341
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.490
everybody's minds to what we
had to start doing. I

342
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.890
mean, there's sites now that'll
work on an 80 cent, 80

343
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:40.000
inch screen and on, you
know, a smaller, older Android

344
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.030
device. Yeah. I think that
definitely responsive design is a

345
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.660
fantastic idea that has not
yet even been, been like

346
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.920
touched, like you can do
the basics, you know, portrait

347
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.710
and landscape, but I've seen
some really cool sites do

348
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.950
transitions as you go from
portrait to landscape and like,

349
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.320
Oh, well we'll just rearrange
things like those are transitions.

350
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.220
I can really get behind
and feel positive about The

351
00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.530
people who were trying. Right.
They're going to put that

352
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.720
extra effort in. We used
to have a saying that

353
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.140
the work doesn't start until
the client's happy. Right. As

354
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.730
soon as the client's okay,
then we're going to see

355
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.620
how much more we can
fit into this to make

356
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.120
it just to happy design
something that makes somebody go,

357
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.210
wow, I didn't expect that.
That was amazing. And that

358
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.060
comes because we started as
flash designers. So that was

359
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.920
always the thing we were
looking for. So it's funny

360
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.510
when Rachel says we all
got run out, a lot

361
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.410
of us just change clothes
really quickly, and we're still

362
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.650
here, but, but I think
responsive and all of the

363
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.200
new devices that are out
there, a lot of that

364
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.530
keeps us from rethinking the
way that we're delivering the

365
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.020
messages because we're having to
stand on our toes to

366
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.230
make sure it's consistent. Yeah.
I think also that we

367
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.470
don't think about a new
input devices enough. I mean,

368
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.630
w we're still kind of
stuck on touch and mouse,

369
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.820
but I think we're going
to see more and more

370
00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.700
gesture based things. I think
one of the reasons that

371
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.240
the, this is my opinion
that the Google glass didn't

372
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:03.500
really jump was the, the,
the interaction model just didn't

373
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.220
work. I could never get
the thing to activate effectively

374
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.010
and you'd see people just
kind of flipping their heads

375
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.290
back, trying to the thing,
you know what I mean?

376
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.640
I'm trying to get the
thing to wake up and

377
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.880
listen. It's what was wrong
with that guy? You know,

378
00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.610
I was at an event
and somebody at Google glass

379
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:20.930
and I watched him doing
that. And I was like,

380
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.940
I think he's having an
episode, but I don't want

381
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.220
to, he couldn't get the
thing to wake up. Now.

382
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.690
I know we, if you
look at the Xbox connect,

383
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.500
that device was so much
more powerful than any of

384
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.200
the technology X-Box actually put
out for it. I saw

385
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.510
a lot of the software
developers who grabbed it and

386
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.030
did things with it. And
there was one game and

387
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.320
I'm blocking on the name
for it. That was for

388
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.390
the Xbox. And I remember
I downloaded it after reading

389
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.600
about it. And you could
just control all of these

390
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.900
different elements in the game
with your Body gestures. It

391
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.270
was amazing. Yeah. It was
an example of where the

392
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.610
hardware is probably there, but
the software, no one has

393
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.230
any idea how to use
it. Yeah. And they don't

394
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.730
know if it's going to
sell. So there's not a

395
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.460
business case it's like to
hell with that. Do you

396
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.340
know the leap motion? Have
you use this? Now? The

397
00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.730
leap motion is a tiny,
tiny device. I'm holding it

398
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.280
up to you. It's looks
like a stick, a gum,

399
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.560
and you hold it in
front of your computer. And

400
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.600
it sends IRR beams up
in the air and you

401
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.200
move your hand around. And
when it's one of those

402
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.390
demos, like you remember the
first time three or four

403
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.580
years ago that you saw
that it was an Israeli

404
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.750
company that had a, a
little device that would project

405
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.230
a laser outline of a
keyboard on your desk. And

406
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.780
we all like, you know,
the Internet's brain just collectively

407
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.530
exploded. Cause the demo was
Epic. But then when you

408
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.560
used it, it's like no,
slapping your fingers on a

409
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.620
hardwood desk is a dumb
way to type. That's not

410
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.910
going to work. And that
was the greatest. And now

411
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.430
it's just like in the
sharper image catalog, right? So

412
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.750
this thing went like internet
darling to piece of chotsky.

413
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.570
That's just sitting in a
catalog That I see every

414
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.060
time I get stuck on
Southwest airlines, The leap motion,

415
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.050
hardware, Epic, the, the, the,
the, the implementation of it,

416
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.570
of the software just involves
me flailing in front of

417
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.030
the screen and then giving
up. And I did a

418
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.420
blog post about it where
I said, leap motion, amazing

419
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:12.420
revolutionary useless. And it's sitting
here unplugged because here's an

420
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.180
example where some genius hardware,
people came up with a

421
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.420
way to notice your hands,
right. But they couldn't figure

422
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.880
out the way to make
the interaction model work. And

423
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.680
everyone wants, everyone wants minority
report, but nobody wants gorilla

424
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.360
arms. That's absolutely it. I
forget. We were a, and

425
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.370
that gets back to the
connect, playing with the kids.

426
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.610
And in my experience, kids
will give up on something

427
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.910
way before adults. They'll be
like, this is stupid. This

428
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.990
doesn't make sense. Yeah. We
were. I forget what game

429
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.850
we were playing. It was,
it might've been a wipe

430
00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.510
out because there's nothing funner
than watching somebody try to

431
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.420
jump across five big red
balls. Right. I mean, it's

432
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.370
just hilarious to watch them
get hurt. So then you

433
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.980
try to do this in
your house. First of all,

434
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.860
ceiling fans are a big
issue and you're like jumping

435
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.410
and you're doing all this
stuff. But to actually set

436
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.600
the game up, you have
gorilla arms, you have to

437
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.710
move here. And then you're
like, Oh, I need to

438
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.590
start back further. And I've
got a chef over here.

439
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.260
And, you know, by that
time, you're back to Mario

440
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.080
cart and I've got, so
I've got a five year

441
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.590
old Was a little short.
So he's standing on a,

442
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.950
an Ottoman in front of
the connect. And the connect

443
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.700
is confused because his, his,
his body splits into legs

444
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.360
and then joins back together
into some giant foot because

445
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.850
it thinks that the Ottoman
is his foot. And the

446
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.940
connect is confused about why
he can't move this giant

447
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.170
foot. And then, you know,
my wife is a, is,

448
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.080
is black. So it can't
see her. And she's declared

449
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.630
that the connect is racist,
racist. I'm like, no, I'm

450
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.490
pretty sure it's not racist.
I think it's just the

451
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.610
lighting color. She's like, I
don't care. She's like, it's

452
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.340
not working. It can't see
me. So we're like adjusting

453
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.680
spotlights to get the thing
to work. And of course,

454
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.560
you know, firmware and a
year later it works. But

455
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.990
the point is that the
dream never quite matches up

456
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.870
with the reality. Yeah. How
many times, if you had

457
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.030
a design idea that you
thought was going to be

458
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.240
like, amazing and you showed
it in AB testing, it

459
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.280
just didn't work. I mean,
dozens, dozens of times, I

460
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.200
used to tell clients, the
reason we test things is

461
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.020
because we're wrong half the
time. So you hired us.

462
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.700
Let's make sure that we
both know that we're doing

463
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.570
something right. You know, and
even then you've got to

464
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.040
keep an eye on it.
Once you roll it out.

465
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.740
My daughter, again, my 11
year old at the time,

466
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.290
I guess she would have
been whenever the first iPad

467
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.920
came out, was it like
six years ago? And I

468
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.510
remember I got it and
I was playing with it

469
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.700
and she looked at it
and she asked me where

470
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.400
the camera was. And I
said, Oh, it doesn't have

471
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.650
a camera. This is more
for consuming and playing. And

472
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.680
she handed it back to
me Seriously. Like she just

473
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.520
declared up no cameras. No,
she went, She went back

474
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.550
to the phone. Right. And,
and then when the two

475
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.380
came out, we just saw
an ad for it on

476
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.540
television. And she looked at
me and she went told

477
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.420
ya. And I was like,
yeah, an Apple probably had

478
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.850
that in a closet. They
were just going to roll

479
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.640
it out. One, one different
feature at a time. So

480
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.950
that those of us that
are connected to them, you

481
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:09.050
know, by our juggler, I
swear I have, if ever

482
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.070
the unearth where I live
historians will think that there

483
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.430
was an Apple store there
because I probably have every

484
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.960
device from three or four
years ago. Great. About Apple

485
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.390
is that these are the
people that make you stand

486
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.460
in line for something and
think it's the greatest thing

487
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:29.140
ever. And then when the
next thing comes out, you

488
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:34.030
look at the previous thing
with disdain, like, how did

489
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.390
we ever survive with this
crap? What is this? Is

490
00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.060
that a five S it
is. Yeah. What is that?

491
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.400
Yeah. What is that? We
can use that garbage. I

492
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.310
mean, I have a six
plus now, so it's the

493
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.590
perfect size, you know? And
I, look, I look at

494
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.180
the previous one, I can't
even look at a four

495
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.130
ass. Like, how did we
squeeze? I think it's just

496
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.100
me getting older. So maybe
it's just, Apple's aging demographic,

497
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.490
but just needs to One
of my favorite things Apple

498
00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.460
is doing in the holiday
season. And this, this is

499
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.800
still a design thing. And
I, I, I don't know

500
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.420
if job's would have liked
it or not. I ask

501
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.460
myself that all the time
now with jobs like this,

502
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.860
I don't know. I don't
know the guy, but when

503
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.920
you walk by the Apple
store, so we have an

504
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.860
outdoor mall, this is huge
town center and there's an

505
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.230
Apple store. And then there's
a windows store just down

506
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.540
from it. Just like, maybe
not even a block on

507
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.760
the other side, when you
walk by the Apple store,

508
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.030
there's a line out front
that's kind of partitioned off

509
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.270
and there's a cop standing
there. And then if you

510
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.450
go down to the windows
store, it's like 20 employees

511
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.000
and a couple of people
inside the store. There's like,

512
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.890
nobody, there you go back
to the Apple store and

513
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.820
you look inside, there's only
six or seven people shopping.

514
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.520
What they've done is anybody
who had a preorder has

515
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.120
to wait outside in a
line. Yes. It's like getting

516
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.120
into the club. It is
it's it's, it's like, when

517
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.310
you own a restaurant that's
not popular. And you tell

518
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.180
the employees to park in
the front, you know, making

519
00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.270
it look like there's somebody
here for God's sakes. Yeah.

520
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.520
Where do you, what do
you think? What do you

521
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.580
have ready to go for
2015? What web design thing

522
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.060
does the web design a
mafia have that we wouldn't

523
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.610
expect? Like, what's the most
revolutionary thing you've seen maybe

524
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.820
on a single individuals blog
like a designer, or you're

525
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.260
like, Oh, this is the,
this is going to be

526
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.510
something like, this is a
technique or a style. Like

527
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.060
what about like responsive images
people are talking about? Yeah.

528
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.820
Responsive images are definitely something
we're going to start seeing.

529
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.310
You know, it's interesting. I
think we'll see some people

530
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:28.660
fall back to some older
things like progressive enhancement or

531
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.530
graceful degradation. That's when camp
called it, What about progressive

532
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.330
enhancement was going to be
a thing and everyone was

533
00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.850
talking about it. Oh, you
just checked for features. And

534
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.280
then you progressively get better.
And mobile first and then

535
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.070
responsive design happened. And then
everyone forgot about progressive enhancement.

536
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.810
But if you looking at
some of the wearables, The

537
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.510
responsive web design is just
not going to work. You're

538
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.460
going to have to find
a way to get that

539
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.010
information across. Assuming people want
to read a blog on

540
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.810
their watch. You know, I
don't think they will. I

541
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.030
think it's about alerts, but
I think there's another kind

542
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.220
of interaction that we haven't
thought about. Because right now

543
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.100
it's pretty clear that my,
my band or my Fitbit

544
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.030
or my, my pebble, whatever
is a notification. Right. You

545
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.980
know, like the Microsoft band
has a color screen and

546
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.100
a touchscreen and they call
it a right a right

547
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.350
wrist device. So the assumption
is you have a watch

548
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.600
on your left and on
the inside of your wrist,

549
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.390
not the outside. Right. Because
the more natural you kind

550
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.360
of go and look, Oh,
there's my notification. But what

551
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.670
happens? What doesn't happen? The
interaction model, I think we

552
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.940
haven't done is I touch
something on my wrist and

553
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.150
something happens on my phone,
on your phone, or I'm

554
00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.880
working on a design on
my iPad. I'm stepping out

555
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.280
the door. Why am I
not lifting my hand up?

556
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.390
And somehow dragging it onto
the phone. And then, and

557
00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:44.180
then leaving the continuation is
very blocky right now. Why

558
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.220
we stick it in Dropbox?
And then we go, and

559
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.090
we, Yeah, you do that.
Actually to that point, there's

560
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.180
a group called universal mind.
There's a group of a,

561
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.420
they do iOS development. They
do Android development, really big

562
00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.230
ticket stuff. And they're really
on the forefront of some

563
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.980
of this. I've seen them,
I'm working with where they've

564
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:10.460
put together, like an, an
iPad table. And as people

565
00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.180
are sitting around it, it
could be playing cards. It

566
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.060
is. And so, yeah, like
the original surface, like the

567
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.050
original surface only, it's the
size of like a really

568
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.170
big dining room table. Oh.
So it's really big. It's

569
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.680
really big. So you can
have 15 or 20 people

570
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.010
sitting around it. And if
somebody wants to share a

571
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.280
document, they kind of just
hit it on the table

572
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.230
and it goes in front
of where the seats are.

573
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.740
Right. And basically if you
put your phone down, it

574
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.910
knows that there's somebody at
that location. No. At the

575
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.490
micro Microsoft got this thing
called the Microsoft home. It's

576
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:50.000
like a, a, a pretend
house that they built inside

577
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.470
of a building. And then
they put all the cool

578
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.070
stuff there. So then dignitaries
and the Pope, they run

579
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.600
them through it. And one
of the things that I

580
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.550
thought was interesting is they're
making a giant table like

581
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.940
that the display technology doesn't
exist. Right. Right. So they

582
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.990
Mount tiny projectors on the
ceiling. So imagine you're sitting

583
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.940
in your kitchen and you're
like, I need a recipe.

584
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.030
And then it beams a
picture of the recipe down

585
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.380
onto the, onto the surface.
But rather than doing a

586
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:20.120
square window and projecting a,
a monitor onto your surface,

587
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.030
it does just the white
text. So it appears as

588
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.550
if the text is coming
out of the marble of

589
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.520
your, of your counter, right.
Gives you the sense that

590
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.260
your counter is this infinite,
infinite screen. That's, That's a

591
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.570
really cool way to go
about it. You put you're

592
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:40.580
right with the, the actual
projection surfaces. They aren't working

593
00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.850
and just described the kind
Of thing that you'd see

594
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.240
in a movie again, where
you're like, let's, let's plan

595
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.590
how we're going to blow
the world up. And let's

596
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.450
all get in front of
the giant table. And then

597
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.940
what we don't have is
the three dimensional thing that

598
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.630
comes out of the table,
right? Like you would see

599
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.900
on agents of shield. Right.
That's one of their things

600
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.950
that is pretty phenomenal looking
Well, there's an, there's a,

601
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.710
there's a, a thought that
that might actually be happening

602
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.560
though. There's a, a new
startup. I think Neil's Steve,

603
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.670
the author, Neil Stevenson just
joined that startup. And they're

604
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:15.660
talking about, what is it
called? He just joined yesterday.

605
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.750
He wrote, he wrote snow
crash, right? Yeah. And the,

606
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.990
yes, and the, the it's
called magic leap is the

607
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.740
new thing. Every word, I
don't know what the word

608
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.530
leap is, but here we
go. Magic leap is an

609
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.710
arsenal of techniques to produce
a synthesized light field that

610
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.390
falls in the retina the
same way as light is

611
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.730
reflected from real objects. I
think that's a fancy way

612
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:40.050
of saying holograms, I think
the 3d table and it

613
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.110
could happen. Yeah. I mean,
and that would be amazing

614
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.420
what they've got a universal
mind right now that, that

615
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.430
I think is great is
when you start looking at

616
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:52.170
collaboration, those documents that you
share, I don't know exactly

617
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.780
how they have them hooked
up, but it's almost like

618
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.960
a shared document. So if
somebody starts writing on it,

619
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.880
it'll end up on the
master and ended up on

620
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.070
the other ones that people
are there. So for brainstorming

621
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.490
and things like that, it's
pretty cool. Yeah. Using, using

622
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:09.630
Google docs or office online,
the web versions, being able

623
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.570
to type and see the
other person type is so

624
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.560
helpful. Cause I'm a remote
worker. Yep. I though the

625
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.720
whole kind of like push
save and hit refresh. Now

626
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.710
I don't wanna do any
of that. I want to

627
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.260
see your keys. I want
to mice. I want to,

628
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.180
I want to send it
to somebody and see them

629
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.090
show up on the document.
Right. Right. Right. And, and

630
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.670
for remote workers, which that's
another trend, I think we're

631
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.960
going to see a lot
more in the way of

632
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.220
remote teams and remote teams
that form with located teams

633
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:39.450
at clients' locations and stuff,
that type of technology. Yeah.

634
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.870
That's critical. I'm a fan
of Slack, right? The chat

635
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.860
room for remote workers. I
actually work with Slack And

636
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.650
HipChat open all the time.
Right next to each other.

637
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.810
Because half of the teams
that I work with use

638
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.230
HipChat and half of them
use Slack. And it's really

639
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.130
a wild situation because basically
what they do is they

640
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.830
kind of take the place
of email and text and

641
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.780
I am, and all these
other things, they're kind of,

642
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.210
if, if you're a super
nerd, they're kind of what

643
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.030
IRC was back in the
day. And at some people

644
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.750
still use that. But the
things that I've found is

645
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.540
first of all, Slack, just
Scott, I don't know how

646
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.720
much it was. It was
like $18 million, a ton, a

647
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.990
ton and another round. And
I'm hip. Chad has got

648
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.950
nothing. Yeah. I mean, they're,
they're owned by Atlasian or

649
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.370
Lansing and I'm not sure
Say that, frankly, it's, it's

650
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.890
over for everyone else. That's
not Slack. Slack is going

651
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.680
to become the get hub
of that space. I, you

652
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.070
know, what sucks is HipChat
has really good video chat.

653
00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.250
So if you're, you're going
with somebody and you just

654
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.400
hit video, it'll open it
up. And also it doesn't

655
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.500
handle emojis as well. And
I think that's where Slack

656
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.800
one, cause emojis are with
millions of dollars. My friend.

657
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.160
Yeah. I, you know, I
hate to believe that, but

658
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.640
you're right. And there's also
other more realtime, more video

659
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.880
thing. Like bluejeans.com is a
really amazing way to do

660
00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.540
video. But for some reason
I find that older people

661
00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.060
of my gender, people of
my generation love video and

662
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.850
the young people, they like,
they like texts. But all

663
00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.070
I do, if I'm typing
to you about the third

664
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.990
sentence, my hands start to
hurt. And like, I'm just

665
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.280
going to pick up the
phone and talk to this

666
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.860
person. Why am I typing
to you? Another thing I

667
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.990
think we'll see next year.
And we're already seeing it

668
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.470
this year is where people
start to integrate with their

669
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.590
own photos and their own
videos. It's really easy now

670
00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.960
to grab different items and
just throw them in on

671
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.650
the fly. So Snapchat, the
last update of Snapchat, you

672
00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:33.070
can actually put emojis in
a picture with you. So

673
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.710
if, and this is my
13 year old is all

674
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:39.610
about Snapchat. And so when
she's doing a selfie, as

675
00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:46.060
she does, she'll put in
like a big red representation

676
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.170
of a guy walking behind
her. And she'll be like,

677
00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.110
like she's gotten scared by
this graphic that looks like,

678
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.850
except for being red, it
came right off a street

679
00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:57.490
sign. You know, like those
slow kids who were always

680
00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:01.000
playing in the neighborhood. So
that to me is kind

681
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.640
of exciting when you start
to see again, it's a,

682
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.640
it's a blending of different
media and really that's all

683
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.560
the hologram things going to
be. It's going to be

684
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.630
a new way to display
the information. Right. That's just

685
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.780
super, super cool. Yeah. I
th I really hope that

686
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.020
we have more ways to
move though, from device to

687
00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.540
device, because if I'm going
to have a desktop and

688
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.120
a laptop and a tablet
and a wearable and a

689
00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:27.130
phone, or whatever, the idea
of the feeling of like

690
00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.110
throw it up into the
cloud and then bring it

691
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.200
back down again. Well, that's
probably what's going to happen

692
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.120
in the background. It doesn't
kind of feel right. So

693
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.220
I think I'm looking forward
to like apples, you know,

694
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.550
continue with the continuum or
continuity this idea that I'm

695
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.410
in one app here. And
I pick up right where

696
00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:43.720
I left off. When you
move, like right now, we're

697
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.900
having a Skype, but I
know I have to run.

698
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.240
So what if I pick
up my phone and then

699
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.640
I just make a gesture
and you're on my phone

700
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.920
and then we can smooth,
but no, I hang up

701
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.130
and I'll call you back.
Yeah. Right. Which feels so

702
00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:01.930
rotary. Well, it also feels
unnatural because yeah, I'm leaving.

703
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:06.550
Why aren't you coming with
me? I think that we'll

704
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.710
see video games are going
to lead that charge, right?

705
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.850
Yeah. That's true. Have you
seen smart glass? I've not

706
00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.430
seen smart glasses. Smart glass
is really interesting. So if

707
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.760
you play like Assassin's creed
or halo or call of

708
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.040
duty, you're sitting there in
front of your Xbox and

709
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.870
you're doing your thing. And
then you're like, you know,

710
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.630
I wish I had a
map of what I'm doing.

711
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:29.320
Like an actual map. Well,
I've got this tablet. I

712
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.930
just log in and immediately
and knows I'm playing a

713
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.730
game. And it shows me
where I'm at. It's like

714
00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:37.770
a GPS for your game.
And it's the mini that

715
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.750
usually goes up on the
screen, but it's on my

716
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.900
tablet. But the great part
is I can close down

717
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.360
the app and still interact
with the game on the

718
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.080
tablet. And then jump back
in. I was watching game

719
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.050
of Thrones on my Xbox,
and I couldn't figure out

720
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.560
who the heck that target
Aryan was. I load up

721
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.380
smart glass as a second
screen. And it puts up

722
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.040
a family tree of the
game of Thrones characters. All

723
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.790
that's amazing context of the
show I'm watching. Right. You

724
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.250
know, that that's an interaction
model. That's from a technical

725
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.640
perspective, extremely hard. Right. But
if they can make that

726
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.180
easy to write to, yeah.
That's going to completely change

727
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.580
how we think about the
web. Yeah. It gives those

728
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.430
enhancements. You know, I think
it was lost was probably

729
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:24.780
the first TV show that
created, you know, that the

730
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.900
Dharma initiative Dharma was a
real thing. You could log

731
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.880
into the Dharma website, you
could do all those things

732
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.030
and they would do different
updates throughout the show and

733
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.830
these types of things. I
think as much as you

734
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:38.340
can make other devices and
enhancement, it's just better. Monday

735
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.290
night football was doing that
for awhile. I don't know

736
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:42.090
that they still are. I
mean, yeah, if I'm watching

737
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.790
football, why am I not
getting of like a top

738
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:49.020
level view with icons? Don't
baseball, people have games like

739
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.800
that have have real time
graphics of exactly what play

740
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.440
is happening and it can
fast forward in time. Yeah.

741
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:57.840
Yeah. I think, I think
we'll definitely see a lot

742
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.420
more of that in 2015.
Very cool. Well, where can

743
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:04.830
people find you online at
Carl Smith? C a R L

744
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.470
Smith. I won't spell that
one for you. Well, I

745
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.450
think we should have you
on, on a regular basis

746
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.580
and because we can, we
can talk for hours. You'll

747
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.970
be my design reporter. There
you go. I'd love to,

748
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.650
I'd love to check in
and let you know what's

749
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.050
going on in the world
of design. Very cool. Thank

750
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.050
you so much, Carl Smith for
coming on Hansel minutes. This

751
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.150
has been another episode and
we will see you again

752
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.720
next week.
