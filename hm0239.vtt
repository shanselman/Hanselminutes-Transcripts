From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes.
Our weekly discussion with web

2
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.590
developer and technologists, Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

3
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.740
number two 39 reported live
Thursday, November 5th, 2010. Support for Hanselman

4
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
it's as provided by Tellerik
rag controls, the most comprehensive

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.690
online@wwwdottlerik.com. In this episode, Scott
talks with Rob Connery about

7
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.690
their new podcast called this
developer's life. Hi, this is

8
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.900
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes. It's

9
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.990
a crazy crossover edition of
Hanselman it's this week. Cause

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.830
I've got Rob Connery on
the show, Rob, the host

11
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.950
of this developer's life. Another
podcast that he and I

12
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.800
work on, how's it going,
Rob? It's going really well.

13
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.130
How are you? I'm very
well. I hear some things

14
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.750
in the background there. What's
going on over at the

15
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.570
Connery residence. Yeah, I should
warn you. We have some

16
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.410
rodents of unusual size fixing
up my house, a little

17
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.960
construction work going on and
I could not reschedule it.

18
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.420
So hopefully it's not gonna
be too loud. So this

19
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.640
will be a very good
episode to explain to people

20
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.920
how to do a podcast.
You get as many construction

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.570
workers as possible, maybe a
saw an air compressor secret

22
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.440
to my success, right? Yes.
High quality audio. Yep. So

23
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.110
what's involved. I know how
we make podcasts over here

24
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.400
because prop productions and Carl Franklin
and Lawrence Ryan, and all of

25
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.120
the folks at <inaudible> work
on Hansel minutes. How, how

26
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.220
do you do the show?
I mean, I kind of

27
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.150
know, but, but let's pretend,
I don't know because there's

28
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.260
a, it's interesting, not just
the technical stuff, but the

29
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.740
inspiration and you know, how
does that work? What's the

30
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.920
production like? Well, you know,
the original inspiration for the

31
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.380
show was of course this
American life with one of

32
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.110
my favorite podcasts. But you
know, as I just thought,

33
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.940
you know, Hey, I could,
you know, I could do

34
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.170
something like this for the
development arena. It started to

35
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.510
hit me that, you know,
this developer's lie or I'm

36
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.010
sorry, this American life borrows
a lot from cinematic production

37
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.070
aesthetics, I spend let's, let's
make sure that remember that

38
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.460
a lot of our listeners
aren't American. So it has

39
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.340
as a way of context,
this American life is part

40
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.060
of public radio and public
radio international, which is a

41
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.590
kind of a national nonprofit,
you know, government run radio

42
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.650
and public. I think this
American life comes out of

43
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.690
WBZ Chicago, and it is
a, there's been about 400

44
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.500
shows now it's, it's largely
considered to be, you know,

45
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.890
well, it is technically the
number one podcast on iTunes

46
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.820
consistently. It is an extremely
popular radio show. They have

47
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.410
live shows where they'll come
and have people tell stories

48
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.020
on stage. So you can
go and see the radio

49
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.660
show recorded live. And the
general idea is that this

50
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.550
gentleman named IRA glass tells
stories and it's usually broken

51
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.000
up into acts and those
acts are based on themes.

52
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So you'll have a theme
like I'm going to summer

53
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.210
camp and what's uniquely American
about going to summer camp,

54
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.330
you know, in this week's
episode three, three stories about

55
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.930
summer camp, yada yada yada.
So it's, it's very cinematic.

56
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.420
It's very structured. It's very
formal and they've honed it

57
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.210
over the last several years
to a fine, it's a,

58
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.890
it's a, it's a machine.
It's just a, it's a

59
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.190
very emotional, intense show. And
I think we both recommend

60
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.560
it to anybody. So for
those of you who aren't

61
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.340
in America, this American life
while uniquely American is certainly

62
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.100
appropriate for folks who live
elsewhere. I think so. And,

63
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.010
you know, I thought it
was also incredibly appropriate for

64
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.350
what we do in that.
You know, one of the

65
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.180
fun things when you get
together with other geeks, like

66
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.400
when, you know, when you
have your nerd dinner or

67
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.680
at conferences, you know, you
sit down and you share

68
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.160
stories, it's just part of
the human condition. And I

69
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.740
kind of figured that there's
so many podcasts out there

70
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.440
that talk about things. And
a lot of people, you

71
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.470
know, tend to get, I
don't wanna say snarky, but

72
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.740
it, as Miguel said in
our last podcast, we're perfectly

73
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.950
tuned complaining machines because we
see so many details and

74
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.930
things. And I thought, you
know, we need a bit

75
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.590
of inspiration, you know, and,
and some positivity out there,

76
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.110
that's sort of been my
goal and it terms of

77
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.020
how I make it. It's
a, it's sort of interesting

78
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.540
when you look at a
podcast, not as audio, but

79
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.520
more as cinema and because
that's, it's, it's storytelling and

80
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.310
which is a true audio
form. But if you convert

81
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.430
that into a cinematic form
in you start interspersing music

82
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.380
in there, there, there all
of a sudden becomes a

83
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.620
pace in a meter. And
next thing you know, you're,

84
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.070
you have to clip and
edit down to the most

85
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.130
minute detail to get actually
the pace and tone of

86
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.430
the, of the speaker or
the storyteller to match the

87
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.010
musical tone, to match an
overall pace inside of the

88
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.610
podcast. It's, it's pretty intense
work. I have to say.

89
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.830
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if
you think about what we're

90
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.220
trying to do on Hanselman
is, is to educate, so

91
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.570
our editing, our story arc,
our intent, our, you know,

92
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.750
everything is tuned to give
you a little bit of

93
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.690
information that hopefully you didn't
have before, which is an

94
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.980
extremely different way of going
about things. Then this developer's

95
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.070
life. You're trying to have
an emotional effect on someone

96
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.620
and not, not informed, but
rather kind of enlightened. Yeah,

97
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.100
absolutely. In a, in a
way. So if you, you

98
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.660
know, if you're a fan
of like the daily show

99
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.080
with Jon Stewart, right. That
that's much more of a

100
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.920
live interactive experience, whereas, you
know, you could flip the

101
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.360
channel and then you're watching,
I don't know, 2001 space

102
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.870
Odyssey. You're not, it's just
a different, it's a different

103
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.930
vehicle, much more produced, more
honed, but it's, it's a

104
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.910
different way of telling stories.
I mean, both of them

105
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.840
get into the art of
storytelling. It's just a different,

106
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.970
I guess, a different vehicles,
what I'm trying to say.

107
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.540
Yeah. And, and you and
I have been at conferences

108
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.330
over the last five or
six years, and we've been

109
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.410
in these amazing conversations. They
might be in a restaurant

110
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.720
in Vegas while we're at
a conference in the middle

111
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.220
of the night and we
go, gosh, I wish we

112
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.830
had a recorder. I mean,
I cannot tell you, I

113
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.720
mean, I can tell you,
you were there how many

114
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.020
times we've had that experience,
where we've been somewhere in

115
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.990
this amazing conversation where someone
is telling an amazing story

116
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.780
and we just wished we
had a recorder. Oh yeah.

117
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.580
I kind of feel like
that's what you're trying to

118
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.060
do with the show. Yeah,
yeah. 100%. And same thing.

119
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.550
I have a bunch of
friends here that are technically

120
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.860
inclined and we're sitting at
lunch and one of them

121
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.290
will just tell me the
most incredible story about this

122
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.960
thing at sun. And I
just sit there and like

123
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.530
absolutely enraptured and just thinking
what, you know, and I

124
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.310
actually went out and bought
a Tascam, you know, MP3

125
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.740
recorder. I keep it with
me. I'm a complete dork.

126
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.930
I keep it with me
just in case from now

127
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.090
on. I should do that
too. I mean, there's been

128
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.590
a number of times when
I've been out and about,

129
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.050
and it kind of messes
up the spontaneity. I mean,

130
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.420
it's one of those things
where you sacrifice audio quality

131
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.610
for, you know, for spontaneity.
I've had times when I

132
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.560
wanted to bust out the
recorder, except I've got a

133
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.610
little M audio microtrack and
two microphones, and, you know,

134
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.740
it takes five minutes to
set up. So you have

135
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.600
a handheld one now that
you can use if in

136
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.870
case something spontaneous happens, I
do. It fits right in

137
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.180
my pocket. It's a, I
got it at Amazon, Amazon.

138
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.450
It's Great. I've seen people
try to make podcasts using

139
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.200
only like an iPhone or
a mobile phone recorder on.

140
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.510
I tend to recommend against
that because the microphone is

141
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.190
usually pretty low quality and
it almost always uses that

142
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.140
audio compressed. Do you have
a thought either way? Absolutely.

143
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.830
It takes a while to
master the audio aspect. As

144
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.990
a lot of people will
probably attest to that have

145
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.900
listened to the first few
episodes of this developer's life.

146
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.670
And, you know, if you
get into the audio production

147
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.010
part of it and you
start listening to higher end

148
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.130
audio, you don't, you can't
go backwards. So if you

149
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.740
start out with an iPhone
and just record a conversation,

150
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.770
it might sound okay to
your ears. But then let's

151
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.320
say you step up to
an MP three recorder that

152
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.470
costs maybe $50 at best
buy. And then you listen

153
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.210
to that and you say,
Oh my God, this just

154
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.670
sounds so much better. And
then you keep going. The

155
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.520
thing that you're actually picking
up is the texture of

156
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.000
the person's voice. And there's
so much to it. So

157
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.980
for instance, talking to you
now, I'm using a pretty

158
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.530
nice microphone and I'm actually,
I'm about three or four

159
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.520
inches from the, from the
pickup here. But you know,

160
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.120
you can, you can work
that to make it sound

161
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.730
like a much more intimate
experience as you know, you're

162
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.970
an audio person. And so
when you start mastering those

163
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.920
things that all of a
sudden opens up so much

164
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.760
more in terms of getting
to people and telling a

165
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.880
story, Well, I'm certainly not
as much an audio person

166
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.880
as Carl and Lawrence and
the folks at prop, because

167
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.400
just, just when I think
I get it, I learned

168
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.340
that I don't get it
at all, but a truth.

169
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.870
For example, I'm using an
older M audio microtrack, I've

170
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:16.130
got a shore microphone and
a pair of XLR two,

171
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.600
one quarter inch cables, and
I'm using a, an audio

172
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.840
trap T R a P
trap from a company called

173
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.990
real traps. This is kind
of like a portable vocal

174
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.940
booth to try to make
the sound quality a little

175
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.470
bit better. I think we're
probably looking at about $500

176
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.560
worth of equipment, but is
that, is that required for

177
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.420
someone to start a podcast?
I mean, couldn't someone out

178
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.360
there who has a great
story, just couldn't they just

179
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.640
record into their podcast or
just fire up Skype and

180
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.300
record the audio there. You
know, it's an interesting question.

181
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.590
I read a great article
by Dan Benjamin from five

182
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.260
by five studios who does
the dev show in about

183
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.800
a hundred other podcasts. But
if you go to hive,

184
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:02.030
logic.com, which is his blog
and you search for a

185
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.120
podcast, he has got a
getting started guide where he

186
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.150
talks about the investment that
you'll make, and you can

187
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.550
get off the ground for
50 bucks, you know, just

188
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.530
to get a reasonable microphone
and sit in a quiet

189
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.870
place. But then as more
and more people listen to

190
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.220
it, more and more people
are going to pick on

191
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.530
you. And as it becomes
more and more popular there,

192
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.590
you're going to be compared
to, you know, like Hansel

193
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.290
minutes, right. Where the audio
is spotless and people are

194
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.520
going to say, well, you
know, when I listened to

195
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.430
Scott, he sounds great. And
you sound like, you know,

196
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.820
you're, you're screaming into a
manhole. No one has said

197
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.150
that you're well, okay. Yeah.
So they've thought it though,

198
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.200
Right? Of course. So, you
know, you can get off

199
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.150
the ground easy, but I
will say it's like, it's

200
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.060
like owning an aquarium or,
or anything else really use

201
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.580
you quickly go down the
slide of how do I

202
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.200
sound better? Yeah. Faster. It's
definitely a humbling, like the,

203
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.110
I usually use the analogy
about, you know, once you

204
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.410
think you're a good fake
plastic rock player, if you're

205
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.020
doing like rock band on
an Xbox and you're on

206
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.540
easy, and then you see
someone do it on expert,

207
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.910
and then you think they're
amazing. And then you see

208
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.820
someone actually play the guitar,
you know, like Sean Wildermuth

209
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.300
or Carl Franklin, and you realize,
wow, we're not even playing

210
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.260
the same thing. Like I'm
playing fake plastic rock. That's

211
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.270
why, I mean, you can
make, you know, Dan, Dan

212
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.760
Benjamin's in an example, Carl Franklin
example, I mean, he has

213
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.050
an entire company dedicated to
high quality podcasting. So while

214
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.300
I appreciate that, you know,
people like the quality of

215
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.700
this show and that show
on the other show, you

216
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.940
can always be an expert
and you can always, and

217
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.040
then even then you might
discover that you're, you're not

218
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.620
playing in the same in
the same leagues, but don't

219
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.200
you think those are, those
are incremental improvements. I mean,

220
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.340
once you get to 80%,
85% good, you spend the

221
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.440
rest of your life trying
to get that last 15%

222
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.460
solid. Absolutely. And it's an
incident obsessive thing, for sure.

223
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.950
And you know, it mirrors
a lot of other things

224
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.640
you do in life, even
coding, you know, you can,

225
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.430
you can learn a language
to about 80% become functional

226
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:02.950
in, you know, really good,
but it's that last 20%,

227
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.370
whatever that becomes mastery and
grew time where you can

228
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.490
answer just about any question
at a conference, when someone

229
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.520
at your level, you know
what I mean? But, so

230
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.680
to get back a little
bit to, to what you

231
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.630
can do to get started
at, like for right now,

232
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.550
I'm actually recording in garage
band. I do all the

233
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.710
production in garage band, but
a lot of professional podcasters

234
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.810
would poopoo that, you know,
they'd say, Oh, go get

235
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.360
you, go get some of
the Sony tools or go

236
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.570
get pro logic and all
these other things, because you

237
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.230
can tune and fine tune
the music and, and everything

238
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.720
you do to such a
high degree. But for me,

239
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.210
you know, I, this does
everything I need. You can,

240
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.690
you can affect some background
effects. You can tweak the

241
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.540
vocals a little bit. You
can actually make your voice

242
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.190
sound like a female. If
you want to. I was

243
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.960
going to do that to
you. One of the podcasts,

244
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.290
but I didn't. I think
my voice does a decent

245
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.490
enough job with gen Lanka,
female. I don't need GarageBand

246
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.940
comes free with the new
max. Also audacity is a

247
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.280
free program you can go
grab and there's a ton

248
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.170
of things you can do
in there. And there's lots

249
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.130
of blog posts online about
how to get started. Hi,

250
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.260
this is Scott coming to
you from another place in

251
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.650
time. Are you using agile
practices to manage your software

252
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.930
development? There's lots of tools
in the market that manage

253
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.850
the steps of a project,
but most of them focus

254
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.180
on individual roles. Get ready
for a solution that caters

255
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.730
for the success of the
whole team. Guys at Tellerik

256
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.540
introduced team pulse. It's an
agile project management tool. That'll

257
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.750
help you gather ideas, estimate
plan, track progress in a

258
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.710
common workspace. Finally, companies, regardless
of their size can use

259
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.050
a lightweight and convenient tool
that makes all the stakeholders

260
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.080
work as a United team.
Even if they're in different

261
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.680
countries by combining intuitive user
interface and the power server

262
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.620
light team poles removes the
roadblocks that you typically face

263
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.650
and applying agile in an
effective manner, no more lost

264
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:54.030
data or disparate systems, no
lack of critical analytics regarding

265
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.120
the health and philosophy project.
See if yourself get a

Tellerik for supporting Hansel minutes

268
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.700
on their Facebook fan page,
facebook.com/t L E R I

269
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.210
K Keller. We do appreciate
it. There wouldn't be a

270
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.540
Hansel minutes. If there wasn't,
Tellerik helping us, how much

271
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.310
work should you put into
it? And I thought about

272
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.890
this recently because I kind
of woke up one day

273
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.790
and said, wow, I'm participating
in two podcasts. This is

274
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.130
taking away from coding time.
And you must have thought

275
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.950
the same thought, right? I
mean, you've got tech pub,

276
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.550
your video education site. You've
got work that you do

277
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.890
on the side as a
consultant and a gun for

278
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.160
hire. And we've got this
developer's life that you're doing

279
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.670
editing and production with me
on every hour that you're

280
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.850
spending editing your podcast is
an hour. You're not learning

281
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.500
Ruby or playing with C
sharp or whatever. Do you

282
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.630
balance that and say, well,
it's good enough. Or, or

283
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.600
do you get obsessive? And
then realize that you'll, you'll

284
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.050
burn an entire day on
some sound problem. I mean,

285
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.060
I guess what I'm trying
to understand is as a

286
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:07.100
programmer type personality, do you
consider this creative outlet being

287
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.620
different? And if so, is
it taking time away from

288
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.120
your, your more analytical life?
I've thought about that a

289
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.960
lot. And I think the
one answer that I can

290
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.610
give you is that I
don't think of it as

291
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.520
a, it's not necessarily a
debit let's call it that,

292
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.700
it's it actually the hours
that I spend on the

293
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.860
podcast multiply the time I'm
able to work on code.

294
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.790
For instance, it's a creative
outlet. It's something that I

295
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.220
actually need to do. And
I look forward to it

296
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.130
to the point where, you
know, when I know a

297
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.680
show is coming in and
I, we have the, we

298
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.440
have the interviews down, I
can't stop thinking about it.

299
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.970
And then in the evenings,
I'll sit down and start

300
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.880
splicing it. And it gets
so excited and so motivated,

301
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.160
listening to the stories and
putting it together that the

302
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.160
next day, you know, when
I'm working, I just feel

303
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.850
happy. And I don't know.
So I guess it depends

304
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.220
on your motivation. If you're
going to start a podcast

305
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.170
and you, you know, your
question was, you know, how

306
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.720
much time should you put
into it? For me, it's

307
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.570
a creative outlet and I
never feel like I have

308
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.100
to do it. I just
want to, and I let

309
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.730
it come and, you know,
out it goes, and then

310
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.610
I'm motivated to do, do
my regular job, I guess,

311
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.710
is the best way to
put it. And I feel

312
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.320
refreshed. I dunno. I dunno
if that's coming out in

313
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.350
a cohesive answer. No, I
think so. I think that

314
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.870
the, then the question for
people who are listening though,

315
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.100
is what if no one
listened to the show? Cause

316
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.740
sometimes, you know, I'm just
doing my thing, right? I'm

317
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.110
just turning the crank. And
I do a, I do

318
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.760
a show every week and
I enjoy it. And it's

319
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.950
part of my life. Now
we've done four years where

320
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.280
the shows and I, and
I tell people, it doesn't

321
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.670
really matter if anyone listens,
you know, if, if I

322
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.120
have five really awesome listeners
or 50,000 and you know,

323
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.280
I honestly couldn't tell you
exactly how many people listen

324
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.410
to the show. And when
I tell that to people,

325
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.570
they always think that it's
some kind of false modesty

326
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.850
and I'm sure you must
have the same thing. Oh,

327
00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.830
well, you're Rob Connor. You
know, you've got a popular

328
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.500
blog, blah, blah, blah. You
know, for every person that's

329
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.830
doing okay, there's someone else
who's doing way better. You

330
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.780
know? I mean, you and
I have a nice little

331
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.390
thing going here and we've
got a nice following and

332
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.880
then you've got, you know,
Dan Benjamin, who's got more

333
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.560
than that. And then Leo
LaPorte has got more than

334
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.990
that. And Adam Curry has got
more than that, right? Not

335
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.830
everybody can be a Beyonce,
but would you do it?

336
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.100
Even if anyone, even if
no one was listening. Absolutely.

337
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:30.340
Absolutely. I, I try and
explain this to people, you

338
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.470
know, so there, we get
a lot of feedback and

339
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.810
a lot of people say,
you know, one person said

340
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.000
to me, I love the
podcast. I love the interviews.

341
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.860
I hate the music. If
you take the music out,

342
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.420
I won't listen to it
or I'll listen to it.

343
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:48.580
You know? And, and I
actually joyfully respond. I'm so

344
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.150
sorry. I'm going to lose
you as a listener, but

345
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.820
honestly, take this the right
way. I don't care because

346
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.350
this is, I can no
more control this creative thing

347
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.310
than I think anyone can
control, you know, any creative

348
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.310
effort really. And no, I
don't care if anybody listens,

349
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.100
this is a, it's just
an expression. It's a thing

350
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.330
I do. And for once
in my, in my kind

351
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.620
of professional existence, I have
complete 100% control over a

352
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.070
thing where it's not necessarily
due to a client. It's

353
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.550
something, you know, I create.
So normally when we write

354
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.470
code, we write it for
a business or a thing,

355
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.710
or to make money or
whatever. I don't have any

356
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.980
commitments here I just created
and I want it to

357
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.830
be. And because there's none
of that pressure of it

358
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:40.530
has expectations on it. I
feel like I have to

359
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.870
make it to be what
it is. And there is

360
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.530
no other way to do
it. So how do you,

361
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.740
so answer asking questions that
the audience might have? How

362
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.100
do you reconcile that with
me? You know, you have

363
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:57.350
100% over your 50%. Oh
right. You know, that's a

364
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.650
good question. <inaudible> Let me
think of it. Right. When

365
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.780
we thought about joining up
in episode two, we was

366
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.000
like, Oh yeah, this is,
I mean, we'd both been

367
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.860
talking about doing a show
like this and it just,

368
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.920
it's a, it's a perfect
outlet for each of us.

369
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.130
And I didn't get any
sense at all. When I

370
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.060
joined, you know, early on
that we would have, we

371
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.790
haven't had any fights or
anything. No, not at all.

372
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.230
And I think when you,
when you talk to somebody

373
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.150
and they share your vision
to a point that, you

374
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.790
know, you, you start step
each other, rather than clash,

375
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.000
it only makes the effort
better. And for me, it's

376
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.810
like the show couldn't be
without you. It, because as

377
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.960
people are, can probably tell
in this podcast here, you

378
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.510
have a much better way
of, of narrating, you know?

379
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.700
And I'm, I try, I'm
getting there. I'm not a

380
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.350
natural speaker and I tend
to ramble as he knows.

381
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.680
Well, and so I don't,
I don't sound like I

382
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.560
ramble in the podcast because
I know. Yeah. But we

383
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.390
spent, we'll spend time at
like, you know, we'll be

384
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.280
up at like two in
the morning going over the

385
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.400
show and I'm like, okay,
Rob. So you said about

386
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.650
three minutes worth of information,
but you told us about

387
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.650
15 minutes to do it.
You're like really, you know,

388
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.500
this is the thing. Right.
And then I don't, I'm

389
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.330
not the music guy and
I will, so this is

390
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.820
why there's two of us,
you know, it's funny. Yeah.

391
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.190
I joked online that, you
know, I'm will I am

392
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.170
and you're Fergie, but in
a sense that there's truth

393
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.480
to that. And that I
can compose the story. I

394
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.160
can edit the arc down.
I can do all these

395
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.400
things, but I cannot necessarily
narrate as good as you

396
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.220
can. Not, not by any.
And also the interviews as

397
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.590
well is just stellar. So
anyway, it's a perfect fit

398
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.020
to get back And there's,
and there's there's administrative stuff

399
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.750
and running the site and
messing around with the audio

400
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.020
and uploading crap and finding
holsters and fighting. This is

401
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.910
the thing, right? It's 50
50. We, we split it,

402
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.200
but absolutely why, why not
keep a creative outlet to

403
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.040
yourself? Why not? Why not
just make just, just you

404
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.620
and you do it all
by yourself in a kind

405
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.640
of your cave. Well, it's
just more fun to share,

406
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.280
you know, especially when, when,
I mean, we always tell

407
00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.560
our kids that, right? You,
you share your candy with

408
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.240
someone else. We'll give some
more candy back to you.

409
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.370
And all of a sudden
you have, you know, a

410
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.000
really fun time with somebody
and you're creating this shared

411
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.140
experience. And, you know, it's
fun to create. It's fun

412
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.890
to make art. It's fun
to do any sort of

413
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.740
effort, but when you share
it with somebody and, and

414
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.070
you feel their joy, it
resonates. And I feel that

415
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.400
the show is way better
because our two creative efforts

416
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.400
are of, you know, when
I sent her Florida It's

417
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.680
pair programming for audio, you
are more than twice as

418
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.980
productive. Absolutely. And I, when
I said before, it's my

419
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.440
creative outlet. I mean, it's,
doesn't change just because you

420
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.010
know, you're here. So it's
so funny though, that when

421
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.710
you talk about the excitement
I came out of the

422
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.140
Miguel interview, if you haven't
listened to the show, I'd

423
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.000
encourage you to check it
out. The most recent one,

424
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.900
I think was episode seven
and we had Alex Payne, we

425
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.750
had John Ray and we had
our, our, our mutual friend

426
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.630
Miquel DIA Kaza. And I
came out of the interview

427
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.550
with Miguel. I was just
like, I called you right

428
00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.650
away. I was like on
campus. I was like, Oh

429
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.620
my God. That was so
awesome. Yeah, you made my

430
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.080
day. I'm such a fan
boy, but you know, it

431
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.670
was just a great interview.
It's one of those things

432
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.290
where we were both in
good moods and we both

433
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.990
had been well fed and
it was sunny outside and

434
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.330
you know, everything good. So
then we call each other

435
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.040
like little girls. It's like
Justin Bieber, excitement about, about

436
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.630
how well things went. You
know what I mean? Same

437
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.540
thing happened with the word
Cunningham interview. You remember? Oh

438
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.790
yeah. I listened to those
things. Well, you know, when

439
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.860
you called me, it was
funny, you called me and

440
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.750
I sat down and you
know, you dropped the audio

441
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.540
on Dropbox. And I sat
down and listened to it.

442
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.580
I'm like, Oh my gosh,
this is stellar. And you

443
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.030
know, the original cut was
about 35 minutes if I

444
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.720
remember. Right. And I was
just thinking, this is all

445
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.540
absolutely usable material, but I
have to edit it down

446
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.150
to meet, you know, the
overall story theme. And I

447
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.420
was just tearing myself to
pieces like, do I really

448
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.940
need to edit this? Will
we use some of it

449
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.980
later on? But that was
just brilliant. That interview was

450
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.560
just wonderful. That's a really
interesting point that you bring

451
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.020
up though. Right? I mean,
someone goes out into the

452
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.650
woods and he finds this
amazing piece of wood or

453
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.930
an old log, and then
they go back and the

454
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.540
log is beautiful, but somehow
they feel the need to

455
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.430
take away. They want to,
they want to whittle it

456
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.220
and they're questioning themselves the
whole time. You know, this

457
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.440
is a beautiful piece of
nature. It sits on itself,

458
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.330
but then it gets whittled
into something more. That, that

459
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.980
is kind of an, a
good example. I mean, we'll

460
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.110
go and we'll talk to
someone for an hour, hour

461
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:26.040
and a half, and you'll,
you'll, you'll eat 15 minutes

462
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.040
out of it, but it
does become more than, than

463
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.640
the raw It does. And
it's weird because I've thought

464
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.250
of that. Especially with this
last episode, when I put

465
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.730
in the, the mashups, because
I was sitting there thinking,

466
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.430
you know, why do I
want to do this? This

467
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.650
is just not really the
caliber of music I've put

468
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.030
in before. And not only
that, but you know, people,

469
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.370
as I mentioned have said
to us too much music,

470
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.130
and here I am putting
in more. And I thought,

471
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.560
I don't, I don't know
why. And the more I

472
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.290
would question, the more I
question, why I'm doing something,

473
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.050
the harder it is for
me to create it. So

474
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.600
I just turned off the
voice. And so then what

475
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.670
I do is I lay
down the, the music tracks

476
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.640
and then I'll go looking
for parts of Miguel's story

477
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.400
and I'll tack them together,
you know, kind of, you

478
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.140
know, things out, but there
is a voice inside my

479
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.690
head that tells me what
needs to be conveyed. And

480
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.400
then, you know, that's what
it comes down. And then

481
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.710
next thing I know I've
got, you know, 15, 20

482
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:23.200
minutes Miguel talking and it's
done One, one of the

483
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.750
things, one of the criticisms
that people have given us

484
00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.350
is that maybe the show
is more than more than

485
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.840
an homage and Amash. Is
it animals? Is it, is

486
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.060
it? I was always thinking
about this whole funny thing,

487
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.670
taking a small tangent, you
know, how people have those,

488
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.400
those verbal affectations, right? Like
there's a guy at work.

489
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.020
There's a guy at work.
He's a great guy. I

490
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.060
love everything. He says, I
talked to him, you know,

491
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.340
all the time. And then
every once in a while

492
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.940
he'll say organization, Oh dear.
And it's like a slap

493
00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.540
in the face. Yeah. And
then I wonder what's mine.

494
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.720
Well, yeah, there yet. It's
an homage, but Well, mine,

495
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.170
my, you know, my, I
have a, I have a

496
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.670
budge. I put syllables. I
emphasize the wrong thing on

497
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.030
the salon. Like, you know,
Eugene, right? Oh yeah. There's

498
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.850
a town in Oregon called
Eugene, Oregon where your brother

499
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.670
lives in, you always call
it Eugene, Eugene. And my

500
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.220
wife jumps at me because
I'll say insurance. It's like,

501
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.060
no, it's in insurance. And
I don't know where that

502
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.990
is. You know, that's funny.
I got in trouble once

503
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.490
with my wife for saying,
I think it was either

504
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:35.470
internship or internship. I don't,
I tend to this day

505
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.690
to this day, I'm not
even quite sure how to

506
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:43.480
pronounce new nuclear, nuclear pens
anymore. If you're from Texas,

507
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.730
it's nuclear, it's the rest
of the world. It's nuclear.

508
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.360
I it's. I know. So
anyway, we've been accused of

509
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.870
the show being more than
just an homage to this,

510
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.240
to this American life, but
a complete rip off. Yeah.

511
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.530
And I would, I think
my answer would be that

512
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:09.460
this American life is an
intense and pervasive inspiration for

513
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.720
the show, but I am
confident that our show has

514
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.320
and will continue to find
its own voice. What do

515
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.380
you, what do you think?
Certainly, but you have to

516
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:25.270
go farther back than just
this American life. Like if

517
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.700
you watch 48 hours or
2020, or any one of

518
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.810
those news programs, you know,
you will see the same

519
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.800
exact mechanism at work. Someone
narrating a story, it wasn't

520
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:41.020
narrating or narrating, so I'm
pretty sure. Yeah. And then,

521
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.830
and then music overlaid and
all of a sudden dramatic

522
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.670
pause. It's a really old
style tried and true way

523
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.580
of telling a story. So
at the same time, yeah,

524
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.900
we do need to find
our own voice. I feel

525
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.350
like with the last two
or three, it's just come

526
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.030
a little bit easier. Yeah.
I just don't know what

527
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.560
you're doing. The first few,
Five, six and seven w

528
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.970
the first one, I love
that. I love all the

529
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.620
shows, but five, six and
seven are really starting to

530
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.420
become into or coming into
our place. I think, which

531
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.380
makes me happy because it
is always going to seem

532
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.890
like this American life, if
you are used to multi

533
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.400
act one hour long podcast
with music and dramatic pauses.

534
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.720
But like you said, you
know, law and order is

535
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.740
the same thing. I mean,
TV shows. Yeah. It's just

536
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.880
a cinematic way of telling
a story. Someone, someone said,

537
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.710
you sounded like captain Kirk.
I know. I don't know.

538
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.410
You know, man, That awful,
the criticism is awful, but

539
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.360
you, you say, you see,
you say that you don't

540
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.620
mind Rob, but you do
mind. You feel it. It's

541
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.960
funny because you talk about,
we talk about affectations. It's

542
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.670
one of the things that,
you know, I remember going

543
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.250
to speaker training at Microsoft.
They were like, you know,

544
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.500
realize what you do over
and over again as a

545
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.310
crutch when you're speaking. And
for me, I speak too

546
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.670
fast. And as you can
hear on this podcast, so

547
00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.240
when I'm narrating, narrating, what
I tend to do is

548
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.210
slow my voice down. But
when I slow my voice

549
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.740
down, I tend to sound
dramatic and people should think

550
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.950
you're squeezing that a little
much. It's it's, it's, it's

551
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.460
part of who you are
though. It's funny. Although, pretty,

552
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.590
pretty soon, I think we'll
start hearing, we'll start hearing

553
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.800
people make fun of you.
Like, like we'll hear like,

554
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.360
cause you were trying to
make, you always try to

555
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.370
make fun of me and
any opportunity that you have.

556
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.190
I, I should, I should
open up the next episode

557
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:32.660
of let's develop his life.
I'm lob Conrad. And I

558
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.680
thought to go bump programming
today. Fantastic. That's Scott Hanselman.

559
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.130
Now Scott likes, see, I
can't do you All you

560
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.160
have to do to do
me is you say so

561
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.210
now? Or like any, anything,
and then add a comment,

562
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.340
which is like, that's right.
And now I'm picking the

563
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.300
conversation this direction or really?
Okay. So I'm going to

564
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.130
take the conversation in this
direction. That's how you make

565
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:02.360
fun of me. No, no,
no. Your applications it's true.

566
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.210
No, your expectations. And I
would also encourage people to

567
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.880
know how to pronounce words.
Oh my gosh. I was

568
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.300
listening to, Oh gosh. I've
can't remember where it was,

569
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:18.050
but the, the person narrating,
it kept saying similarly <inaudible>

570
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.950
similarly, it stopped me in
my tracks. I lost all

571
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.250
EV I mean, I couldn't
follow along anymore. I was

572
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.670
listening to another very, very
famous podcaster on the radio.

573
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:33.860
Who said it wasn't, they
didn't, they didn't say human.

574
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:39.200
There was like human, like
the human condition. Yes. That's.

575
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.750
That's not, that's not okay.
Yeah. It's amazing what comes

576
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.630
out. Like I remember, I
don't want to, Oh, it's

577
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.130
going to, I was gonna
talk about somebody. I think

578
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:53.040
the point is though that
everyone has those words, that

579
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.930
you can go 30, 40
years of your life. And

580
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.030
never really know I was
on channel nine once with

581
00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:04.470
Dan Fernandez. And I said,
trout, T H R O

582
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.730
G H it's trough like
a trough, like the Nadir

583
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.180
of a, of a curve.
And somewhere in my brain

584
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.650
for the last 30 years,
I thought that it was

585
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:18.150
pronounced to trial. And I
just never like corrected that,

586
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.670
that bite. There's no CRC
in my brain to correct

587
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.270
that. So Dan was like,
what are you saying? What

588
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:28.050
is wrong with you? I
think the embarrassed people are

589
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.410
going to have those mistakes
and that's okay on your,

590
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.350
on your show and you
shouldn't sweat it. Yup. Okay.

591
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.170
Well, you know, you try
not to, but like even

592
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:41.580
today on Twitter, someone asked
me, shouldn't it be this

593
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.330
developer life instead of the
possessive, this developers? And I

594
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.670
thought, well, that's an interesting,
interesting take. And so we

595
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:48.960
went back and forth and
next thing you know, we're

596
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.230
talking about nouns and adjectives
and verbs and you know,

597
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.290
old style naming. And it's
just funny. I mean, you

598
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.000
know, and it wasn't an
argument by any stretch, but

599
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.180
you know, as developers, we
like to be exact and

600
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.860
it didn't make sense to
him. Why we'd have the

601
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.010
possessive in the name? And
I thought, well, I guess

602
00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.500
I really don't have much
of a reason. It just

603
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.130
seemed to flow. You know?
Well, I mean, whether you

604
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.890
name it this developer life
or this developer's life, the

605
00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.870
point is we're going to
keep moving forward. We're going

606
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.960
to try to explore stories
from everybody. I think that

607
00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.410
we've, we've had a couple
of famous people on maybe

608
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.660
just because we know some
of them and they were

609
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.750
conveniently located. I think that
we should have more, not

610
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.720
famous people on. I think
that in the future we'll

611
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.750
have some spontaneous interviews. Like
when you have lunch with

612
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.680
someone and pull out your,
pull out your microphone. Yeah,

613
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.290
absolutely. And it is one
of my goals to have

614
00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:44.010
much, many more common stories,
much more relatable stories because

615
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.090
while interviewing wrestling and DHH
is fun, it's it? I

616
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.590
think to a lot of
people, it's hard to relate

617
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.340
to them yet. Their stories
were so inspirational. I just

618
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.020
felt like they had yeah,
Yeah. Out there. I think

619
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.670
that we do appreciate it.
I don't know about you.

620
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.190
I do appreciate the story
ideas. I mean, we've got

621
00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.730
at least five good story
ideas. Maybe 10 someone had

622
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:07.230
an idea called solitude about
the lone programmer. People doing

623
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.680
big stuff all by themselves.
I mean, I think you

624
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.510
would agree if someone has
a great idea for a

625
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.580
story. Tell us on Twitter
and we are keeping track.

626
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.570
Absolutely. Cool. Well, thanks Rob
for chatting with me today.

627
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.740
