9
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.960
episode, Scott talks with longtime
Microsoft developer, Larry Osterman. Hi,

10
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.700
this is Scott Hansel and
this is another episode of

11
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.050
Hansel minutes. And I'm sitting
here in building 85, 85

12
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.260
with Larry Osterman, long time
Microsoft employee. How long have

13
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.100
you been here? A bit
over 23 years. Wow. Okay.

14
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.350
Have you ever been in
this office that long? I've

15
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.400
been in this office for
about a month and a

16
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.710
half, two months? Maybe I
noticed that your name tag

17
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.360
out, for instance, a Lawrence.
I'm not sure who put

18
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.960
that up. Probably not. You,
some facilities person pulled it

19
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.670
out because that's the name
that's used on official documents.

20
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.590
And when I was hired
in here, of course you

21
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.480
use your official name, the
name that's on your social

22
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.480
security card, but there ain't
nobody. I know who calls

23
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.860
me that I was gonna
say, I was like, is

24
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.050
this the same guy? I
wasn't sure what's your, is

25
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.660
your badge number really low
that's numbers don't matter that

26
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.210
they, they don't know relationship
between badge number and employee.

27
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.650
Oh, cause I got a
low and I was like,

28
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.210
Oh, I feel special. I
have a little badge now.

29
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.060
I mean, my badge number
is got five digits and

30
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.590
it's in the mid five
digits. So it's not like

31
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.210
badge eight or something. No.
I mean, as of today

32
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.510
I have I'm number 31
in seniority in the company.

33
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.720
So I'm not sure where
that gets you. Maybe a

34
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.220
bit. Doesn't get me anything
can get in line at

35
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.310
the picnic earlier. It doesn't
get me anything. I mean,

36
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.400
I actually, I don't even,
I don't even get in

37
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.370
line in the picnic. All
I get is a, well,

38
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.660
I get a, a, I
get a little glass plaque

39
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.750
that says hi, you've been
here for a really, really

40
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.680
long time. There are people
in your group who were

41
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.480
not born when you started
working at Microsoft. Doesn't say

42
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.770
they're scary. Yeah. It's funny.
I went through a, I've

43
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.990
only been here eight weeks.
I've been in the industry

44
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.940
about 15 years, but I've
only been at Microsoft eight

45
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.100
weeks. I went through Neo
and it gave a couple

46
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.790
of interesting statistics. First one
was that 16% of the

47
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.010
company was hired in the
last year. That's Oh yeah,

48
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.620
It was, it was an
unspeakable. And then when they

49
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.420
said, how many people here
are being hired out of

50
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.850
college, like how, you know,
most of the room's hands

51
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.560
went up and I was
just like, and I was

52
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.490
feeling old. I was hired
out of college. I've never

53
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.830
worked at another company. Really?
You've had one W2 your

54
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.080
whole life. I have had
one W2. I just got

55
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.640
to make the paperwork so
much easier. Yeah. That's great.

56
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.040
Did you, now, when you
have that kind of perspective,

57
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.760
I mean, you've got 23
years here, 25, 23 years

58
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.550
in the business. Why aren't
you burned out? I mean,

59
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.590
I'm burned out. I just
don't. I just kind of

60
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.910
go, I'm going to become
a nurse. I'm going to

61
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.760
stop programming. I'm done. This
is ridiculous. Computers are stupid.

62
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.150
Don't you do that? No.
The wonderful thing about working

63
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.680
at Microsoft especially is that
there's always something cool happening.

64
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.910
There's always something really cool.
And there is no other

65
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.360
place in the world that
you can work on something

66
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.520
and have what you work
on. Touch the lives of

67
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.000
literally a billion people. I
mean, there's 800 million people, 500 million

68
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.260
people out there who are
using software that I wrote

69
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.820
the stuff I worked on
for windows Vista. There's probably

70
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.510
close to a hundred million
people using that. Now think

71
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.740
about that. That's like insane
that there's that many people

72
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.310
using. And frankly, there's a
ton of really cool things

73
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.920
that Microsoft does. It really
is. I mean, Yeah. Where

74
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.280
am I gross off? It's
both, But it's not, if

75
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.260
you, if you've got the
right attitude and it's just

76
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.890
fun. Oh, I mean, in
23 years, I've done network

77
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.230
file systems. I've done discovery
agents. I've worked on email

78
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:54.270
servers. I've worked on embedded
chips for home automation. I've

79
00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.270
done audio. I mean, video
delivery systems. I've done all

80
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.980
sorts of things. And the
really cool thing about working

81
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.170
for Microsoft is that when
you get tired of your

82
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.660
job, you don't have to
go looking for a job

83
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.630
somewhere else. You can just
find something really cool and

84
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.730
neat. That's just in the
next building over. And that's

85
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.880
just, I just love that.
No, that's, that's interesting that

86
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.800
you say that because I
mean, I'm only like two

87
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.090
months in the job. I'm
like, yeah, I don't know

88
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.080
if I'm going to do
this for the rest of

89
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.030
my life. And I said
that to someone at Microsoft,

90
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.320
I was like, Oh, that's
okay. You'll have a totally

91
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.570
different job in 18 months.
Yeah. Maybe something, I don't

92
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.200
know. I mean, the idea
that you can bounce around.

93
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.700
I mean, how do you
do that? I mean, how

94
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.690
long have you been in
the job that you've been

95
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.020
now? About five years in
my current job, I was

96
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.770
about six years in the
job. And in six years

97
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.090
in exchange, four years in
windows and T You just

98
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.480
decided it was time. And
we just said, Oh, you

99
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.120
know, I think I'm ready
to do something else Time.

100
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.450
It was time to, you
know, in exchange we shipped

101
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.540
exchange 2000 and I was
burned out and I was

102
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.520
burned out and there's no
question. I was burned out.

103
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.870
I was tired of doing
it. And I said, okay,

104
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.760
fine. I'm done I'm outta
here. And went and looked

105
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.500
for a job and found
something that was nice and

106
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.960
low stress for a couple
of years. That was that

107
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.750
embedded chip thing, which is
a very small project. It

108
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.480
was like five people working
on it. And you know,

109
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.050
when that one finally shipped,
I went looking for another

110
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.930
job. And in that case,
another job found me, which

111
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.230
was this job on the
sound team. Yes. That's a

112
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.910
good question. So what are
you working on now? You

113
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.340
are on your own 17.
What kind of things are

114
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.360
you working on? Well, our
team owns the audio infrastructure

115
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.400
for windows. And so I'm
working on stuff for the

116
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.580
next version of windows. And
unfortunately I can't say what

117
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.860
that stuff is. We can
talk about Vista. I mean,

118
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.380
it sounds to sum up,
I understand quickly changed dramatically

119
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.340
invested. Did it not. We
threw away everything above the

120
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.000
driver level and replaced it.
And we also dropped on

121
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.970
a, dropped in a new
driver model as well for

122
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.020
new drivers, but existing drivers
continue to work. We changed

123
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.570
everything else. It all used
to be running as drivers

124
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.130
in the kernel and we
moved it all up into

125
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.870
user mode. And we then
rewrote all of the API

126
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.950
APIs that work with, worked
with the old system to

127
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.140
work with the new system.
One of the things that

128
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.060
was from a user's perspective
that I found the most

129
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.820
surprising about Vista was when
I clicked on the volume

130
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.040
and I had separate volume
for each application. That was

131
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.530
mine. That was, was that
seriously? That was seriously me.

132
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.940
That was seriously me. That
was, that was my, that

133
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.010
was the thing I was
working on and had been

134
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.260
working on for the past
four years off. More or

135
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.360
less meant a lot of
other things. But my big

136
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.450
thing I'd been working on
was perhaps volume and volume

137
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.000
control in general was one
of the things that I

138
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.880
spent, you know, Oh my
God, Microsoft has some guy

139
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.290
who spent four years working
on just the volume control.

140
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.860
And he actually, he did
did Microsoft did it, it

141
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.110
turns out it turns out
actually it's a surprisingly hard

142
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.670
problem, especially per application volume
control, because what an what's

143
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.500
an application you can say,
we want per application volume

144
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.930
control. And that's a really
easy thing to say and

145
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.300
to put on a slide
<inaudible> And someone did that.

146
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.890
I assume someone had that
idea and thought it was

147
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.620
important enough for you to
spend Exactly somebody did. Somebody

148
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.440
sat down and said, we
have customers who are complaining

149
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.510
about this problem. We need
to fix it. So we're

150
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.080
going to fix it. And
we went off and said,

151
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.760
okay, well it turns out
that at the wind 32

152
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.720
level at the OSTP level,
an application is a process,

153
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.110
right? But from a customer
standpoint, that's not necessarily what

154
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.350
they see. It's probably a
task bar button. The task

155
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.590
bar button is what exactly
is what users think, but

156
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.380
a task, our button, it
turns out isn't really very,

157
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.540
there's no way of knowing.
I could have 50 task

158
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.440
bar buttons that are associated
with one process. I can't

159
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.810
differentiate it. Half of those
task bar buttons might not

160
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.840
be doing anything with audio
at all. How do I

161
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.210
tell, how do I correlate?
How do I relate those?

162
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.590
And it turns out it's
a very hard problem. Hosting

163
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.690
environment, hosting environments also cause
problems, internet Explorer is in

164
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.210
Firefox are the big ones.
These are applications that tabs.

165
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.270
For instance, if you've got
multiple tabs, you can have

166
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.420
different multimedia content playing on
each of those tabs. You

167
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.000
may not even know that
it is because there's some

168
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.970
ad that's playing an annoying
sound in the background. I

169
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.590
hate it to nothing, The
new tab. And then somebody

170
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.950
starts playing, Hey, how's it
going? Huh. And you can't

171
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.990
all tab to it because
it's behind another tab. I

172
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.390
cannot tell you how much
I despise websites that announced

173
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.770
themselves with audio. I just
find that extraordinarily annoying, but

174
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.250
those are hosted. Those are
all living within one or

175
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.970
one process. But again, to
the user there, they're different.

176
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.940
It's not just, it's not
another application cause they know

177
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.980
it's all within an Explorer,
but they want to treat

178
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.010
them differently. So it's a
very, very, very hard problem.

179
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.460
We had to make some
compromises to, to get things

180
00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:01.190
working in a way that
would make users happy. So

181
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.660
how much of that logic,
when you say it's a

182
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.370
very hard problem? I, in
my mind, I'm kind of

183
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.050
like drawing truth tables and
trying to figure out how

184
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.150
I would solve something like
that. And certainly I can't

185
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.760
solve your five-year problem and
20 seconds of thinking about

186
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.370
it. But my first impression
is, is this something that

187
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.370
is fuzzy logic? Is there
heuristics about this or is

188
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.130
it fairly, just a fairly
complicated flow chart where it's

189
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.900
like, here are all the
edge cases that we're going

190
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.090
to handle. Here are some
applications that we know that

191
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.170
are poorly behaved as far
as their, their multiple processes.

192
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.060
What the user thinks of
them as one application, are

193
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.490
there multiple tasks where buttons
mean, what kinds of hints

194
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.760
is the app giving you?
Well, the big one is

195
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.740
a process. And that's what,
what we finally decided to

196
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.670
do was to go with
the process is your natural

197
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.870
boundary. And it turns out
it's actually not that complicated

198
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.110
where we had a solution
that wasn't actually that complicated

199
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.940
when we finally got down
to it. And the challenge

200
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.490
of course is coming up
with a solution that is

201
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.490
not that complicated. You can
come up with really, really

202
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.580
complicated ones, but the simple
ones are almost always better.

203
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.160
In this case, what we
did was we defined this

204
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.670
concept of an audio session
and an audio session is

205
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.120
simply a collection of audio
streams. So when you're playing

206
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.520
audio, we generate, you generate
a stream of bits of

207
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.700
16 bit or 32 bit
or whatever it is, numbers.

208
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.840
And we aggregate each of
those streams into what we

209
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.890
call a session by default,
a process has a session

210
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.130
and it's just got a,
it has an idea of

211
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.510
zero. When you create, when
you construct an audio stream,

212
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.070
you say, you can optionally
say, I want this audio

213
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.230
stream to be in a
session with the name of

214
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:42.200
Fred you, the application developer,
get to choose a session.

215
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.690
And then from that actually
turns out almost everything else

216
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.690
falls out. The only thing
we had to add to

217
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.700
that on top of that
initial idea was the concept

218
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.900
of a cross process session.
And that's actually used for

219
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.570
the window. Sounds I don't
know if you've noticed that

220
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.120
there's one slider that's always
pinned there for windows sounds

221
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.510
right? Because my question was,
as someone might go and

222
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.940
say and explore opened each
thing in a different process,

223
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.980
a window, and you might
have multiple instances of it

224
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.400
System sounds. And actually we
enhanced the place on API.

225
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.870
The third party applications can
use this system sounds I'm

226
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.930
sorry for place on it's
the sound underscore system flag,

227
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:28.500
but system sounds basically have
a, their own session and

228
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.080
there's basically just, it's a
flag and they they're, they

229
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.170
run cross process. In that
case, the audio engine or

230
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.040
the volume control logic in
the audio engine doesn't care.

231
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.510
What process is being used
to play the audio? Again,

232
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.280
a session is a collection
of streams where those streams

233
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.330
can come from one process
from multiple processes, the engine

234
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.120
doesn't Care. Okay. So let's
say I've got windows media

235
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.610
player and that's running a,
some audio and something goes

236
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.950
wrong. The file's corrupt and
then a message box pops

237
00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.210
up and it goes Wong
that's coming from. Yeah. And

238
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.370
that would have the system
sound volume associated with it.

239
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:10.380
And that's because the message
box API calls into, through

240
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:16.830
a surprisingly complicated path, unfortunately
calls into a piece of

241
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.980
code that's running in the
system that eventually calls plays

242
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.050
out and it specifies the
sound system sound flag. So

243
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.560
we, we try to differentiate
notification sounds that the system

244
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.480
generates and audio that the
application generates. And as I

245
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.590
said, for applications that use
that have environmental effects, like

246
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.910
click navigation sounds or new
mail notifications, you can actually,

247
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.880
you can set flags basically
that you, you can, you

248
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.610
can, you can opt into
the, I really want to

249
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.290
treat this as if it
was a system sound and

250
00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:00.120
not like my sound, because
it's really an environmental part

251
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.610
of the experience. It's something
that had just, you know,

252
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.010
I'm just making clicks and
beeps or whatever it is

253
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.040
in the background. So if
the user is, if they

254
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.650
user meaning the application developer
is not setting these flags,

255
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.900
if they haven't chosen to
take advantage of these, it

256
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.420
shows up as their process.
It just goes by process.

257
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.890
And so that, that's what
makes it simple because in

258
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.290
my mind I was thinking
that you're taking all sorts

259
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:23.190
of cues about what shows
up in the volume control

260
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.170
because the window is visible
and there is a process.

261
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.710
So, you know, I can't
find out any of that

262
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.590
information. You're too deep. Aren't
you, I'm too deep in

263
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.670
the audio service. I'm completely
isolated from the user's desktop.

264
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.360
I have no knowledge and
cannot have any knowledge about

265
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.260
windows or anything like that.
That's actually because it was

266
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.320
mostly because of a security
feature that was put in

267
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.530
for windows Vista called session
zero, isolation it out. There's

268
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.740
a lot of applications that
in windows XP said, ah,

269
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.500
I'm a service, but I
can enumerate everything on the

270
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.890
user's desktop and they can,
I can, I can figure

271
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.190
out what windows servers can
interact with this service. Well,

272
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.160
it's not even that because
in, in, even if you

273
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.190
didn't have the service can
interact, you could still enumerate

274
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.730
if you were in session
zero. So if you were

275
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.090
the very first user logged
onto the machine, it worked

276
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.390
fine. And there's a lot
of applications and services that

277
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.490
figured they could do that.
And it turns out they

278
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.970
never actually really worked their
test matrix. Wasn't good enough.

279
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.450
They never tested the fast
user switching scenario cause they

280
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.840
would've discovered even under XP
that under fast user switching,

281
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.620
it just didn't work. Yeah,
well Invista, it, it turned

282
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.640
out there's this class of
security holes called shatter attacks

283
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.640
that occur when you have
a privileged service that can

284
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.030
interact with the desktop or
more importantly, a privileged service

285
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.120
that can bring up user
interface on the desktop. So

286
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.130
one of the features, one
of the security fixes that

287
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.890
went into windows Vista is
this concept that we call

288
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:03.260
sessions or isolation. And basically
all services are isolated away

289
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.440
from the desktop and they
have no ability to interact

290
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.020
with the desktop. That way
when the user is sitting

291
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:14.450
there, that it completely neutered
that entire class of vulnerabilities,

292
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.930
you simply can't have a
shatter attack in windows Vista

293
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.290
because it's just gone stuffs
the vector that was used

294
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.110
to make that attack is
gone. So if someone upgrades,

295
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.910
someone had one of these
evil things in their system

296
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.950
and upgraded to Vista, that
that thing is ultimately just

297
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.960
neutered. It may be on
the system, but it's can't

298
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.810
do anything. Yeah. And it's
not an evil thing, actually.

299
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.990
It's very clear. It's not
an evil thing to do

300
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.260
this. It's just something that
a programmer took a shortcut

301
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.350
that he really shouldn't have
there, but they're not evil

302
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.210
hapless. They're not evil. But
the problem is is that

303
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.050
their code sometimes has bugs
in it. And that's where

304
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.830
the problem came from. And
that the original shatter attack

305
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.010
was because there was a
bug in some code and

306
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.830
it was an iOS bug
if I remember correctly, but

307
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.290
that was a, there was
a bug in some code

308
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.880
and you could use this
vulnerable, this, this vulnerability, this

309
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.730
class of attacks to exploit
and to own a person's

310
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:12.320
machine. These apps have bugs
in them sometimes. And it's

311
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.590
unfortunately the nature and they
would pop up their UI.

312
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.460
And all of a sudden
the bad guy could take

313
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.210
advantage of that. One of
the particular cases I remember

314
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.300
there was an antivirus application.
So you put a virus

315
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.210
on your machine, the antivirus
scanner says, you have a

316
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.030
virus on your machine. And
the virus says, Oh, look,

317
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.140
the antivirus program just popped
up. And then they exploited

318
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.360
a vulnerability in the antivirus
program. And I have no

319
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.180
idea which one it is.
I opened up the portal

320
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.830
and the thing jumps through
and they jumped through it.

321
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.830
And then the virus just
jumped through and it's pretty

322
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:51.060
clever. I, at my heart,
I'm a security nutcase. I'm

323
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.480
a security geek. That's my
that's. My passion is security

324
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.170
and the NPR and the
ma the mechanisms around security

325
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.880
and stuff like that. And
I have a huge, huge,

326
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.940
huge amount of respect for
the engine nuity of the

327
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:12.000
people who do security research
and who find vulnerabilities and

328
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.290
the techniques that they use.
Because while many of the

329
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.410
people who use the technology
and the techniques that they,

330
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.390
these guys were doing, the
researchers have less than superior

331
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.190
skills. Many of the people
who are actually designing the

332
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:32.220
stuff or the pejorative phrases,
script kiddies, they're just taking

333
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.070
work. Somebody else did and
building on it. But the

334
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.260
people who actually do the
real research, I have a

335
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.750
lot of respect for these
guys because what they're doing

336
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.880
is really hard. It takes
a specialized skillset. And a

337
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.470
lot of times some of
the stuff that they're finding

338
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.750
and that they turn into
viable weaponized, payload, or payload

339
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.020
that can actually be used
to reliably. It takes lot

340
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.750
of work and a lot
of time and practice and

341
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.110
patience to find some of
these things. And that's just

342
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.910
cool Watching this dance between
the iPhone and the people

343
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.730
who want to release the
iPhone is unreal. It's like

344
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.430
I watch, I look at
N gadget yesterday, new iPhone

345
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.860
update everything's back the way
it was. We're all shut

346
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.430
out. 20 minutes later, we're
back. It's exactly right. If

347
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.250
you open a TIF file
inside of the browser, then

348
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.750
we're back and then they
get it down to the

349
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.640
point where it's a webpage.
They got it down to

350
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.260
the point where you could
actually just visit a web

351
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.470
page. And I mean, think
of the, I mean, I

352
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.090
always, I always have this
image in my mind that

353
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.680
I know that we've got
a bigger international audience, so

354
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.780
forgiving, but I always imagine
this 17 year old Danish

355
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.860
kid, you know, who's off
somewhere solving this problem. And

356
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.740
they have just the patience
of job to keep poking

357
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.140
bits out, into space and
then do a jump and

358
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.480
see if that is a
place to That is what

359
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.760
they that's exactly what they
do. And some of these

360
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.250
guys, I mean, some of
these guys are really, really

361
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:54.650
sophisticated. There was a talk
I attended last year and

362
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.780
the presenter of the talk
commented. This was about hardware

363
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:06.950
encryption. So it explicitly was
about hacking game consoles. And

364
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.320
one of the guys was
commenting. So, you know, one

365
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.960
of the things people don't
understand is some of us

366
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.410
have like scanning electron microscopes
in our living room. And

367
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.300
he puts up a slide
that has a picture of

368
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.780
his living room. And darn
if there isn't a scanning

369
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:27.980
electron microscope next to his
couch, and he uses that

370
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.790
he sands off the epoxy
on the top of the

371
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.550
chips of the things he's
trying to hack. And he

372
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.840
uses this electron microscope to
read the internal circuitry, to

373
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.750
find out what it does.
How do they, the thing

374
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.290
that blows me away is
it Learn that. And as,

375
00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.280
and I know I saying
that I'm an old timer,

376
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.020
and I just am saying
that when you have five

377
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.790
years, 10 years, you get
these different milestones in your

378
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.400
career, you kind of go,
wow, it's taken the sum

379
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.780
total of all these years
for me to get to

380
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.290
this point. And then you
meet someone who's 22, who

381
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.830
has surpassed you, how do
you, if they don't teach

382
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.110
it in school, how do
you pick up, you know,

383
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.320
25 years of security experience
in four and four years,

384
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.360
and then with a scan
electronic Microsoft break into a

385
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.240
console, I just, the acceleration
of the speed at which

386
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.450
they can absorb that is
unbelievable. Well, I don't know

387
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.430
a lot of it frankly
is cause, cause cause kids

388
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.000
start earlier the technology, I
mean, when I was starting

389
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.720
back in the dark ages,
I mean, you were lucky

390
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.670
if you had an Apple
two in your house, you

391
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:32.280
know, an Apple two or
a TRSA registered shady. You

392
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.870
were lucky. I mean, it
was a big deal. It

393
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.580
was a guy in, down
the hall from me in

394
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.210
the dorms at college who
had a TRS 80 and

395
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.020
we would wander by cause
he was like, he was

396
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.720
cool. He had a computer
in his office when I

397
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.310
started, we were in the
big iron age, you know?

398
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.260
And what that meant was
that, you know, when I

399
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.090
got to high school, I
got a chance to do

400
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.230
time sharing on a real
computer, but no had no

401
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:56.910
other experience. And it was
somebody else's computer. We broken

402
00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.300
into that one very quickly.
That was a computer that

403
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.030
had, was secure in name
only. We didn't take us

404
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.520
very long to find holes
in it, but it was

405
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.230
not that I'm a hacker
at all. It's just, and

406
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.220
I have actually no skills
in that area. It's just,

407
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.820
this was so easy. It
was. But back in the

408
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:19.290
late seventies, early eighties, we
didn't care. Nobody cared nowadays.

409
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:24.000
Of course it's scary. And
I was actually, I was

410
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.240
reading cliff Stolz Cuckoo's egg,
which for some reason I'd

411
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.980
never read. I was reading
that a couple months ago.

412
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.120
And he's reading about how
he's writing, about how the

413
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.590
hackers are taking, copying our
password files. And it doesn't

414
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.960
make any sense that they'd
be CA caking our password

415
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.930
files because you can't do
anything with a password file

416
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.630
because the passwords are encrypted
in the file. And it

417
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.820
doesn't do you any good
to have the file to

418
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.010
do it? Cause you can't
do anything. And I'm like,

419
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.510
I'm reading this. And I
was going to my head.

420
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:56.730
It's like, no, no, no.
There are mounting offline dictionary

421
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.190
attack against your password file
because you can do this.

422
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.730
No, no, no. Can't you
see that? And of course

423
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.060
he couldn't because back in
1984, when this happened, nobody

424
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.140
had thought about offline dictionary
attacks or at least it

425
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.450
wasn't a wasn't that something
that people were really thinking

426
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.670
about Well, and not even
offline dictionary texts with this

427
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.820
rainbow hash thing, basically what
people are doing is they're

428
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.040
taking kind of this, you
know, the sum total of

429
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.370
all words that could ever
exist plus numbers plus, and

430
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.810
they'll make 16, 17 gig
files using old land manager

431
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.020
hashes from years ago and
they'll just scan through it

432
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.700
and they'll go, they'll go
backwards from the hash to

433
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.070
the password. Absolutely. That's why
land man just turned off.

434
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.320
And that's why land managers
talk to her, not by

435
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.760
fault in Vista because, and
I'm so happy that it's

436
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.970
finally off in Vista because
we, we made some real

437
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.490
serious mistakes back in the
1980s. And this is, these

438
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.240
are mistakes that were made
in the eighties when it

439
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:03.410
wasn't so insanely critical to
get it right. And I

440
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:08.180
don't think anybody really fully
understood at that time, just

441
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.870
how hard it is to
get security, right? And more

442
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:17.360
importantly, how easy it is
to make mistakes insecure by

443
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.570
default as well. It's not
just that it turns out

444
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.140
it with a, with a,
with a set of relatively

445
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.950
reasonable things. You can actually
make a fairly robust system

446
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.580
and you validate your inputs
always stay away from the

447
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.130
unsafe API calls. There's a,
there's a couple of really

448
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.130
mechanical things that you can
do that are actually do

449
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.890
a pretty good job of
that. But it's when you

450
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.980
start saying, Oh, I'm going
to design an authentication system.

451
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.580
Well, I'm going to design
it, authentications that that's actually

452
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.650
hard. And it turns out
if you don't actually talk

453
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.800
to people who have done
this in the past to

454
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.860
design these for a living,
you're going to get it

455
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.150
wrong. And it, we see
this time and time and

456
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.350
time again because people try,
they, they build their own

457
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:14.240
encryption algorithms and they try
them and they don't work.

458
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.240
And I can't break my
own encryption algorithm. You see

459
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.510
people post this regularly. I
come up with a new

460
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.700
unbreakable encryption algorithm, Making sure
I'm making sure where keys.

461
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.830
I made a little application
in the nineties for the

462
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.500
Palm pilot to manage blood
sugar. And I rather than

463
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.380
buying, paying the $50 to
buy a license manager for

464
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.650
my shareware keys, I invented
an algorithm. And I mean,

465
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.350
this was a niche within
a niche within a niche

466
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.750
because we're talking about type
one diabetics with Palm pilots

467
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.200
who are geeks. So six
people cared about this application

468
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.380
and there was an exploit
and a crack within a

469
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.120
week. Yeah. I'm not surprised.
Yeah. It's very, very, very,

470
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.820
very hard to get that.
Right. And which is why,

471
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.150
you know, one of the
things that Michael Howard, Dave LeBlanc

472
00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.850
and their writing, so your
code book, they're basically comedies

473
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.780
whenever you get the urge
to design your own, cryptosystem

474
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:09.010
resist. It just, just don't
do it. It's just not

475
00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.160
worth the effort because you're
going to get it wrong.

476
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.730
Unless you're like one of
the 20 or 30 people

477
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:21.040
in the world who are
capable of designing encryption systems,

478
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.430
the same is true of
authentication systems when we rolled

479
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.400
our own on some stuff
back in the eighties. And

480
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:33.310
we're only now getting, we're
only now able to cut

481
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.120
the cord on this. And
I'm just really, really, really,

482
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.530
really happy that those systems
that we deployed back in

483
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.090
the eighties have now finally
upgraded. Most people have gotten

484
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.350
rid of their windows, 95
Lucerne. Our cups are corporate

485
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.260
customers and have gotten who,
the ones who care about

486
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.140
these passwords and stuff like
that. Most of them have

487
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.960
gotten rid of their windows,
95 machines. They're now finally

488
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.310
moving to operating systems clients
that can actually be secured

489
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.450
and that have the ability
to be secure. So for

490
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.190
those listeners that don't have
the context we talked to

491
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.770
talked about land manager briefly,
and there's a number of

492
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.200
DLLs in our LM, this
and that. I mean, you'll

493
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.450
find those keys in windows,
but people may not necessarily

494
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.220
have an understanding of that
history. I mean, what is,

495
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.930
what does that, and how
did it, why is it

496
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.900
still with us? When I
started at Microsoft, we were

497
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:27.380
just shipping dos 3.1, which
was for the PCAT. And

498
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.760
the IBM had come up
with a product called the

499
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.960
PC land program, which was
basically our very first networking

500
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.730
client. We shipped a server,
an IBM ship to server

501
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.060
for this. And this was
the ms. Net product. Its

502
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.670
replacement was a product called
land manager, which shipped sometime

503
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:51.050
in the 1980s and was
moderately successful. It was a

504
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.320
competitor to the network product
that Novell had produced. And

505
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.900
that was wildly successful. As
I said, there were some

506
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.890
deficiencies in the authentication algorithms,
some really serious ones in

507
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:11.210
the authentication algorithm that were
identified after we shipped moving

508
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.960
forward. <inaudible> we produced a
product for OSU called land

509
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.350
manager, actually worked on that
product. And I ran it

510
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.180
for years. I was, I
was, I actually never was

511
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.880
on iOS two. I was
on, I was on the

512
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.980
predecessor product T O S
T. That's what I was

513
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:32.450
started. I worked on when
I started and I worked

514
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:37.820
on and I'm ended up
moving, saying on that project

515
00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.780
while we end of life,
that basically we, we, we

516
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.750
satisfied some corporate customer requirements
that we had contracts with

517
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.680
customers who had to deliver.
And, but I moved off

518
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.250
that onto the land manager
project, which was, it was

519
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:54.500
a product for us to
a network printer. That's actually

520
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.480
where the land manager password
security was, was created and

521
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.100
was, was rolled out. First.
We carried that on through

522
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:08.390
to NT and within two,
three, one and three five,

523
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.350
and all of our networking
products had support for this

524
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.230
NTLM style authentication, which is
the citizens land manager of

525
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.300
the day. So we say,
so people who are out

526
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.220
there and maybe people who
have just begun, you know,

527
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.460
when they say NTLM, they
don't really know what they

528
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.710
did, they just it's an
acronym, but it means new

529
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.530
technology or what does it
say? Windows NT, land manager.

530
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.480
And we had at some
point the networking stuff inside

531
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.060
of windows and T was
called and land manager, friend

532
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.950
T or something. Right. But
now when we think about

533
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.740
windows authentication and we may
refer to it as NTLM,

534
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.700
if we're talking to Vista
machines or newer machines, we

535
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.160
may refer to it colloquially
as NTLM, but it's not

536
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:51.360
using anything with these exploits
anymore. Oh, let me keep

537
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.810
on going. Sorry. NTLM V
one had some very severe

538
00:29:54.810 --> 00:30:00.180
problems sometime. And I don't
exactly remember where we rolled

539
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.120
out a version two clients
from before that timeframe, which

540
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.920
unfortunately includes windows 95, had
you all use this older

541
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:18.090
weaker land manager, 1.0 authentication.
And we've had, we've been

542
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.220
trying over the years to,
to, to weed those clients

543
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:25.470
out and not support it.
And with mixed results. Finally,

544
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.470
now all of those old
clients are gone and when

545
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:30.690
windows Vista, we finally cut
the cord and said, okay,

546
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:36.240
we will no longer support
this older, old authentication mechanism.

547
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.240
And what that means is
that windows 95 clients, which

548
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.540
still use the weaker authentication
will no longer be supported.

549
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.220
They can no longer inter-operate
or connect to NT machines

550
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.740
using the poor authentication mechanism.
They have to use some

551
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:55.650
other mechanism. Then the term
NTLM, it kind of lives

552
00:30:55.650 --> 00:31:02.370
on to just mean windows
authentication, Sort of, yes, there

553
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.360
are two styles of windows
authentication right now. There is

554
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.140
NTLM, which is this NTLM
Vitu protocol. And then there

555
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:15.960
is Kerberos, which was introduced
with windows 2000. Most of

556
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.560
the time when you're talking
from a domain joined windows,

557
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.460
computer, that's running windows 2000
or greater to another domain,

558
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.300
join windows 2000 computer or,
or later you're using the

559
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:31.350
Kerberos authentication mechanism to do,
to authenticate between the two

560
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.440
and Kerberos. It turns out
is a very high quality

561
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:40.740
peer reviewed industrial strength authentication
system developed at MIT that

562
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.250
we've adopted as our peer
to peer authentication. And it's

563
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:48.210
actually very good. Very high
quality is resistant to a

564
00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:52.200
huge variety of security attacks
that the older protocol, the

565
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.250
older NTLM protocol is not
cannot is vulnerable to is

566
00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:01.410
a really much better solution.
We still support NTLM for

567
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.710
non domain joined machines. So
if you are not a

568
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.810
member of the domain, and
you're trying to talk from

569
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.990
one computer to another, when
you're talking on your home,

570
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.050
for instance, then we're going
to use the NTLM authentication

571
00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:17.070
mechanism because Kerberos requires a
domain. So this might be

572
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.100
an odd question and an
odd tangent, but at home

573
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.990
I run a work group.
So I've got a server.

574
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.270
I think it's a windows
home server or whatever. And

575
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.310
in order to be able
to access shares, I have

576
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.430
to have another user. I
make local to that machine

577
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.580
with the same name and
the same password. And I

578
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.500
have to keep those passwords
kind of in sync manually.

579
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.750
The wife doesn't know that
this happens. So when she

580
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.340
goes and she says, whack,
whack server, how, how is

581
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.980
that working? I mean, how,
how has that hash lining

582
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.660
up correctly? And I'm not,
you know, I don't know

583
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.880
if I'm using the right
terms, but how is she

584
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.670
able to just seamlessly get
access to that machine by

585
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.830
virtue of the fact that
I've put the same passage

586
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:56.800
on the same machine, Because
there are three pieces to

587
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.270
your password, okay, there's your
domain, your username and the

588
00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.460
password. There's the three things
that are used to authenticate

589
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.610
you to determine who you
are when you're a member

590
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.010
of a work group, when
you're not a member of

591
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:15.220
a domain, your domain is
the machine upon what you've

592
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.610
been logged on, But not
the work group, not, Not

593
00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.460
the work group. Okay. When
you go to contact another

594
00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.690
machine in the work group,
it tries using the username

595
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.570
domain and password. And as
I understand it, and I

596
00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.360
may be slightly wrong on
this, but on a non

597
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.390
domain joined machine, what the
system does is it first

598
00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.230
tries to authenticate you using
the domain user and password.

599
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.630
If that fails, it says,
Oh, I'm going to throw

600
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.420
away the domain park. Since
I'm not in a domain,

601
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.850
I'm just going to try
the username and password. And

602
00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.320
I'm going to look it
up again in my local

603
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.250
database. So when your wife
connects or when you connect,

604
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.070
you're accessing the machine and
it comes in and says,

605
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.270
hi, I'm on, you know,
the kitchen, computer and accident

606
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:01.510
server. And so you get
kitchen Scott and Scott's password

607
00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.050
that doesn't work. So the
server then says, Oh, okay,

608
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.540
well, how about I just
try the server and Scott

609
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.940
and Scott's password. And that
works. And that's how it

610
00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.490
lets you in. And that's
where that, and that's that

611
00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:18.340
NTLM V2 that's done using
the NTLM. Yes, that's done

612
00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.410
using the NTLM Vitu. So
then that sounds like a,

613
00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:22.630
probably a good reason to
be, yeah. Maybe close enough.

614
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.250
I mean, I know where
we can't go into the

615
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.620
tech incredibly technical details, but
the general idea that would

616
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.840
be that it would be
a lot more secure, a

617
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.350
lot more secure leads you
to manage centrally located. If

618
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.080
I just put a domain
in my house, Which has

619
00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.510
its own set of issues.
Yeah, exactly. Okay. Putting a

620
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.330
domain in your house has
its own set of things

621
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.250
that come along with them.
Domains tend to be a

622
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.300
little bit higher maintenance for
most home users, myself included.

623
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.500
It's not worth the effort.
The added security I get

624
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.590
is not worth the cost
of that. The added security

625
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.140
I get from rolling out
a windows 2000 or Vista

626
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:04.630
server, 2003, whatever vis server
in my house, the added

627
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.630
security I get, as far
as using Kerberos inside my

628
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:12.580
house is not sufficient. In
my opinion, personally, as to

629
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.430
justify that other people may
have others. Now, there may

630
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:19.060
be other reasons why you
want to deploy small business

631
00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.610
server in your house. You
know, you may want to

632
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.250
deploy some, all business server,
cause you want to do

633
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.440
email management and you want
to run a web server

634
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.420
out of your house or
something like that. And you

635
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.540
know, that, that might make
some sense. And that I

636
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.250
certainly know a lot of
people who have done that

637
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:39.930
and you get, but I
wouldn't actually deploy 2003 or

638
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.810
2008 or whatever. Yeah. Just
for the security, because the

639
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.600
kind of attacks that I'm
talking about that the current

640
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.090
clients are vulnerable to don't
typically involve home scenarios. They

641
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.220
can theoretically, and there's absolutely
are potential issues there. And

642
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.340
I don't want to, but
I don't see that being

643
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.480
an issue for most customers
Years and years ago when,

644
00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.570
when Comcast cable first came
out and they didn't partition

645
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.360
things where you could actually
go into the work in

646
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.660
the network neighborhood and see
your neighbor, I used to

647
00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.710
connect to their printer and
just print out messages. So

648
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.080
they would show up and
they'd have, hi, it's your

649
00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.820
neighbor. You might want to
think about putting a password

650
00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.770
on your printer. Yeah, well
that's cause they print that's

651
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.440
cause they were, they, they
left, they left to go.

652
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.930
They, they left the guest
account open and well yeah.

653
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:31.060
What do you know? Yeah.
It's there are yeah, there

654
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.920
certainly are. Yeah. Yeah. One
last question I wanted to

655
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.600
ask you that I thought
that was really, really interesting

656
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.830
on your blog. I know
that you've got to get

657
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:40.910
going is that you had
a really great post talking

658
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.970
about threat modeling and you
did threatening a specific API.

659
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.370
You basically took One thing.
I was play sound. Yep.

660
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.220
Model the hell out of
it. And I assume that

661
00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.680
you do that with any
public API has to be

662
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.770
given this kind of a
treatment. My job as I,

663
00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.650
whenever anybody asks, what do
you do? My answer is

664
00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.930
I'm the guy who makes
windows go ding. It's one

665
00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.550
of the reasons why I
really like this job is

666
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.220
because I could finally have
an I can, I can

667
00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.300
explain my job in like
five words. It's great. Yeah.

668
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.370
So I used the place
on API, which is what

669
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:13.550
makes the ding and I,
that I own let sit

670
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.650
among other things, but I
own that API is one

671
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.950
of the things. So I
chose that because it's an

672
00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:24.320
API that has where there's
complexity associated with it. But

673
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.440
it's simple enough that I
can re I can do

674
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.760
a complete threat model for
it in a blog post.

675
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.490
Cause I try to keep
my blog posts to around

676
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.180
500, 800 words. And really,
I didn't realize you put

677
00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.060
that thought into it. Yeah.
Hmm. Yeah. This is the,

678
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:42.860
yeah, I do. And I
try to keep it in

679
00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.050
that range. I can write
volumes, but frankly it takes

680
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:46.610
a lot of time. The
more you write, the more

681
00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:50.060
it takes time. It takes.
And I do this in

682
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.480
my spare time. So I
don't tend to, I can't

683
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.180
devote huge amounts of time
to it. So I want

684
00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.320
to be able to have
something I could do in,

685
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.620
in smaller chunks. Frankly. I
think people get fatigued when

686
00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.380
they try to read really,
really long things. They, your

687
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.510
eyes glaze over and you
start going to textbook mode

688
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.120
and you just sort of
look for the highlights. So

689
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.060
I wanted something small that
could work and that, that

690
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.190
actually had some real threats
that would have to be

691
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:17.450
mitigated. So that was why
I chose that Play sound

692
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.370
threat. I mean, if I'm
gonna attack, play sound, what

693
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.650
would I have tried? And
what would fail? Ah, well,

694
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.900
play sound plays a file.
It plays a wave file.

695
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:26.120
Okay. We were talking and
you had actually just made

696
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.790
a post in your blog
post about recovering a corrupted

697
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:33.080
wave file. Okay. Well guess
what? Corrupted wave files are

698
00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.890
a really good way to
attack play sound. If you

699
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.880
wanted to attack place on
place out as a Phi

700
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.410
is an API that opens
a file parses. The contents

701
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.680
of that file reads the
contents of that file based

702
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.510
on some of the information
that was parched from it,

703
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.450
and then hands it to
some other API APIs to

704
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.970
play. That's a lot of
input you're taking. There's a

705
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.770
lot of input. There's a
lot of data that has

706
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.470
to be parsed in that
if that data isn't parsed

707
00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:01.210
correctly, bad things can happen.
It also has modes where

708
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:04.750
it will take a location
in memory again, parse it.

709
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.970
So the, there are lots
of inputs to this API.

710
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:13.540
There's the file name itself.
I'd start handing in really

711
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.480
long file names. See whether
you can, you can trip

712
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.130
a buffer overflow based on
the file name. That's harder

713
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.580
to disassembly bake exploitable, but
maybe you could do something

714
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.740
with the filing. Maybe you
could do something with the

715
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.460
file contents. If you have
the ability to write to

716
00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.630
the registry place on API
can write, can read from

717
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:36.910
the user's registry. So if
you've got some software running

718
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.500
on the user's account, maybe
you could find a way

719
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.220
to cause some problems play
sound by manipulating the registry.

720
00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.550
Now that's less useful in
terms of as a way

721
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.120
of attacking the system because
the place on API itself,

722
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.090
it turns out it runs
in the context of the

723
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.720
user. There's no networking interaction.
Part of the moving of

724
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.420
things out from the place
has always been, it's always

725
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.540
been up there. Okay. So
please sound's always been up

726
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.130
there in user mode. It's
always been living in the

727
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.200
cottage. So there's really not
a lot in terms of

728
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.960
like cracking the system wide
open that you can do

729
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.400
with the place on API,
but maybe, maybe you're a

730
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.130
bad guy and you can
figure out a way to

731
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:19.480
get a file into the
user's hard disk. And then

732
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.230
maybe you can find a
program that will play that

733
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:28.090
file. So let's imagine a
hypothetical web browser. And I

734
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:29.650
don't actually know, I don't
believe that there are any

735
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.410
web browsers that do this,
but let's imagine a hypothetical

736
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:35.380
web browser. And somebody says,
Oh, I want to implement

737
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.190
the BG sound HTML tag,
which basically takes away file.

738
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.760
So it takes a path
to a wave file and

739
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.910
plays that. That's how, how
that stupid, annoying background sound

740
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.790
we talked about gets played,
or one of the ways

741
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:55.210
it gets played. I'm going
to put exploit code into,

742
00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.800
I find I can exploit
place on and I've got

743
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.200
a browser that's gonna call
place out. I'm gonna put

744
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.590
exploit code into my wave
file. That will crack play

745
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.470
sound. Now what's the browser
going to do? The browser

746
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.900
is going to open look
at the file URL. It's

747
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.450
going to take that URL
off of my server. It's

748
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:14.500
going to copy that file
to the user's local hard

749
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.960
dive. And then the browser
is going to call, play

750
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:20.020
sound with the contents of
that file. Well, I have

751
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.750
two possible ways I can
trick place that the, the

752
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.570
browser first off I could
pass a really, really long

753
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.960
founding. Maybe the browser puts
it into the local cache,

754
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.120
but keeps the name, the
last portion of the file

755
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.970
name. So maybe I could
convince this non-existent browser to

756
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.930
use that. Or maybe if
I can find a file

757
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:42.950
format vulnerability, I can click
that browser to cause play

758
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.070
sound to read that file.
And if the, I can

759
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.260
cause browser to read that
file. Now, all of a

760
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.950
sudden I might be able
to get code running in

761
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.610
the context of the currently
logged on user. So I've

762
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:59.720
now elevated my privileges from
anonymous, which is the internet

763
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:05.240
to running as the user.
Now you could say, well,

764
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.880
it's the fault of the
browser? The browser should be

765
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.600
checking that well, how does
the browser know that there's

766
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.180
this vulnerable code living underneath
it? It's just calling the

767
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.330
system API. It's not, it's
not doing anything that it

768
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.630
sees as being anything particularly
wrong. And, and I agree,

769
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.350
and the fiction should not
be in the browser. The,

770
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.870
the bug is that the
low level API, if you

771
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:30.590
have somebody who's calling it
unexpectedly on behalf of input

772
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.190
from an anonymous source, you
could have a problem. And

773
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.410
that's why it's important to
do everything. And in fact,

774
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:42.230
part of the SDL security
development life cycle process includes

775
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:47.120
threat modeling every single feature
in the system and that

776
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.860
not necessarily every API is
threat model, but certainly every

777
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.280
feature, every component in the
system and for windows Vista,

778
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.710
we went through and we
put, we did threat models

779
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:01.280
for a ton of the
pieces of the operating system.

780
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.720
We actually did a lot
of work And I assumed

781
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.310
it while you were doing
it. You learned stuff. I

782
00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:09.010
mean, you didn't do it
to validate that, Hey, we're

783
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.620
awesome. Look at secure, but
you probably discovered all sorts

784
00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.810
of interesting things. We discovered
all sorts of interesting threats

785
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:18.010
and also of sorts of
interesting things. Actually there there's

786
00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:24.130
currently a disputed threat or
associated with speech recognition. This

787
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:28.750
made a big splash back
in January. I believe somebody,

788
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.880
I think it may have
been George oo ZD net

789
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:36.370
blogger noticed that if he
turned on speech recognition and

790
00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:39.490
played back a wave file
that he had recorded with

791
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:44.290
the windows recorder that he
could cause the wave file

792
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.490
to convince speech recognition, to
take actions on his behalf.

793
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.420
Okay. I mean, that's really
clever. I think it's a

794
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.440
bad idea at some point,
But it's a, it's a

795
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.720
threat. There's a, there is
a threat. Yeah. I suppose

796
00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.100
if I held a cell
phone up to it, I

797
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.990
could probably have people on
the cell phone till my

798
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:05.940
computer, The common vulnerabilities database,
the CVE people that sort

799
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.520
a clearing house for data
vault for vulnerabilities, the CVE

800
00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.860
people call, they believe that
this is a vulnerability in

801
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:15.490
windows Vista, Microsoft disputes. This
Microsoft believes that this is

802
00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:19.660
a Microsoft MSRP. People have
looked at it and they've

803
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:25.870
said, I don't know about
how important this is. Does

804
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.490
that mean I can run
down the halls of Microsoft

805
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.260
here in start yelling format
C colon as I run

806
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.800
by someone's office. In fact,
and if in fact they

807
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.070
were running Speech recognition, it's
possible that if your speech

808
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.890
recognition was trained, to be
able to recognize your voice,

809
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.510
you could in fact cause
problems. And so that's why

810
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:45.030
I said it's disputed. There
are different people who believe

811
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.600
differently. This, we actually found
this as part of our

812
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.520
threat modeling process. This was
one of the threats that

813
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.250
we covered that we, we
said, Oh, somebody could use

814
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.340
speech recognition. And in the
case of the audio team,

815
00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.180
we said, Oh well, you're
right. We could, but that's

816
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.030
out of scope for the
audio team. And then we

817
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.910
sent them out to the
speech guys saying, Hey, by

818
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.850
the way, this is a
theoretical issue. They made a

819
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:13.620
decision like you did that.
You know, we've got a

820
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.240
lot of work to do.
And the reality is, is

821
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.200
that the severity of this
particular phone bill, and that

822
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.510
is something you have to
understand is that security is

823
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:27.360
a continuum for every, you
can't fix every, they are

824
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.360
going to hate me for
saying this. The security guys

825
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.150
are gonna hate me for
saying this, but it's a

826
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.880
continuum. Okay? There is no
such thing as perfect security.

827
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:39.360
You can be completely insecure
that, that there is totally

828
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.730
clarity, but there is no
such thing as perfect security.

829
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.970
It is a continuum. And
at some point when it

830
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.360
comes time to when you're
in the business of shipping

831
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.440
products, at some point, you
need to say, okay, we

832
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.210
have to ship. We have
to make a decision that

833
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.140
align where below this line,
we're not going to fix

834
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:01.170
it. And above this line,
we are, you classify your,

835
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.710
your threats, according to the
amount of damage that can

836
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.140
be caused, the likelihood that
they can happen. And you

837
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.410
make decisions about what fit,
what what's feature, what bugs

838
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.020
you fix, what bugs you
don't fix. You know, every

839
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.340
bug that we know that
could give an attacker, the

840
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:22.050
ability to completely take over
the machine where we're probably

841
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:25.500
going to fix those things
that could cause an attacker

842
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.420
to do something bad. Yeah.
Some Microsoft guy told me

843
00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.400
that the bug level was
set at the killer kitten

844
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.310
level so that if the,
if the bug potentially kill

845
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.880
a kitten, then they would
fix that. Otherwise I think

846
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.990
they're both slightly lower, considerably
lower than that. It's a

847
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.180
lot lower than kill a
kitten cause nobody wants to

848
00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:48.380
kill kittens, but you do
have to make choices. And

849
00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.050
you are always making choices.
Every time a bug is

850
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:55.010
submitted, whether it's internal or
external, every time a bug

851
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.830
is submitted, a team looks
at the bug and they

852
00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:00.410
say, okay, yes, we're fixing
it. No, we're not fixing

853
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:04.370
it. This is the nature
of software development. Every bug

854
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.190
look gets looked at. Every
bug gets a judgment call

855
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:09.470
made on it. Now the
majority of the bugs that

856
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:12.950
fit that gets submitted get
fixed really is true on

857
00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.260
you may not believe it,
but it's true. The most,

858
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:19.070
most of the bugs do
get fixed. We're going to

859
00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:20.270
do it. We're going to
take care of most of

860
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:24.380
them, but sometimes bugs come
in where it's not as

861
00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.480
clear. And it's not as
obvious, especially when you get

862
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.860
really close to shipping. Cause
the closer you get to

863
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:35.500
shipping, there's actually risks associated
with every change. Every chain

864
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.430
time you change, the source
code has the possibility of

865
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:42.010
introducing new bugs. So as
you get closer to shipping

866
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.210
the level, the bar for
opening for meeting new bugs

867
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.800
gets really, really high and
fixing the bug could introduce

868
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.110
an even worse bug cause
fixing the bug can. And

869
00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:57.910
we have seen this happen.
We've had bugs taken very

870
00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:00.550
late in the game that
have caused that have had

871
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.960
to be fixed one, two,
three, four times. Because every

872
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.940
time you change the code,
every single time you change

873
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.850
it, you, you open the
possibility of doing it, you

874
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.910
know? And at some point
the fall the bar becomes,

875
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:16.300
you know, okay, would we
issue an MSRP bulletin for

876
00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.390
this bug? And if the
answer is yes, by the

877
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.320
way, then almost to the
day we ship, if something

878
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.260
comes in, that is an,
is a, we think the

879
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:29.080
SSRC would issue a bulletin
on this problem. If it

880
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.970
were, we'll take that fix.
And if we're, you know,

881
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:37.660
like hours away and something
like that comes in, yeah,

882
00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.600
we'll probably ship with it,
but we'll make darn sure

883
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.400
that by the time our
customers get their hands on

884
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.530
it, the fix is available
so that their exposure is

885
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.100
as minimal as humanly possible.
I don't think that's ever

886
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.730
actually happened where we've had
something come in that close

887
00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.130
to shipping. So we've never
actually had to do this,

888
00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.970
but you know, we're going
to do the right thing.

889
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.770
We're going to do the
right thing by our customers.

890
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.680
We're just going to, which
is to make as sure

891
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.730
as we can that, you
know, they're safe. That's that's

892
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.000
job one. That's why that's
actually why I get so

893
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.240
passionate. And so nutty about
this stuff is that, you

894
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.060
know, it's so important to
get this stuff right. And

895
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.960
it's the, the good news
is you can get to

896
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.500
the 90% case with only
a couple of things. And,

897
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:30.790
you know, as I said,
unsafety, runtime library validate your

898
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:35.500
inputs, use authentication, use, use
ankles when appropriate. And you're

899
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.240
90% of the way they
are. It turns out if

900
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:41.020
you know, and it's, which
actually frustrates me when I

901
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.620
start seeing, you know, really
silly mistakes, which people making

902
00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.050
people do make them inside
and outside Microsoft, you know,

903
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.360
you, you were talking about
the TIFF vulnerability. Yeah. I

904
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.140
was really surprised. I had
not realized that they had

905
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:58.900
reverse engineered and they'd found
it very into the TIF

906
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:03.160
vulnerability to that. They were
reusing the TIF vulnerability again,

907
00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.430
this is in the iPhone.
Yeah. Well, I really appreciate

908
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:07.750
you taking the time out
of your day to talk

909
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:09.550
to me earlier. I know
you're really busy guy and

910
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.400
maybe we'll have you on
the show again. No problem.

911
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.280
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes and we

912
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:26.100
will see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
