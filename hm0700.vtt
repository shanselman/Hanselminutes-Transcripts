Hey friends, summers longer days
and slower pace. Invite us

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.020
to pick up a book,
follow our questions and try

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.140
our hand at something new.
The work of modern software

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.840
developers is evolving in ways
that are both challenging and

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.170
rewarding. As a developer, it's
essential that you cultivate a

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.920
security mindset and to help
we've put together a collection

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.450
of information, security books, podcasts,
blogs, and hands on exercises

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.680
recommended by Vira coders across
our development security and product

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.880
teams from a just published
page Turner to classic frack

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.240
articles. There's something here for
everyone who's interested in becoming

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.390
more security minded. So dip
your toes in or take

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.040
a deep dive visit www

Vira code.com/reading. Hi, this is

14
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.700
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes. In

15
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.030
fact, this is episode 700.
I have to thank you

16
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.170
for that guest. There have
been 700 episodes of Hansel

17
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.010
minutes, which is divided by
52. I don't know a

18
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.000
big number. It's like 12
plus years. 13 years. Congratulations.

19
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.930
Thank you very much. My
guest today on episode 700

20
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.380
is my wife Mo. Hello,
Mo. Hey Scott, how are

21
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.710
you? I'm very well. I'm
sure you're thrilled as always

22
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.930
to be on the show.
You cared deeply about the

23
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.560
show. So with no hint
of sarcasm, like why are

24
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.950
we doing this? Why are
we clearly, we need a

25
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.690
weekly Mowen Scott show. People
say that they only listened

26
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.860
to the show. Just waiting
for you to show up

27
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.830
every few years. It's a
compliment. Thank you very much.

28
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.080
How's it going? You tolerate
me doing this show. I

29
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.280
realize, and I appreciate that.
I'd said pleasure. Has it

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.230
been a problem at all?
Scheduling the show. You really

31
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.600
don't have to just do
anything other than keep the

32
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.300
boys from making noises for
half an hour. Yeah, not

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.600
a whole lot on my
part, except for that couple

34
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.300
of times a decade or
so and money for gas,

35
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.430
but I'm know you do
all the heavy lifting in

36
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.660
that one. So nice job.
All right, cool. He yesterday,

37
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.700
when was our anniversary? Two
days ago, dude, you should

38
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.150
know this. Come on man.
Two days ago. Happy anniversary.

39
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.550
Thank you very much. You
two coming up on almost

40
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.140
20 years. I'm happy to
be renewed for another season.

41
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.370
Is that true? 25? It
does feel like trends. If

42
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.770
you roll up, if you
round up, it could be

43
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.250
up to near 25 now.
Yeah, almost 20 years. Good

44
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.400
Lord. That's a long time.
It was fast. Some people

45
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.550
had asked on Twitter, how
you were doing. If you

46
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.520
go out and Google for
Hanselman in cancer, of course

47
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.280
you had cancer a number
of years ago. And actually

48
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.810
we were diagnosed this month.
It's been what? Seven years?

49
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.890
Yeah, 2012. It's kind of
crazy when that comes up.

50
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.070
It's like, wow, that was
some journey, huh? Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.480
You can check out our
cancer year on the other

52
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.570
podcast that I used to
do with Rob Connery called

53
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.560
this developer's life. If you
go to this developer's life.com

54
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.010
episode was called cancer. And
it was actually a diary

55
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.830
over the course of the
year, because if I recall

56
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.380
and correct me, if I
get this wrong tiny wife,

57
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.140
you wanted to keep a
diary, but you didn't really

58
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.290
have the energy to do
the writing part of the

59
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.350
diary. So instead you just
recorded it on your phone

60
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.480
and you had like, I
feel like this and we

61
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.730
go for walks and we
talk about it. So over

62
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.190
the course of the year,
as diagnosis and treatment and

63
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.930
on, you know, surgery and
all that kind of stuff

64
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.240
happened, we kind of complained
to each other. And then

65
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.360
we tied that into like
a single, a single podcast

66
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.930
episode. Yeah. It totally helps
to have a, an engineer

67
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.060
for a husband who knows
how to put that together

68
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.070
because I, I wouldn't have
been able to do that

69
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.970
on my own as far
as documenting it. So it

70
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.040
helps to have your expertise.
Cause you were able to

71
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.740
facilitate that in a way.
I love that. And the

72
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.030
one time that we're recording
you use expertise to prefer

73
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.420
it. Anything, anything that I
do that's right. You are

74
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.480
so wholly unimpressed with whatever
it is. Took the time

75
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.690
when we're not recording. I
don't think you've ever said

76
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.350
anything. Even remotely close to
expertise. And actually that's a

77
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.080
good point. We should mention
what, what you do cause

78
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.270
you're actually on your second
career. What did you do

79
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.070
before? Correct. Tyler's in business
work for a nonprofit and

80
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.130
now I'm a nurse. You
see how understated you are.

81
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.040
You had an MBA, you
have a international business degree

82
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.360
at green French, you speak
four languages. You were running

83
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.750
a finance department for nonprofit
in one day. You just

84
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.980
decided to be a nurse.
Why? Well, I mean, it

85
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.950
wasn't quite that abrupt in
that sudden, right. But something

86
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.150
that I always wanted to
do. Yeah. 10 years, you

87
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.510
never mentioned nursing. We talked
about going into some kind

88
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.770
of a people without borders,
kind of a thing. People,

89
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.060
it couldn't be doctors. We
weren't doctors. So exactly as

90
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.560
volunteers, without borders, just regular
people with no borders. Right?

91
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.040
Yeah. So, but I mean,
look, it's just a way

92
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.220
of giving back, right? When
you have been given so

93
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.830
much and I always felt
like it was a privileged

94
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.900
life we do that we've
had. And so I was

95
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.660
wanted to give back, but
I mean first, so I

96
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.400
had to get a job
and take care of my

97
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.100
family because you know, you
don't always know who you're

98
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.140
going to marry and you
always want to be independent

99
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.430
as a woman and be
able to take care of

100
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.250
yourself and your family. And
my, my family is still

101
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.980
in Zimbabwe at the time.
And in fact, some of

102
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.230
them still are there now
and wanting to get a

103
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.030
job and be able to
send money home. And so

104
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.670
that was the plan was
do the quickest thing that

105
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.230
would get opportunity to send
money home and up as

106
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.280
the business life, When I
married you, you had already

107
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.560
had your master's degree and
you were working and doing

108
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.070
your own thing. And now
you're doing an entirely different

109
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.770
career. It's it might be
interesting for people to hear

110
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.200
that, that you're, it is
in the back of your

111
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.690
head that you want your
own career and your own

112
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.710
thing. So that God forbid
I'm not around or we

113
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.920
aren't around or whatever you
are your own person and

114
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.350
you're doing your own thing
and you're capable of doing

115
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.710
your own thing. Yeah. I
mean, absolutely. I think it's

116
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.440
important for the boys and
you know, not having any

117
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.450
daughters, my life is a
little different than a Bay,

118
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.970
right? I'm surrounded by men
in my house, but I

119
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.710
want the boys, just people
are men. They'll become men.

120
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.600
I'm working on it, dude,
I'm working on it. They're

121
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.330
not men yet. Clearly the
toilet. I know I'll have

122
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.230
the time, but in time
they'll get there. I hope.

123
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.320
And I want them to
grow up knowing that women

124
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.960
are capable individuals and can
take care of themselves, can

125
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.540
have goals, can exceed those
holes, et cetera, et cetera,

126
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.820
you know? And you, you
do a lot to support

127
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.920
that, of course, because you
always make it very clear.

128
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.170
Like it's even when I
wasn't working, when I was

129
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.360
taking care of the boys,
that was what we decided

130
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.550
on was first my choice
to stay home for a

131
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.400
while with the boys, when
they were younger, you never

132
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.250
made it. You'd never say
things like it's my paycheck

133
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.200
or it's my house. You
know, even though you were

134
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.090
making the mortgage payment. So
it always felt like it

135
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.450
was seen. So that was
of Yeah. At the time.

136
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.700
Yeah. But this was the
thing though. We always decided

137
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.000
that that was for, for
the time that you did

138
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.910
it, your job and while
it's not a job that

139
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.940
generates a paycheck, it is
an enormous amount of work

140
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.030
to be a homemaker. And
we, and this was an

141
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.100
agreement that we made and
that's, that's an interesting thing

142
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.310
to mention as well. Over
the last 20 years when

143
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.210
we started, I hadn't graduated
college yet you had a

144
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.530
masters. I had not yet
finished my undergraduate. My undergrad

145
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.310
took 11 years. Right? Yeah.
I love how you smile.

146
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.290
You think that's hilarious forever
Because we're recording. I'm going

147
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.370
to compliment you on your
tenacity in sticktuitiveness. And when

148
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.380
we stop recording, you will
be like, it'd be raped

149
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.970
me for my laziness. I
like to give her the

150
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.080
program 11 years. Yeah. So
I finished my bachelor's in

151
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.980
2003. And while I was
going to school, you were

152
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.340
supporting me. And then when
you decided to go into

153
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.710
nursing, that was a plan.
And this is really a

154
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.650
big thing. It's a theme
in, in my blog and

155
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.940
my podcast and our conversations
is this notion of intentionality.

156
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.970
Yeah. Don't let your life
happen by default. And when

157
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.050
you sat down and said,
I want to be a

158
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.650
nurse, you were like, okay,
if I recall, this is

159
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.290
my recollection, which may not
be clear. It was basically

160
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.250
you came and you said,
buckle up. This is going

161
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.530
to, it's going to be
pretty it's verbatim. Yeah, that

162
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.570
was roughly, that's what you
said. But it was like,

163
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.430
this is going to get
crazy. I'm going to be

164
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.740
going to school. And you
were, I mean, you were

165
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.830
basically checked out till 2:00 AM
every night, seven days a

166
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.160
week studying, if you weren't
downstairs, studying you were upstairs

167
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.220
studying. But that wasn't a
thing that just happened, like

168
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.390
that was planned. Well, I
mean, it was, and I

169
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.540
think this is definitely recollection
kind of softening the blow

170
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.970
a little bit because it
is a game changer when

171
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.950
your spouse comes in and
says, Hey, I want to

172
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.860
do this. And you're like,
Whoa. You know, when did

173
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:21.020
that become a user? That,
yeah, exactly. And even now

174
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.090
you're like nursing, you know,
I didn't know you wanted

175
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.700
to do that. Yeah. It
is hard. But again, it's

176
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.400
all about communication. Right. And
being part of a team

177
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.440
and saying, Hey, this is
important to me. And if,

178
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.870
if for whatever reason, I
didn't communicate that or convey

179
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.120
that my bad, you know,
I think you did. I

180
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.820
mean, it matters now that
we're people without borders. No,

181
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.460
I'm talking about people without
borders. Yes. Let's make t-shirts

182
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.910
but I'm talking beforehand because
I think that's what is,

183
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.860
is a challenge and a
marriage and you and I

184
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.960
have talked about this from
a personality point of view,

185
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.610
just the other day you
were saying with the boys

186
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.110
that when we have a
plan in place, we might

187
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.070
decide something as basic as,
okay, we're going to get

188
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.140
up and then go have
bagels at our favorite bagel

189
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.390
store. They will shop and
then do a, B, C,

190
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.970
D E. And if you
get that in your head

191
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.060
on Friday night, for instance,
saying, okay, that's what our

192
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.030
Saturday is going to look
like. Our tomorrow's going to

193
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.330
look like, and then I
wake up on Saturday morning

194
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.610
and say, okay, forget that
idea. Here's what we're going

195
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.080
to do. Instead of going
to the beach, you know,

196
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.210
you said that the jar
is you find a jar

197
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.300
and you find that it
is not the expected plan.

198
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.550
So it's, you've got to
shift, you know? So that

199
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.930
was a little bit like
that. And I want him

200
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.160
to go back to school
as a bit of a

201
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.080
shift in the marriage and
the plan it's like, wait,

202
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.100
where is this coming from?
But to be able to,

203
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.020
to keep communicating, to be
able to keep having the

204
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.150
dialogue and say, you know
what really matters? And for

205
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.100
you, I mean, you came
around and then you, you

206
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.550
became a cheerleader, you know,
okay, well, if we are

207
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.410
going to do this, let's
do this. We go to

208
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.680
nursing. Stuff's being more, goes
to nursing school, but we

209
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.480
go to nursing school, et
cetera, et cetera. And that

210
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.600
was huge. And you, you
bring up a really important

211
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.560
point is this notion of
expectations. We've always said that

212
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.800
in a marriage, you have,
you come in with expectations

213
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.670
and you have daily expectations,
weekly, yearly expectations, right. And

214
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.840
when an expectation isn't met
there's fear and uncertainty and

215
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.740
doubt and anger because it's
like suddenly the rug has

216
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.930
been pulled out from underneath
you. And it can be

217
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.240
something as simple as recording
of the olive garden. No,

218
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.970
we're not. We're going to
Chipotle. Ah, and it's like,

219
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.750
Whoa, I'm angry suddenly because
something has changed or it

220
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.150
can be, Hey, I thought
you were gonna work at

221
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.710
this job. Or I thought
you were going to watch

222
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.650
the kids. And now we're
moving to Spain. Like what,

223
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.360
what happened there? And you
got absorbed the initial upsetness.

224
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.990
Yeah. The initial context switch,
I think, was the term

225
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.720
that we used it. And
then you gotta get over

226
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.730
it and say, all right,
this is the change. This

227
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.030
is. Yeah. And I find
that, you know, sometimes I

228
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.800
do that a lot. I
mean, something as basic as

229
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.730
conversation where it depends who
I'm talking to. Like if

230
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.130
I'm talking to my sister,
you know, we can talk

231
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.100
about four or five different
things almost at the same

232
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.130
time and I can pick
it up. We can be

233
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.410
talking about the kids. We're
talking about our work. We're

234
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.770
talking about I'll I'll I'll
mom. And I'll say, you

235
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.910
know, hold that thought, which,
you know, we have, we

236
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.750
have a phrase, we just
say, put a comma. There

237
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.840
is the equivalent of white
presets on English thing. That's

238
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.610
the English translation of what
we do say, which has

239
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.380
put a common there and
then I'll jump to something

240
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.700
else and I'll come back
and I'll pick it up.

241
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.120
You know, that can be
hard to do in a

242
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.700
relationship if you're not sort
of speak into the person's

243
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.620
language. And so I think
you and I have, it's

244
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.630
not perfect by any stretch
of the imagination, but we

245
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.480
continue to work at it.
We continue to say, okay,

246
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.780
this is what I'm going
to do. And, and a

247
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.280
couple of times you've called
me on it and said,

248
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.070
well, you just skipped steps
here. You went from step

249
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.400
one to step seven. What
happened in between? And then

250
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.280
I'm like, Oh shoot. I
did. He made a lot

251
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.610
of assumptions, Assumptions. I, I,
in my head, I walked

252
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.710
through it methodically and it's
like, okay, I've got to

253
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.870
call back and bring you
up to speed. Okay. So

254
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.480
this is where I am
now, which is great for

255
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.960
me. Cause like I'm, I'm
I'm homemaker. Okay. And I

256
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.490
think your thought was, Oh,
you're going to go back

257
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.930
and work for the nonprofit
or you're going to go

258
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.330
back and work in the
office. Okay. So, and then

259
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.150
I went from, I'm a
homemaker now to, okay. So

260
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.940
I want to play to
nursing school. Okay. For me,

261
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.680
that's, that's sort of a
logical thing. Cause I've been

262
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.780
thinking about this in my
head for you. This was

263
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.030
like, wait, where, you know,
so once I went back

264
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.790
and I said, Hey, listen,
I have always wanted to

265
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.030
be someone involved in healthcare.
I didn't even necessarily, always

266
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.530
want to be a nurse
nurse, but I always knew

267
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.410
I wanted to be in
healthcare in some capacity. Right.

268
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.990
So that's new information for
you. Oh, I didn't realize

269
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.990
that. Okay. So why now?
Well, I want to do

270
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.060
it now because our boys
are older. Now they're more

271
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.780
independent. You know, I'm not
nursing for instance, then I

272
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.850
think diapers, et cetera, et
cetera. So the older they

273
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.590
get, the easier it is
for them to sort of

274
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.680
live their own lives. They're
not as dependent on me

275
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.620
and on you, you know,
It does think. So that

276
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.110
means that we should have
a plan. The boys will

277
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.500
be out of, out of
school and in college, in

278
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.400
the next seven to eight
years. That's crazy talk right

279
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.410
there. But yeah, it is,
it is totally nuts. Cause

280
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.240
I know people who know
us who remember us carrying

281
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.350
them around. And I remember,
I always remind them. I

282
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.520
remember when you didn't exist,
so don't talk back, right?

283
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.960
What are we doing after
that? Right. Have we even

284
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.290
got an empty nest plan?
Do people do that? Is

285
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.600
that a thing? We should
have an expectation, you know

286
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.060
how, when you're dating and
then, you know, maybe you're

287
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.260
going to move in with
the person you're going to

288
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.660
get married, but then you
discover that they're they do

289
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.480
something gross with their toothbrush
or they don't flush the

290
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.670
toilet or you know, whatever.
And then it's like, is

291
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.850
that a deal breaker? Yeah.
Right. And maybe you don't

292
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.950
want pets or maybe you
do want pets or maybe

293
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.250
they're a vegan or whatever,
like a marriage or a

294
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:37.950
relationship is a series of
potential deal, breakers and accept

295
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.950
as not deal breakers. And
then you move on to

296
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.500
the next thing. What if
we find out that you

297
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.420
want to go and do
salsa dancing for the next

298
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.000
20 years after the boys
have left as talented as

299
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.730
I am, you know? And
I want to play Xbox.

300
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.340
Yeah. What's a, how do
we solve that? Well, I

301
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.280
mean, I'm curious to hear
your take on that. It's

302
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.630
we need to do it
on a live on a

303
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.450
podcast. I was just throwing
out the idea that maybe

304
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.030
we need to do some
planning. Yeah. I mean, well,

305
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.040
that's a given, I don't
know. I was hoping we

306
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.560
would hang out a hangout
and I don't know, do

307
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.230
yoga and go with the
senior center. I don't know.

308
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.120
I see you've given it
a lot of bud here.

309
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.490
I think the point is
to get the boys out

310
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.910
of the house and then
chill. Yeah. Right. The goal

311
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.830
is to hang out. Right?
Isn't that just the goal

312
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.030
in life. Hey, friends as
a software engineer, chances are

313
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.660
you've crossed paths with Mongo
DB. At some point, whether

314
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.820
you're building an app for
millions of users or just

315
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.780
figuring out your side hustle
as the most popular non-relational

316

324
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.880
Well. But I mean, one
of the issues that we're

325
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.850
facing, which I think most
couples don't face is that

326
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.940
I am relatively new in
my career. Right. So you've

327
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.360
been doing this for what?
Over 20 years, I don't

328
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.360
know, at least 25 and
20, excuse me. I stand

329
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.680
corrected people 25 years, been
a nurse for five years.

330
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.620
And that goes right. Well,
mostly new. You're like a

331
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.200
senior now. No, but when
I'm talking about though, is

332
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.210
from a career point of
view, most people when they

333
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.360
talk about a career it's
30 years, right? So you're

334
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.230
talking about retiring. Yes they
do. They do. That's the

335
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.640
thing, but I'm not even
sort of halfway into my,

336
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.220
my career so to speak,
you know? So, so it

337
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.200
does create a bit of
an unusual challenge that I

338
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.900
think most people, by the
time they're 45, I'm not

339
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.060
saying I'm just five years
old in my job, you

340
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.760
know, whatever my job is
The question. So do you

341
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.160
want to do this until
you're 65? Yeah. I mean

342
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.900
that's so that's, that's the
kind of thing that I

343
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.050
was saying that it's about
communication and having the conversations

344
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.570
because you're already, you're clearly
telling me that you just

345
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:16.210
wanna, you know, float around
and be a bum is

346
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.280
what I heard. I don't
mean a bomb. I would

347
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.510
just like to finish one
X-Box game. I mean, I

348
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.330
think the goal is to
Pressing and key to goal

349
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.350
Level two. I mean, I
mean your life will be

350
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.510
complete. Yeah. I know. I
mean, I think the goal

351
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.690
is to not have to
work and then I might

352
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.490
go and teach, you know,
we always talked about me

353
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.030
teaching high school. Right. You
know, maybe talk about traveling

354
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.490
too, right? Yeah. And then
I'll teach high school, wherever

355
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.400
that is, you know? Right.
Or run around, run around

356
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.680
the world, get one of
those around the world. Tickets

357
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.030
where as long as you
keep East, right. You can

358
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.950
just kind of like go,
you continue. You know? I

359
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.780
don't know, like the point
is to not have to

360
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.240
wake up on a random
Tuesday. Yeah. That would be

361
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.330
cool. I mean, I might
still do the podcast and

362
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.330
because I can't stop now.
Right. That's right. I've gotta

363
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.380
be your 800. I need
you for episode 1000, in

364
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.450
fact, which is coming up
pretty soon here in about

365
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.810
seven years. Oh gosh. But,
but I guess when you

366
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.910
should probably figure that out.
Yeah. And that's been a

367
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.950
theme though, in our marriage
since the beginning, if you

368
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.100
recall, when we got married
and we did our vows,

369
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.700
we also wrote a mission
statement and some people thought

370
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.260
that was kind of a
nerdy thing to do, but

371
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.440
I always thought that was
pretty cool because people put

372
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.230
all this work into a
wedding, but how often do

373
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.690
they sit down and ask
themselves the hard questions about,

374
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.270
you know, Oh, you're a
cat person. Like I would

375
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.810
hate to discover that the
day after, or like, you

376
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.130
know, you didn't like tacos
or something. Oh, I mean,

377
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.410
we could, we could cobble
on without tacos, but I

378
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.050
think that Coke probably, I
think diet Coke would be

379
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.910
a deal breaker for you.
I mean, you leave me

380
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.460
and the kids. If I,
If you were an anti

381
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.330
diet Coke zealot, I'm not
sure how we would function.

382
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.960
But the point was that
intentionality seemed to be permeating

383
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.930
us. Were you intentional before
we got married? Is that

384
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.510
like a Mo thing? A
Mo ism. I taught you

385
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.770
intentionality. I brought intentionality. I
intentionally did it Take full

386
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:14.000
credit? So no Brings up
an important point. We married

387
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.160
ourselves, Jessica bad. I don't
know, man. I didn't know

388
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.470
better. I think we've been
married awhile. No, but like

389
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.200
that's true though. Right? Isn't
that annoying? Just so mean.

390
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.800
Not at all where I
thought you were going at

391
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.410
that point, but yeah. I
mean, I think it's true

392
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.840
and I always tell people,
it's like, I'm married myself,

393
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.920
which is awesome. Like, you
know, 62% of the time,

394
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.990
you know? And then the
rest of the time, it's

395
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.040
like, Oh my God, I
married myself. I mean, Mary

396
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.590
yourself, no. When we say
Mary yourself, like what we

397
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.540
mean by that is that
we do The way you

398
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.360
think for the most part,
the, the how you, how

399
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.730
you get there is different.
I don't, I'm not an

400
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.890
engineer. I'm not a programmer.
So my brain doesn't work

401
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.410
the way yours does. But
I mean, on the things

402
00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.900
that matter, we almost always
end up at the same

403
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.750
point, whether it's the boys
and doing homework, whether it's

404
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.330
limiting their screen time, whether
it's what, you know, the

405
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.460
importance of family and our
lives, et cetera, Manage our

406
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.310
finances. Exactly. Once exactly where
we want to go for

407
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.860
vacation, We always end up
at the, at the same

408
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.910
place. It's just, you meander,
you just meander. I mean,

409
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.710
you just are all over
the place as to how

410
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.020
to get there, how to
execute the plan, but you

411
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.880
get there. So what do
you mean by that? I

412
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.100
didn't know where you meander,
how That's the spin of

413
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.770
the last 20 years sort
of, you know, massaging you

414
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.170
in the right direction to
this presentable person that people

415
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:34.160
see now. Oh my goodness.
Yeah. Awesome. Let's talk about

416
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.100
the things that we don't
do the same. That I

417
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.360
would say the two things,
maybe two and a half,

418
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.790
depending on how you count
them. That are the most

419
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.010
annoying about our marriage. Now
I was two and a

420
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.610
Half. Yeah. I didn't see
you. I didn't say the

421
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:53.100
most annoying things about you.
I appreciate that. Thank you.

422
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.630
The most important thing about
our marriage is a getting

423
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.640
out of the house in
the morning. Like if we're

424
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.580
trying to go somewhere, like,
like on time, you mean

425
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.770
like I put like, well,
yeah. I mean, I put

426
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.750
on my pants and I
leave and the boys and

427
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.030
I are in the car
and it's like, let's go

428
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.350
and you're, I don't know,
cleaning the dishwashers, just doing

429
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.420
something that has nothing to
do. I am totally for

430
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.360
the family, for the children.
We'll be there when we

431
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.810
get back. The second thing.
So one leaving on time,

432
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.750
she know I've forgotten. Number
two at all, maps maps.

433
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:32.010
Like you just, you don't
believe in maps. Like we

434
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.260
were, we were at the
beach a couple of weeks

435
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.480
ago or whatever. And it
was like, I was trying

436
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.980
to explain the map and
it was like, well, it's

437
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.530
like the we're going to
go this way. The hypotony

438
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.970
news. And you're like, no,
we'll go down and then

439
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.740
we'll go over. I'm like,
no, but the hypotony is

440
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.640
just, it's faster. And you're
like, no, it's not, no,

441
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.920
it's not. Of course you
were right. But that's not

442
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.910
the point. The man, you
remember, we ended up on

443
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.640
a dirt road. It was
so dumb, Dude, you lost

444
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.310
me after you were. Right.
You know, at that point,

445
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.930
You know, I dunno. I
just, yeah, I follow maps

446
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.840
is all I'm saying Hi,
I am not anti map.

447
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.560
I mean, I think maps
are purposely for the rest

448
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.430
of the world. They are
useful thing to have. They

449
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.410
provide a very limited value
for me. And the reason

450
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.680
why is because I don't
always understand maps, right? In

451
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.930
order for somebody to provide
value, you must have an

452
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.170
appreciation and an understanding of
what you're looking at. Right.

453
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.820
You know, if I don't
speak Greek and you put

454
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.370
a whole bunch of, you
know, a Greek book in

455
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.720
front of me, I'm not
going to get a whole

456
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.550
lot out of it. And
that's that's maps for me.

457
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.500
It's like, it's like magic.
You know, I could learn

458
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.160
Greek. I could, you don't
care to learn there. You

459
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.220
have it. You know, that's
a good thing. It's one

460
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.140
thing to be ignorant. And
I don't mean anger in

461
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.250
a bad way. It's Because
ignorant, ignorant in a nice

462
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:55.530
way back days ago, <inaudible>
of maps. I don't know.

463
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:56.940
I just seems like you
could learn it. Like I

464
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.480
think maps provide value. They
do. But there are many

465
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.370
other things that I could
learn that are important to

466
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.720
me that I care about.
What do you call it

467
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.240
a long way? Because to
me it's not the long

468
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.410
way. Right. You know? But
listen, it's the long way

469
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.110
to you because of something
else that you value. So

470
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.990
you might value getting to
where you're going. For me,

471
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.660
it's the process, right? What
am I doing that on

472
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.000
that drive drywall. I may
be talking to you. I

473
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.980
mean, are you talking to
my other son or to

474
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.930
my son? I may be
talking to my sister or

475
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.570
whatever the case may be.
Right? So it's not as

476
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.580
necessary for me to go
from point a to point

477
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.470
B directly. I will take
the way that I think

478
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.660
is fastest. But if you
tell me that there's another

479
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.000
way, that's even faster. If
I go the hypotony news.

480
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.790
Well, great. You got hypothenuse,
I'll go by the way.

481
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.070
The part that's so funny
is that the goal is

482
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.980
almost always, you know, for
the market bear to get

483
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.680
there safely and whatever, right.
I'm following the fastest direction.

484
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.870
You know, you don't want
to be in traffic. Nobody

485
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.390
wants nobody likes stoplights. Yeah.
And then I'll go, Hey,

486
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.610
we should go this way.
It's faster. And you'll be

487
00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.020
like, well, good luck with
that. Like enjoy that way.

488
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.210
I'm not going that way.
I'm like, this is faster.

489
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.000
And you go, if you
say so, it's like, you're

490
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.370
trolling me. It's like you
say, if you say something

491
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.350
like, no, it's not. If
I say so if, if

492
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:14.480
physics itself says that that
direction is faster, it's faster.

493
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.970
Except of course, when I
get it wrong and it's

494
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.770
like, but that's neither here
nor there. And you point

495
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.570
to a map and you
say, the map says, it's

496
00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.190
go this way. And we
go there and we end

497
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.920
up in somebody's backyard because
We would have varied. Or

498
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.220
it was like a bridge
was down. Remember that one

499
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.710
with a GPS took us
right up to the end

500
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.770
of the Lake. And there
was no ferry. There, There

501
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.510
was no fear in, there
was another time it took

502
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.090
us right up to somebody's
yard because I guess they'd

503
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.490
built a house. And this
poor guy actually let us

504
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.270
drive as a property. I'm
like, let's hear from abs.

505
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.130
You know, I believe at
that point, I said, I

506
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.500
stand corrected because, So this
is the other thing that

507
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.810
you do. This has become
a thing. Everyone's got their

508
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.000
shorthand. Every relationship has their
shorthand. And I think that

509
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.370
those things are important when
you're right. This is a

510
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.860
lovely thing that my wife
does when you are correct.

511
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.610
And I am wrong rather
than saying, Hey, screw you

512
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.680
or pay for, get you
or whatever, naughty thing you

513
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.860
could say, you say, Oh,
well, I stand corrected, which

514
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.580
is the exact opposite of
what in fact happened. So

515
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.820
I stand corrected is the,
is the, the antithesis of

516
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.310
what is wrong on you?
Idiot. That's what you're thinking.

517
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.750
But you say it in
a really sweet way. And

518
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.330
you're like, well, pardon me?
That's right. Clearly the map

519
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.550
was right. I don't know.
I just feel like maps

520
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.310
report, but getting out the
door on time as well.

521
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.230
I mean, come on. Yeah,
it is. It is. I

522
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.330
mean, but again, what am
I doing instead of getting

523
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.490
out on time for you,
it just becomes a matter

524
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.270
of you're disrespecting the process.
You're disrespecting us leaving, you

525
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.060
know? Well, you know, I
mean, I'm looking at those

526
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.150
dishes. They're not going to
clean themselves. And if I,

527
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.170
if I may and you
say to me, they'll be

528
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.840
there when we get back,
that's the problem. They'll still

529
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.590
be sitting there. Philby when
we get back, Either front

530
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.680
load, the work or back
load, the work, like if

531
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.780
we're leaving for a week,
I can see we're doing

532
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.970
the dishes. That's a good
idea. But if we're leaving

533
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:06.310
for lunch, then didn't really,
let's like, let's go, Just

534
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.130
leave them there. Let's just
live in that field like

535
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.590
dishes or just the nickname
and the chromic weight of

536
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.410
the knowing that knowing that
you left your dishes, that

537
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.920
doesn't bother you, That dishes
have a weight on your

538
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.520
car, That laundry on our
soul. Can we enjoy lunch

539
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.220
knowing that our laundry is
not being done? No soul

540
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.160
weight. The answer to that
is no laundry. So anyway,

541
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.590
I just want to go
on time. Just one day

542
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.380
in 20 years, I want
to go somewhere on time.

543
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:37.330
We've been doing a lot
of family events lately, which

544
00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.600
is pretty cool. The boys
signed up for, for TaeKwonDo.

545
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.550
Yeah. Korean martial art. And
the first couple of days,

546
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.960
we sat there with the
other parents, <inaudible> parents and

547
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.900
watched them and checked our
email. And I felt kind

548
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.990
of dumb sitting there checking
my email. So then we

549
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.020
jumped in and now we
are working on our blue

550
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.590
belts in TaeKwonDo and the
other parents are still sitting

551
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:06.030
there on their phone. Right.
Great. I didn't think that

552
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.620
you were going to go
for it, but you're actually

553
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.960
doing, turning out really well
at this. Does that surprise

554
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.940
you? Well, I, again, I
think you're being, you're glowing.

555
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.630
I am doing, you thought
you were going to do

556
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.380
it. That is true. And
I went through sort of

557
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.800
a love, hate relationship with
the TaeKwonDo. Hope because it's,

558
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.370
it's hard to realize just
how old you are. And

559
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.480
I'm not saying that no,
no, you're not. No one

560
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.710
is because you always think
that you're young at heart

561
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.360
and that you are flexible.
And then all of a

562
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.940
sudden, somebody says, give me
20 pushups and you get

563
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.610
stuck after two. And does
that go Kick me in

564
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.580
the head? And you're like,
yeah. You know, kicking the

565
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.610
knee. Yeah. Cause he's standing
there holding his arm up

566
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.260
above his head. It's like
kick my hand. And it's

567
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.510
like, okay. So that's not
going to happen. How about

568
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.520
the compromise? And I just
definitely, I used to kill

569
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.210
the ankle, you know, <inaudible>
mid to late forties, more

570
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.540
than ever before. Yeah. But
the, one of the key

571
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.460
things that made me want
to do this was, you

572
00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.460
know, boys are, boys are
boys and they enjoy a

573
00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.390
lot of the boyish things,
the race, car games and

574
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.870
all this stuff and cooking
stuff, which isn't my thing.

575
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.820
Again, I was kind of
lamenting saying, I don't have

576
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.270
a daughter, but I realized
that if I don't, if

577
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.730
I want to be close
to them, okay, I need

578
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.800
to speak their language. And
I want, I need to

579
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.570
get into the things that
they enjoy so we can

580
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.560
maintain the closings that we
have now. And so I'm

581
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.510
not really a video gamer,
never really going to be

582
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.790
my thing. But I thought
to myself, well, they're going

583
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.130
to be doing this twice
a week. There's this TaeKwonDo.

584
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.330
So that is something I
can get into. And it

585
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.080
was a stretch, you know,
but was for the children.

586
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.050
Yeah. Well, and so like
one thing that people may

587
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.230
notice about as we've had
this conversation over the last

588
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.750
half hour, you made a
number of comments about as

589
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.360
a woman or a daughter
or two boys, you know,

590
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.690
there's some gender role things
coming from Zimbabwe that maybe

591
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.240
run a little differently than
some of the gender roles.

592
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.580
Cause I'm pretty clear on
the boys. Should you be

593
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.020
able to do whatever they
want to do? Regardless of

594
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:05.150
generals, ironically enough, we get
into TaeKwonDo. Like 60% of

595
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.400
the class is women. And
one of the grandmasters is

596
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.580
a woman. And now we've
got a bunch of, a

597
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.700
bunch of women in the,
in the TaeKwonDo class. And

598
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.880
again, the Grandmaster is one
of the grandmasters as a

599
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.350
married, as a married couple
as a man or woman,

600
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.330
she actually mentioned how nice
it was to have you

601
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.260
in the class. So TaeKwonDo
is ending up to be

602
00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.180
kind of a nice mix
of men and women in

603
00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.280
that class. I mean, I,
I would disagree that it's

604
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.250
60% women. I think what,
what you're trying to say

605
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.130
is girls. Yeah. There's no
women, women as an adult.

606
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.650
Yeah. Yeah. Appointment point is
what you thought. You'd be

607
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.900
the lone woman in a
TaeKwonDo class of boys kicking

608
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.010
stuff, To be clear. I'm
one of two women and,

609
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.100
and young women who are
in their teens, teens. Right,

610
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.390
right. It is at the
very least 50 50. So

611
00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:51.600
here we are mincing words.
It's like 60% girls in

612
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:57.270
the class, women girls. Well,
I don't know. No, it

613
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.950
would count the number of
kids in the class now

614
00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.490
and have this argument 5%.
Yeah. It's not an argument.

615
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.250
I'm just, I'm surprised that
you think it's that many

616
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.670
because it's definitely very male
the classes. And I think

617
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.490
really, absolutely. What does that
mean to me always. I

618
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:16.770
mean, males in non females,
none. None. Yeah. No, absolutely.

619
00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.660
We in the same class,
I mean, what are you

620
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.960
seeing? Where are you going
to school? But, but what

621
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.150
I think we can both
agree on, again, being people

622
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:26.850
that could sort of end
at the same conclusion is

623
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.920
that there's not a lot
of adults. There you are

624
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.040
the only adult male, for
instance, that's not a black

625
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.400
belt or a teacher. No,
that is a funny thing

626
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.490
actually, because we ended up
at the, at the wrong

627
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.910
end. I should've joined three
years before because in the

628
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.750
advanced class, it's all black,
you know, there's a ton

629
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.460
of black belts. So there's
a bunch of people in

630
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.060
there. 25, 30, 30, five
older people that are yeah.

631
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.190
All the black belts, all
the people who are my

632
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.340
age are they're all black
belts. And when I went

633
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.760
up to the tournament in
Washington, where I got the

634
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:08.640
heavyweight championship for free pills,
he said that Friday, I

635
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.810
was like, what do you
mean? We have a weight

636
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:14.130
champion. That's not nice. Oh
my bad. But I know

637
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.230
it doesn't show what you
meant by here. I'm literally

638
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.160
a heavyweight in this class.
I'm a buck 90. So

639
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.930
I'm just saying that, that
put me in the heavyweight

640
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.300
class, My friend, she had
a little more time, Hey,

641
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.880
I'm working on it. My
point is that I won

642
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:34.020
the heavyweight weight class for
seniors. So now I'm a

643
00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.900
heavyweight senior. This is not
an inclusive podcast at this

644
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.780
point. You're not helping me.
Right. The point I'm making

645
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.290
is that when I went
up to, up into Seattle,

646
00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.180
it was all, you know,
lots and lots of men

647
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.730
involved, stuff like that. So
yes, you're right at the

648
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.800
cycle that we are in,
in the particular class that

649
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.740
we're in, it's mostly teens
and not in six year

650
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.680
olds. And yeah, there's a
couple Cool continue to, to

651
00:31:55.830 --> 00:32:00.930
kick my behind The point
is that was a weird,

652
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.410
random off into space. They
would take window. The point

653
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.060
was though, is that here
was a thing that we

654
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.420
thought would be a traditionally
boys, breaking boards, kind of

655
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.770
a thing. And it ended
up to be quite a

656
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:15.930
nice group of people. And
now I'm visualizing, like every

657
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.990
time we go, I'm visualizing
that family black belt are

658
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.360
we all gonna get black
belts? And, and I noticed

659
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.820
actually, when I went upstairs
in the guestroom, I didn't

660
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.310
realize this. You had actually
hung up all of our

661
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:31.200
certificates and our awards from
that. And in the kitchen

662
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.530
here, we've got all of
our various awards and the

663
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.340
little boy, our youngest son
got a couple of awards.

664
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.360
Yeah. And then our oldest
boy got a sparring award.

665
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.340
So they're starting to get
that idea. This is their

666
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.120
first real organized sport where
they, it is on them

667
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.500
to go and achieve or
not achieve You do as

668
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.290
well as you apply yourself.
Right. Can you come back

669
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:55.720
with something or you don't,
or you don't care either

670
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.610
way you try it. Right.
You know, so I like

671
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.800
that idea of saying, put
effort into it and hopefully

672
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.990
your effort pays off. And
sometimes it will. And sometimes

673
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.330
it won't, but you're showing
up and you're trying, you

674
00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.350
know, like a marriage, like
a marriage, we turned it

675
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.450
all the way. That's right.
I walked you right to

676
00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.540
it. You walk me. But
That was a call back.

677
00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.810
I did that. That's right.
Well, thank you. A tiny

678
00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:20.410
wife for hanging out with
me on my 700th episode

679
00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.660
of Hansel minutes podcast named
after us and my poor

680
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:29.920
estimating skills Hansel hour. Did
you know that? That's why

681
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.650
Hanselman as it's called then
Is cause you've got a

682
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.350
good, yeah, Because I'm a
bad estimator. Nope. True story.

683
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.180
If you, if you're here
now listening to the 700

684
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.950
episode of Hansel minutes and
you may wonder why is

685
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.280
this show called Hanselman is
because a gentleman that I

686
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.800
worked with who you can
find on Twitter named Travis

687
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:48.010
Illig remember Travis, Travis. So
when I worked with him

688
00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.880
at a Kirlian before Microsoft
many, many years ago, I

689
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.710
used to say, Oh yeah,
I could do that in

690
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:58.000
about 30 minutes. And he
would look at me incredulously

691
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.240
and he would say, are
those Hansel minutes or actual

692
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.730
minutes? Because I would say
30 minutes. And we ended

693
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:07.060
up being like six hours.
So, so then when the

694
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.820
podcast idea came out, I
said that we'll call it

695
00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.640
Hanselman. It's after my bad
estimating, because the show is

696
00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.070
supposed to be 30 minutes
long. And here we are

697
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:18.880
at 34. Oh wow. But
perfect. And then I, this

698
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.220
is the part where I
do the radio voice. Oh,

699
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.790
I love them anyways. Sure.
And I do that. This

700
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.120
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

701
00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.700
you again next week and
you do that. Oh, I

702
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.430
say that you're on your
own. You're not gonna do

703
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.750
that. Kind of a deep
voice. It's pretty weak. You

704
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:41.950
got to do the radio
voice radio. Alright. We'll see

705
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:42.790
you all later. Okay.
