<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.660
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.350
I'm talking with Mark Durden
who runs the key man

10
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.130
project, and you can check
it out@keyman.com. Where are you

11
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.530
calling from? I'm calling from
Phnom Penh. Cambodia. All right.

12
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.130
And, but you don't have
a Cambodian accent say No,

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.260
I'm an Australian working there,
basically running a software team

14
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.490
out of Phnom Penh. And
how long has key man

15
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.630
been, been run? So I
wrote the first version of

16
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.020
Kamen back in 1992, I
think when I was about

17
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.340
14 years old. Seriously. Yeah.
So I was, I was

18
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.240
living in Laos at that
point with my parents. And

19
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.270
you, this is like, what
does that now? 26 years.

20
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.810
Yes. It's a very long
time. Where did you think

21
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.970
that this would be an
open source project you would

22
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.950
be working on for basically
your entire life? No, I

23
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.730
didn't have any idea of
that at the time. So

24
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.630
the, there was a specific
need that my father had

25
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.170
back in 1992. So it
was not long after the

26
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.410
release of windows 3.1 and
true type fonts. And this

27
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.190
was like magic because we
could all of a sudden

28
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.280
write the last script. And
I don't know if you

29
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.330
do you know anything about
the last script? So, so

30
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.690
the last script doesn't look
very much like Latin script

31
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.610
for use in English. It
has marks vowels that go

32
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.060
above and below and to
the left and to the

33
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.550
right of the base character.
Is it a syllabary? It's

34
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.220
not, it's, it's technically an
alphabet because everything is written,

35
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.190
but it's, it's related to
a lot of the Indian

36
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.670
languages in the way that
it's written In 1982. How

37
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.840
would one write this? So
in 1992, there was really

38
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.770
no good way to type
Lao in windows. So people

39
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.310
had made fonts where they
replaced the English characters with

40
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.560
Lao characters. So you press
the T key press letter

41
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.620
T and instead of coming
out with an English that

42
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.930
a T it would come
up with a allow letter,

43
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.750
but it would actually be
stored as an letter T

44
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.650
in your document. Oh, wow.
Okay. So you would open

45
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.210
up a text file and
it would just look like

46
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.750
a bunch of random Latin
letters, but if you applied

47
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.820
the font, you'd be looking
through it through a different

48
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.260
set of lenses. Yeah, that's
correct. And that kind of

49
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.230
works until you want to
do, you know, two languages

50
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.690
in one text document or
a text field at a

51
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.960
database. And if you want
to do any kind of

52
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.720
ligatures or have fonts, but
up against each other and

53
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.810
attach, that becomes challenging. If
not impossible. Cool. You can't

54
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.460
do anything smart with the
fonts. No. And is this

55
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.750
before Unicode kind of got
together and made all of

56
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.010
the different, you know, unique
code names for all the

57
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.350
different characters? Yeah. So this
is, this is still in

58
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.470
the days of code pages.
So 256 characters of which

59
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.570
about what 64 of them
are non grata really. Hmm.

60
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.450
And I understand that when
Lao alphabet was added into

61
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.970
Unicode, there's even a permanent
error in Unicode with regards

62
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.820
to two different names for
characters in Lao. Yes. I

63
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.700
believe I actually reported that
one. So there was two,

64
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.130
two of the names to
the letters had their names

65
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.620
swapped. It's it's a bit
awkward, but you can, you

66
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.040
can still use the letters.
Yeah. I assume that this

67
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.380
is hidden from the, to
the typist. Yeah. They don't

68
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.570
see it in day to
day use only the, the

69
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.120
font geeks. See it when
they're trying to do their

70
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.730
new fonts and the Unico
geeks. So you're 14 and

71
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.210
you want to type loud.
So you start writing C

72
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.020
and C plus plus. Yeah.
So the, the basic thing

73
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.200
we wanted to do is
we wanted to shift the

74
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.280
Lao alphabet into the upper
esky section above one 28

75
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.240
and in practice above one
60, because that range from

76
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.190
one 28, two one five
nine is, is dodgy fee

77
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.590
for general use. So that
means we, we lose lost

78
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.800
the characters that were up
there, which were the European

79
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.410
extended esky with letters, with
diacritics and some currency symbols

80
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.450
and things like that. But
that didn't really impact a

81
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.660
lot of what we were
doing. But the problem is

82
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.030
that we didn't have a
way to actually key those

83
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.760
symbols once we actually move
them up there. So I

84
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.620
got hold of a windows
SDK. We probably shouldn't talk

85
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.920
too much about how legitimate
that was in those days

86
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.080
and didn't have access to
any documentation or MSDN CDs

87
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.610
or anything like that. So
I worked from the head

88
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.520
of files being a 14
year old with lots of

89
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.590
time and, and figured out
how to create a hook,

90
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.620
a application, or a hook,
a DLL that would capture

91
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.000
the keystrokes and allow me
to spit out whichever character

92
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.980
I wanted. And were you
already a computer person at

93
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.450
this point? So I was
highly interested in computers. I

94
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.150
think if my parents hadn't
restricted me, I probably would

95
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.260
have spent most of my
awake time playing with the

96
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:39.610
computer. So this initially was
the, was the intersection of

97
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.550
your interest in language, your
interest in the country you're

98
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.880
living in and a problem
that was as of then

99
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.710
unsolved? Yeah. You know, I,
I wrote computer games before

100
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.940
that just like most teenage
computer programmers. Yeah. So you,

101
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.490
you, you wrote this as
a, as a, a windows

102
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.160
app itself, or did it
hook in and look like

103
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.310
part of windows? It was
a windows app and there

104
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.800
weren't really any hooks in
windows to LA to control

105
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.160
the keyboard layout at that
point. So it was a

106
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.490
separate app that ran, it
actually showed a little icon

107
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.950
in the title bar of
the active application. And you

108
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.880
could click on that icon
to switch between English and

109
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.100
Lau. Had you intended that
this would be English and

110
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.680
then N number of other
languages, or was it just

111
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.030
a matter of solving the
problem for Lau? So initially

112
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.330
it was just loud. It
was fairly hard coded, and

113
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.700
it was fairly hanky, but
wasn't very long after we

114
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.770
wrote, after I wrote the
first version, we had some

115
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.410
visitors and they saw this
program and they said, Oh,

116
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.350
we can definitely use this
for such and such a

117
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.010
language in, in Thailand. And
like, I don't remember what

118
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.150
language it was now. And
so that meant I had

119
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.070
to rewrite it to make
it so that they could

120
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.980
define the, the table for
mapping the keyboard. So I

121
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.570
wrote, came in version two
and they took that away

122
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.540
and they started using it
for a number of languages

123
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.350
in, in Southeast Asia. And
this, this where people with

124
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.290
the organization that I work
with now, which is a

125
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.900
SIL summer Institute of linguistics.
Hmm. And so at that

126
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.140
point, it wasn't an open
source project. I don't think

127
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.700
I'd heard of open source.
I, but it was a

128
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.990
free project. So the software
was completely free of charge.

129
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.960
And had you thought about
this other than just, it

130
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.270
was a hobby and it
was helpful to people, and

131
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.580
again, you said you're a
teenager, so you have all

132
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.210
the time in the world.
That's right. So I was

133
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.940
homeschooled. So I was very
flexible on my hours and

134
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.380
I just like to make
something that help people. And

135
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.750
at what point though, did
this turn into what is

136
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.340
now, how many keyboards? So
now we have over 700

137
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.520
different keyboards on the website,
I'm covering over a thousand

138
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:22.550
different languages. Wow. Did, did,
is this something where you

139
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.830
were, have been working on
this kind of more or

140
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.350
less full time for the
last 26 years? Or was

141
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.930
there any downtime where you
were doing this and then

142
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.900
went off to university and
then came back and people

143
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:39.290
were still using it? Okay.
So around about 1996, I

144
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.960
went to university before I
left Laos. I'd never actually

145
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.420
used the internet. So I
had no idea about it.

146
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.040
The internet was illegal in
Laos in those days. Wow.

147
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.680
Okay. So I came to
Tasmania in Australia for university.

148
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.830
And one of the things
I discovered when I started

149
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.990
university was that I actually
needed money to live. This

150
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.670
was a bit of a
shock. So I had to

151
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.910
get some work. And then
I realized that I could

152
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:19.910
sell licenses of Cayman and
actually make money and actually

153
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.910
keep working on it. So
I had had a challenge

154
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.620
for a while of what
can I make enough money

155
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.970
to, to actually work on,
came in. And that was

156
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:35.450
attention, I guess, for the,
until 2015 or so. So

157
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:40.430
the selling licenses of software.
So did you turn that

158
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.710
into your own company or
did you license it to

159
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.930
a company? So I turned
it into my own company

160
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.470
and I ran it pretty
much part time until about

161
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:55.040
2010 or so. And then
from 2010 through to 2015,

162
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.860
I was running the company
full time, but the software

163
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.100
never made a profit itself.
Okay. So this is, this

164
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.440
is like, as you know,
people who are farming for

165
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.340
subsistence, this is subsistence coding
at this point. It is.

166
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.210
Yeah. And, and, you know,
you do contract work and

167
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.670
that kind of thing, and
that brings enough money into

168
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.030
do the thing that you're
passionate about and that, that

169
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.460
works. But it does take,
take a bit out of

170
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.880
your life, out of your
family after a while. Yeah,

171
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.990
indeed. And did, when did
they start enlisting volunteers in

172
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.690
making this pluggable? So you
went from one keyboard to

173
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.820
thousands. So that really happened
when I made the, the

174
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.890
keyboard language for designing a
keyboard layout back in version

175
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.330
two of Cayman. It exploded
at that point and back

176
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.790
in 1993 or 1994. So
that was all distributed by

177
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.710
it really in Southeast Asia.
And then throughout into the

178
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.750
U S I don't know
how it was distributed for

179
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.340
the rest of the world.
And by flopping out, you're

180
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.210
literally saying enthusiastic people tell
their friends, and then they

181
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.230
meet up and copy floppies
in basement somewhere. Pretty much

182
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.110
a SIL did take it
on as a project that

183
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:17.160
they wanted to use for
very early on, back in

184
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.380
1994, 95. And so a
lot of their, that they

185
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.350
had a distribution of software
back in those days when

186
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.640
you sent out CDs to
people. And so that's, it'd

187
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.900
be on their CDs. And
what does SIL S I

188
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.860
L is summer Institute of
linguistics. So we're an organization

189
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:44.070
that works in literacy and
language development and Bible translation.

190
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:49.560
So it's a Christian organization
and work with minority languages

191
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.570
around the world. So then
they made this possible that

192
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.880
you went from a free
thing that you do as

193
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.810
a hobby to a subsistence
company. And now you are

194
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:06.150
supported by this nonprofit, Basically.
Yes. So I sold, sold

195
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.200
licenses of key man to
a large number of organizations.

196
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.600
People like BBC world service,
they work in a lot

197
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.100
of different languages. So back
in 2001 or so, they

198
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.450
were working in 70 different
languages. So they had a

199
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.530
big need for being able
to control the way they,

200
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.350
they type things and not
necessarily using even the system

201
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.190
supplied input methods, because they
have people who are coming

202
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:42.060
from very mixed areas where
they didn't actually have, you

203
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.370
know, consistent knowledge on how
to use the computer. And

204
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.490
people had to design their
own systems, but they needed

205
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:53.010
a single system in their
studios And making it available

206
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.720
to everyone though, which is
a kind of a game

207
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.600
changer. Because when, when, when
I was gambling with different

208
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.130
languages 20 years ago, I
was looking at Ethiopic scripts,

209
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.130
Amharic degree. Yeah. And I
would use a tool called

210
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.710
Gus pro G E apostrophe,
easy pro. And it was

211
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.070
like $59 or whatever. And
there's a whole, I mean,

212
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.500
for every language you're interested
in, there's someone out there

213
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.040
who has a product for,
you know, only $79 that

214
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.680
you could install and then
use the language, you know,

215
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.880
that you are interested in
by making key man available

216
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.430
to everyone. It kind of
disrupted the industry, wouldn't it?

217
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.720
So the first disruptor of
the industry was actually Microsoft

218
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.300
keyboard layout creator, because that
made it possible for anyone

219
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.700
to create a windows keyboard
for free. So at that

220
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.410
point, I actually thought, Oh,
well, this is the end

221
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.290
of Cayman because there won't
be enough money left in

222
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.570
it for me to keep
working on it. But the

223
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.360
Kamen does a number of
things that windows keyboards can't

224
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.390
do. And it turns out
that for a lot of

225
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:06.080
languages, those things actually really
helpful. So a windows keyboard,

226
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.900
if you, if you're familiar
with how they work, if

227
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.780
you look at English, you
know, you press the Tiki

228
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.630
and the T comes out,
it seems pretty straight forward.

229
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.660
But even there, we've got
a whole bunch of things

230
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.520
that are hidden from view.
So if you look at

231
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.060
the key caps on your
English keyboard, you can see

232
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.280
a capital T, but you
can't see a lowercase T

233
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.500
somebody who's not familiar with
the Latin script has a

234
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.110
great deal of trouble using
that. Cause psychology find the

235
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.030
letters that they can see
written down if they want

236
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.860
to type in microsoft.com. Well,
where's that little line with

237
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.830
a dot above the eye.
It's not on the keyboard.

238
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.970
That is a really interesting
exercise in empathy. Yeah. It's,

239
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.690
it's actually so hard to
actually step into that world

240
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.330
of, Oh, you know, how
do I use my language

241
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.050
on a computer? Because we're
so surrounded as English speakers,

242
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:04.120
by everything being in English,
it's like, go, go to

243
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.970
the Russian web for a
few days and, and try

244
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:13.270
and get anything done. Yeah.
I'm looking at the, I'm

245
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.790
looking at the EA and
realizing how different it capital

246
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.130
E is from a lowercase
E to the point where

247
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.480
if you're just learning English,
you are effectively completely blocked.

248
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.550
Yeah. Wow. Okay. So Microsoft
keyboard layout creator came out

249
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.090
in 2007. So a little
over the 10 years from

250
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.570
now. And you realize that
while that was a bit

251
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.450
of a disruptor, it wasn't
a cough, a nail in

252
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.770
the coffin for key man.
It wasn't. And partly because

253
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.730
at about the same time
I created a web version

254
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:51.160
of Kamen. So Jarvis scripted,
you know, with internet Explorer,

255
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.120
six things about around that
time too had actually, you

256
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.370
know, matured enough to the
point that you could create

257
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.690
a onscreen virtual keyboard and
do the same things on

258
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.480
the web as you were
doing on a keyboard programming

259
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.820
windows. And that sold to
a number of organizations that

260
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:14.440
were wanting to do web
based virtual keyboard in their

261
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:19.450
websites. And that kept me
going And did, did aren't

262
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.210
the fonts though that you
need, like, not always available.

263
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.430
I remember in the last
five, 10 years, it just

264
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.780
feels like suddenly the fonts
I need are available while

265
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.880
a couple of just a
couple of years back, I

266
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.600
was still downloading fonts on
a per language basis. Yes.

267
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:39.310
It was always difficult. So
internet Explorer kind of solved

268
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.450
the embedded font problem in
some ways with the embedded

269
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:48.910
open type EOT font format.
But they were so hamstrung

270
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.400
by the, all of the
copyright issues that they, that

271
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.970
the format was very locked
down. So it was very

272
00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.470
difficult to create an IOT
font and it was only

273
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.780
ever worked in internet Explorer.
So you would find that

274
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.390
some websites would embed those
fonts. Others would just have

275
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.660
a, if you see square
boxes, click this button to

276
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:15.320
download a font, a message,
And did this quietly just

277
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.220
go away because different operating
systems woke up or because

278
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.560
people started creating open fonts
and then we are able

279
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.890
to seamlessly download them or
get the browsers start embedding

280
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.040
them. Like right now I'm
typing Lao in key man

281
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.160
web.com. And I don't remember
ever installing any of that.

282
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.600
So it's a mixture of
things. Windows 10 has a

283
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.200
very large range of fonts
by default, you know, for

284
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.150
a lot of the languages,
it's got a single font

285
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.620
for large languages. It has
a nice collection. And so

286
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.540
that means that, you know,
if you're using windows 10,

287
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.210
then you're going to cover
a lot of those languages.

288
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.220
But if you go to
a language like Chuck Marr,

289
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.620
you're probably going to see
square boxes. <inaudible> Where is

290
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.900
that language from Chuck Maya's
Asian language Bangladesh. I think

291
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.850
I've got fans. You've got
fans. Yay. Yeah. I'm on

292
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.960
windows 10 insiders and it
looks very swirly and circley

293
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.170
Ah, you've got an embedded
font. There you go. I

294
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.440
have, we have switched on
the embedded fund. Oh, lovely.

295
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.960
So I don't have those
fonts, but I do because

296
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.030
they are embedded in the
browser. Yeah. Or you can

297
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.090
test that by copying and
pasting into notepad. Yeah, you're

298
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.830
right. I just copied it
into note pad and I

299
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.810
got question marks. So that
is an it more of

300
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.170
a, for lack of a
better word, obscure a font

301
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.280
it's It's less recently supported
by. Yeah. So it's actually

302
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.660
an active development right now.
Okay. Interesting. Yeah. I want

303
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.460
to be respectful of what
the right, what the right

304
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.620
language is to use when
referring to these things, because

305
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.580
we can use words like
niche or minority languages, but

306
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.500
what does that really mean?
It just means that there's

307
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.260
not millions and millions of
people and that have heard

308
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.600
of it, but it's still
either actively used in written

309
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.300
languages. Yeah, that's right. So
I don't, I actually don't

310
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.030
know how many people speak.
Chakma it's just one that

311
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:06.620
I was been in, in
recent development. So I was

312
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:12.170
quite aware of it. So
key man on the web

313
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.770
and key man on a
windows, and they'll also Mac

314
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.060
and Android, is this sharing
the same core engine or

315
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.210
is this the same thing
written multiple times? It's the

316
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.780
same thing written multiple times.
There are some shared, there

317
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:33.560
is some shared functionality. So
the iOS, Android, and web

318
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.910
actually all share the JavaScript
engine. And that's actually kind

319
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.760
of cool. There's a reason
for that. Is that on

320
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.430
iOS, you weren't allowed to
write a, an interpreter. So

321
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.970
Apple's app store rules said
you couldn't write a, an

322
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.560
interpreter. And so we figured
that given that came keyboards

323
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.240
are effectively a programming language
for a software program that

324
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.900
the be good chance would
be have our app projected

325
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.390
at some point, if we
tried to write it and

326
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.890
you interpreted for those keyboards,
But then when, when Apple

327
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:12.030
iOS eight came out where
you could have system-wide keyboards,

328
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.580
that gives you the opportunity
to jump in in a

329
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.310
much, very, in a very
legitimate way and write your

330
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.400
own keyboard. But then how
do you support fonts for

331
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.830
languages that Apple doesn't support?
How do you render something

332
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.940
like that? Apple that there's
two halves to that story.

333
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.380
One is the actual letter
shapes themselves. And the other

334
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.020
one is the, the rendering
engine that takes the letter

335
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.840
shapes and puts them together
in the right order and

336
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.440
in the right place. So
the render, we have very

337
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.730
little control over because it's
very deep in the system,

338
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.850
but we can install fonts.
So for about probably 90%

339
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.570
of the languages that we
work with, apples renderer already

340
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.760
copes with the, with the
shapes, even if they don't

341
00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.090
supply a font. So, and
there is a way because

342
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.680
we can install a font.
That means that we can

343
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.310
actually do what we need
to, to use that language

344
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.440
on iOS. Interesting. And do
you have telemetry or ways

345
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.390
to tell that people are
using this? I mean, are

346
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:16.290
there any languages that you
support where you legitimately don't

347
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.090
know if anyone's even using
it, but it was important

348
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.960
to do because you wanted
to do it. So Almost

349
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.020
every single keyboard that's out
there was submitted by somebody

350
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.010
else, not by me. So
it was maybe 10% of

351
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.770
them were ones that I
created and other ones that

352
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.430
I was working with, and
most of the time, those

353
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.810
ones were keyboards, where I
was working with somebody else

354
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.910
who had a need. And
then I created the keyboard

355
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:48.210
for them. There's the keyboard
aspect, which is the input,

356
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.900
there's the rendering of the
cliff. But then for, also

357
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.890
for languages that have diacritical
marks and things, where there

358
00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:00.510
is multiple keystrokes to get
a thing like Ooredoo, for

359
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:05.130
example, you type something and
then hit space and then

360
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:11.580
it fundamentally changes something else
that is that swapping Unicode

361
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.190
lifts out for different things.
Is that, is there an

362
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:20.190
engine because that's not just
like, like ethnocentric, monolingual, people,

363
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.520
people who speak just English,
they are used to typing

364
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.190
one key and one thing
happens. And the only time

365
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:27.930
any kind of cording comes
along is when you hit

366
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.020
shift and something else. But
the idea that you type

367
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.440
three, four, or five characters
and then hit space and

368
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.890
then something totally different happens.
It's very kind of lack

369
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.470
of a better word foreign
to them. Yeah. I'm curious

370
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.690
what magic is going on
there because it's more than

371
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.320
just a visual keyboard and
it's more than just font

372
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.250
rendering. That's right. Yeah. So
that's kind of where came

373
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.100
in the power of Keevon
comes in and where it

374
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:57.560
moves beyond what ms. Kelsey
can do, for example. So

375
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.590
what we have in Cayman
is what we call contextual

376
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.350
input. So we look at
what's already in the tech

377
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.060
store or on screen for
the more visual description. And

378
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.860
then we combine that along
with a keystroke and transform

379
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.530
what's already on screen with
that key stroke into an

380
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.810
output. So for instance, if
you have an a, and

381
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.560
then you type combining acute
Mark, it may, instead of

382
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.700
having two characters in a,
and a combining acute character,

383
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.330
actually remove the, a from
the tech store and put

384
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.510
in an a with combining
an acute or a with

385
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:39.910
acute as a single character,
You have to keep that

386
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.060
stack around though, because presumably
then when I hit backspace,

387
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.040
I don't mean to remove
the character. I need to

388
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.130
back up the thing I
just did. Yes and no.

389
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.710
Yeah. Backspace is an interesting
one. We've we've had lots

390
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.490
of discussions about backspace. Oh,
that's a good point. Like

391
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:58.270
I just typed in ODU
and typed four characters to

392
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:03.340
get one, then hit backspace
and it backed up one

393
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:09.880
logical step rather than removing
the one logical. Yes. And

394
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.420
it depends. So if you
look at Chinese IMS, if

395
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.950
you type backspace after you've
committed your character, it actually

396
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.470
deletes the whole character and
you have to retype it.

397
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.280
Oh, okay. So it does
really depend on, on the

398
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.340
language and how it's working.
So yes, you do have

399
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.880
to maintain a stack or,
or have access to that

400
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.280
context. And that's also an
interesting story. Yeah. I could

401
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.570
definitely see how people, one
person could feel very passionately

402
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.420
that backspace should behave this
way. And other people might

403
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.940
say, Oh, no, of course
not. It's backspace is, is

404
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.730
undo. It's back up a
moment. Not back up everything.

405
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.000
Yeah. So the simple answer
I give to people now

406
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.160
is, well, if you're not
happy, you can create your

407
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.540
own keyboard layout, Which is,
which is interesting because that's

408
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.390
exactly what people do. You've
got, like you said, thousands

409
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:05.320
of keyboards lands. So you
said that when windows keyboard

410
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.380
a maker came along 10,
15 years ago, that that

411
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.420
was a, a moment where
you thought maybe this would

412
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.800
stop when windows seven, then
eight, the 10 of course,

413
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.050
you know that lots of
people, you know, hundreds, I'm

414
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.170
sure people at Microsoft are
trying to make as many

415
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.900
languages as possible work as
well as possible. And I

416
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.900
know that windows 10, for
example, included a lot of

417
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:32.200
really great new support for
Amharic ticketing and cause based

418
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.700
languages. But you, you, you,
there's no reason to stop.

419
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.430
Like you're saying that there's
still considerable value that came

420
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.820
in. Yeah. So there's two
different parts of that. Again,

421
00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:47.460
one, now that it's a,
multi-platform it means that if

422
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.560
somebody does want to create
a layout for a language

423
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.090
they can do at once,
and it's going to work

424
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.930
on the majority of devices
out there, not just on

425
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.280
windows or not just on
Mac. And the other one

426
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.570
is because it's open source.
Now it wasn't, it wasn't

427
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.540
originally, but it is now
it means that, you know,

428
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.810
you've got that freedom, which
you don't necessarily have to

429
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.060
do what you want with
the keyboard. You're not necessarily

430
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.320
dependent on, on what Microsoft's
design choices are. And they

431
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.600
might be great design choices,
but they might not be

432
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.490
the ones you want And
it's not. And Microsoft and

433
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.730
windows itself, isn't for lack
of a better word, actively

434
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.010
trying to thwart this kind
of thing. Like it's, it's

435
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.400
okay to have different keyboards
and different plugins and the

436
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.980
ability to try to use
different stuff. That's not what's

437
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.800
out of the box. Yeah.
I've got a really great

438
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.800
relationship with a lot of
the guys and people at

439
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.050
Microsoft who have supported me
in the past, in developing,

440
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:49.400
came in and filling that
gap. And so I really

441
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.850
appreciate the work they've done
in terms of adding all

442
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:57.110
that extra support in windows
10. And then, and, and

443
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.560
there's a big issue there
in, in some ways, if

444
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.350
the need for key man
went away because the operating

445
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.770
systems did at all, that
wouldn't be a bad, Well,

446
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.360
I'd be a little sad.
I think if I had

447
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.220
spent 20 years working on
it, I might be a

448
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.750
little frustrated. Yeah. It's not
going away anytime soon, but

449
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:18.020
yeah. Well I think maybe
in 10 years, The ability

450
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.870
also to go to flicker,
for example, key man web,

451
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.670
then see a keyboard and
then drag a button to

452
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:29.120
your bookmarklets toolbar and then
suddenly use that keyboard in

453
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.960
your web browser is pretty
extraordinary. Yeah. That's one of

454
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.840
those interesting ones. That was
a, I think I did

455
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.200
that on an airplane trip
just for fun. And then,

456
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:44.390
and then I had to
support it, But you, maybe

457
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.790
you didn't think that was
the use case, but someone

458
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.470
said, Oh, this is perfect.
This is exactly what I

459
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:50.960
needed. I want to plug
my, you know, I'm doing

460
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.650
a blog just for people
who speak Amharic. Therefore I

461
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.930
want to make sure that
they can comment all I

462
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.690
have a browser add in
and a plugin for a

463
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.900
CMS or a web WordPress
that will allow anyone to

464
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.770
comment regardless of operating system
or any limitations that the

465
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.190
computer might have. Yeah. Yeah.
And there's a lot of

466
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:16.220
people who've who have done
that. I think we're based

467
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.100
keyboards also interesting because Google
now have quite a lot

468
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:24.770
available with, I think their
virtual keyboard. So there's a

469
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:27.890
bit of competition out there
for Kamen web, but there

470
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.060
still gets thousands of daily
visitors to the site. So

471
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.500
it seems like, So it's,
it's, we're using it. It's

472
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.750
free now and people are
using it thousands and thousands

473
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.160
and thousands and people can
go to key man, K

474
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.110
E Y M a n.com
or key man web.com and

475
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.480
they can download. And when
they're downloading it, they would

476
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.840
be downloading the keyboard for
their language. Can they download,

477
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.570
like if they were in
Belgium, they could download three

478
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.850
or four keyboards for the
three or four languages they

479
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:01.980
might speak or is it
one per download? They can.

480
00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.730
So basically there's the engine
that came in app, which

481
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.800
they install first and then
they can add as many

482
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.840
keyboard layouts as they need.
So once you've installed the

483
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.510
app, you can just go
and add additional keyboard layouts

484
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.580
with, through, through the app
or through package people, package

485
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.910
files on the web. And
do I understand that you

486
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.240
just launched a beta of
a key man for Mac?

487
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.550
Yes. Yeah. So that's, it's
interesting because I feel like

488
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:36.330
we were going through the
same journey in undocumented space

489
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.250
with Kevin, from Mac, as
we did with Karen, for

490
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:44.370
windows. When we start to
work in, in for lack

491
00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:49.020
of a better word, esoteric
languages, which offering system designers

492
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.150
haven't necessarily even imagined. And
the intersection of that with

493
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:58.080
the lower level keyboard input,
which is usually fairly lightly

494
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.770
documented, we run into all
sorts of interesting problems and

495
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:08.100
unexpected challenges and consistency issues
between applications and how people

496
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.410
deal with backspace and whether
they try and take over

497
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.830
and do their own thing,
that kind of thing. But

498
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.710
in the short term, your
goal, or maybe the longterm

499
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.910
goal is that the keyboards
that already exist are operating

500
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.300
system nonspecific. So if I've
got a keyboard, I'm developing

501
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.030
a keyboard, that's an existing
windows keyboard. For the most

502
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.520
part, I can just bring
that keyboard into the Mac

503
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.430
version. Yes. I think there's
any for the Mac. That's

504
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.830
very much true. There's I
think three or four keyboards,

505
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:41.460
which have Ima functionality, which
pop up user interface, which

506
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.480
would have to be rewritten
for Mac, but yeah, vast

507
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.570
majority are straight over. All
right. And all of this

508
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:55.950
is on GitHub at github.com/key
man app, correct? Yes. Fantastic.

509
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.560
I assume that you would
not be a, you would

510
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.810
not turn away good help
from smart people who might

511
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.880
want to get involved in
open source and get involved

512
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.120
with key man. I would
be very, very welcome. Yeah.

513
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:10.440
So we were a small,
small team as, as these

514
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.530
things always are and can
never do all the things

515
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.280
we want to do. Fantastic.
Well, if you speak another

516
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.990
language that is not English,
I would encourage you to

517
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.530
check out <inaudible> dot com
and of course get hub.com/key

518
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.290
man app. Thank you so
much, Marc Durden for chatting

519
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.810
with me today. Well, thank
you. It's been a pleasure.

520
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.680
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

521
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:39.720
you again next week. <inaudible>.
