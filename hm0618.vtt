<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.720
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.780
I'm talking with dr. Christus
<inaudible>. She is the research

10
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.410
manager of the quantum architectures
and computation group at Microsoft.

11
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.050
How are you? I'm great.
Thanks for having me on

12
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.290
the show. Oh, thanks for
coming on the show. It's

13
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.740
overwhelming to even think about
something like quantum computing and

14
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.150
I appreciate you being available
and being so flexible in

15
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.550
talking about this. I've actually
been watching all of your

16
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.430
videos and YouTube and reading
articles and trying to get

17
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.810
my head around this because
the word quantum is one

18
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.750
of those words that I
think we, the, the lay

19
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.560
people attach a lot of
mysterious and mystical things too.

20
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.450
So I wanted to talk
about it in a very

21
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.780
concrete way. Is there a
quantum computer yet? Well, that's

22
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.210
a, that's a great question.
Yes, quantum computers exist today

23
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.420
actually, and really they've been
around in a very small,

24
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.800
early form for several years
now. And really our goal

25
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.310
now is to see a
quantum computer scale up, right?

26
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.870
So we have these preliminary
quantum computers. They can't do

27
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.500
anything more powerful than your
classical computers, but as we

28
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.160
scale them up, you know,
the promise is that on

29
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.940
certain problems, they're going to
far outperform what we can

30
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.930
do with your, you know,
your typical processing, your, your

31
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.630
conventional computing, the conventional computing
you have today. So some

32
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.660
problems that you would want
to run and, and solve

33
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.890
using conventional computers, even if
that's say a supercomputer, some

34
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.650
problems will actually take billions
and billions of years to

35
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.890
find a solution. And these,
you know, some of these

36
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.130
problems with a quantum computer,
a scaled up quantum computer,

37
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.470
you'll actually be able to
solve them in a matter

38
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.670
of hours, hours, or days.
So that's a pretty substantial

39
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.920
impact. Does that mean that
it is a and again,

40
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.840
all my questions are going
to be ignorant. So just

41
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.330
assume I'm saying, forgive my
ignorance in front of everything

42
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.920
that I say, is that
because the quantum computer is

43
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.490
faster or is it because
it's taking shortcuts? Yeah. Yeah.

44
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.280
It's a very nuanced change
here. So when we save

45
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.590
faster, you know, the clock
rate of the quantum computer

46
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.630
actually isn't necessarily faster than
your conventional computer clock rate,

47
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.950
right? You're looking at something
that might be maybe a

48
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.430
hundred nanoseconds, 1,000 nanoseconds up
to a microsecond for a

49
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.790
clock rate. That's not faster
than conventional clock rates. But

50
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.180
the key is that when
you look at the algorithms,

51
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.280
right, the applications that you're
going to run on a

52
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.200
quantum computer, the number of
operations in those algorithms or

53
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.970
in those applications is so,
so much, fewer, so much

54
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.790
less than the number of
operations you would need to

55
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.440
do on your conventional computer.
That indeed that the ultimate

56
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.090
runtime to find the solution
is much, much faster. Interesting.

57
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.690
Okay. That makes me feel
like maybe a quantum computer,

58
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.100
isn't a generalized thing. It's
more like a GPU or

59
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.270
a coprocessor for math. Yeah,
exactly. We like to, we

60
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.390
like to think about quantum
computers really as an accelerator,

61
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.040
right? So imagine Azure, right.
I, I work at Microsoft,

62
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.890
so we have Microsoft Azure.
We have this amazing cloud

63
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.650
computing platform. And what do
we bring to the cloud?

64
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.430
We bring to the cloud,
many different types of processing

65
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.280
and compute options, whether that's
GPU, FPGA CPU, right. And

66
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.080
another one of those options
is going to be your

67
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.090
quantum chip, your quantum computer,
your quantum accelerator. And so

68
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.690
indeed you're not going to
run every, you know, every

69
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.570
problem you want to solve
on a quantum computer, you're

70
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.680
really gonna target it for
a special class of problems

71
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.850
or for a sub-routine within
your algorithm. You're going to,

72
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.120
you know, design algorithms in
a hybrid way. You might

73
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.120
use your GPU for some
data processing and then send

74
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.630
that data after that, to
your quantum chip. Right? So

75
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.430
you can really operate in
this hybrid, you know, this

76
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.580
hybrid compute environment. Hmm. It
seems to me like the,

77
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.840
the industry and the, you
know, the wired magazines are

78
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.240
kind of going nuts because
it's just so fun to

79
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.450
say quantum, you know, it's
just one of those mystical

80
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.740
words and there's, they're making
big statements around how this

81
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.460
is going to change everything.
And because, you know, so

82
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.230
many of us have been
in tech for so long.

83
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.570
It feels like every 20
minutes, there's something that's going

84
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.000
to change everything, whether it
be AI or ML, or

85
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.150
is it going to change
everything, or do you think

86
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.120
the hype machine maybe is
going too far? I think

87
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.750
it's going to change quite
a lot. Everything might be

88
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.000
a little extreme, but I
think we will see revolutionary

89
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.310
level changes coming from being
able to actually quantum compute

90
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.380
the types of problems we're
looking at solving with a

91
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.550
quantum computer are, you know,
I, I believe world world

92
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.100
changing, right? We're looking at
solving things that really give

93
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.660
us more knowledge, you know,
about how to better more

94
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.920
efficiently produce food or, you
know, combat things like global

95
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.370
warming. You know, these are
no small scale problems. We're

96
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.670
looking at problems that were,
you know, the human race

97
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.810
needs to face and solve.
Quantum computers can help us

98
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.190
find solutions to this level
of problem. Of course, we'll

99
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.450
do it in conjunction with
our conventional computing and supercomputers

100
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.160
and everything else. It will
be a hybrid style solution,

101
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.020
but quantum computers will be
a key, absolute critical piece

102
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.230
to finding solutions for these,
this scale of problem. There

103
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.750
was a time when I
would buy a, a three

104
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.670
86 SX that didn't have
a coprocessor and Excel would

105
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.350
use it or not use
it depending on whether it

106
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.510
was there. And there was
a time when I could

107
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.630
buy a voodoo graphics card
and get better graphics or

108
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.420
not. Will there be a
time that I'll be able

109
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.190
to go and buy a
card and pop it into

110
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.750
my machine and it'll have
a quantum coprocessor? Or do

111
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.850
you think this is something
that's going to be relegated

112
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.510
to giant refrigerators in the
cloud? Yeah, I think more

113
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.670
and more, we're moving to
more of a cloud based

114
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.990
model across compute more generally,
right? Because you're going to

115
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.020
have your data stored in
the cloud. You have apps

116
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.170
and services in the cloud,
and then, you know, you

117
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.040
need not buy the chip
or the card to put

118
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.020
into your local PC. You
can access an amazing set

119
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.520
of resources in the cloud.
So I think ultimately we're

120
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.450
seeing a move to, you
know, broader and broader cloud

121
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.440
compute. And in that environment,
of course, we'll sit these

122
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.640
quantum chips that you will
have access to. It is

123
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.120
also the case that a
quantum computer, at least most

124
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.540
of the paths to realizing
a quantum computer, including the

125
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.500
path we're taking at Microsoft,
indeed the quantum computer is

126
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.570
operating in a very low
temperature environment, a millikelvin temperatures.

127
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.930
And that means we need
a, what's called a dilution

128
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.220
refrigerator around it. So popping
a dilution refrigerator into your

129
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.330
local PC, it probably isn't
going to happen. And that's

130
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:35.020
another reason. Yeah, exactly. But
you know, definitely having access

131
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.690
to those devices in the
cloud that will make it

132
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:43.180
accessible for everyone. Interesting. Now
you have a, a PhD,

133
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.880
but you also worked in
machine learning and, and things

134
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.540
like that are quantum computers
and machine learning intermingled, or

135
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.960
is that just your career
path? Well, yeah, it's pretty

136
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.070
remarkable. You know, I did
a PhD, quantum computing, and

137
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.580
then when I joined Microsoft,
I, I studied and did

138
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.390
research and machine learning for
web ranking for, for several

139
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.970
years. And at that time
that was over a decade

140
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.110
ago. I didn't yet see
the crossing between the two,

141
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.980
the two opportunities that I
had taken with quantum computing

142
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:22.170
and machine learning. And now
it's, it's such, we're, we're

143
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.890
really looking at quantum machine
learning. So it was pretty,

144
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.460
pretty, it was great happenstance
that I studied both of

145
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.810
these subjects. And now we're
really diving into what will

146
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.820
quantum computing bring and lend
to machine learning and AI,

147
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.810
what kind of, you know,
what does quantum mechanics bring

148
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:49.800
to machine learning? How can
we take cues from modeling

149
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.500
and computing? You know, the
type of modeling and computing

150
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.950
nature does, how do we
take those cues and build

151
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:03.870
better models of vision, speech,
you know, language, text data,

152
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.620
right? Can you take something
that fundamentally has some quantum

153
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.100
mechanical elements to it say
a quantum model, can that

154
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.730
quantum model better represent data
or bring new insights? It's

155
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.240
absolutely fascinating that now with
a quantum computer, you have,

156
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.590
you really have a better
glimpse into how nature computes.

157
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.630
And with that, it, it's
fun to think about the

158
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.620
promise that that brings for
machine learning. So, so indeed

159
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.100
now quantum machine learning is,
is an area that we're

160
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.110
definitely investigating quite a lot.
And we see improvements coming

161
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.880
from quantum models of data.
We see speed ups ways

162
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.560
to better train deep neural
nets. You can get faster

163
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.210
training of models, you can
get better approximations of data

164
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.860
and so forth. So you
said something really powerful in

165
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.040
the middle there where you
said, how nature itself computes.

166
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.380
I've heard a number of
people in pliers and not

167
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.930
more than just implies, say
that nature is a big

168
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.870
computer and this isn't necessarily
the Elon Musk, we're all

169
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.110
in the matrix theory. But
the idea that in order

170
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.290
for nature to simply be,
it has to calculate. And

171
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.590
it seems like quantum computing
is, is trying to take

172
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.410
some of that spare CPU
for lack of a better

173
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.130
word and do something with
it. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah,

174
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.620
you can think of nature
as a, is a big

175
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.700
computer, right? It's it's clock
rig is much, much faster

176
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.140
than the quantum computer, but
indeed, you know, with a

177
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.170
quantum computer, what you're able
to do is really simulate

178
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.890
physical systems, right? At the
core, what are we doing?

179
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.670
We're evolving, what's called Schrodinger's
equation, right? Which, which tells

180
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.480
us how state evolves, how
these quantum mechanical States evolve

181
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.480
over time. And by being
able to actually model that

182
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.050
and compute, make it digital,
even make it able to

183
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.860
be error corrected. You know,
we're, we're basically getting a

184
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:08.170
step closer to being able
to take a computational, you

185
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.290
know, hammer to some of
the problems that nature is

186
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:16.720
solving every day. Things like
we think about quantum chemistry

187
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.280
or materials, you know, nature,
you go outside, you see,

188
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.480
you know, things are growing,
right. Trees are growing leaves.

189
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.810
You know, you have grass
and flowers and all of

190
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.510
these things are growing. Right.
And nature's just doing that.

191
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.070
Now, if we can understand
better how we produce, you

192
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.850
know, how does nature produce
fertilizer? How do they perform?

193
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.890
What's called nitrogen fixation so
efficiently. We, we don't perform

194
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.480
a nitrogen fixation in the
lab near as efficiently as

195
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.830
nature does it with microbes
in the ground. But now

196
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.140
with a quantum computer, we
can begin to actually study

197
00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.500
these microbes, understand how do
these organisms actually produce fertilizers

198
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.800
so efficiently, and then try
to model that, mimic it,

199
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.010
engineer it, and then come
up with a much better

200
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.840
procedure, just that alone, studying
what we called nitrogen fixation,

201
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:18.580
the process that we use
to produce artificial fertilizer with

202
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.350
that, we, we actually could
end up saving something like

203
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.960
3% of the world's natural
gas today. We use something

204
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.230
like 3% of the world's
natural gas just to produce

205
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.800
artificial fertilizer in labs. So
if we can make that

206
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.250
more efficient, that could be
huge. So that's an example

207
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.020
of modeling nature, right? With
a quantum computer, Right. And

208
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.280
looking at like the idealist
view of the nitrogen cycle

209
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.370
and doing the right thing
to make it go effectively,

210
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.880
as opposed to artificially manufacturing
fertilizer and plugging it into

211
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.150
that cycle. Yeah. See if
we can engineer an artificial

212
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:58.380
system, actually, a catalyst that
really mimics what nature does

213
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.820
in that process. You mentioned
shorting her. And as most

214
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.380
laymen myself included know about
the Schrodinger's cat concept, where

215
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.870
you put the cat in
the box, the cat is

216
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.600
either alive or dead. And
the theory is that there's

217
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.170
a, a quantum superposition where
the, for a time the

218
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.160
cat is both alive and
dead. Is that something that's

219
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.190
just come into popular culture
or does that, that theory

220
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.940
or that concept really model
a real problem that the

221
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.500
quantum computing tries to solve?
Right? Well, yes, the cat

222
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:37.290
of course is a very
macroscopic object, but indeed the

223
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.280
idea behind Schrodinger's cat, right?
The idea that you have

224
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.580
this black box, right? You
have this box and if

225
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.520
you don't open the box
right inside the box, the

226
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.220
cat is both alive and
dead. But when you open

227
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.980
the box, the cat is
either alive or dead. The

228
00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.290
whole idea of this is
it's really what's happening at

229
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.970
the information level in your
quantum computer. So inside your

230
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.300
conventional computer, your classical computer,
as a, as we, we

231
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:14.720
call it sometimes our bits,
right? Binary units of information,

232
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.140
that can be zero or
one, right? Your, your conventional

233
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.560
computer is like, it has
switches they're on or off.

234
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:28.160
Now a quantum computer inside
has cubits quantum bits. And

235
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.370
these quantum bits can take
on just as you just

236
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.640
said, what's called a superposition
of States, this alive and

237
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.650
dead notion. The superposition of
States, what it means is

238
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.200
a cubit can be both
zero and one simultaneously when

239
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.040
it's operating inside the quantum
computer. Now the catch is

240
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.040
when I look at my
cubit. So I measure my

241
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.610
cubit from the outside world,
from our macroscopic world. I

242
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.950
want to get information out
of my, you know, out

243
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.700
of my quantum computer, I
measure the state, it becomes

244
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.810
zero or one. And it
becomes that with a probability

245
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.540
associated to what's called the
amplitude of the state, which

246
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:11.240
it goes into more detail
than we probably want to

247
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.120
get into on the podcast.
But the whole idea of

248
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.120
being it really is inside
the quantum computer. It's like

249
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.850
having all of these cats,
all of these Schrodinger cats

250
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.240
operating together. And then at
the end of the computation,

251
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.910
we measure the system and
we get out of state.

252
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.640
So if I had eight
cats or eight bits, all

253
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.860
in a row, are they
alternating between all possible States

254
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.990
and all potential eight, you
know, 256 or whatever eight

255
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.220
bits is worth of, of
States. And then at the

256
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.950
end, by observing them, I
forced the, I force its

257
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.380
hand. I forced the universe
is hand, and then it

258
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:55.540
gives me a value, right?
So If you remove the

259
00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.940
word alternating, so it's not
that it's oscillating or, or

260
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.030
kind of doing a path,
then another path and another

261
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.380
path, it's actually doing it
in parallel. So inside the

262
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.010
quantum computer, you have eight,
let's say eight cubits, those

263
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.070
eight cubits, as you just
said, you have two to

264
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:19.960
the eight actual States, then
256 States and your quantum

265
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.600
computer is simultaneously operating across
all of those 256 States.

266
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.210
Hm. So all of the
answers are existing at the

267
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.870
same time until we forced
it. And again, I apologize

268
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.120
for using these terms that
I'm sure are incorrect, but

269
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.940
until we force its hand
or we observe it. And

270
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.310
then the, the, it is
the observation that causes the

271
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.550
universe to make the decision.
Exactly. So as soon as

272
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:50.610
we measure, so to observe
it, we measure the, and

273
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.070
when we measure it, we're,
we're saying, give me back

274
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.370
out a class, you know,
one of these States, one

275
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.270
of the 256 States, and
it'll come back to me

276
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.360
in a bit string, right.
So I get that bit

277
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.730
string back, but I get
only one of the 250,

278
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.950
60 it's back when I
measure the system. So how

279
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.130
do you know it's the
right one, if you can,

280
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.710
all of my knowledge of
this, isn't entirely, entirely based

281
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.590
on watching black mirror. So
maybe I'm not prepared to

282
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.010
interview you, but does not
that mean that there are,

283
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.510
I have no way of
knowing if the answer I

284
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.730
got back is the right
one, because there could be

285
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.540
255 other doctors for his,
that are out there enjoying

286
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.780
their answer, which is different.
Right? So at the surface,

287
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.680
it seems that way. Right.
But what's pretty remarkable is

288
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.190
that you can design this
algorithm. It's like, you know,

289
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.680
when you create a, a
recipe to bake a cake,

290
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.840
right, you could say, I'm
going to throw all these

291
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.670
ingredients together. And I don't
know if it's going to

292
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.900
come out chocolate or vanilla
or, you know, but, well,

293
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.260
we don't really do that.
Right. We design the recipes

294
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.550
so that we make a
chocolate cake, right? The output

295
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.530
ultimately needs to be the
chocolate cake and not the

296
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:01.460
vanilla cake here. Same thing.
You know, we are going

297
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.730
to design the algorithm, just
like we design classical algorithms,

298
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:08.000
just like we design algorithms
for our conventional computers. We

299
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.750
have an idea of exactly
what output we want. And

300
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.470
so we set up the
sequence of operations to optimize

301
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.730
for getting that output out.
And we can do that

302
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.820
in the quantum computer as
well. And what this comes

303
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:28.040
to is an idea of
what's called interference, quantum interference.

304
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.190
What we're really doing is
if you think of these

305
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.270
States, right? In the example,
you gave 256 States, right?

306
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.900
Imagine them each is a
wave in a tide pool.

307
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.420
And when waves collide, they
grow, right. The amplitude increases,

308
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.830
some waves will grow and
some waves actually will cancel

309
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:53.390
out and disappear. Right. And
so just imagine, you know,

310
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.300
touching your finger to a
tide pool and then touching

311
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.820
your finger again and watching
these waves collide with some

312
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.710
growing, some collapsing. That's what
we actually program is to

313
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.970
get some of these waves
to increase in amplitude in

314
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.430
the height of the wave
and some of them to

315
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.370
disappear. Now, if you imagine
each of these waves is

316
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.680
one of these States, that
means I can get some

317
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.190
of them to disappear out
of the computation and some

318
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.580
of them to really amplify.
And as I amplify them,

319
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.840
when I measure the system,
the most amplified wave has

320
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.750
the highest probability of being
the state that I measure

321
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.840
at the end. So if
I can get my solution

322
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.430
to be in that high
amplitude wave, I'm, I'm pretty,

323
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.380
you know, I'm pretty golden
in terms of getting the

324
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.160
solution out that I need.
And every quantum algorithm then

325
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.760
is a probabilistic algorithm. So
if I didn't get the

326
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.900
answer wanted, or, you know,
I want to check, I'm

327
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.880
going to run the algorithm
just a couple of times,

328
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.220
because with high probability, I'm
going to get the state

329
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.160
out that I want because
I've sculpted the solution, the

330
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.550
algorithm in a way that
this high amplitude wave has

331
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.040
the, has the right answer
in it. That's interesting when

332
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.080
I, that makes me think
about in the context of

333
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.750
the many worlds theory that,
how do you know that

334
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.910
with a universe that we're
in is the real one

335
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.940
it's because it's the most
likely one because we're in

336
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.520
it. If we weren't in
it, it wouldn't be the

337
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.990
most likely one. Yeah, there
you go. Now, when someone

338
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.650
says a cubit, I've heard
people say that cubits are

339
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.430
our two States, like you
said, where the, you can

340
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.380
be in a superposition, but
then I've also heard other

341
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:38.130
explanations where one bit can
contain multiple dimensions for lack

342
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.100
of a better word, like
24 or more different, you

343
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.810
know, up, down left. Right.
And all these kinds of

344
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.140
things. Can you maybe explain
that? Is that a confusion

345
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.680
or an oversimplification? I heard
Justin Trudeau explain that once.

346
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.890
And it didn't quite sound
right. He did a pretty

347
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.950
good job when he was
interviewed on quantum, quantum computing.

348
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.880
I thought. Yeah. So indeed.
So, so let's go back

349
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.660
to this notion of a
quantum bit, right? Okay. Bit

350
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:09.300
is, is base, you know,
two level system, a binary

351
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.530
system. So when we say
cubit, we mean it's a,

352
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.060
it's a, a two level
system. The cubit has two

353
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:24.720
possible States, zero, zero, or
one. But again, those States

354
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.890
can be in super position.
So it's actually in the

355
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:35.130
state zero and one, but
it can take any combination,

356
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:39.150
any linear combination of zero
and one. So what this

357
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:44.160
means visually is think about
a sphere, right? Like a

358
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.690
ball. And imagine, you know,
the surface of this ball,

359
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.960
what it means is if
I take this ball at

360
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.870
say at the North pole
is the state zero at

361
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.170
the South pole is the
state one. Now my cubic

362
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.290
can take any point on
the surface of the sphere,

363
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.800
any point on the surface
of the ball, that cubit

364
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.400
state. So it could be
just in the zero state.

365
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.530
It could be just in
the one state, or it

366
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.110
can be any combination of
zero and one, meaning it

367
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.710
could take any point on
the sphere as its state.

368
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.330
So it's still a two
level system. If you want,

369
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.640
you know, higher level systems,
then you could go to,

370
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.810
you know, we talk about
ternary ternary would be a

371
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.640
three-level system. So acute TriNet,
a D level system, you

372
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.780
know, we're D as arbitrary
as a Q DIT, but

373
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.490
you know, most of the
time we think about just

374
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.710
cubits and mapping everything to
binary. So simplistically, if I

375
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.970
looked at a sphere, my
intuition might indicate that there

376
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.060
would be more degrees of
freedom than just those, that

377
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.910
between zero and one, I
might think about, you know,

378
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.240
X, Y, and Z, but
that's not necessarily the case,

379
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.350
is it okay? Well, no,
indeed you can think about

380
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.080
it in more degrees of
freedom. In fact, what is

381
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.910
it, a cubit it's, it's,
it's a comp it's hard

382
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.370
to describe some of these
mathematical principles on the, on

383
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.850
the podcast, but the idea
being that let's take some

384
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.560
value alpha and some value
beta, my cubic can take

385
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.760
the state alpha times the
state zero plus beta times

386
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.910
the state one and alpha
and beta are complex numbers.

387
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.860
So we are operating, we
didn't go into that on

388
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.920
this sphere, but the we're
actually operating in a complex

389
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.030
valued space. Okay. And that
is difficult. Not only to

390
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.610
explain in a, in three
dimensions, drawing a picture, it's

391
00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.470
even more difficult when you
consider the fact that we're

392
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.160
on a podcast nearly through
time itself. So I appreciate

393
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.360
your patience. Yeah. So these
are the elements that we

394
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.580
use, but I would not
necessarily do all of this

395
00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.920
work in C sharp. I
understand that there's a quantum

396
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.880
developer's kit that people can
download and I can program,

397
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.120
you know, the problems that
I want to with. I

398
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.640
can think about them outside
in C sharp, put the

399
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.150
quantum appropriate things into the
dev kit. And I can

400
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.130
simulate that even on my
laptop, if I want it

401
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:13.300
to Exactly, we're really thrilled
that we just released the

402
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:18.040
Microsoft quantum development kit. And
as part of this kit,

403
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.750
we've released a brand new
quantum focused programming language called

404
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.170
Q sharp. And the whole
idea here is that we

405
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.900
need a new language because
these principles that we've just

406
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.120
been walking through together, super
position interference, right? This notion

407
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.450
of cubits that take on
these different States, you know,

408
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.550
we need a language that
allows you to express these

409
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.400
things easily and at a
high enough level that you

410
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.990
can bring together, you know,
different aspects of quantum computing

411
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.680
and quantum mechanics together to
make a solution for, you

412
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.050
know, for an application that
you're interested in doing so.

413
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.340
So with the Microsoft quantum
development kit, we've put out

414
00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:02.020
this, you know, this, this
high level, very accessible language,

415
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:06.520
Q sharp, which builds on
many of the ideas behind

416
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.390
languages like C sharp and
F sharp. So it should

417
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.840
look very familiar. It's embedded
in visual studio. So you

418
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.510
get syntax highlighting debugging, you
know, it, it feels very

419
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.050
familiar to the developer. And
then with that inside the

420
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.500
quantum development kit, we've also
released a whole set of

421
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:31.030
samples, tutorials libraries, right? So
you have all these libraries

422
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.660
at your fingertips that you
can pull together and call

423
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:39.730
on to actually build a
quantum application for, you know,

424
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:43.560
a quantum solution for, for
an application you're interested doing.

425
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.960
Plus we have tutorials. So
if you want to learn,

426
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.770
gosh, how does quantum teleportation
work? We have a whole

427
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.520
sample and it's written in
Q sharp. You know, the

428
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.340
language is well-documented. So you
can walk through and begin

429
00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.720
to develop some intuition around
quantum computing. And the hope

430
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.340
is that by making quantum
computing accessible to a broad

431
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.270
audience, we're going to see
just amazing solutions come out

432
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.660
of the community in terms
of what, what will we

433
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.450
do with a quantum computer
and what will the key

434
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.760
killer applications be? One of
the things that I was

435
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.280
a little overwhelmed to hear
was that if I was

436
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.170
going to do local work,
30 cubits takes about 16

437
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:33.530
gigs of Ram 31 cubits
doubles the memory. Right. Right.

438
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.960
So, so what's great. I
should also mention in the

439
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.050
quantum development kit, and you
mentioned this earlier, is that

440
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.020
it not only comes with
the language and the samples,

441
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:47.390
but also a target simulator,
the simulator allows you to

442
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.080
simulate what would happen on,
as you just said, 30

443
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:57.560
cubits in roughly 16 gigs
of Ram. Now doubling again,

444
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.430
going back to the state
space, one more cubit requires

445
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:07.010
doubling the amount of memory.
And so locally, you're looking

446
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:11.150
at, you know, around 30
cubits for simulation, which again,

447
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.780
that's released as part of
the, the kit. But as

448
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.950
you go to say, 40,
you know, 41, 42 cubits,

449
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.270
you know, you're looking at
running on, we've released a

450
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.930
state of the art simulator
in Azure to allow you

451
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.660
to run on that scale
because after all, when you

452
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:35.420
get to just 230 250
cubits, you're looking at scaling

453
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.960
to more memory than there
are particles in the visible

454
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.350
universe. So when you think
about that 200 and, you

455
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:47.000
know, 250 cubit sounds so
small, but the, the amount

456
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.530
of information in 250 cubits
is more information that we

457
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.730
could store in particles in
the visible universe. But you're

458
00:28:55.730 --> 00:29:00.560
talking about simulating a quantum
computer on a surface book.

459
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.170
When I then run my
code and move it from

460
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:08.060
local into Azure. Am I
simply simulating it in Azure

461
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.950
using their classical or standard
computers? Or is there in

462
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.410
fact, a quantum computer in
Azure, or is it really

463
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.840
that we're setting ourselves up
for some theoretical future where

464
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.870
there is a quantum computer
now, Right. It's really that

465
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.930
we're setting ourselves up to
take the code that you're

466
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.470
writing today. You can simulate
it today in Azure. So

467
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:31.520
you're simulating it within a
classical computing, conventional computing environment

468
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:36.890
using the Azure compute. And
then that same code when

469
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:40.340
we have a, you know,
scaled up quantum computer that

470
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.870
sitting in Azure, that same
code will then be able

471
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.950
to be deployed on that
compute in Azure, on the

472
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.420
quantum computer Platform. I see.
So this is so to

473
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.420
oversimplify things, cause that's what
I'm so good at. It's

474
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.230
like before GPU is I
might want to go and

475
00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.300
render the movie toy story.
I could write all the

476
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.750
code for some theoretical GPU.
I simulate it locally and

477
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.170
it takes an hour for
every frame, fast forward, 20

478
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.480
years. And now we could
render toy story. And in

479
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.210
real time on an Nvidia
card that we have on

480
00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.690
our PC. Yeah, exactly. Right.
I would say we're not

481
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.240
on the 20 year timeframe
though. You know, the idea

482
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.210
would be that this would
happen in more like a,

483
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.810
less than five year timeframe
to really scale to a

484
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:29.430
larger, larger quantum application. And
as we talked about in

485
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.430
the beginning of the podcast,
you know, already today, quantum

486
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.940
hardware exists and you're looking
at, you know, small numbers

487
00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.280
of cubits, but the number
of cubits we have today

488
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.020
in the community is less
than what you can simulate.

489
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.010
So by being able to
run on a simulator saying

490
00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.550
an Azure, that's giving you
access to the equivalent of,

491
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:56.310
you know, like 40 cubits.
So let me ask one

492
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.900
final question that I think
will be good way to

493
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.810
end the show for people
who are listening, who might

494
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.540
be going to work, and
maybe they're doing, you know,

495
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:08.640
text boxes over data and
not particularly amazing stuff from

496
00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.640
a quantum computing perspective, but
they may have a problem

497
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.370
that their business, whatever business
they happen to be in

498
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.300
might need to answer. How
does, how does one know

499
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.450
and determine that they have
a question that is best

500
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:26.280
answered by quantum focused language?
Yeah, that's a great question.

501
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.330
And it's, it's one that
we continue to look into

502
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:33.780
every day. I think the,
you know, some of the

503
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.350
best problems to solve on
a quantum computer are those

504
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:42.120
where you're simulating a physical
system, a quantum mechanical system.

505
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.150
So say you're working on
thing, you know, thinking about

506
00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.180
things in materials, material science.
I want to think about

507
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.530
an exotic property of a
material. I want to think

508
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.620
about catalysis. You know, how
do I make a chemical

509
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.850
reaction, more efficient? And if
that catalyst and that reaction

510
00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.430
involves a heavy metal, then
a quantum computer is a

511
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:07.020
great candidate. Say, I want
to do machine learning. And,

512
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.510
and I I'm doing machine
learning, but I have a

513
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.280
way to maybe process data
down. When we're looking at

514
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.790
near term quantum computers, if
we have too much data,

515
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.430
that's going to be expensive
to do on a quantum

516
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.300
computer. So cases where you
maybe have streaming data or

517
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.100
data that you could process
down and then send to

518
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.310
the quantum computer, for example,
send a sub-routine to the

519
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:37.020
quantum computer to speed up
your machine learning algorithm. And

520
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.400
quantum computers are good, you
know, great at modeling the

521
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.250
physical world. In many cases,
they're great at doing, finding

522
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:53.840
quadratic square root speedups when
searching for solutions. So those

523
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.700
types of problems are things
to think about. Well, thank

524
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.160
you so much for taking
the time to put up

525
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.530
with my questions and for
educating all of us here

526
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.500
on the show. We do
appreciate you. My pleasure. Thank

527
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.320
you for having me on.
And I encourage the listeners

528
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.280
to go to microsoft.com forward
slash quantum and try out

529
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.240
the Microsoft quantum development kit.
Fantastic. I am downloading it

530
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.810
now and it integrates great
with visual studio 2017. Excellent.

531
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.010
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

532
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:25.120
you again next week.
