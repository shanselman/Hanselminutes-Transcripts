10
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.250
written an application that syncs
faces between outlook windows, mobile

11
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.960
and Facebook. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman and this is

12
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.390
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and we are sitting here

13
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.420
today with Mel Sam pet,
a program manager on the

14
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.570
windows mobile team. Thanks for
taking the time to talk

15
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.660
to me today, Mel, and
you have an application that

16
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.030
I just recently installed on
my machine called out sync,

17
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.820
and this is something that
talks to Facebook. It talks

18
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.980
to outlook and it makes
my mobile phone better. So

19
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.920
it's really kind of a,
I, I felt that it

20
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.290
was a pretty complicated thing
cause it, it changed, it

21
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.360
touched lots of aspects of
my lives. It reached into

22
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.190
Facebook, it reached into outlook
and we can, and mobile,

23
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.340
tell me about this application,
what this does. Sure. Hey

24
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.430
Scott, so this application has
called out saying can, what

25
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.570
it does is essentially take
the photos of the people

26
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.270
that you know, on Facebook
that you also have as

27
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.930
contacts within year outlook application,
and it takes those photos

28
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.390
and sinks them and insert
them into your outlook contacts.

29
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.630
And if you've got a
windows mobile device that syncs

30
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.370
up with outlook, whether it's
overactive saying or over the

31
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.470
exchange server, those photos syncope
with windows mobile, with your

32
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.680
windows mobile device. So for,
for the contacts that you

33
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.560
have in both places on
Facebook, as well as outlook,

34
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.510
you would ultimately see those
photos on your phone. And

35
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.720
most of the stuff happens.
The actual sync of this

36
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.420
photos happens automatically. So, so
you got those photos into

37
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.240
your phone and then when
those people call you, you

38
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.280
see those photos on your
caller ID and every time

39
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.050
you opened them up in
your contacts app on your

40
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.920
phone. So it seems like
a pretty straightforward thing, but

41
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.870
there's a lot going on
underneath the covers share. But

42
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.180
for me as a user,
basically I ran this little

43
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.080
app. I logged it into
my Facebook Facebook accounts. I'm

44
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.350
how I told it about
Facebook. I authorized it as

45
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.800
an application and Facebook. Yes,
you have do that. You

46
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.120
have To give the application
permission to access your, your

47
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.340
Facebook account. So of course,
Facebook, for those of you

48
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.290
who aren't on Facebook, and
if you're not on Facebook,

49
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.490
why not is an application
to social networking application. It's

50
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.010
kind of a portal like
it's, you know, a friendlier

51
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.340
version of linked LinkedIn or
Orcutt or one of these

52
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.240
social networking sites. And it's
surprisingly addictive. And now I've

53
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.440
got about 2100 outlook contacts.
Just every time I meet

54
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.000
somebody, every time I get
a business card, I come

55
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.560
back from a convention, I
enter it in. So I'm

56
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.220
obsessive about this. And then
I've got, I dunno, some

57
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.210
couple of thousand friends on,
on Facebook and every one

58
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.190
of those friends has a
face associated with them. So

59
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.310
you're doing an intersection of
those two sets, Correct. Now

60
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.400
the not nice thing about
Facebook is most people that

61
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.610
have a profile on there
usually have a photo. Some

62
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.710
people, when they get started
with Facebook, they don't have

63
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.320
a picture there for privacy
reasons, but eventually I noticed

64
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.790
that most of their friends
have a photo and they

65
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.330
just put a picture out
there. So wouldn't it be

66
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.060
nice if you can grab
the latest and greatest picture

67
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.840
that the person chose for
for himself or herself, and

68
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.910
then get that into your
outlook contacts with the people

69
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.370
that you have in both
places. That's essentially what phase

70
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.700
without sync is meant to
Announcing is not an outlook

71
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.230
add in because I know
that I've got lots of

72
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.460
knots about look addons and
interestingly enough, not really willing

73
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.590
to add anymore. I feel
like I maybe just stabilizing

74
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.940
outlook a bit. So this
is something that I just

75
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.640
run occasionally, maybe run it
twice in the last month.

76
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.800
Right now. That's an interesting
that you brought that up

77
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.590
because I, when I first
started thinking about how I

78
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.840
would present the UI for
out sync, my first instinct

79
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.630
was to create it as
an outlook plugin, our ad.

80
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.720
And so it would be,
you know, like a toolbar

81
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.330
button that you could just
start from within outlook. But

82
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.200
my concern was what you
just mentioned, which is, you

83
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.940
know, people wouldn't want to
do this every single day

84
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.880
just because people people's friends
don't change the photos on

85
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.800
Facebook every single day. So
it just didn't make sense

86
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.480
loaded within the, within the
space of outlook itself. And

87
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.060
you know, maybe you run
it once a week and

88
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.830
you just want it on
demand and it doesn't take

89
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.230
up any memory while you're
not using it. So walk

90
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.360
me through the creation of
this. I mean, you sit

91
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.490
down and you'll file a
new application and just walk

92
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.230
me through what the thought
process was. Sure. So it

93
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.050
requires a, so obviously there
is a bunch of platforms

94
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.770
here, right? One is your
programming against the Facebook API

95
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.700
APIs, second year of programming
with, with outlook itself. And

96
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.510
third, I mean, this is
a desktop application, so it

97
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.830
could be written and managed
code or native code, or,

98
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.570
you know, I had to
make a few decisions there.

99
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.560
And ultimately, I mean, the
goal is that it brings

100
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.360
all this information to your
mobile phone, but strangely enough,

101
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.580
this, this application has no
pieces running on the phone

102
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.790
itself. I mean, the, the
transport of the photos from

103
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.180
outlook to your mobile phone
happens over exchange or Cause

104
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.310
you've always been able to
add pictures to context, correct.

105
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.770
I know people who are
like obsessively take photographs of

106
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.930
the people in their context
lists, but it seemed to

107
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.820
me that if I've already,
I can't go running, running

108
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.400
these 2000 people down. Yeah.
The photos are out there.

109
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.140
We should, we should. Those.
Yep. Yes. So, so the

110
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.600
way I started, this was
first, I would obviously need

111
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.460
access to, you know, the
Facebook information itself. My first

112
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.240
instinct was before I found
out that, you know, Facebook

113
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.390
supports all of these APIs.
I thought, well, maybe I

114
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.810
could screen scrape information from
people's Facebook profiles, as long

115
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.910
as the user gives me
his name and password, but

116
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.510
that just seemed very intrusive
and it didn't seem like

117
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.750
an elegant way to do
it. So I always knew

118
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.970
that Facebook has an API.
It just didn't know how

119
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.470
hard it was to use
in the fifth. It was

120
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.000
all open source, PHP, you
know, stuff, which I really

121
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.250
wasn't very comfortable with. I
was more comfortable with my,

122
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.390
with managed code for using
the.net framework. So, so I

123
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.420
dug around a little bit
on Facebook's developer side and

124
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.990
I found all their rest,
API APIs and Ajax like

125
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.310
code, you know, it didn't
really seem very familiar to

126
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.430
me. So, you know, I
started poking around to see

127
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.200
if anyone's written a managed
wrapper for the rest API

128
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.510
as a Facebook exposes. And
oddly enough, Microsoft has, you

129
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.240
know, a library for Facebook,
which is hosted on code

130
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.260
Plex, which is our open
source, you know, a website.

131
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.360
So this is a part
of the, if I remember

132
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.430
correctly, this is part of
the coding for fun guys,

133
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.770
As an MSDN coding for
fun project, but it evolved.

134
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.290
And now it's actually hosted
on code Plex. So it's

135
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.240
open source and a company.
You know, I forget the

136
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.910
name of the company that
w Microsoft hired to do

137
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.850
this work, but there was
this third party vendor who

138
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.880
actually went and created this
whole framework from Microsoft. And

139
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.330
it's now hosted on, on
code blacks as an opensource

140
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.670
project. And, and the original
MSDN coding for fun framework

141
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.180
is still available. But, but
the one on, on code

142
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.580
flex is newer and it's
got more visions and it's

143
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.830
got more bug fixes and
a few more features. So

144
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.690
what does this API feel
like? I mean, I'm thinking

145
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.690
about if this is ultimately
angled brackets and when we,

146
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.160
we usually say rest a
rest API, but there's rest

147
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.840
in the classical sense. I
think I'll do a show

148
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.310
on rest in the future,
but then there's what we

149
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.110
usually call pox, just plain
old XML, which isn't a

150
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.070
formalized thing. It's basically I
post something and something comes

151
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.590
back and most API APIs
that we, we, when we

152
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.560
say rest are actually underneath
pox, but when you wrap

153
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.830
that in a managed API,
you, you have to ask

154
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.990
yourself, am I going to
start holding state? Or am

155
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.760
I going to make it
look like a real request

156
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.760
response? What does this API
feel like? And how much

157
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.790
does it give away what's
going on underneath? So essentially

158
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.450
what happens is you, you
know, I'm, I'm going to

159
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.520
talk to it from the,
from the managed side, right?

160
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.120
So, so you, you, you
get the assemblies for, you

161
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.000
know, Facebook dot DLL and
Facebook dot web dot DLL.

162
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.810
You, you get them into
your, your solution and then,

163
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.680
you know, you use them.
And then, you know, if

164
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.390
you use a managed framework,
Microsoft provides, you're essentially shielded

165
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.690
from all of the underlying,
you know, rest, API and

166
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.720
XML. It goes back and
forth between the server and

167
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.180
your, your desktop application. What
happens is you, you call

168
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.440
a method on this, within
this Facebook class, which, which

169
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.340
pops a login dialogue, which,
you know, the, the UI

170
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.280
for the logging into Facebook
is also embedded within the

171
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.750
assembly. Really. So as a
desktop application developer, you basically,

172
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.280
you have a control that
you just drop into your

173
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.530
form and you say, this
is where authorization for this

174
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.630
application is going to appear.
The control is part of

175
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.930
this, this framework that the,
to download from code blanks.

176
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.220
So you just drag and
drop it, and you give

177
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.600
it a few properties such
as your application ID, your,

178
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.390
your author ID, your, your,
you know, which, what you

179
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.600
get by registering as a
developer on Facebook's website. Okay.

180
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.810
Okay. So step zero, go
to Facebook's developer website, register

181
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.820
as a developer, and then
indicate your intent to make

182
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.580
an application. Yes. And, you
know, and once you've done

183
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.710
that and that's free, anyone
can do that, right? Any,

184
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.280
any user can just Mark
themselves as a developer by

185
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.670
adding the developer application to
their profiles. So, so once

186
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.340
you've done that, you then
start adding applications to your

187
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.060
profile. Every time you add
a new application, Facebook gives

188
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.030
you a unique, good for
the application, and then the

189
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:19.070
secret phrase for that applicant.
So you take those two

190
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.360
Properties and you put them
into this control that you

191
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.030
dropped into your management project.
This is the property that

192
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.520
you sat on, just the
property. Correct. And, and obviously

193
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.690
you can do it with
code as well. If you

194
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.370
want to do it programmatically,
or if you want to

195
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.900
do it, if you just
want to type it into

196
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.350
the inspector, and then you
just call a method, you

197
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.470
just, I think it's called
login or authorize or something

198
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.120
like that. And, you know,
you just call a method

199
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.270
and then the UI appears
if it needs to. And

200
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.330
then, you know, the cookie
gets set on your, on

201
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.690
your machine, you know, from
within this UI, which, and

202
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:55.070
the UI is essentially a
embedded web browser. So they're

203
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.370
giving you a cookie rather
than giving you some secret

204
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.070
that you have to then
be responsible for storing securely.

205
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.120
Correct. Now, now that's the
case with desktop applications. All

206
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.730
of this is very, very
easy. Now there's another type

207
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.700
of Facebook application that year,
right. Which is a web

208
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.850
application, which is more traditional
Facebook apps that you see

209
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.810
in people's profiles. Like the,
you know, like the movies,

210
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.290
the new starters on the
vampire bites and, and the

211
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.480
favorite cars, a favorite felons,
that kind of stuff right

212
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.850
now for an application that
like that, which is hosted

213
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.650
on the web, you actually
had to do some state

214
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.080
management. You know, you get
a query string from Facebook,

215
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.680
which contains your, your session
key. And then you, you

216
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.600
pass it around to the
pages that you want to

217
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.690
host on Facebook. But for
a desktop application, all of

218
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.270
that stuff is, is, is
as much simpler. That's great.

219
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.920
So you didn't have to
have any shared secrets or

220
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.930
anything. You just, you said,
log me in. And they

221
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.580
said a cookie and that
the cookie gets blown away.

222
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.620
You're prompted to log in
again. Correct. I think it's,

223
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.030
it's really, really easy. So
it was the, once you

224
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.980
logged in, you can just
start, you know, queering, you

225
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.950
can start calling methods on
this, on this Facebook object

226
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.020
that you have, you know,
you can say, you know,

227
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.120
get friends lists. It gives
you like an array of,

228
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.610
of objects, which are, you
know, each of them has

229
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.100
like a friend class. Right.
And then you can, you

230
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.790
can, you know, it's all,
you know, there are just

231
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.490
rich classes that you can
start using. So if you,

232
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.830
there's a classical user, for
example, you know, and if

233
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.810
you, if you look at
the properties of the class,

234
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.790
you have, you know, friends
and name and, And they're

235
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.000
handling the serialization, the destabilization
for you. Exactly. Exactly. This

236
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.620
is something I'm definitely gonna
check out for the, my

237
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.980
weekly source code series, because
I'm always interested to see

238
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.790
how, how much someone is
stretched, abstracts away, the wire

239
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.130
protocol. And it sounds like
in this case, it's complete,

240
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.530
you never, you never debug
this. You never looked at

241
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.990
the wire. Yeah. As, as
a.net developer, you don't have

242
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.760
to worry about what's going
on beneath the surface. I

243
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.400
mean, and it's really, really
clean, right. I mean, you

244
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.460
know, me personally, I would
never have attempted this kind

245
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.410
of thing if it had,
if I had to mess

246
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.540
around with the rest API.
And yeah, That's a really

247
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.990
interesting statement. I mean, I
like, for example, I recently

248
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.170
did some work talking to
a thing called with Sabi.

249
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.300
It's an online financial services
thing and they have a

250
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.580
rest API. And the first
thing I did was I

251
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.890
went looking for a managed
API for it and it

252
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.740
didn't exist. So then I
was like, well, how badly

253
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.780
do I want to do
this? Now in this particular

254
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.820
case, I wanted to do
it badly. So I built

255
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.490
a managed API on top
of it, but it sounds

256
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.170
to me like if they
didn't have this managed API,

257
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.690
you probably would have just
said, well, maybe later. Yeah,

258
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.270
exactly. And, you know, and,
and especially since I would

259
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.370
have to write all the
exception handling myself and how

260
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.910
to figure out, you know,
you know, just if the

261
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.360
bits got transferred correctly and
what the XML schema is.

262
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.460
And I just wouldn't want
to do that, but with

263
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.160
managed code, I mean, as
you know, I work for

264
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.140
Microsoft and a lot of
people that listen to your

265
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.500
show probably use dotnet as
their primary. Yeah. I think

266
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.670
it's fair to say that
that's a part of their

267
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.860
primary thing. Yeah. And, and
for people like that, who

268
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.440
are, you know, typically writing
enterprise applications or, you know,

269
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.370
just using.net, because they're familiar
with that. I mean, this,

270
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.450
this just makes it so
much easier and brings this

271
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.780
whole social networking element to,
to what used to be

272
00:13:54.810 --> 00:14:00.450
like our, an enterprise tool.
So anyway, so just going

273
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.860
for a little head, you
know, so, so once the

274
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.500
user is logged into my
app, I know who the

275
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.870
P the person's friends are.
And each, each friend that

276
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.890
has properties, like a small
image, large image, a medium

277
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.730
image. And that's the image,
which the user has submitted

278
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.250
to Facebook on the profiles.
So I have the URL

279
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.090
for their images. Now I
take that URL and I

280
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.390
dump it in a local
temp file. Okay. And then,

281
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:34.080
and then I log into
outlook using the office PIs.

282
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.930
Okay. The Pia means primary
interoperate assembly. And these are

283
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.960
because office ultimately is a
calm automation or what used

284
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.200
to be called Oli automation.
Right. PIs are the kind

285
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.400
of official gacked way to
talk to outlook and the

286
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.940
manager. Yeah. I forgot look.
Correct. And again, that's also

287
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.490
really, really, really easy mean
if you, if you've, if

288
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.850
you've got the Microsoft, what
does that visual studio for

289
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.690
office? Yeah. VSTO tools for
office. Yeah. So, so VSTO

290
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.490
gives you all the PIs.
You need to talk to

291
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.390
outlook and exchange and PowerPoint,
or Only thing, or did

292
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.240
this cause came with visual
studio. You know what I,

293
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.850
I believe it came installed
just cause I probably, I

294
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.330
think I have the, the
professional enterprise version, official studio,

295
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.520
so, okay. Officials do 2008,
includes all this stuff too

296
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.800
off the bat. One thing
I want to back up

297
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.490
on briefly is that just
issues of privacy. So I

298
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.950
understand that when someone adds
me as a friend on

299
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.620
Facebook, I have a choice
to show them either my

300
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.340
profile or my limited profile.
So I think that people

301
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.320
who might be listening, who
are thinking about what, gosh,

302
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.470
my friends are now using
this photo for maybe things

303
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.650
I didn't expect them to,
but you are able to

304
00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.980
give people access to, or
reject access to things like

305
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.800
your photo, your phone number
and your email address. Definitely.

306
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.040
It means sometimes, you know,
you you'll start clicking around

307
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.550
at your friends, friends list
and you'll see people whose

308
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.220
photo is invisible to you
because you're not their friend

309
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.000
you're considered just an anonymous
surfer. And, you know, and,

310
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.480
and this API respects all
of that Facebook privacy control

311
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.780
that a user would face.
So this API doesn't give

312
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.140
you as a developer, any,
any additional access to the

313
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.880
user profile and you would
have had as a user

314
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.730
anyways, To reiterate that it
doesn't API, doesn't give you

315
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.150
any additional power that the
user wouldn't ordinarily have. And

316
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.410
in fact, the API goes
one step ahead. So Facebook

317
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.890
itself does not expose a
user's email address and certain

318
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.060
information like phone numbers to
the API. So as an

319
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.080
end, so as a user,
you know, if, if I'm

320
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.060
your friend on Facebook, Scott,
I can look at your

321
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.540
email address. Right, right. And
I can email you from

322
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:40.330
Facebook. Right. But as a
developer, I can't obtain, I

323
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.430
don't have access to your
email address. And I think

324
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.640
Facebook put that, check it
there just to prevent someone

325
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.750
from harvesting. So even if
someone authorized an application thinking

326
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:53.080
it was not evil, right.
And it was evil, it

327
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.420
still wouldn't have access to
these. Exactly. And, and, and

328
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.360
these things specifically, it's, it's
the email address. I don't

329
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.300
know for sheriff block's phone
numbers too, but I think

330
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.850
it's, it's a couple of
fields which, which Facebook considers

331
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.300
to be crucial and, you
know, to avoid spam and

332
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:13.300
to avoid information leak. So,
so, you know, people sometimes

333
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.610
email me and say, well,
you know, I have these

334
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.090
contacts on Facebook, which I
don't have an outlook. So

335
00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.570
can you create outlook contacts
from Facebook? Yeah. And the

336
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.370
answer is I can't do
that because all I have

337
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.260
access to as a picture
and the, and the name

338
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.260
and certain other information, which
probably isn't very useful without

339
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.960
the email address. Yeah. I
see. So Facebook, from an

340
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.770
API perspective, isn't a full,
complete contact management application at

341
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.160
this point. Correct. And, and,
you know, I think it's,

342
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.350
it's better that way because
they're doing what they want.

343
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.940
Well, yeah. I mean, it's
a book of faces. I

344
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.180
mean, I understand that. I
think I have immediately one

345
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.060
question though, which is, how
are you synchronizing this? I

346
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.590
assumed you were looking at
email addresses. What happens if

347
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.800
John Smith and John Smith appear in
my outlook and my Facebook,

348
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.190
but it's a different guy.
Yeah. Like good questions got.

349
00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.610
So I obviously, I can't
use the email address. Right.

350
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.390
I mean, that would have
been a very good way

351
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.810
to, to, to match. Yeah.
That's a good primary key,

352
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.530
foreign key relationship, Access to
email addresses. I'm doing something

353
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.080
really, really simple. And you
can get, I'm just using

354
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.100
the first name, last name.
Oh, wow. Yeah. And, you

355
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.820
know, it's, it seems like
it's overly simplistic, but it

356
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.100
works. And I mean, I'm
sure you've used out sync

357
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.320
and you know, Problems, but
now you've got me wondering

358
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.450
if one of these days
a John Smith is going to

359
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.100
call me and I'm going
to see another guy's face.

360
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.770
What if there are multiples,
do you deal with that?

361
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.260
I just, yeah. I just
use the first, Sorry, I

362
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.110
didn't mean to out like
out your bugs in this

363
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.680
interview, this is a very
interesting question. Crushing. And people

364
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.930
have, you know, people that
ask me variations of this,

365
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.060
right. I mean, one is,
you know, can you create

366
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.760
a new outlook contact based
on the Facebook contact? And

367
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.400
the answer is, yeah, it
could, but it wouldn't have

368
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.800
a lot of feasible information
would have a name and

369
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.420
a picture. It would have
a name, a picture, and

370
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.720
maybe, you know, their hometown
and, you know, their, you

371
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.580
know, I guess a relationship
status and things like that,

372
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.440
which you wouldn't really find
useful without any email address

373
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.170
on the flip side. You
know, and the other question

374
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.770
I get asked is, well,
you know, I have people

375
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.850
in outlook. Well, I have
people in both places, but

376
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.400
outlook, the, you know, the
name is John L. Smith and on

377
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.530
Facebook, it's John Smith and how
come it's Don matching. That

378
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.840
was my next question. What
about middle initials? Yeah. Yeah.

379
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.050
It doesn't match those, unfortunately.
So yeah. And I haven't

380
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.240
really come up with a
good solution for that. I

381
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.320
mean, one solution might be
that, you know, let the

382
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.020
user manually match contacts and
then store the Facebook ID

383
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.170
and the outlook ID somewhere
in the registry or somewhere

384
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.660
in, like in a file
or something like that. A

385
00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.930
really great feature. Yeah. I
think that they would, there

386
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.330
are those people who have
their, who care about their

387
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.790
middle initial. Yeah. And it
would be interesting to make

388
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.640
a judgment call about whether
or not it's more likely

389
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.610
that their middle initial would
appear in Facebook because that's

390
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.930
the profile they created versus
outlook context, which is ultimately

391
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.280
what you created. Sure. So
if I met John Q. Smith, I

392
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.770
don't care about the queue.
I put John Smith and outlook,

393
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.740
but he does, he puts
it in and out and

394
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.980
out, But it could go
either way. Cause, cause Facebook

395
00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.660
doesn't ask you for a
middle initial. They don't have

396
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.760
a feel for middle initial,
but outlook does. So when

397
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.250
you're entering someone from a
business card, for example, you,

398
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.220
you know, you would probably
put in their middle initial

399
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.830
when you're doing it yourself.
Yeah. On Facebook. I rarely

400
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.900
see people. I don't think
I've ever seen someone with

401
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.560
a multinational and Facebook. Yeah.
Interesting. So, so this was

402
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.230
sort of like a pride
to feature for me, you

403
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.360
know, I have what'd you
just say that's a Microsoft,

404
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.900
isn't a too. So this
is a priority two thing.

405
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.530
Yeah. So, so probably two
is usually something which is

406
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.370
a nice to have and
pride threes are usually, you

407
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.320
know, cut line stuff, Hotline.
Okay. I'm sorry. I've only

408
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.030
been at the company seven
weeks. I got to ask

409
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.280
you for all the translation.
Yes. Got it. You stick

410
00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.230
around long enough. You'll talk,
you'll start talking like the

411
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:03.000
product groups. So, so this
was something I, you know,

412
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.980
I actually had the plumbing
work for this underneath the

413
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.840
surface. I just didn't have
the UI that, you know,

414
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.460
I just didn't have the
time to create the UI

415
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.500
for it, but it's definitely
something I'm going to work

416
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.030
on when I, when I
do that. Yeah. I think

417
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.430
that'd be a really fun
feature because I'm out of

418
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.430
the thousand odd friends on
Facebook and the 2000 people

419
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.310
in, out in outlook, I
think ended up like 300,

420
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.380
398 or something like that.
What seemed like a high

421
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.170
number. But now I'm wondering,
there may be another a

422
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.840
hundred guys, a hundred people
in there There most likely

423
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.870
are. And Scott, I mean,
you know, you being a

424
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.930
very well known person. I
mean, you have, I always

425
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.270
thought you were gonna say
gregarious, but well you do.

426
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.460
I mean, you know, most
people that have used my

427
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.530
app, you know, have used
it with three, you know,

428
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.530
maybe two, two 50, 300
contacts and, and you know,

429
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.440
with, with, with the dataset
that size, you don't really

430
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.190
have a lot of dupes,
but I guess with 2000

431
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.050
people, I mean, there is
a possibility that you have

432
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.960
See the dirty little secret
about me and this is

433
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.970
just horrible, but now I'm
saying it on tape is

434
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.980
that I know these people,
I meet these people. I

435
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.480
shake people's hands. I talk
to people and I have

436
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.710
really interesting conversations with strangers
at conferences. I just, and

437
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.110
I remember them. Here's the
part, that's horrible. I remember

438
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.540
these conversations. I met a
guy at deaf connections. I

439
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.180
literally just came off the
plane. I mean, you're, we're,

440
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.610
we're sitting here in my
hotel in Seattle. I just

441
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.490
came from Vegas, had like
20 minute conversation with a

442
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.150
guy. I remembered when I
had met him before tech

443
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.720
ed, 2003, I knew what
problem he had. I, we

444
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.730
were talking about, I remember
the code. He showed me.

445
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.250
I did not know this
guy's name for the life

446
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.130
of me. I he's like,
he probably don't remember me.

447
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.500
And I was like, Oh,
asp.net. One, one, you had

448
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.840
a problem with the farms
with indication. You had no

449
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.210
idea what his name was.
This kind of, this kind

450
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.450
of application that's can show
me in someone's face. It

451
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.490
makes all the difference to,
to put the name to

452
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.480
the face. Yeah, totally. And,
and, and, you know, there,

453
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.310
so in, in the first
version that I did, I

454
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.070
essentially just focused on getting
the PA the person's picture

455
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.340
into your windows mobile device.
That was the biggest that

456
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.680
happens automatically with the active
site. So let me just

457
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.830
finish my train of thought
there, but in, in a

458
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.130
future version, mean I could,
you know, bring down other

459
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.250
information like their relationship status
or their hometown, or, you

460
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.800
know, some of the other
stuff that people have on

461
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.510
Facebook such as their current
status, or, you know, their

462
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.990
current employer, which has all
of this as all of

463
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.840
the above are fields that
Facebook does expose an API.

464
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.910
So, so, you know, maybe
the next time you meet

465
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.310
that guy, you know, you've
already got his information from

466
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.990
Facebook. So you don't have
to think about, you know,

467
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.850
if the person still work
in the same company, or

468
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.280
if he's almost married now
he's, you know, moved around

469
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.970
a little. So anyway, so
that's definitely something we can

470
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.270
sync with outlook. Now, going
back to your next question

471
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.740
about windows mobile. So what
I do is I use

472
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.840
the outlook PIs to, to
insert these images into the

473
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.710
outlook contacts. And again, there's
a very clean API for

474
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.190
that. You can just open
up, you know, you can,

475
00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.060
you can iterate the, the
contacts in your, in your

476
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.240
outlook folder. And then for
each contact, there's an a,

477
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.430
there's a, there's a method.
I think it's called set

478
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.580
picture or set photo. And
it takes a, the parameter

479
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.910
is a local file path.
So I just take that.

480
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.370
Wow, that's easy. Yeah. You
know, I just take that

481
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.730
temp file that I stored
for their image and then

482
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.490
sign the photo and I
get back an error code.

483
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.550
If there is anything, Now
the image doesn't have to

484
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.770
exist on disk. It gets
sucked into outlook world and

485
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.900
then lives in your PST,
or there's an exchange. Yeah.

486
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.280
And then I just get
rid of the, the temp

487
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.530
file. And then that image
becomes part, you know, it

488
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.250
gets stored internally as an
attachment within outlook itself. So

489
00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.600
yeah. And then you can
just delete that image from

490
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.140
the, from the, I found
this to be very useful

491
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.180
because it doesn't only appear
in windows mobile, but it

492
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.000
also appears next to their
name in outlook. So when

493
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.250
I'm emailing folks, I'm seeing
their face as well. So

494
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.240
people's faces are popping up
all over, Correct. And it

495
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.760
even shows up in outlook
web access and within windows

496
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.850
mobile in, in, in the,
you know, if, if, if

497
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.430
you have an ISV app
such as pocket informant, or

498
00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.840
there's all sorts of, you
know, outlook mobile replacements, they

499
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.920
can leverage that image too.
I mean, anyway, you know,

500
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.140
windows mobile has an API
to, to iterate the contacts

501
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.690
list, just like outlook does
on the desktop side. I

502
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:11.920
was just going to take
up a lot of space.

503
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.900
I didn't really think about
this. I've got all 2000

504
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.410
contacts on my device and
now I've got all 400

505
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.110
photos, but I haven't had
any trouble. Did you, did

506
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.850
you make them smaller or
did It gets smaller? So

507
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.340
I'm not making them smaller
because the good news is

508
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.120
when you sync those images,
when exchange sinks, those images,

509
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.720
there's some logic on the
exchange side that shrinks those

510
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.120
images down to a size
that's compatible with windows mobile.

511
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.000
I think there is a,
there's a limit. It can,

512
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.150
the images can be only
be six 64 kilobytes, or

513
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.220
I don't know what the,
what the number is, but

514
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.810
there is a limit. And
I know that because I've

515
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.030
talked to the, the active
sync team, Because I didn't

516
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.060
think about it. And interestingly,
my particular device, you know,

517
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.820
some people will use a
USB cable to plug in

518
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.280
and use active sync. My
mobile phone has never actually

519
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.370
touched my computer. They do
everything wirelessly. So all these

520
00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.760
photos came down over my
data plan. Yeah. And yeah,

521
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.010
I mean, each image isn't
taking up some three or

522
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.620
400 kilobytes. I mean, it's,
it's taking up some amount

523
00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.690
of space, like, you know,
you know, within a hundred

524
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.330
kilobytes and it's, it's reasonable.
So yes, it takes a

525
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.310
space, but it's not gonna,
Yeah. I haven't noticed any

526
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.370
problems and it hasn't slowed
anything down, interestingly enough. Yeah.

527
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.360
I mean, the, you know,
the, the pocket outlook application

528
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:22.240
or the, the context application
on your mobile phone is

529
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.220
designed to work with as
many images as you have.

530
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.890
So if even if all
your contacts had photos, I

531
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.890
would still work it's it
can scale nicely. Yeah. On

532
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.570
the version of windows mobile
that I'm running, I'm running

533
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.700
kind of an internal build.
I've noticed. I'm not sure

534
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.050
if you can tell me
whether this is like this

535
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.590
in windows mobile five, when
it was mobile six, the

536
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.410
phone will ring. It'll tell
me the phone number. And

537
00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.980
it's working in the background
to figure out the person's

538
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.700
name, then a few fraction
of a second later, the

539
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.770
person's name will appear and
then a fraction of a

540
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.710
second later, their, their photo
up here. So none of

541
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.110
these things are slowing the
phone down because it's happening

542
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.080
in the background. Yeah. And,
and the same thing happens,

543
00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.570
you know, in the, in
the internal version of windows

544
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.940
mobile, which we can't talk
about it publicly right now.

545
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.150
But you know, you'll notice
that the image is exposed

546
00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.590
in a lot, a lot
of other places as well.

547
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.650
So for example, if you
get a text message, it

548
00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.320
shows up in, in a,
in a really cool way

549
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.230
in certain parts of the
device, and it shows up

550
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.300
with your, with that, with
the image of the person.

551
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.180
So, so, you know, once
that image is on the

552
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.520
device, it can be leveraged
by a number of internal

553
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.410
apps, as well as eyes
we have Out there. Yeah.

554
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.640
A lot of people were
giving me a hassle of

555
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.710
taking back my iPhone. I
bought an iPhone. I used

556
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.140
it for 13 days. I
took it back because I

557
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.320
just didn't realize how much
of my, how much exchange

558
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.350
it for me was my
brain. Yeah. And then when

559
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.930
I installed out sync and
started getting people's photos on

560
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.680
my system, I didn't realize
how pervasive it was because

561
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.720
those photos would appear in
outlook, web access did appear

562
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.670
on the phone. The phone
would ring, you know, there's

563
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.810
my wife's face. Those kinds
of things. I didn't. Yeah.

564
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.090
And, and, you know, I
think that's a limitation of

565
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.720
the iPhone, not sinking natively
with exchange right now. Yeah.

566
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.910
But I mean, there's no
reason why some third party

567
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.270
can't write a sync provider,
which will take those photos

568
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.100
and copy them to the
iPhone as well. Cause those

569
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.190
photos exist on in your
exchange account or within your

570
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.760
outlook account. Right. So not
to give you like feature

571
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.550
requests, but since I've got
you here, I'm thinking of

572
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.830
all the different other places
where people's faces are that

573
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.250
I might want to potentially
get into, into outlook and

574
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.340
to exchange, I'm thinking about,
I've got about 350 windows

575
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.060
messenger contacts. A lot of
those folks have, have faces.

576
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.840
I'm thinking about other social
networking sites. It seems like

577
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.170
out sync could potentially be
a face collector. It could

578
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.650
not only decide that you've
got multiple John Smith's and

579
00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.000
have you mapped them, but
you might be able to

580
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.230
go and log into, into
Plaxo and Delaney, LinkedIn into

581
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.140
messenger, into Yahoo and say,
well, here's three, here are

582
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.450
the three faces of Mel
Sampat. Which one would you

583
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.800
like to show up in
your phone? Yeah, that's a,

584
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.050
that's a really, really good
idea. And in fact, you

585
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.870
know, someone internally, a guy
works in the SharePoint team

586
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.690
does the same thing. Cause
so SharePoint has a social

587
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.000
networking aspect of it, right?
It does. Yeah. Yeah. It's

588
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.400
really neat. Microsoft, this whole,
my site's concept that we

589
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.430
have. Yes. So if you
go to HTTP mine within

590
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:09.830
Microsoft, you look at this,
the, this page built, which

591
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.990
is about the user. You
see his photo, you see

592
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.300
his, you know, the default
as, as a, as a

593
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.450
photo that shows up on
his badge, but BCL is

594
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.520
how their profile information about
the person. So, you know,

595
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.790
someone from the SharePoint team
asked me if, if you

596
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:27.140
could sync Facebook contacts with
SharePoint and, and there's a,

597
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.370
you know, there's a lot
of cool things we can

598
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.000
do, right? Like you said,
a windows live contacts, and

599
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.370
I was an API that
you can sync with. And

600
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.960
there, you know, as long
as there is an API

601
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.740
out sync can potentially be
used to, to, to talk

602
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.650
to it. It's interesting. You
said, he said he wanted

603
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.110
to sync Facebook With SharePoint.
And interestingly, I keep thinking

604
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.600
of exchange as being that
kind of outlook is my

605
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.410
middle place. Like for example,
we have this an internal

606
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.660
thing called you know, office
communicator. Of course other people

607
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.510
use communicator in their enterprises
if they have exchange. And

608
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.240
when you're logged into the,
the, the corporate network, if

609
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.640
I click on your name
at the bottom, I see

610
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.970
your badge, I see a
picture of you. So I've

611
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.830
got a lot of Microsoft
context. I would love you

612
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.720
to have to suck those
down and put them into

613
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.080
outlook. Those to those faces
don't automatically appear in outlook.

614
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.840
Do they know? But they
appear in communicator data to

615
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.730
see, you can make, you
can make this happen. You

616
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.390
can. Yeah. Yeah. And it's,
it's really interesting, you know,

617
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.120
that once, once a platform,
whether it's Facebook or whether

618
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.980
it's SharePoint or outlook or
exchange, I mean, once it

619
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.700
has an API, which exposes
a user information, I mean,

620
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.440
there's just so many cool
things you can do within

621
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.780
this playground. It's a playground.
I mean, and it, you

622
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.360
know, it, it really makes
a lot of these stodgy

623
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.500
enterprise products into social networking
playgrounds. So this isn't the

624
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.930
only Facebook application you have.
We've been talking about desktop

625
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.910
applications and when you have
the full power of the

626
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.620
desktop, you can do a
lot of stuff. But you

627
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.590
also mentioned a little bit
before about a web application.

628
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.290
So you have a totally
separate application that runs in

629
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.630
Facebook. Yeah. So just to
put it in perspective, I

630
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.620
mean, most people that use
Facebook probably have seen traditional

631
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.920
web based applications, which, which,
which fit right into their

632
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.550
profiles and desktop applications are
kind of rare. You don't

633
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.290
see a lot of apps
that people out of download

634
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.810
Yours is actually the only
one I've ever used. So

635
00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:09.420
that's like was, is, is
one good example of something

636
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.570
you did with the desktop
app. But, but I have

637
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.080
this other app, which is,
you know, more like a,

638
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.730
you know, one of the
zombie apps or one of

639
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.820
those. Yeah. When you say
people who aren't using Facebook

640
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.350
won't know what a zombie
application is. One of the

641
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.990
things that's interesting about Facebook
is that the applications are

642
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.850
viral and this can be
a good thing and a

643
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.640
bad thing. They are viral
only to the level of

644
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.420
viral illness you give them.
So for example, an application

645
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.150
might be a favorite movies.
So you install the little

646
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.670
application and it appears as
a square somewhere in your

647
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.400
profile. There's like a portal
it's like picking a web

648
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.950
part in SharePoint, but it's
in a Facebook particular way.

649
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.630
And then I might go
and say here at my

650
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.510
different movies, and then the
application can choose to say,

651
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:51.000
well, you really ought to
tell your friends about this.

652
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.340
Since I have access to
your friends list, check these

653
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.710
boxes, and I will send
an invitation for them to

654
00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.630
install this application. And this
is allowed really geometric or

655
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.260
exponential, even growth of these
applications where a good app

656
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:08.310
spreads. Unfortunately, though, and this
is just an opinion, there

657
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.490
are these things called vampire
and zombie. These are games

658
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.060
basically where you've been bitten
by, by Mel. And then

659
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.710
I have to install the
application and I can go

660
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:20.650
buy other people. And it's
a fun quote, unquote Virus.

661
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.750
Well, it's fun until a
year. Your manager's manager's manager,

662
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.430
which is essentially my general
manager sends me the, you

663
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.500
know, well, I get this
email saying that, you know,

664
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.870
so, and so has bitten
you. And this guy is

665
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.590
my Uber manager and your
Uber manager, Uber manager. And

666
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.670
I'm sitting there thinking, well,
Steve Palmer has bitten you.

667
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.310
Yeah. You know, Steve farmer
has bitten you on Facebook.

668
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:46.220
Would you like to bike
back? And here I'm thinking,

669
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.320
well, what does that do
for my career? If I

670
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.020
like my manager back, or
if I don't find him,

671
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.080
I mean, am I suppose,
Well then the other question

672
00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.790
is that how high does
this manager know what he's

673
00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.980
done? Right. I mean, does
he installed something he shouldn't

674
00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.080
have installed? I always worry
about, well to try to

675
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.050
save them from themselves. So
interesting. Cause everyone at Microsoft

676
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.690
is on Facebook now. Right.
And you know, there's just

677
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.750
like everyday, like, you know,
some new person I worked

678
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.370
with is on Facebook and
adds me as a friend.

679
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.780
And it's not surprising that
you know, that the upper

680
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.120
management is on Facebook too.
And you gotta be really

681
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.300
careful with what you post
on there. You know, you

682
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.430
know, some people have their
political views or they have,

683
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.490
you know, things like, well,
you just had like all

684
00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.740
sorts of personal stuff, which
you don't want to, you

685
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.060
know, actually have your management,
maybe, you know, your court.

686
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.410
Well, these are public things.
I mean, Facebook profiles show

687
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.320
up on Google and Facebook
profiles can be found. Yeah.

688
00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.390
You know, another interesting thing
that happened was I was

689
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.570
actually in San Francisco last
weekend, visiting a friend who

690
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.030
moved from Microsoft to Google.
And I posted an update

691
00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.800
on my Facebook saying, you
know, I'm doing a tour

692
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.590
of Google. And when I
came back to Redmond, my

693
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.390
manager pulled me into his
office and said, Hey, Mel,

694
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.880
are you happy with your
job? Is there anything you

695
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.010
need to tell me? Like,
sure. What are you talking

696
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.890
about? I'm happy. It's like,
well, you know, apparently, you

697
00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:00.460
know, there was a rumor
about you, you know, being

698
00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.440
at Google. And is there
anything you need we needed

699
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.040
to talk about Because you
stopped by yeah. That's the,

700
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.170
you live in the public
life if you're on Facebook.

701
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.840
Yeah. Facebook. Yeah. So anyway,
so I have this other

702
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.300
app called, I love my
phone and it's got, maybe

703
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.310
you can post a link
to this. Right? Put this

704
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.830
on the show notes. You
know, again, it's related since

705
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.320
I work in the windows
mobile team it's related to

706
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.870
phones and what it does
is, you know, people want

707
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.240
to show off their movies
on Facebook or their favorite

708
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:29.620
recipes or their favorite artists.
Why, you know, I'm proud

709
00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.600
of the phone I use.
Right. I mean, I love,

710
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.580
you know, Can we both,
we have the same phone

711
00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.230
and I'm looking at your
phone. It's mostly a T-Mobile

712
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.870
dash. Yeah. Yeah. It's great.
Yeah. So, so I'd like

713
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:39.850
to go on Facebook and
show the world, Hey, this

714
00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.310
is the full name. And,
you know, several people have

715
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.710
similar opinions about the iPhone
or, you know, like, you

716
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.480
know, any, anything cool that
you use it, whether it's

717
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.060
a Blackberry or I fell
under windows mobile phone. So,

718
00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.210
so I, you know, I
have this, this website where

719
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.420
I host a database with
a list of the top

720
00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:59.830
100 phones okay. From, from
Amazon's list. Right. And I'll

721
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.230
let people select a phone
from there in the lift

722
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:05.110
and the database. And, and
they, they say, okay, this

723
00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.460
is my, this is the
phone I use. And it

724
00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.770
shows up as a little
box on their profile saying,

725
00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:10.900
you know, Oh, with the
picture pulled from Amazon with

726
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.870
a picture Amazon, I'm just
calling Amazon's web service to,

727
00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.170
you know, to show a
picture there. And it's, it's

728
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:21.280
really, you know, tying together,
you know, Amazon's web service

729
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.570
with asp.net on the, on
the website. And Facebook's again,

730
00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.870
it's using Facebook's framework that
Microsoft developed. So how do

731
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.640
you keep your application from
being your, you know, your

732
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.640
servers from being crushed by
this, this huge amount of

733
00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.130
Facebook, traffic has more and
more and more people install

734
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:41.220
your applications. That's a great
question, Scott. So, you know,

735
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.650
it might seem like every
time you look at a

736
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:48.390
person's profile, every single application
that the user has on

737
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.290
the profile is actually being
loaded from the application developers

738
00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.600
website. But that's not really
the case. What happens is

739
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.720
only when you want to
configure an application such as

740
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.600
for your Flixster movies app,
you know, when you want

741
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.240
to select your favorite movies
or in my case, when

742
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.390
you want to select your
favorite phone, that's when the

743
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:10.950
developer's website comes into the
picture. So the developer's website

744
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.430
is hosted within an eye
frame. You can, you know,

745
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.450
so Facebook gives you a
session. And as a developer,

746
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.910
you can use that session
to configure the user profile.

747
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:24.750
And in certain, certain HTML
within the user's profile. And

748
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.230
that, that HTML that you
as a developer give to

749
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.430
Facebook gets cast. So just
the contents of the eye

750
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:34.010
frame, just that, that moment
in time that stays there.

751
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.090
Yeah. So, so, so for
example, if within my app

752
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.960
specifically, right, when the user
says he wants to select

753
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.770
a favorite phone, you know,
I load this I-frame, which

754
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.470
shows a couple of dropdown
boxes. You know, where the

755
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.350
user can select his phone.
His carrier has not yet.

756
00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.110
This is all live, really
hitting your actual machine. Correct.

757
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.480
And, but this is, again,
this is not something I

758
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.860
use or would want to
do every single day, just

759
00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.660
like a user one, want
to change his favorite movies

760
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.940
every day. He wouldn't want
to change this one, want

761
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.700
to go into configuring the
app every single day. Right.

762
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.630
So he does it once
he presses submit. And then

763
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:13.730
my app generates a chunk
of HTML. Well, technically it's

764
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:16.960
not HTML it's FBML, which
has a special marker The

765
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.520
language for it because we
needed another markup language. Well,

766
00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:23.330
it's a market language that
ensures that The HTML is

767
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.210
consistent with Facebook's design guidelines.
So Facebook has done a

768
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.970
really good job of making
their own markup language, which

769
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.450
supports a few HTML tags,
but essentially it's got special

770
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:36.800
tags, like title and, you
know, subtitle, Because that was

771
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.300
my next, my next question
was gonna be, what about

772
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.610
CSS and how does it
all look the same? Yes.

773
00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.550
So, so you have to
use FBML too to show

774
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:48.980
content within the user's profile,
I'm extrapolating and guessing here,

775
00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.980
but if they decided to
change their whole site thematically,

776
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.770
they would change their FPL,
you know, back end and

777
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.350
the whole site, everyone would
look the same. Yeah. Yeah.

778
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.160
So, so as a developer,
you're not allowed to use

779
00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.430
CSS within the, the content
that's shown on the, on

780
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.230
the profile page. You can
do whatever you want and

781
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.540
the I-frame, which is the
configuration page. And the Facebook

782
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.870
doesn't care if that looks
completely different than their profile

783
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.060
page, but they wanna ensure
that the profile page itself

784
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.820
looks very consistent. And that
really, you know, you might've

785
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.480
heard about, you know, people
say that Facebook has a

786
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.500
lot more professional looking than
my space, for example, it

787
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.020
kinda is. Yeah. And, and,
and this is a reason

788
00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.710
why, because developers can not
just put random HTML on

789
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.220
the profile And from a
security perspective as well. Yeah.

790
00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.560
And, and so, you know,
from a security perspective, it

791
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.950
prevents things like phishing attacks,
you know, you can't just

792
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:39.910
insert an image, you know,
you know how people insert

793
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.690
like a zero pixel image,
which can call scripts on

794
00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.390
a, on a, another server.
You can't do things like

795
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.720
that. Cause Facebook caches that
image as well as the

796
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.560
FBML My next question. So
you've got a picture, you've

797
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.450
got a hundred different pictures.
Are they hitting Amazon? Are

798
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.390
they hitting? They only hit
Amazon when you configuring the

799
00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.430
app. But when you, when
you, when you create the,

800
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.960
the FBML, which you give
to Facebook, Facebook takes all

801
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.420
the images that it references
and a cash has them,

802
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.480
and it puts them on
its own servers. So, you

803
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.240
know, it serves a lot
of purposes, right? One is

804
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.820
obviously we talked about, which
is consistency in the, in

805
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.640
the UI, you know, you
can't just create your own

806
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.400
CSS tags or you can't,
you know, make texts larger

807
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.620
than it should be Facebook
and control the look and

808
00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:26.520
feel. The second is Facebook
and guarantee that the profile

809
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.970
page is always going to
be available regardless of the

810
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.910
spikes and bandwidth, or if
an application selling becomes more

811
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:38.490
popular, popular than the, than
the developer expected, Facebook can

812
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.520
scale it servers. Right. Cause
they're, they have more bandwidth,

813
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:46.110
conceivably, more bandwidth than a
third party developer. So yeah.

814
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.940
That's, I mean, that's very
clever that's that seems, it's

815
00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.530
kind of a, it's kind
of obvious, of course, once

816
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.050
you have thought about it,
but how else would they

817
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.990
do it? There's lots of
companies like, like Yahoo, I've

818
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:57.690
been having trouble with widgets
and stuff. Right. But you

819
00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.270
know, the first time you
started writing a Facebook application,

820
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.710
you may not realize that
this is the way it

821
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:04.230
works. And you may, you
know, you just need to

822
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:07.110
know that this is the
architecture. And it took me,

823
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.080
you know, a few hours
to realize that I couldn't

824
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:14.160
update what's on the profile
in real time because that's

825
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.300
cash. Right. So for example,
I couldn't show the weather

826
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.260
over there, you know, because
that information is cash and

827
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.720
it can't just call a
script to update itself automatically.

828
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.490
You have to put in,
you know, you had to

829
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.700
go through some extra hoops
to get that information to

830
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.920
me. Yeah. So how did
you render the FBML? Is

831
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.870
this response dot right tags?
Or did you just write

832
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.850
this into your ASP X
page with a certain mind

833
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.400
type? No, that's not a
mind type it's, it's actually

834
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.920
easier than you would think.
It's, I'm just using a

835
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:46.500
string builder too, to you
heard it here, folks. So

836
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.930
I'm using this from builder
class to, to create the,

837
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.090
not rocket science. It's not
rocket science now. And, and

838
00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:55.920
Facebook has this, this tool,
I think it's called FBML

839
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.700
test emulator where you can
type in your FBML and

840
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.080
it shows you what it
would look like on the

841
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.350
Facebook's profile on a Facebook
profile. So, so I typed

842
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.220
in all my FBML, my
placeholder FML. I made sure

843
00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.930
it looks and feels the
way I want it to,

844
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.760
and then I just copy
and paste it into my

845
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.310
visual CDO, into my C
sharp code. And I just,

846
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.000
you know, replace the placeholder
text with what the actual

847
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.510
variables should be. Cool. Well,
so we P we'll put

848
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:25.500
some links up to, to,
to out sync too. I

849
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.720
love my phone. I love
my phone and I, and

850
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.420
everyone, everyone who listens to
Hanselman should now become your

851
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.620
friend on Facebook. So I
want to see a, of

852
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.170
add friends to a male,
so he can at least

853
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.880
decline you cause he doesn't
know who you are. Well,

854
00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.520
so, so again, you know,
I just want to stress

855
00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.730
that, you know, writing Facebook
apps can be very addictive

856
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.250
and, and you can, you
know, if you're a developer

857
00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:52.060
that's used a dotnet code,
it's it's really, really easy

858
00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.640
and you can do it
desktop applications without saying sand,

859
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:57.160
you can find web applications,
which is more common these

860
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.800
days. And, and once you're
white, your first Facebook app,

861
00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.650
you have a framework in
place that you can just

862
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.960
use to create another app
and more and more and

863
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.990
more apps. And, you know,
Facebook is as most of,

864
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:11.890
you know, Facebook is the
first, you know, social networking

865
00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.500
site that has an open
platform and API and stuff.

866
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.810
So, you know, you should
definitely go and leverage that

867
00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.060
Well, well, thanks for taking
the time to talk to

868
00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.220
us. And this has been
another episode of Hansel minutes.

869
00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:22.480
We will see you next
week.
