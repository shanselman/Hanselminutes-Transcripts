00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.880
No one wants to manage
databases. If they can avoid

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.650
it. That's why Mongo DB
made Mongo DB Atlas, a

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.970
global cloud database service that
runs on AWS, GCP and

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.870
Azure. You can deploy a
fully managed Mongo DB database

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.630
in minutes with just a
few clicks or a few

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.150
API calls, Mongo DB, Atlas,
automates deployment, automates updates, handles

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.670
scaling, and more so that
you can focus on your

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.390
application instead of taking care
of your database, you can

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.780
get started free@mongodb.com slash Atlas.
Now, if you're already managing

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.500
a Mongo DB deployment, Atlas
has a live migration service,

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.770
so you can migrate it
easily with minimal downtime and

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.830
then get back to what
matters. Stop managing your database

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:01:03.990
and start using Mongo DB
Atlas. Hi, this is Scott

14
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.740
Hanselman, Hansel minutes today. I'm
talking with Kate Redding. She's

15
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.610
an engineering manager at the
sauna. How are you? I'm

16
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.320
good. Thanks. How are you,
Scott? Join the pen at

17
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.110
all. Looking for, you know,
honestly looking forward to podcasts

18
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.750
and talking to amazing people
every week is a highlight.

19
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.170
If you have any great
highlights in your week, I

20
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.380
mean, other than a setting
a pizza box on fire

21
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.780
in the kitchen last night,
I'm not sure what could

22
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.530
surpass that right now. That
sounds amazing. But only if

23
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.320
it was intentional, you had
to intentionally burn the pizza

24
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.710
box in your house. Sadly,
we lost a great half

25
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.710
of a pepperoni and sausage
pizza, so I would have

26
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.110
planned it differently if I
was doing it on purpose.

27
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.470
Well, we, we, we, the
handsome and its audience collectively

28
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.030
mourn that half of the
pizza. I was checking out

29
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.600
your, the sauna blog when
you would have an article

30
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.690
called why I joined. And
whenever I have people on

31
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.690
the show, I look at
the, the dates and I

32
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.500
always try to figure out
the timeline. How long were

33
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.360
you at Assan or have
you been in a sauna

34
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.550
before you became a remote
worker against your will? So

35
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.550
I joined a Assana in
January of 2019. And so

36
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.160
that means a little bit
over a year before we

37
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.580
went remote. Was it all
quick? Was it like Monday

38
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.920
you're at the office and
Tuesday they're like, go, go,

39
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.850
go. I don't even remember
because what I really remember

40
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.330
is that I had taken
a week of vacation. And

41
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.910
so I was on the
East coast for a wedding

42
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.840
when San Francisco went on
lockdown. So what happened for

43
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.640
me is that I was
out of the office when

44
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.370
we, the office made all
those decisions. And so my

45
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.830
life was about deciding, am
I going back to San

46
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.240
Francisco or not? And we
rented a car and drove

47
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.760
cross country to Missouri. And
I lived there for three

48
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.540
months and I just flew
last from Missouri to Florida

49
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.150
to switch from staying with
my husband's parents, to staying

50
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.350
with my parents. So my,
my world has, I haven't

51
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.380
been in San Francisco for
four months. Yikes. So the

52
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.510
house is, or the apartment
or whatever is in the

53
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.340
state that it was when
you left and was not

54
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.880
expected to like, yes. Did
you leave an iron go?

55
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.600
I did ask a friend
to go and empty my

56
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.330
trash and see what was
in the fridge. It turned

57
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.520
out I had left the
back door unlocked. So we

58
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.980
got that taken care of,
but yeah, it was a

59
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.160
bit of a shift from
what I expected. Okay. Well,

60
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.340
this is actually really interesting
because you went to both

61
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.390
your, your husband's parents and
your parents. Now my wife

62
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.640
and my parents, respectively don't
exactly have amazing home internet.

63
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.950
And I have been seeing
quite a diversity of home

64
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.730
internet as I've watched people
struggle with their, you know,

65
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.210
high definition teams and zoom
calls as has that been

66
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.230
an issue at all the
infrastructure of the parents There've

67
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.340
been pluses and minuses, I
would say so my husband's

68
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.640
family lives in Missouri in
a very small town. We

69
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.800
were worried about the internet,
but actually it worked out

70
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.080
fine cause he and I
were both doing zoom calls.

71
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.330
The thing that was very
interesting is they have a

72
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.460
cabin in the middle of
nowhere that they like to

73
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.370
go to on the weekends.
And there there's no internet

74
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.940
and my phone doesn't work.
And so I don't, I've

75
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.730
tried very hard not to
work on. Yeah. I try

76
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.000
very hard not to work
on the weekend anyway, but

77
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.730
I'm used to sort of
having this fallback of what

78
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.950
if I need to check
in on something or if

79
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.960
I have a candida and
I'm trying to hire and

80
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.700
they need something from me
and there needs to be

81
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.400
some approval I'm off by
time zones for a couple

82
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.560
of hours. I'm used to
having a little bit of

83
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.410
a fallback and instead I've
just now made it very

84
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.440
clear. Hey, on the weekends,
I am going out of

85
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.290
internet range. So if you
need anything from me, get

86
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.110
it to me by noon
on Friday. And it's been

87
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.800
very healthy. Wouldn't you say
that it would have been

88
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.940
healthy? <inaudible> Well, listen, I'm
going to take this as

89
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.430
a learning opportunity, but also
I, I hadn't worked from

90
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.240
home, you know, and so
it was much easier to

91
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.120
draw boundaries when my work
was at work and my

92
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.450
home was at home. That
is really interesting. So I've

93
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.800
worked remotely for Microsoft now
for 14 years and I

94
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.020
have found the opposite and
I've heard people say the

95
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.480
opposite is that you're in
your house. And if you're

96
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.900
kind of trapped and of
course that's a juxtaposition between

97
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.330
remote work as a, as
a joy and a freeing

98
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.170
thing, and quarantine work as
an oppressive, you know, Gloria's

99
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.040
prison with Netflix, but the
idea that I don't really

100
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.140
have anything else to do,
and I'm in the spare

101
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.660
bedroom and I go outside
and I'm on the same

102
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.410
wifi network, people find themselves
working always like their work

103
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.550
is just smeared across their
personal lives. It's awesome that

104
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.560
you are able to keep
those things separate. And some

105
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.910
of it is Survival. And
some of it is setting

106
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.300
an example for one thing,
I'm also a parent. So

107
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.760
that is, I have a
three year old daughter and

108
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.890
that's a big reason why
we decided not to go

109
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.350
back to San Francisco and
instead to stay with family

110
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.270
for a few months, because
it just gave us a

111
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.750
lot more flexibility, but it
means that I don't have

112
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.290
hard lines within my work
day. And I don't have

113
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.200
hard lines at the end
of my Workday. You know,

114
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.880
I mean, right before I
came in to record this

115
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.220
podcast, my daughter wanted to
show me how she made

116
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.980
the bed. And she really
wanted me to come in

117
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.180
and play with her. And
I had to be like,

118
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.250
no, I have, I have
something I have to do.

119
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.420
And so that happens my
whole day. So by the

120
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.370
time I'm finished with work
for the day, if I

121
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.950
can really draw a line
and say, I'm finished, I

122
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.830
just, I need to, because
there's more things I have

123
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.630
to do. Hmm. See, first
I feel like we need

124
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.390
to immediately stop the show
and see this bed. It's

125
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.300
a thing of beauty. I
feel like there's an accomplishment

126
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.400
in the other room and
we are missing out on

127
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.800
that. I, I very much
appreciate that the, the twelve-year-old

128
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.600
will come in here and
he'd be like, Hey, can

129
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.120
you look at this Minecraft
thing that I built? And

130
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.830
it's like, Oh, you know,
you're going to talk to

131
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.800
a vice president or whatever.
I don't know that my

132
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.920
boss's boss's boss needs to
talk to me. And then

133
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.640
they go that's okay. I
guess I'll see you after

134
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.470
work. You know, it's just
like, Oh, you're ripping my

135
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.230
heart out. Like I don't
want to work. I'd love

136
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.940
to, I mean, I like
my job. That's the other

137
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.370
thing explaining to a child.
I like my job. I

138
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.720
don't want to work. I
want to hang out with

139
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.930
you. Right. And it's, it's
sort of both all the

140
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.350
time. Right? I like my
job and I love being

141
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.990
a parent. It's just the,
I can't do them both

142
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.830
at the exact moment all
the time. The other thing

143
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.360
that I liked that you
said, and I read a

144
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.400
double meaning into it, as
you said, you're setting an

145
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.640
example. And I'm curious if
that is setting an example

146
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.330
for your team as well.
Yes. As I've been thinking

147
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.210
about how I support my
team, one of the things

148
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.570
that I've been talking with
them about is I created

149
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.110
this thing that I wrote
up early on in the

150
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.920
pandemic. And I said, it's
my, my comms plan for

151
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.040
this work from home time.
And my priorities and I

152
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.100
listed my top priority is
health and safety of my

153
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.070
family. And then my second
priority is health and safety

154
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.890
of the people on my
team. And then third is

155
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.460
helping, you know, like healthy
functioning of the team. And

156
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.750
then fourth is execution. And
so if I'm not setting

157
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.910
that example where I'm saying,
I'm turning off the internet

158
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.760
or I'm having a hard
day or Emma, my daughter

159
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.800
is having a rough day.
And so I need to

160
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.320
take the space to take
care of that. How am

161
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.510
I then going to tell
the rest of my team

162
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.460
that it's safe for them
to do the same thing

163
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.150
That is really important? And
what I like about hearing

164
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.710
people's priorities is I like
it when they don't fit

165
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.620
an obvious order or I,
or I go, Oh, that's

166
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.610
how you ordered them. My
wife and I have told

167
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.580
the boys that the marriage
is number one priority and

168
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.160
the boys are second. And
the boys are like, so

169
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.040
offended by that. What I
was like, wait, you guys,

170
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.820
we were here before you,
and we will be here

171
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.830
after you. Don't let the
door hit you on the

172
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.550
butt on the way out.
Right? So without a healthy

173
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.120
marriage, you know, so what
you're talking about is execution

174
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:23.190
fourth, you know, but at
the same time, that that

175
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.920
makes total sense. And that
sets the tone for the

176
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.000
whole family for the whole
personal life and the professional

177
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.740
life. And hopefully your, your
team takes that to heart

178
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.140
as well. When it comes
to taking time off and

179
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.960
setting boundaries with you, Right?
I find it's especially important

180
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.470
for my engineering team leads.
So that's the, the hands

181
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.350
on people who are writing
code, who are leading the

182
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.370
team is they feel a
real sense of responsibility. The

183
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.680
team depends on me. If
I'm not doing those things,

184
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.050
the work isn't going to
be ready for them. And

185
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.960
I describe it as the
classic. You have to put

186
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.690
your oxygen mask on first,
if you don't take care

187
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.730
of you, how can you
take care of anything else?

188
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.030
And it's the same for
me in my role. And

189
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.040
I, and I know that
that is one of the

190
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.880
primary goals. Your primary job
functions as injuring manager is

191
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.900
to coach those team leads
on what's an effective process.

192
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.900
What's an effective culture, but
how are you doing that

193
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.440
on the fly? You said
that you hadn't been, did

194
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.050
I understand that you have
no remote working experience before?

195
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.180
Do you, do you read,
you ask other people who

196
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.850
work remotely or do you
just figure it out? Intuitively

197
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.240
My teams were kind of
interesting on one of my

198
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.560
teams. I had one remote
employee. So one person who

199
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.350
has always been remote and
then the rest of the

200
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.280
team was all in the
office. So from that, there

201
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.700
are definitely some practices that
we got in place to

202
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.060
make sure that he could
work effectively as a member

203
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.580
of the team. And I
think that probably gave us

204
00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.680
a leg up, but everyone
going remote really changes things

205
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.530
a lot. I think there's
a fair amount of it

206
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.130
that is we relied on
some practices we already had

207
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.890
in place that were good.
And then we had to

208
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.670
double down and make them
better. And maybe the top

209
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:18.680
thing is, is iteration. I
honestly don't read as much

210
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.470
as I used to. And
I think it's a it's,

211
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.320
especially because I just don't,
I can't create the space

212
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.690
for, in it, in my
life for it right now.

213
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.440
So I think a lot
of it is tips and

214
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.530
tricks from other people who
are in my network, just

215
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.750
kind of very quick, we
were doing a lot of

216
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.850
here's the thing I've done
that works. And I'm like,

217
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.520
great. I'm just going to
take yours and try it

218
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.170
and then iterate on it.
And that's been maybe one

219
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.000
of the fastest way. Yeah.
That is smart though. Like

220
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.990
fail fast, fail often, if
you think about, I mean,

221
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.970
just going to like listening
to how you're absorbing and

222
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.350
how you're processing information, you,
you set formal priorities on

223
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.880
your life. There's a lot
of people who just let

224
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.630
their lives happen by default,
you ranked the things that

225
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.840
you were important to you.
And now you're describing a,

226
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.900
a personal culture and a
team culture of, you know,

227
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.090
fail fast, fail often, Hey,
let's try this for a

228
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.980
week. Did that work? We
feel good about that. All

229
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.630
right, let's try it again
for another week. No, we

230
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.440
didn't like that. Let's not
do that anymore. Yeah. I

231
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.960
would say the practice that
has helped the most. I

232
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.160
think there's two things. One
on my team, I have

233
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.600
established a culture of doing
team user manuals. It's adapted

234
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.120
from there's a, I can't
remember who it was, who

235
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.970
did a thing on manager
read me's, but that was

236
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.510
where I got the idea.
And it's essentially an operating

237
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.380
manual to working with me.
But from the perspective of

238
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.340
recognizing how different everyone on
the team is and giving

239
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.070
everyone a space to answer
a few questions about how

240
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.310
they work and how they,
how they function. And we

241
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.390
were doing that before, because
I just find it really

242
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:01.260
important for building a diverse
team that makes space for

243
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:06.000
each other, but now it's
become even more important. And

244
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.630
we had an opportunity right
around the time where we

245
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.990
all ended up working from
home. We had roadmap week,

246
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.940
which is our organization's planning
moment. And there's two parts

247
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.780
to roadmap. Week. One part
is outward facing to stakeholders.

248
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.490
Here's what we're going to
build over the next six

249
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.120
months. Here's our expectations for
what will happen in what

250
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.880
order, but there's also an
inward facing moment where the

251
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.630
team retrospects on the last
six months and just explorers,

252
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.180
what went well about how
we work together? What didn't

253
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.670
go, well, what new practices
do we want to introduce?

254
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.190
What practices do we want
to modify? And it's a

255
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.720
very big reflective moment. And
we happened to have that

256
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.680
shortly after we all went
work from home and that

257
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.350
turned out to be a
really good intention setting moments.

258
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.880
I like that term intention
setting moment, I'm getting really

259
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.240
big this year into deliberate
practice. And it doesn't matter

260
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.090
if you decide to do
a thing and it's wrong

261
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.880
or right. But it is
important that you decided to

262
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.270
do a thing as opposed
to letting the thing happen.

263
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.460
So intention setting sounds very
intentional, right? That's exactly the

264
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.760
point behind why I think
these user manuals are so

265
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.290
helpful as well because otherwise
a team's practices, you know,

266
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.410
maybe they're formed intentionally by
a couple of the leaders,

267
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.500
but ideally I want them
to be formed intentionally by

268
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.170
the team because we're ultimately
asking the whole team to

269
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.400
buy into them. And so
if we give everyone in

270
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.840
the team, the opportunity to
weigh in and create those

271
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.430
intentions together, then it's more
likely to both stick and

272
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:49.470
to support everyone. I'm going
to put links to all

273
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.770
of this stuff that we're
talking about in the notes,

274
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.670
the manager read, me's the
idea of a, a user

275
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.970
manual, having a personal user
manual. That's been coming up

276
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.260
more and more on our
teams at Microsoft where someone

277
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.110
says, Oh, I want all
of my communication in Microsoft

278
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.120
teams. And then you have
a person who says, well,

279
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.130
I want all mine and
outlook. Right. And then it's

280
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.070
like, well, you know, and
then someone, then some random

281
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.420
person, like, I want it
in WhatsApp. What do you,

282
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.500
what do you do in
situation? Like, do you have

283
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.470
any situations like that where
you're a Slack company and

284
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.350
everyone wants it in Slack
or whatever. No one wants

285
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.530
to do that. Yeah. I
mean, I think so my

286
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.340
view on this is that
writing the user manual, isn't

287
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.340
the thing that means that
people disagree. It's the thing

288
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.880
that surfaces it. So we
had a bit of a

289
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.970
showdown on my team about
how we were going to

290
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:45.280
do stand ups. And it
was, you know, there's a

291
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.480
faction that wanted to do
synchronous stand ups in person

292
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.630
via zoom. And there's a
faction that wanted to do

293
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.490
asynchronous stand ups via Slack.
And he's thinking of Stanos

294
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.940
Right. Meaning they happen. Yes.
And it's another point too.

295
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.280
Right. So meaning they happen
sort of whenever is the

296
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.260
right time for you. Right.
So it's sort of an

297
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:10.090
individual focus versus a team
focused moment. Right. Okay. Yeah.

298
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.370
And there's lots of reasons
for all these different things,

299
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.880
right. Time-zones companion come into
play should stand up, be

300
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.530
first thing in the morning.
Well, first thing in the

301
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.420
morning for me, isn't first
thing in the morning for

302
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.300
you. What about right? What
about right before lunch? Well,

303
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.300
my whole family has scheduled
lunch at this time. And

304
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.800
now you're saying you want
to do standup in this

305
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.230
time. So what's the right
thing. And the bottom line

306
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.420
is, you know, your best
case scenario is you find

307
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.890
a solution where everyone is
happy, but let's be real.

308
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:42.640
Sometimes that doesn't exist. Yeah.
And so we ultimately, we

309
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.790
made a compromise and this
is when I like my

310
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.920
team to try to be
able to, to reach a

311
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.590
conclusion on their own. Ultimately
in this one, this is

312
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.810
one, right. I did something
that's unusual for me and

313
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.800
I decreed what it was
going to be. And I

314
00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.730
said, I want us to
do this for two weeks.

315
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.560
I think was the initial
time period. I said, for

316
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.020
two weeks, we're going to
do it this way. And

317
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.490
I don't want us to
talk about it. I don't

318
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.650
want to hear about it
again. I want us to

319
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.720
focus on the rest of
our work and you can

320
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.910
think about it. And I
encourage you to be open

321
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.820
minded about the perspective that
was different from yours. And

322
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.760
then I created an explicit
space. I said at our

323
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.730
next retro, I'm going to
create like an explicit splice

324
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.820
to talk about how did
the standups go? That is

325
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.540
really actually very cool because
there's, we use a term

326
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.690
and sometimes internally I need
a volunteer. If I don't

327
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.630
get a volunteer, you're going
to get voluntold. But the

328
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.670
opportunity there, like you, you
gave them the space to,

329
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.910
to come up with a
solution that failed. You said,

330
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.830
all right, we're going to
do this. And then at

331
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.610
Intel, they have this term
disagree and commit, right? Yeah.

332
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.670
The big old fight. Everyone's
mad. Okay. We've committed though.

333
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.230
Let's for two weeks, I
love that a moratorium on

334
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.960
not complaining about this and
won't complain about it later.

335
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.650
We have things to do.
Interesting. Is there a pressure

336
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.950
to use only a sauna
for these things or make

337
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.220
the, make the tools fit
the process or the process

338
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.470
with the tool? I would
say that the benefit that

339
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.440
we get from having the
whole company uses sauna is

340
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.660
that we're pretty clear on
it being the source of

341
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.690
truth and all teams use
it. So it makes it

342
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.840
easier to collaborate across lots
and lots of teams. So

343
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.480
that becomes the trade off
that we make. If we

344
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.930
choose to use another tool,
but for things like stand

345
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.440
up right now, you think
about what's the problem you're

346
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.720
trying to solve. If you're
trying to do a synchronous

347
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.210
standup, where everyone is together
in the same place and

348
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.230
try to quickly share information,
that's not long lived a

349
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.830
sauna, isn't the place, because
right now it just doesn't

350
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.250
solve that need. We use
a sauna for tracking the,

351
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.680
the source of truth. So
if you think about like

352
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.960
the team's work for a
sprint, it lives in a

353
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.140
sauna. And so any like
long lived information should be

354
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.630
there, but your quick, like,
how am I feeling about

355
00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:01.190
it? Right. As long as
the North star, the sort

356
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.680
of, like I said, the
authoritative source, this is what

357
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.120
we're doing, but it's not
a chat platform. Right? Hey,

358
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.980
friends, I want to thank
one of our sponsors, the

359
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.250
company, text control. They are
the creator of TXT tax

360
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.300
control. It's a Microsoft word,
inspired document editor library. It's

361
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.930
basically a document processing engine
for your web applications. They've

362
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.530
got libraries for asp.net, MVC
for angular, for no JS.

363
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.770
And they just released a
dotnet core version. It lets

364
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.220
you basically integrate a Wiziwig
document editor into your web

365
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.180
applications. You can edit docs,
you can do merge templates.

366
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.270
You can include data. You
can even create Adobe PDF

367
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.600
documents. It's a fully featured
API. It's really pretty amazing.

368
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.760
You can try it free.
And I encourage you to

369
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:52.160
check out the live demos@textcontrol.com
slash demos, text control.com/demos. It's

370
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.920
really pretty amazing piece of
work. One of the things

371
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.770
that we've been trying on
my team is a thing

372
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.620
called Monday vision Friday reflection,
where on Monday we send

373
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.570
out an email, which is
a bulleted list and one

374
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.600
of our team members does
it with emoji. So now

375
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.610
we all do it with
emojis, for bullets in the

376
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.100
emojis. I don't have meaning.
And the, that is a

377
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.520
vision for our week and
the trick wasn't to be

378
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.820
a complete list of all
things we're doing. It was

379
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.010
meant to be three to
five things that we would

380
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.880
really feel an awesome week
would require if the week

381
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.490
was awesome. We got these
things done. And then on

382
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.980
Friday we reflect on them
and we do like a

383
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.150
little mini post-mortem. That's an
asynchronous standup, but we do

384
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:40.400
synchronous standups. That makes sense.
We are, we're on teams,

385
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.210
we're doing video calls, but
everyone tells everyone what they're

386
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.260
doing. And that the intent
of that was to we're

387
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.260
struggling with cross team collaboration
because we're ending up being

388
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.620
siloed because we are physically
siloed. Is that happened at

389
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.450
all? It's like, well, I'm
here, I'm in my house

390
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.730
in my time zone. I'll
just do it all. I'll

391
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.140
just do the thing, Becoming
siloed from other teams or

392
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.640
becoming siloed individuals From each
other. I have a team

393
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.540
of 10 and we're no
one is co located. We're

394
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.620
all remote. And there are
opportunities for team synergy where

395
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.950
like, Oh, team member to
team member six, if only

396
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.270
you two knew what you
were working on and you

397
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.920
were in the same room,
you could do this. Or,

398
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.740
you know, so we're really
struggling with that. And one

399
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.920
of the things we're, we're
trying to incorporate now in

400
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.500
an attempt to fix this
is what one of our

401
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.580
team members calls writing it
down culture, just stop talking.

402
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.310
And then what the, you
know, spend more time writing

403
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.560
things down. So Hey, this
hour meeting, let's make it

404
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.270
a half an hour meeting
and then somebody write it

405
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.680
down and put it in
one single place. Yeah. I

406
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.140
don't have perfect vision. So
for me to say, Oh

407
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.250
no, we definitely are absolutely
collaborating in all situations where

408
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.310
we should. I can't say
that because certainly there's something

409
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.890
I don't know about. I
think the fact that we

410
00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.210
use a Sana for all
of our different types of

411
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:05.280
information really means that we
had built a strong practice

412
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.460
of writing things down before
we use it for meeting

413
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.310
agendas. We use it for
tracking our sprint work. We

414
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.830
use it for here's my
list of ideas that I

415
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.350
want to eventually apply to
this problem we already know

416
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:22.710
about. We have lots of
sort of built in mechanisms

417
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.790
and practices already for that.
It doesn't mean we're perfect

418
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.130
at writing it all down,
but I think that's not

419
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.900
the particular problem we have.
I do see siloing happening.

420
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.600
I think actually the, the
place I see it the

421
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.910
most is with new people
who are onboarding because they

422
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.530
don't know where the people
are or where the information

423
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.700
is unless they know what
to search for, or someone

424
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.720
tells them about the thing.
Yes, that is a huge

425
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:59.580
problem. And so yes, discovery
is really hard because if

426
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.380
you know the words to
search for, you can find

427
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.170
the thing like we have
the set of projects that

428
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.690
is intended for you to
give input to something that

429
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.830
you're not responsible for. So
for example, as an individual

430
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.590
engineer, if you have input
about how our recruiting process

431
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.310
or our hiring process or
interview process goes, you submit

432
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.840
it to the end interview
opportunity project. Once you've been

433
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.760
at a sauna for a
little while, you know that

434
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.780
if you search for opportunity,
you'll find product opportunities, the

435
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.410
sauna opportunities, interview opportunities. And
so you'll quickly find the

436
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.630
place where you can provide
the feedback you want it

437
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.240
to provide. But if you
don't know that opportunity is

438
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.850
the word that we use
for talking about that sort

439
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.610
of thing, or that that's
a cultural thing that we

440
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.920
value. How will you find
that for the first time?

441
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.710
Exactly. During our Onboarding process,
we have a glossary of

442
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.410
words to know it's all
over the, you know, all

443
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.770
the Microsoft isms that we
don't know that we don't

444
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.400
know, I do have a
similar kind of a sauna

445
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.150
isms terms and things that
are not industry standard, but

446
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.740
our Asana standard, Certainly. I
mean, there's lots of them

447
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.770
that we've explicitly written down
things like our company's values,

448
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.840
which we make sure, and
we train everyone on that.

449
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.910
And then they show up
in lots of places, but

450
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.940
there's also many that are,
you know, could be team

451
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.910
specific or a part of
your area, or also there's

452
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.600
some that over time you
get so used to that,

453
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.140
the moment that you realize
that it's not common is

454
00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.040
when someone questions you on
it. Yeah, exactly. I do.

455
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.870
I do before. I don't
want to run at a

456
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.670
time and I want to
shift gears a little bit

457
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.180
because I was looking at
the timeline of your career.

458
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.460
And I noticed that you
worked at Apple for a

459
00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.490
time as a software engineering.
And I just happened to

460
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.140
notice that you, you left
Apple in August of 2001,

461
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.670
as I recall, that was
a, that was a busy

462
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:56.620
time in America, just shortly
thereafter. Right when I worked

463
00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.310
at Apple was actually my
internship before my senior year

464
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:05.470
in undergrad. And so the
career fair for my senior

465
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.220
year when everyone was looking
for jobs happened in October, 2001.

466
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.610
So the key event that
happened in between that was

467
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:17.650
September 11th and my career fair
was not very well attended

468
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.850
for multiple reasons. One was
that the tech sector really

469
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.700
hadn't been doing well for
a little while. That was

470
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.570
around the time the bubble
popped and then recruiters were

471
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.240
literally afraid to get on
planes to come and recruit.

472
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.150
No one wanted to fly
and knock to Tobar 2001.

473
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.350
So that year actually there's
some similarities to things that

474
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.010
are happening to undergrads now
where people who did get

475
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.280
job offers early in the
year were having them rescinded

476
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.880
before they graduated. And it
was a really tough time

477
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.390
in the job market. So
I ended up, there were

478
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.280
lots of people I graduated
with who went back to

479
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.190
grad school, but I was
pretty burned out on education

480
00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:00.100
at that point. And that's
how I ended up working

481
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.010
for the federal government because
when lots of tech companies

482
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.850
weren't hiring, they were, There's
a huge chunk of time

483
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.550
where you spend working. It
just says for the federal

484
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.540
government doing awesome and amazing
things, but that's for 13

485
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.770
years. And when you work
for the government, can you

486
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.320
log in podcast and talk
about that stuff? Or do

487
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.590
you literally disappear, do awesome
work. And then your head

488
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.220
pops up 13 years later,
Definitely disappear. And then your

489
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.760
head pops up 13 years
later, I had no professional

490
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.660
presence until I decided I
wanted to leave the government

491
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.170
and look for a job
elsewhere. How is there any,

492
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.110
when you come out of,
when you exit, you know,

493
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.850
for lack of a better
word, a mission like that,

494
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.810
you know, 13 years stint,
is it hard for people

495
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.480
in the private sector to
see value in that in

496
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.060
the black box, the new
black box of your career?

497
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.070
Very, very hard for a
couple of reasons. I mean,

498
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.760
some of it honestly comes
from bias because people say,

499
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.560
well, if you haven't worked
at a startup before, how

500
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.320
do I know you can
work at a startup? People

501
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.690
have their own perspectives on,
what does it mean if

502
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.280
you worked at a government,
what does it mean about

503
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.910
you or about your background
or your capabilities. But also

504
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.820
I spoke a different language.
I had spent 13 years

505
00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:17.690
getting really good at understanding
when someone asks me a

506
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:20.270
question, what information they were
really trying to get out

507
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.360
of me and knowing the
words to communicate it. And

508
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.810
when I first started looking
for jobs, I just, people

509
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.750
didn't understand me and I
didn't understand them. And so

510
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.930
it was a real effort
to figure out how to

511
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.440
communicate in a way that
I could, I could explain

512
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.750
why it is that I
know I can do this

513
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.930
work. Even if you don't
see Google on my resume

514
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.560
or Microsoft. That is really
interesting. I have a good

515
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.770
friend who is a vet
and came out of doing

516
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:54.500
engineering and software in, in,
in the Marines. And he

517
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.750
also felt when he jumped
into the private sector, that

518
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.790
the language that they're using,
like they're not clear at

519
00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.440
all. They're not telling me
what they need. This is

520
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.080
not in any way organized.
What's, what's wrong with you

521
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.810
people to complete, like when
you said another language, I

522
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:09.080
was like, what's French. No,
you were speaking government, Right?

523
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:13.070
Yeah, absolutely. And, and there's,
you know, there's San Francisco

524
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.040
tech language and people don't
know what it is because

525
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.020
they all use it. But
when you come from the

526
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.840
outside of it, you immediately
are like, Oh, we don't,

527
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.570
I don't know what you're
talking about. And it's things

528
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.920
like acronyms, but it's also
things like just shared culture.

529
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.350
I mean, I have a
soft spot when I find

530
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:32.900
people who are leaving the
government and are looking to

531
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.590
switch to tech. I am,
I enjoy talking with them

532
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:40.160
to help them understand how
to translate their experience in

533
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.960
a way, because you have
to be able to speak

534
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.110
the other person's language. They
may not be as motivated

535
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.650
to learn to speak yours
Well, and isn't that the

536
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.490
very personality type and the
skillset of an, a successful

537
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.630
engineering manager. Yeah. I think,
yeah. It's an interesting point

538
00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.530
to be able to speak
other languages. I think so.

539
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.340
That's interesting. I hadn't thought
about it that way. My

540
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.420
14 year old has started
telling people that humans are

541
00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:13.160
just big meat bags under
pressure. And I'm like, okay,

542
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:17.690
that's an interesting way to
think about humanity itself. We're

543
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.850
just walking meat bags, you
know, thank you for that

544
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.050
gift young person. And as
I'm trying to understand how

545
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.930
he thinks about things, how
he is developing his worldview,

546
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.140
I start realizing that as
I try to support my

547
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.490
team of meat bags, I've
got 10 different people and

548
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.040
they all different backgrounds, all
different. They all grew up

549
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.130
differently. They all developed their
brains differently. It's a miracle.

550
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.850
We get all along at
all. And it, my job

551
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.340
is to herd those cats
and make them make them

552
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.830
happy and successful in their
best selves. Yeah. And I

553
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.990
think that's, I've heard this,
you know, you find comfort

554
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.180
with people who are like
you and growth with people

555
00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.450
who are different. And I
think as an engineering manager,

556
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.360
I've absolutely found that to
be true because when I

557
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:08.310
find someone who has had
similar experiences to me, it's

558
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.460
easier for me to coach
them and also for them

559
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.020
to relate to me, cause
I can say, Oh yes,

560
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.450
I've experienced this. Or this
is a struggle that I

561
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.430
had. And here's how I
worked through it. And they

562
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:21.000
get to sort of feel
less alone and also see

563
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.720
an example of someone who
has successfully worked through that.

564
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.010
But when there's someone who's
very different from me, I

565
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.700
have to work harder to
make sure I'm really understanding

566
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.880
where they're coming from and
how to coach them in

567
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.490
a way that will be
helpful to them. I don't

568
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.760
want to be coaching it's
that like do unto others

569
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.660
as they would like as
opposed to doing what I

570
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.270
would like. If I coach
someone who's very different from

571
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.670
me with the way I
want to be coached, it

572
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.870
might not work Interesting. You
know, that I really liked

573
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.880
that. And I think that's
a good place to end

574
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.850
though, because it really gets
you thinking about how we

575
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:03.390
are in the place. We
are in technology with inclusion,

576
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.270
where an industry found comfort
in people who went to

577
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.300
the same schools and hung
out with the same people.

578
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.750
And now we are experiencing
a moment of growth where

579
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:16.530
we can find both comfort
and growth with a whole

580
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.470
new generation of people who
think differently and hopefully we'll

581
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.280
make better software. I like
that. Thank you so much

582
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.620
for chatting with me today.
Kate reading from us Ana,

583
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:30.480
thank you. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

584
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.950
we'll see you again next
week.
