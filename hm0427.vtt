Lawrence Ryan announcing show number four
27. In this episode, Scott

11

talks with Jonathan Barnesville about
what it really means to

12
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.390
be Junior developer. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

13
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.000
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'm talking to Jonathan

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.930
Barnesville. He did a great
blog post on medium. I

15
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.190
don't know if it's a
blog post. Do you call

16
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.690
it a medium or what
do you call it? A

17
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.590
piece. An article. Yeah, blog
posts, articles. It doesn't really

18
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.320
matter to be. Yeah. Yeah,
it really took off though.

19
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.410
And the title is what
it really means to be

20
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.170
a junior developer. This thing
went all over the internet

21
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.360
for, for awhile there. I
was really impressed with it

22
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.740
and it caused me to
want to reach out to

23
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.320
you. What made you, what
made you write that? What

24
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.390
made you no one ever
talks about the junior developer.

25
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.280
Everyone's always talking about how
they can become a senior

26
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.050
developer, but no one ever
comes and kind of keeps

27
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.270
it real and says, okay,
I'm a junior dev and

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.300
this is why I wrote
that because, so at the

29
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.580
time I was working for
a company called AI squared

30
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.820
and I was like, over
there, I didn't have like

31
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.750
a title as a junior
developer, but I mean to

32
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.810
my people, to my coworkers
and I guess everyone else

33
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.670
in the industry, I, it
was clear that I was

34
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.220
the junior guy. Right. And
I think like the main

35
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.530
problem that I found was
in the beginning, I kind

36
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.480
of hated that as well.
In fact, I had guys

37
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.330
on my team who would
sometimes refer to me as

38
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.780
the junior guy and like
at first, you know, like

39
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.010
that gave me, you know,
the whole stigma around that

40
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.780
word, you know, like I
had, I had those same

41
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.000
feelings as well. And I
always wondered, like, why am

42
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.150
I being called a junior
guy? But when I actually

43
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.980
started thinking about it, I
realized it was actually more

44
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.310
of a benefit than anything.
And, and I think what

45
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.840
sparked me to write this
article was I had a

46
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.910
friend of mine who actually
sent me an email and

47
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.280
he was pretty pissed about
like how the team he

48
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.380
was on and how he
liked working on like, he

49
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.240
liked working on the product,
but he didn't like the

50
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.980
fact that he was a
junior developer and so on.

51
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.080
And so instead of responding
to his email, I just

52
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.470
wrote the article and sent
him a link. And yeah.

53
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.810
And so that was pretty
much like all my thoughts

54
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.850
on that is pretty much,
you know, like being a

55
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.070
junior developer, I don't think
is a bad thing. I

56
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.350
think it's a great thing
because, you know, you get

57
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.100
to actually be able to
learn, get paid for it

58
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.170
And you know, and it's
okay for you to make

59
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.260
mistakes. Whereas like, you know,
the, the senior guys while

60
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.810
they're the senior guys and
they have that awesome title,

61
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.110
if they're, you know, if
they, you know, mess up,

62
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.120
you know, like it's, it's
harder for them to just

63
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.730
say, Hey, I'm able to
mess up. Like you're expected

64
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.520
as a senior guy or
the architect to know certain

65
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.770
things and not to make
certain mistakes as a junior

66
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.350
guy, you know, like you're
expected to make mistakes. So

67
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.950
I think making mistakes is
a good thing. So yeah.

68
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.690
That's the gist of that,
That the term jr. Referred

69
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.780
to age, or were you,
was it like a bunch

70
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.360
of old people telling the
young guy, or was it

71
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.690
pretty clear that it was
experienced in the industry or

72
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.080
was it experienced at the
company? I think it was

73
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.450
pretty much experienced in the
industry. That's, that's how I,

74
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.310
that's how I saw it.
That's how I still see

75
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.420
it. I mean, I have
a lot of thoughts along

76
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.640
like around what experience really
means, and I don't really

77
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.650
agree with how we do
it now, but that's not

78
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.890
even like that's out of
the scope of this. I

79
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.450
don't think it is out
of the scope. I think

80
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.700
that's excellent. That's a right,
right in the scope. What

81
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.820
do you think about that?
So I guess my thoughts

82
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.250
on that is that like
the way that we do

83
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.800
experience just based on years
of experience, I just don't

84
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.290
think it's the right way.
Like, you know, where, you

85
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.740
know, someone can say like,
okay, you're officially a senior

86
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.900
developer. If you've been doing
this for 10 years, I

87
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.610
think it should be more
along the lines of what

88
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.580
you've learned and the like
how, and, you know, I

89
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.390
guess a lot of experience,
can you get that experience

90
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.390
over a period of time?
That's certainly true, but, but

91
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.050
like, there's also, you know,
like how you learn things.

92
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.450
And I think as you
learn more and more things,

93
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.480
and as you become, you
know, like experts in them

94
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.180
in memorize, like I made
a diff I talked about

95
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.130
this in my article about
like true experts versus like

96
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.340
experts where like you learn,
you know, JavaScript and you

97
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.980
know, it really well, but
you know, you still have

98
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.130
not hits her and mistake,
sorry. You know, like roadblocks

99
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.620
and until you hit those
roadblocks, you will not know

100
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.840
that you don't know certain
things. Right. And so those

101
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.540
are things that you gained
by using that tool or

102
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.690
like language or framework, whatever,
over a period of time.

103
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.450
But I guess long story
short is that I feel

104
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.670
like we should rethink, I,
I couldn't say I have

105
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.470
a solution to it, but
I just think that we

106
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.990
should rethink the way that
we even talk about experience

107
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.450
in general. It's like, this
guy must be senior because

108
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.430
he's been doing this for
10 years and this guy

109
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.380
must be, you know, junior,
because he's been doing this

110
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.920
for three years. Right. So
that's just, I guess my

111
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.790
thoughts on that really, I
I've said before on this

112
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.300
show that I've met people
with 20 years experience, but

113
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.100
it's the same year, 20
times. Yeah. You know, and

114
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.950
it's like, no, like I
don't want to like insult

115
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.590
people. So like respect to
people who are listening, if

116
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.240
you might think that you're
this person, but let's say

117
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.280
that you work for, I'm
just gonna pick a company

118
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.280
Coca-Cola and you went to
work for them right out

119
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.320
of college. And you've been
there for 20 years and

120
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.570
you know, everything there is
to know about Coca Cola

121
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.960
and how they run their
software systems back here, you

122
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.290
know, about like the back
of your hand, but you're

123
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.110
still writing in the exact
same language and the exact

124
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.890
same way using the exact
same development model and exact

125
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.350
same project management style as
20 years ago, that is

126
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.400
literally the same exact year,
20 times. That's very different

127
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.880
from someone who maybe had
four different jobs, five years,

128
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.930
each, and a diverse group
of technologies with the diverse

129
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.820
group of people doing solving,
and presumably failing in a

130
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.980
diverse amount of ways. I
think I would have more

131
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.980
respect for the person who's
done that than the one

132
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.020
that's just been doing one
thing for their whole life.

133
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.250
Yeah. That's, that's literally exactly
what I mean. It's like

134
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.920
those 20 years, you know,
like if they don't, at

135
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.870
that point, they don't really
mean much. It's what you've

136
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.330
done over those 20 years
and like how much you've

137
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.400
learned and you show what
I'm saying. Like, so like

138
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.920
the example you took of
like, you know, five years

139
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.190
each of like learning different
tools and becoming experts in

140
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.010
those things over those period
of over that period of

141
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.190
time, like, yeah, you, you
are a senior like guy

142
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.110
after those 20 years, you
see what I'm saying? But

143
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.260
like that other guy, I
mean, I guess, yeah. I

144
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.780
guess it's the end of
the day. It all depends

145
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.150
on like how much meaning
you give the word itself

146
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.940
and like, yeah. I don't
know how much of it

147
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.880
do you think is years
versus mindset, because I'm sure

148
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.670
that there's someone who's listening,
who is seeing themselves in

149
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.490
that statement. And they've been
at company X, 20 years

150
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.110
and they're like, wait a
second. Why are you picking

151
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.590
on me, Scott? It may
be mindset. Could you be

152
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.800
somewhere 20 years? But in
your mind, you're making each

153
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.550
year fresh and you're bringing
in new ideas and trying

154
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.010
to cause innovation, even though
you're at the same company

155
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.380
for your entire career. No,
I don't think it has

156
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.970
anything to do with the
company. I think it's more,

157
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.860
yeah, it's more along the
lines of like, what's your,

158
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.720
I mean, I guess it
all has to do with

159
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.150
learning, right? That's, that's, that's
my main thing about is

160
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.180
that like it's right now,
it's based off of years,

161
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.250
I think it should be
based off of like what

162
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.010
you've learned and like, and
how you've been able to

163
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.460
like, you know, solve some
problems, some interesting problems or

164
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.650
things like that. Not like
if you, I feel like

165
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.350
if you've worked five years
at one company and you

166
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.560
never really managed to like
solve some really, like, I

167
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.810
guess you can't come up
with like a critical problem

168
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.640
that you have to solve,
that you learned something from,

169
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.310
and then somebody else who
worked at, you know, a

170
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.160
similar company, they're able to
tell you like five different

171
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.920
things they've they were able
to, you know, like figure

172
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.630
out how to solve and
things like that. I think

173
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.350
that person I feel is
more experienced to me because

174
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.170
like that person actually had
certain problems, they had to

175
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.570
solve it. They tried today,
you came up with a

176
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.150
solution and whether it worked
or not, they can tell

177
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.400
you what happened, but you
know, it was that I

178
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.220
think that's, I think that's
the, that's what experience means

179
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.530
to me. Actually. I think
that Most interesting part of

180
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.660
what you just said was
the, whether it worked or

181
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.720
not. I think that's significant
because I don't think that

182
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.120
we, we value failure enough
as an industry. I wrote

183
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.850
a blog post a while
back about certifications and how

184
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.730
you'll have someone who's like
a PhD who spends like,

185
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.740
you know, seven, eight years
in college. So they can

186
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.010
go comma PhD at the
end of their name. Then

187
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.650
you have another person who
goes and gets like a

188
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.700
Cisco certification into Microsoft certifications.
And suddenly it's like Jonathan

189
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.720
Berryville, comma, MCP, MCSD comma.
And you know, Cisco wasn't

190
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.790
like really, man, this dude
went to like evil doctor

191
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.250
school for like eight years.
So he could say PhD,

192
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.790
you took a test at
horizon learning center for 40

193
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.070
minutes. And you get to
put stuff at the con,

194
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:20.070
why not say Scott Hanselman,
comma for successful projects, comma

195
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.400
three failed startups, you know,
like tell me what you

196
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.350
learn. So you keep bringing
up this idea of it

197
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.820
should be measured on what
you learned. How do we

198
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.350
keep that from becoming a
list of Bullet points of

199
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.490
languages? I know I, I
don't even with languages, like,

200
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.440
I don't think it's the
language it's that matter? It's

201
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.500
like, for example, when you
get into languages, the whole

202
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.260
like, fight about like, whether
you should use Ruby or

203
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.740
Python and OGs, I always
have arguments with developers about

204
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.500
this because like, I feel
like you should just learn,

205
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.510
like, take as much time
as you can. I mean,

206
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.000
like, people don't have infinite
amount of time, but like,

207
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.820
if you like any free
time, you have learned new

208
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.980
things. And just, cause I
find that like, even with

209
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.430
languages, for example, or frameworks
or whatever, every time I

210
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.560
learned a new one, just
like learning how to use

211
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.450
it. I'm not any expert
in it or anything like

212
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.490
that, but just learning how
to use it. I learned

213
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.730
something new, right? Like I
just a quick small example,

214
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.290
and this is not like
a humble brag, but like

215
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.250
a language that I got
into that totally bended my

216
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.740
mind was Haskell. Like I
just got into it and

217
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.800
like started playing around with
it. And I thought like,

218
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.560
even though I don't use
Haskell fruit, I like use

219
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.310
a Haskell for literally nothing.
Like, it's just more theoretical

220
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.410
for me and stuff like
that. But the fact that,

221
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.510
you know, I started learning
this stuff. It really thought

222
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.520
me about, you know, type
systems and you see what

223
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.190
I'm saying? So like, I
feel like you should not

224
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.130
be focusing on you like
getting a bunch of, you

225
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.650
know, tools to, you know,
tell people like, Hey, I

226
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.270
know high school, I know
early, I know all this

227
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.610
stuff. It should be more
on like just learning things.

228
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.830
So you could become, I
guess, more experienced like so,

229
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.980
so you can like understand
new problems. And like, if,

230
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.290
if I, if I approach
a certain problem, I can

231
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.900
think of a set of
different tools that can be

232
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.520
used to solve that and
maybe try to figure out

233
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.470
the best one. And if
I don't know that, like

234
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.300
if I don't already know
if I'm no expert in

235
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.460
that tool yet, then I
know then I can become

236
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.530
an expert in that tool
to, to in order to

237
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.120
solve that problem. But if
you don't even know that

238
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.740
tool exists, or if you
don't even know it's there

239
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.100
or you see what I'm
saying, like that's, that's sort

240
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.540
of where I stand with
that. It shouldn't be just

241
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.910
a set of bullet points
and this is all opinion,

242
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.400
by the way, I'm not,
Hey, this whole podcast is

243
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.250
opinion. That's what it is.
Oh yeah. So like, I,

244
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.590
I, I just don't think
it should be like, Hey,

245
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.650
I'm, you know, jotting down
a bunch of like skills.

246
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.530
Yeah. It shouldn't be that.
I think it should be

247
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.800
more people. People should be
more focused on learning. That's

248
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.900
that's, that's my, that's the
whole story right there. That's

249
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.400
the whole story. Like, you
should be more focused on

250
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.820
learning, not, you know, a
degree or not getting a

251
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.880
bunch of certifications that, you
know, like it should be

252
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.610
more on the learning. What
am I learning and what

253
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.430
experience am I gaining from
it? And what problems can

254
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.040
I solve with this thing
I just learned? Should I

255
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.190
be learning it more? And
like that, one Of the

256
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.440
things that I want to
kind of pull out of

257
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.940
what you said was the
idea of it. But I

258
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.800
know that this thing exists,
like you said, Erline, I

259
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.840
know Erlang exists. I've read
all about it. I've never

260
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.020
personally programmed an airline, but
I do think that I

261
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.690
have a sense as to
just me speaking about myself,

262
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.240
I have a sense of
how the computer science landscape

263
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.090
works. And I have a
sense of how architectural systems

264
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.140
work, that if I saw
a problem that screamed user

265
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.560
Lang, that I would recognize
that problem. I like to

266
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.840
think this about myself and
I would recognize that problem.

267
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.550
And I would bring that
to management and say, you

268
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.370
know, this really feels like
an airline problem. I think

269
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.310
that C sharp is not
the language for that, or,

270
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.760
you know, whatever. And I
think that that knowledge of

271
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.250
this thing exists. Sometimes I'll
talk to people and I'll

272
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.690
say, well, gosh, this really
feels like the way that

273
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.640
note does things. Like, I
don't really know anything about

274
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.120
node. Well, you don't really
need to know it and

275
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.560
be an expert at it.
You don't have to be

276
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.140
proficient in it to know
that it solves a class

277
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.690
of problems. And then the
way the simple awareness that

278
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.840
it exists, then lets you
know, when it's time to

279
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.700
go and learn No particular
problem. Yup, exactly. That's I

280
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.650
mean, let me put it
this way. Like, and again,

281
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.360
this is not a humble
brag, but I've played with

282
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.360
over like 15, 20 languages.
And I can only call

283
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.140
myself an expert in like
maybe PHB, like, like I

284
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.120
can really only call myself.
Like I know all the

285
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.280
corners of PHP just because
that's what I use the

286
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.680
longest, This call is over.
I'll just hang up on

287
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.460
you now. Cause you love
pastry, but I'm just like,

288
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.040
that's, that's just, I'm just
trying to, It's the language

289
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.530
that you know, I know
C-sharp like, that's the one

290
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.810
language that don't mess with
me. I notice you sharp

291
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.650
PHP. That's your language. Totally.
Yeah. Like if somebody were

292
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.090
to tell me, this is
not how this works in

293
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.740
PHP, I could have a
debate with them. If somebody

294
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.810
tells me this is not
how this works in Erling,

295
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.050
I'll sit down and just
listen because like you see

296
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.300
what I'm saying? So like
that's I, but, but yeah,

297
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.980
I know like, you know,
if there's a problem that

298
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.050
should be solved with node
JS, like you just said,

299
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.300
I can tell, okay, maybe
we should use node JS

300
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.670
for this. And then I
can, whatever I don't know

301
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.660
about no, Jess then spend
my time learning it. And

302
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.850
I honestly, in my opinion,
I think that's like the,

303
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.670
that's how you, I feel
like people should be gaining

304
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.610
experience, not you know, saying,
Hey, I know angular. I

305
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.910
know Amber, I know backbone.
I know like Erling, I

306
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.580
know Haskell great, you know,
all these tools, but like

307
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.760
the, how does that, how's
that helping you learning? Right.

308
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.340
Right. Exactly. Like I think
about it in the context

309
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.390
of being a carpenter. Like
you see carpenters, don't typically

310
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.580
focus on their tool belt.
They don't like, you know,

311
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.470
I'm a carpenter and then
on their resume, it's like,

312
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.190
you know, things that I
know screwdriver hammer, right. They

313
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.250
know about how, you know,
how wood works and behaves

314
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.280
and how houses work and
behave under pressure and how

315
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.010
to cut something is different
from the saw that I

316
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.560
use to cut it. There's
like a thousand ways to

317
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.700
cut a piece of wood
just right. Knowing which tool

318
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.400
is much more important than
saying why I know how

319
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.840
to use a saw. That's
the only thing, you know,

320
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.590
what's, what's the thing that
they say that when all

321
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.130
you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

322
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.760
Yup. Everything looks like a
nail. Yeah. Do you think

323
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.980
the difference between a junior
engineer and a senior engineer

324
00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.580
is the kind of the
beginnings of those realizations about

325
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.340
knowing what you don't know,
knowing what's available in the

326
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.100
landscape and when it's time
to bring in another tool

327
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.280
or bringing a new, a
bit of learning Sorta kinda,

328
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.130
I mean, I still find
a lot of developers that

329
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.410
I would classify and I
don't walk up to them

330
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.020
and tell them that, but
I would classify them as

331
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.140
you know, developers and they
don't really see that. I

332
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.540
mean, I think like allowed
you to yeah. Like allowed

333
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.770
you to evolve as it's
hard for them to even

334
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.140
realize that that's what I
think is that their junior.

335
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.990
Yeah. Like not, not that
they're junior, but that there's

336
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.210
a lot of stuff that,
well, I guess yeah, that

337
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.770
their junior cause like there's
a lot of stuff that

338
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.710
they don't know yet or
things like that. And yeah,

339
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.780
it's, it's just, it's, it's
an interesting, like, I guess

340
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.820
it's an interesting situation to
be in. Cause like, I

341
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.810
mean, I still consider myself
a junior developer and I,

342
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.250
I don't think I'm going
to be developing, I guess

343
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.220
since I was 12, 13,
but I wouldn't really call

344
00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.800
that develop. It's funny that
you say that. So bringing

345
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.120
in ages I'm a little
bit, I don't know how

346
00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:02.920
old you are, but I
am Lord, so I'm 40.

347
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.010
Okay. So there's two things
here. There's a number of

348
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.350
years we've been in the
industry. That's one level of

349
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.680
experience. And then there's age.
Like if I were 40

350
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.340
with two years experience, then
I'm going to defer to

351
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.520
you because maybe you've got
two years experience too, but

352
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.550
I'm 40. I've been in
the industry for 20, 25

353
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.140
years. But I don't know
anything about PHP. Therefore I'm

354
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.810
going to defer to you.
So I feel like there's

355
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.980
all these kind of axes
years experience in the industry

356
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.400
years experience in a language.
And then there's always this

357
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.020
implied kind of age ism
aspect. But I would hope

358
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.060
that I would have the
maturity as someone who is

359
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.820
older than you, but doesn't
know what you know about

360
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.720
PHP to recognize that and
like be deferential and say,

361
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.920
okay, well Jonathan's clearly the
expert. So why would I,

362
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.960
I can come up against
you on a PHP related

363
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.320
question. See, that's, that's like
one of the, like that's

364
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.900
a problem that I find
actually across all developers, like,

365
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.930
like one of the things
I find developers are. So

366
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.620
I guess stubborn about is,
is actually asking questions. Like

367
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.200
I feel like developers have
this stigma where they feel

368
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.170
like they should know everything.
So like if they're in

369
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.630
like at a, at a
conference or at a meetup,

370
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.670
like even like sometimes I'm
giving a talk and you

371
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.520
could tell that this guy
doesn't really get this thing,

372
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.890
but he will never ask
the question. Right. And like,

373
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.440
but when you have a
conversation with that same guy

374
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.320
after the talk and you
realize like the first, pretty

375
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.870
much 15 minutes of everything
you said made absolutely no

376
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.970
sense to him. Right. But
like you could have asked

377
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.520
that. I mean, I think
it's a, it's a big

378
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.040
problem that like we've made
ourselves think that we can,

379
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.930
we should be able to
do everything and we shouldn't

380
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.660
be able to like, we,
like, I feel it's, it's,

381
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.570
it's it's bad because it's
bad for learning. Right. Cause

382
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.760
you're not, if you're not,
if you're not okay with

383
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.240
asking, asking a question, right.
Like saying, Hey, I do

384
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.280
not know what the pendency
injection is. Can you explain

385
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.470
that to me? If you
feel like I must know

386
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.140
what dependency injection is. So
if I don't know it

387
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.540
I'm stupid and developers are
gonna think I'm stupid and

388
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.520
no one will hire me.
Then you're not ever going

389
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.380
to learn what dependency injection
is. You're just going to

390
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.660
keep having that thought. And
you'll never going to ask

391
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.130
anyone and you're going to
try to read as much

392
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.620
as you can on Wikipedia.
Wikipedia will bring you down

393
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.410
a rabbit hole. And so,
so yeah, like that's, I

394
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.270
think it's, it's a big
problem with cost of operas

395
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.040
in general. Like I've seen
it. I see it like

396
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.340
literally every day, like where
some developer you could tell,

397
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.890
they don't understand something, but
they don't want to ask

398
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.100
it. Right. They just feel
like, What are we doing

399
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.250
as a culture that causes
that like is, I know

400
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.710
there's been lots of discussion
about like nerd culture and

401
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.140
everything. Everything we talk about
as a generalization, but what

402
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.780
is it about programmers where
there's this sense of posturing?

403
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.040
Like there's such power in
saying, I don't know. Like

404
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.980
it took me 10 years
of my career before I

405
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.650
realized that it's okay to
be in a meeting with

406
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.410
a bunch of important people
and say, I'm sorry, what

407
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.140
does that acronym mean? You
know what I mean? Like

408
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.010
that's, I'm, I'm calm. I'm
like raising my hands and

409
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.140
I'm gesturing. Cause I feel
so excited about this and

410
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.550
strongly about this. Like if
there's one thing I can

411
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:03.020
tell you, my 19 year
old self is that you

412
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.270
might be in a meeting
with a bunch of VPs

413
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.830
or something, and then there's
going to be an acronym

414
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.750
that's going to come out
or a word or this

415
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.780
either happened to me, even
an English word that I'm

416
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.850
not a hundred percent familiar
with. Like I'm reading your

417
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:17.870
article here. And I saw
you use the word deja

418
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.940
VU. I know what that
means. And then you have

419
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.630
another word that's French, Gemma
VU. What does that mean?

420
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.040
Murphy never seen. Okay. So
I don't know that. Right?

421
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.540
I know I could Google
it, but I'm gonna ask

422
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.510
you, but you th there's
there's power in that. I

423
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.900
truly don't know what that
means and there's nothing, it

424
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.630
doesn't lessen me to simply
ask. And when I finally

425
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.390
decided to, I call it
leaning in like, it's one

426
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.510
thing to go and say,
what does that mean? Exactly.

427
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.300
As opposed to I'm sorry,
I didn't catch that. What

428
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.980
is which acronym is NSA?
Oh, national security agency. Sorry.

429
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.910
Thank you. Moving right along.
Like lean into it. Like

430
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.220
really don't know. You know
what I mean? Don't like

431
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.950
not know a little bit,
like I have no idea

432
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.490
what Bitcoin is. So please
get me up to speed

433
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.770
and no one's going to
be like, he's a senior

434
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:13.430
engineer. Why did he not?
We'll see what I, what

435
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.010
I find actually funny about
this is that I have

436
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.340
not met one developer that
knows everything. Like I never

437
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.190
will. That's what I find
funny about this. I mean,

438
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.770
even like, for example, like
I guess in our community,

439
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.260
for example, we'll look at
people who write, let's just

440
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.930
say Haskell or see code
as like, those are the

441
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.260
top developers. Right? And so
like, I have a friend

442
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.830
of mine who actually does
embedded C programming and right

443
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.110
now he's learning how to
do web development. And it's

444
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.270
like, he will send me
an email, like literally like

445
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.050
everyday dude, what is Jason
P like? It's like even

446
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.130
reading a Wikipedia. What Jason
is. He has no idea.

447
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.130
He still doesn't understand it.
Right. But yet if you

448
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.730
gave him, you know, like
a PCB and like a

449
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.010
compiler until you see what
I'm saying, like this guy

450
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.120
can actually, you know, like
build the computer that he

451
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.920
was brilliant. He's brilliant. Yeah.
Yeah, totally. I, I met

452
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.650
this guy at Intel. He's
like, sorry, 75 year old

453
00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.780
guy. This is like a
technical fellow. This is someone

454
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.870
who's been at Intel 20,
25 years working on low

455
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.500
level micro code in the
processor itself. Wanted to come

456
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.180
to me after a talk
and wanted to learn web

457
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.630
development. It took me a
second. Like here's someone with

458
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:27.420
40 years experience in the
industry, literally building the planet

459
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.330
of Silicon that we sit
on top of. And he

460
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.860
wants to know how to
say hello world on a

461
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.120
webpage. Yep. But, but he
was not in any way

462
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.070
upset about that. It was
not unapologetic. I think it

463
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.680
would be the way. Yeah,
exactly. Like it's. Yeah. It's

464
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.540
just, I feel like all
this stigma should just go

465
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.520
away and it's, it's easier
said than done, but it's

466
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.950
like, you shouldn't feel like
you need to know everything.

467
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.440
Like, and, and I, to
be fair, like I find

468
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.160
myself in that situation, I
guess how I started changing

469
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.850
that about myself is when
people would, so for example,

470
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.800
like go give a talk
at a meetup. And then

471
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.080
I would then after they
meet up during chats with

472
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.150
other people, like with the
attorneys, I'd realize they didn't

473
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.070
understand it. And it would
piss me off. Like it

474
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.020
would, I wouldn't show them
that I'm pissed off, but

475
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.910
it would piss me off
that they couldn't, they didn't

476
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.310
feel okay to actually ask
that. So over time I

477
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.380
started actually looking at myself
like, am I like that?

478
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.900
Like when I go to
a talk or am I

479
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.410
like that? I do. I
feel like I should know

480
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.070
everything and things like that.
And so I guess now

481
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.350
at least I try, like,
if I don't understand something,

482
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.120
I don't care if I'm
in an audience of 500

483
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.580
people. I there's nothing that
says, I should know it.

484
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.650
Like there's no book out
there that says, if a

485
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.650
developer does not know dependency,
injection, you're not a developer.

486
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.370
Right. So like, I feel
like we should just get

487
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.880
away with like, understand that.
And like that will really

488
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.710
make learning a whole different
experience. Right. Because yeah. And

489
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.960
it's, I think it all
comes back to the developers

490
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.870
thinking that they should be
able to do everything and,

491
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.050
and not like in not
agreeing that, Hey, I don't

492
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.390
know this. Let me ask
this other developer, even let

493
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.340
me hire somebody else to
do this, to solve this

494
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.190
problem. Right? Like that's not
my type of problem, things

495
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.980
like that. So yeah, I
think that we, as a

496
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.020
culture, need to embrace not
knowing and embrace new people

497
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.280
coming in. Like there was
this old Saturday night live

498
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.650
thing back when Jimmy Fallon,
about 19 years ago when

499
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.330
Jimmy Fallon was on Saturday
night live, he had a

500
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.450
thing called Nick burns your
company's computer guy. You got

501
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.250
to go and go and
Google this for me, Nick

502
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.310
burns your company's computer guy.
And basically people would have

503
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.140
a problem. And he'd be
like, I'm trying to set

504
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.680
up the printer. And then
Nick, the companies can use

505
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.930
like a stereotypical company's computer
guy and he'd come over

506
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:39.360
to me, go Move and
then shoved them away. And

507
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.750
he goes, Tapping, tapping on
the keyboard and you go,

508
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:48.550
It's so hard. We've met
that person. Like we know

509
00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.540
that person, that individual who
makes you feel like so

510
00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.330
dumb. And the entire thing
was Jimmy Fallon, as your

511
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.510
company's computer guy making you
feel like the worst tiniest

512
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.790
person, because you didn't know
how to copy a file

513
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.520
from here to there. Like,
we need to make that

514
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.400
stop as an industry. It's
not a pay to make

515
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.980
people feel like, Actually I
think that that's part of

516
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.710
the big problem that, that,
that causes that bigger problem.

517
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.760
Right? It's like, it's people
that don't, that make the

518
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.160
other people that don't know
certain. Some things like think

519
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.650
that they should know it.
Right. Because the way, like,

520
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.840
even the way you respond
to a question, right? Like

521
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.550
if you're giving a talk
and somebody asks you a

522
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.130
question, the way you respond
to it might make that

523
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.350
person never want to ask
a question ever again. Right.

524
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.720
So like, I, I think
that's the same way that,

525
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.910
you know, we're having all
these other problems in tech

526
00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.150
where like what, you know,
women in tech and just

527
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.490
diversity in general, I think
we should also be calling

528
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.860
out people who do stuff
like that. Like if somebody

529
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.380
asks something and, and like,
if I'm at a talk

530
00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.050
and somebody asks a question
and like the speaker responds

531
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.540
in a certain way, that's
very condescending. Like, I feel

532
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.030
like people should say, Hey,
like, it's OK. If he

533
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.190
doesn't know this, like, why
did you have to answer

534
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.160
like that? It was just
answer the question at some

535
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.200
point. And it turns out
that even that speaker, I'm

536
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.700
pretty sure at some point
they didn't know what that

537
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.330
was as well. So like,
yeah. It's, it's, it's something

538
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.250
that I feel like, yeah,
as a community, we can

539
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.850
definitely improve. It just will
take like everyone's help. But

540
00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.330
no one will be able
to, I think that's, that's

541
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.760
just a, that's like if
I were to actually sit

542
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.250
down and try to put
a mathematical equation behind that,

543
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.950
like you cannot learn if
you do not. Like, if

544
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.830
you do not know if
you can not be okay

545
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.260
with actually asking someone, right.
Like if you're not okay

546
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.990
with like saying, Hey, I
don't know this, can you

547
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.190
explain to me what you
meant by that? Then you

548
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.580
keep thinking that you should
know it. Right. And because

549
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.310
you'll keep thinking that you
will never, you never actually

550
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.610
learn it. Right. And so
that's, that's a problem. I

551
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.550
really like saying and reminding
to people, even ones who've

552
00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.230
been in the industry for
20 years plus is that

553
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.980
we're all amateurs. Like we're
all learning. You gotta keep

554
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.700
that passion. You linked to
Peter Norvig's article, teach yourself

555
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.030
programming in just 10 short
years. And I think the

556
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.980
thing that you said was
great is like, why is

557
00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.770
everyone in such a rush?
Like you're you're 19. I

558
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.630
don't know when you expect
to be a senior engineer.

559
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.640
Pretty sure it's not going
to be when you're 21.

560
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.860
I don't. I remember in
fact, I don't even care

561
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.340
about that In fact, by
smile because that's the answer

562
00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.380
that, that you should have
given is that yeah. I

563
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.840
mean, it'll happen when it'll
happen, when I feel comfortable,

564
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.960
but then maybe you'll switch
languages. Like if I switched

565
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.900
over and became a full
time Ruby programmer, I would

566
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.880
be a junior programmer and
that would be totally fine.

567
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.020
And there's nothing, there's nothing
wrong with that. Why do

568
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.900
you think that, that people
in their early twenties or

569
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.670
mid twenties or people who
just have four or five

570
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.790
years experience want to be
senior right away? Like, why

571
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.790
does that name mean so
much? Because I know carpenters

572
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.340
and plumbers and electricians that
work for years and years

573
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.920
and years, just to be
journeymen and move their way

574
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.170
up to being a master
carpenter, master electrician. Well, I

575
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.150
mean, if we had to
look at everything, like from

576
00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:50.000
what I can see it,
I think part of it

577
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.920
has just has to do
with the fact that like,

578
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.680
I guess, I mean, to
me, that doesn't matter. But

579
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.970
though of course, that matters
to a lot of people,

580
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.430
which is the fact that
like senior guys get paid

581
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.430
more, for example. Right? Like
they get paid more. So,

582
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.500
you know, to somebody who's
a junior guy, they might

583
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.010
be like, well, it just
comes down to pay. No,

584
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.720
I'm not saying it's just
pay, but that's just one

585
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.720
example of something that's like,
it's like seeing that person

586
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.880
saying, Oh, like this guy,
I know much more than

587
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.760
him, but he's getting, you
know, like paid 25 K

588
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.320
more than me. You know
what I'm saying? And like,

589
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.170
at that point you start
feeling like, why am I

590
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.660
not getting paid that I
actually talked about that in

591
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.790
the article. It's like, when
you feel like I know

592
00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.590
this, right. And that that's,
that's typical with junior developers

593
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.180
is that like, I know
all of this. And then

594
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.340
you look at, you know,
the, your coworker, who's the

595
00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.920
senior guy. And he's like,
he just knows Java and

596
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.930
that's it. But he could
tell you everything about Java.

597
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.540
Right. And I know all
of this that could provide

598
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.730
much more value for the
company, but this guy getting

599
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.220
paid 25 K more than
me. Right. So that's just

600
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.810
one, that's just one example.
I mean, it's not all

601
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.240
about money. Like for me,
again, for me, I don't

602
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.720
really care about that, but
that's, that's one example of

603
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.090
things. And the other thing
is just like having that

604
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.600
title right. Senior versus junior,
I guess that in general

605
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.690
must mean something. And that's,
that's the whole point of

606
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.660
my article was saying like,
ignore the title. Don't even

607
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.140
care about it. Like it
even like with like, I'm

608
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.760
more right now, what I
do full time as I'm

609
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.570
working on my own company.
Right. And like, even if

610
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.830
I could have filed for
my company without actually giving

611
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.300
myself a title a little
bit, I would have been

612
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.910
so happy. I had to
give myself a title. So

613
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.100
I have a title, but
I, I think title is

614
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.320
also part of the problem.
It's like, don't care about

615
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.540
your title, just care about
your role and how you're

616
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.940
learning in your role, in
how you're like, that's all

617
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.460
that stuff has like, has
some part in it. I

618
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.120
fulfilled, Right? That's, that's, that's
almost like a, that's kind

619
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.450
of a, we call this
the star Trek next generation

620
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.540
way of thinking where, you
know, there, there's this really

621
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.310
great episode of star Trek.
I think it was a

622
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.430
movie actually in star Trek
generations when someone from the

623
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.650
past comes forward and they're
talking to 'em the thing

624
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.140
was Alfre Woodard. She's talking
to John Luke Picard and

625
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.970
he's like, Oh, well we
have no money here. You

626
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:56.210
know, we've, we've elevated to
a higher level of understanding

627
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.090
and we work as a
culture towards knowledge and, you

628
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.220
know, it's, it's silly to
make a star Trek reference,

629
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.990
but that is kind of
the goal. Like what you're

630
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.510
saying is, you know, forget
the title for a second.

631
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.630
Yeah. Money's important. But let's
put that aside is this

632
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:12.320
job is my attitude, are
my coworkers helping me learn

633
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.040
more better myself and, and
be the kind of developer

634
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.520
and hence the kind of
person that I want. Exactly.

635
00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.980
Like, and I feel like
once you start it, a

636
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.630
lot of this is also
easier said than done, but

637
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.000
I feel like once you
understand that, like, like for

638
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.700
me, until I understood that
it, like, I had that,

639
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.590
those same thoughts, I can't
lie. I had those same

640
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.120
thoughts. Like I would look
at my cork and I'm

641
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.220
like, why is this guy
getting paid more than me?

642
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.610
Right. But like, you know,
once I understood that actually

643
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.070
made, took advantage of it.
And like, you know, an

644
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.650
example is at S square,
the, you know, the software

645
00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.160
architect, our software protector was
Brian, his name was Brian.

646
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.760
And like, I, a lot,
a lot that I know

647
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.890
about software development in general,
I can, I can, I

648
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.100
can credit to Brian. Like,
you know, he even likes

649
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.170
scalability. I had no, I
mean, I knew what the

650
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.870
word meant, but like I
had never like, had to

651
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.120
deal with that. Right. But
he, you know, just by

652
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.460
him explaining a story of
him working at Akamai and

653
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.610
explaining how, like, how something
went, you know, and how,

654
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.590
like, how do you manage
to solve a specific problem?

655
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.660
I now had an idea
of how to solve that

656
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.570
problem myself. Right. And like,
if I didn't, if I

657
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.970
wasn't open to actually saying,
Hey, I don't know this.

658
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.910
Even to, just to myself
and, and being able to

659
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.500
say, okay, let me just
sit down and listen to

660
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.840
what Brian has to say
with his, you know, like

661
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.600
10 years of experience and
stuff like that. Like if

662
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.240
I, if I actually sit
down and like, if I

663
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.430
was okay with that, then
even if I was sitting

664
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.440
there looking at him, I
probably would have not been

665
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.080
paying attention to him. Right.
Or whatnot. So I feel

666
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.110
like it's, it's easier said
than done, but once you

667
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.390
realize that it's actually more
of like, I, I feel

668
00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.010
like you should just take
it as a learning experience

669
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.830
if you're considered a junior
developer. And I think I'm

670
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.810
going to be a junior
developer for probably the next

671
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.120
10 years, 20 years. I
don't really care, but like

672
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.150
just take it as a
learning experience. And if you

673
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.250
see it that way, I
feel like it it's gonna

674
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.950
have a better effect on
you than anything. Right. Yeah.

675
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.990
Yeah. I definitely think you've
got the right attitude. And

676
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.890
I think that you've realized
already that the most important

677
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:07.540
part of asking questions is
the listening afterwards. Yes. Thank

678
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.610
you so much for chatting
with me today. Jonathan Barnesville,

679
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.860
we'll make sure to put
a link to Jonathan's article

680
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.890
up on the show notes.
This has been another episode

681
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.990
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
