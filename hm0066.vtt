com. In this episode, Scott
and Kroll discussed home networking.

12
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.580
Hi, this is Carl Franklin and
you're listening to Hansel minutes

13
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.600
from Hanselman it's dot com
here with Scott Hanselman back

14
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.000
at the wheel. How are
you, sir? We're back at

15
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.320
the wheel. We are, we
had a little bit of

16
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.870
a week off there. I
enjoyed it. Yeah. I went

17
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.620
over to a rails conference.
Yeah. Got it. Great interview

18
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.980
there. Yeah, it was pretty
cool last week. So we

19
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.500
weren't going to talk about
home networking. So when it

20
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.300
emailed and said that they
wanted to set up a

21
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.330
home network, I'm in no
way, a home networking expert,

22
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.780
but you know, I do
have opinions and I'm sure

23
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.590
that you have opinions. So
in this particular episode, probably

24
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.380
the real information will come
from those who decide to

25
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.250
respond, visit the comments page,
visit my blog, and we

26
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.350
can talk about what you've
done to set up home

27
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.630
Networking. I know you're not
talking to me right now,

28
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.780
but I'm with you. I'm
probably even less than you.

29
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.320
I have an old wireless
network when there's gigabit and

30
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.330
all that. I'm not, not
at all home network heaven,

31
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.910
Right? Well, yeah, when you're
putting together a home network,

32
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.460
it's about deciding what it
is you need to accomplish

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.650
for my dad, the default
router, the default, you know,

34
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.630
the, he could basically got
an all in one box

35
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.660
from the cable company, right?
So it's basically a router,

36
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.440
a bridge and a hub
and a wireless broadcast are

37
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.870
all in one. Right. So,
you know, so it, it

38
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.520
handles the transit transition between
the co-ax the cable that

39
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.770
comes in the 75 home
co-ax that comes in off

40
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.270
the street. Turns that into
ether, net, RJ 45, it's

41
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.060
got four ports on it.
So it's a hub. The

42
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.480
ports are independently have independent
speeds. So it's a switch.

43
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.480
And then it's got a
wireless gee, is it 54?

44
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.420
Alright. Yeah. G is 54
and that just works. Right?

45
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.190
So his main machine is
plugged into that and he's

46
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.250
got wireless the rest of
the house and it works

47
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.620
just fine. Cause all he's
really trying to do is

48
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.800
share the internet with a
few laptops and, and print.

49
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.450
That's pretty much all I
have. Yeah. And that's fine

50
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.780
for, for most folks, you
know, in that instance, you

51
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.360
might take a look at
the podcast that we did

52
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.950
on alternative lynxes firmware. The
firmware is getting better and

53
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.500
better. I think that the
actually the open source community

54
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.880
is pushing the, the competition
to pushing the competition and

55
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.480
the actual commercial competition to
make their stuff better links.

56
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.120
This is firmware got better
and better as peoples are

57
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.580
pushing it. So they started
saying, Oh, I guess people

58
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.200
do want this. They do
want, you know, a detailed

59
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.930
management of the universal plug
and play. They do want

60
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.650
a VPN backend. They want
quality of service. So they

61
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.350
started putting those features back
in. But yeah, take a

62
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.500
look at that podcast about
alternative firmware. I've turned a

63
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.160
number of people onto that
who were not necessarily very

64
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.090
technical, but they were able
to download the binary, flash

65
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.570
their firmware, and then make
some simple changes, like quality

66
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.480
of service to make their
voice over IP better. So,

67
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.880
you know, you're kind of
your first decision is what

68
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.430
do I need? So you
know, how many devices do

69
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.910
you have if you've got
a couple of machines and

70
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.950
you're just surfing the net,
maybe sharing a file or

71
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.530
to a wireless router is
going to be the way

72
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.560
to go. But if you're
gonna have a lot of

73
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.900
machines and, or a lot
of actually, I wouldn't say

74
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.960
machines now, I would say
devices, you have to ask

75
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.380
yourself how much management do
I want of these for

76
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.110
me? I didn't realize how
many things in my house

77
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.570
had an IP address until
I'd actually kind of went

78
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.580
and cataloged them. All right.
So I've got, I got

79
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.830
a Mac at my PC,
get my wife's PC. That's

80
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.230
pretty straightforward, pretty common. You
know, my wife has P

81
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.890
you know, your PC, your
kid's PC, I've got two

82
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.830
replay TVs, which are basically
a DVR, like a TiVo,

83
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.470
except they have an ethernet
cable. So what does that,

84
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.560
let me see why SPC
my PC Mac to replace

85
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.850
it's five. I've got my
Xbox right. X plus three

86
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.060
60. Right. I got my
wi which has a built

87
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.090
in wireless. Yep. Do you,
what do you need the

88
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.490
wireless for the weed? Is
it connect to the internet?

89
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.180
The internet every evening, But
the, we also has runs

90
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.600
opera the alternative browser, so
I can browse the web

91
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.650
on my big 42 inch
screen. Huh. So I used

92
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.630
the we to browse from,
from within the, you know,

93
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.390
sometimes there are, there's a
program called MCE browser, I

94
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.120
think from kind of Anthony Park,
where you can use, you

95
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.470
can basically launch your Xbox
three 60, go back over

96
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.930
to your media center, PC,
and then browse from there.

97
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.750
But I ended up using
the, we, it's very simple.

98
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.450
It's tiny. And I B
I just browse that way.

99
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.970
It uses opera and it
looks very nice. Okay. It's

100
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.220
got great font scaling, so
you can do it on

101
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.850
a big screen and not
too much about it. So

102
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.890
anyway, I ended up with,
Oh, I've also got a

103
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.710
universal plug and play a
MP three player. It's like

104
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.490
a little, little appliance that
sits on your receiver that

105
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.620
lets you stream music from
your collection. Like the, the

106
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.750
little, the little iTunes brick
that you can plug into

107
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.880
the wall and it will
pull from your iTunes library

108
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.220
and the airport. I ended
up with something like 12

109
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.970
or 13 different things that
have IP addresses in the

110
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.480
house. And that was surprising
to me. But then I

111
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.540
realized that, Oh, and the
Vonage, I use Vonage for

112
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.880
my phone. So that was
another thing it starts to

113
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.270
add up at least for
a gadget person. And I

114
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.180
started to realize that different,
there are different interrelationships between

115
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.090
the IP addresses. People really
expected the IP addresses to

116
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.450
stay the same. Well, that
was my next question is,

117
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.090
do you, do you sign
static IP addresses and how

118
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.430
do you resolve DNS and
all that? Right. So I,

119
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.280
I do the, the in
between I do a static

120
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.790
lease, right? So the DHCP
lease is based on the

121
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.320
Mac address. So I rather,
I signed static IPS, but

122
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.320
I assign them based on
Mac address. Okay. So when

123
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.050
it sees my PC, I
always know it'll be.one. That's

124
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.380
just how I've got things
set up. Okay. For me.

125
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.970
Oh yeah. In the baby
room. There's a, there's an

126
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.610
IP camera in the baby
room. So that's another, another

127
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.380
one by, by taking the
moment to assign static IP

128
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.430
addresses. And particularly by doing
them via DHCP lease, not

129
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.250
only does it make things
easier in case name, resolution

130
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.550
fails, I tell that I
don't know why it happens,

131
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.990
but a lot of routers
have a heck of a

132
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.290
time with their, with their
local DNS and the relationship

133
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.660
between the outside and the
inside. So a lot of

134
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.000
times I have trouble addressing
my own machines internally and

135
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.640
I've debugged it over and
over. And just sometimes windows

136
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.700
doesn't understand if you go,
you know, whack a server.

137
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.130
Yeah. Yeah. I have the
same issue. Don't know why

138
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.370
Has it something, something to
do with devices that are

139
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.630
on the wireless network, being
bridged inappropriately with devices that

140
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.550
are on the wired network
and maybe the name I

141
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.350
was losing to that passing
between them. I don't know,

142
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.810
but when those kinds of
things rear their head, I

143
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.420
just make an entry in
the host's file and having

144
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.850
a course of static IP
address and non-moving IP address

145
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.390
makes that a lot easier.
It also makes port forwarding

146
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.950
easier. So when you're designing
your network first, you've got

147
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.310
to figure out what's your
inventory. If you know that

148
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.080
you're only going to have
a certain number of machines

149
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.720
and maybe an occasional machine
from work, you can lock

150
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.100
things down by, by Mac
address and say, not only

151
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.960
will I lock my wireless
down where I only want

152
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.840
to allow these IP addresses,
but I'll only pass out

153
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.490
an IP address via DHCP
to this list of Mac

154
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.670
addresses. You know, it seems
tedious, but once you've got

155
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.610
that catalog, it's kinda nice
to know that that you're

156
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.610
a little bit more locked
down even internally. So once

157
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.560
you've done that inventory of
the devices that you have

158
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.450
in your house, and you're
setting up your IP addresses,

159
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.120
then you can start thinking
about port forwarding. You can

160
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.050
do it yourself, like go
into your router and say,

161
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.350
I want port 80 to
be forwarded over to this

162
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.540
machine. Or you can let
universal plug and play the

163
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.270
automatic Nat stuff, do that.
And so UPNP, some people

164
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.840
have strong feelings about, basically
this is a protocol that

165
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.950
lets devices announced that they
need to bust a hole

166
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.800
in the firewall and it
could be a device. It

167
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.620
could be a piece of
software. So like windows MSN

168
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.680
messenger announces that it needs
a hole plugged in and

169
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.370
popped into the firewall. Your
X-Box will do that more

170
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.980
than you think we'll we'll
do that. So what you

171
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.530
might think about doing is
taking a look at your

172
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.770
router's advanced options and seeing
if there's a place to

173
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.280
view the table, the complete
list of all holes that

174
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.920
have been punched in your
firewall. And then you can

175
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.020
decide whether you want to
punch them or not through

176
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.450
yourself or not. For example,
sometimes I have trouble with

177
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.710
those ports being opened, but
then never closed again by

178
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.800
the there's like a, become
a morgue thread, but they're,

179
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.430
they're harmless it's stuff like
the voiceover IP stuff for

180
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.110
the Xbox. So I just,
you know, just punched that

181
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.690
hole ahead of time and
you won't have to worry

182
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.660
about UPNP that you can
turn it off. So basically

183
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.540
it's like, it's like the
static DHCP stuff. You can

184
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.360
count on the system to
work every time. Or you

185
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.500
can just set it up
ahead of time and be

186
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.630
done with it. So I've
got three or four holes

187
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.790
that are popped in my
firewall for things like when

188
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.760
you and I do a
DNR TV, right. For, for

189
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.390
some voice over IP things
where I'd really rather not

190
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.310
have the, the systems automatically
open ports also that's because

191
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.890
there are a number of
kind of Trojans and things

192
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.830
that will open a firewall
port for you. Right. So

193
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.580
when you have a protocol
standard like that, anyone can

194
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.010
use it. So then they
can punch holes back into

195
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.350
your firewall. Yep. Yep. One
of the things I'm having

196
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.900
trouble with is that I
used to have Comcast and

197
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.620
I could go into my
Comcast over port 80, and

198
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.550
then I could log into
my windows home server home.

199
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.820
Server's got a really great
feature where you can tell

200
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.340
it, give it a, give
it a name, like a

201
00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.070
sub, a sub domain name,
and it will automatically give

202
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.970
you an externally addressable URL.
So if I want to

203
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.790
say, see if Hanselman is
available and it'll get, give

204
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:11.040
me Hanselman dot, whatever food.com
automatically sets it up. I

205
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.310
just associate it with my
passport. And then I have

206
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.830
an externally addressable, Earl, too.
So kind of thing that

207
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.050
we've been doing for a
long time as geeks with

208
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.850
dynamic DNS, Dyn, dns.org, but
you know, to make, to

209
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.460
make an IP address, you
can't count on available from

210
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.580
the outside, except they've built
it into the, the administrative

211
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.270
interface to home server. But
when I switched over from

212
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.020
Comcast to files or Fios
from Verizon, which is what

213
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.940
we use here in the
States, we want fiber optic.

214
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.930
They shut down port 80.
They will not let you

215
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.170
run anything over port 80.
I can run over 80,

216
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.720
80. I can run over
even four 43, but I

217
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.510
can't get anything out over
port 80. It seems kind

218
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.470
of silly that they're going
to shut down 80, but

219
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.020
they'll let me open up
any other port. And even

220
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.660
though the terms of service
say, don't run a, a

221
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.870
server. I just want to
log into my machine and,

222
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.380
you know, administer things remotely.
I discovered this, unfortunately on

223
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.210
a business trip where everything
was set up, we had

224
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.160
just switched over to. So
then I went to Vegas

225
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.740
and I couldn't get back
into my house. So you

226
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.810
might want to think about
what is your strategy for

227
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.110
getting back into your home
in a secure method? There

228
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:22.180
are things like hamachi H
a M a C H

229
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.620
I hamachi is a, a
VPN client that is a

230
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.110
kind of a peer to
peer VPN open source client

231
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.480
that lets you create a
virtual private network between any

232
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.300
two machines. And it does
all the Nat and network

233
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.000
traversal for you. Basically it
lets you take any two

234
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.390
machines and put them on
a virtual sub-net so that

235
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.350
they could talk directly to
each other. So hamachi is

236
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.380
one way that you could
do that. There's all sorts

237
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.380
of options around VPN. A
lot of the VPN that's

238
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.190
built into the, the routers
that you'll get today. They'll

239
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.500
work just fine with the
basic out of the box

240
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:01.180
chap and PPTP point to
point tunneling protocols stuff that's

241
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.050
built into windows. So the
question is, you know, how

242
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.180
are you going to get
into your machine? Do you

243
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.430
want it to be, I
want to be on the

244
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.590
same sub-net so I want
to be into my network,

245
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.710
right? Which is different than
I want to control my

246
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.890
machine remotely. So there's a
couple of different things you

247
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.960
might want to think about.
Sometimes people don't like the

248
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.860
idea of having the ability
to get in on the

249
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.370
same subnet. You know, for
example, if I set up

250
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.220
a VPN, someone gets in
using my password, they've got

251
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.460
full reign, right? They might
want to use something like

252
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.730
a go to my PC,
but then you've got full

253
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.700
control over a particular computer.
And then you could potentially

254
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.090
cause havoc that way. So
you want to ask yourself

255
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.210
what, what level of risk
is appropriate? There's also things

256
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.440
like folder share folder share
of course, lets you synchronize

257
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.030
folders between machines and traverses
networks automatically. Right? You got

258
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.880
a question about folder share.
Cause So lets you grab

259
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.280
files remotely. So sometimes all
you need is a file.

260
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.080
So why open up all
those holes when you just

261
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.250
want to, right. Right. We,
we had set up folders

262
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.070
share before and a windows
live messenger then came out

263
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.490
with a folder sharing technology
and I know Microsoft bought

264
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.220
folder share. Is that the
same stuff? Cause it doesn't

265
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.490
seem to work for me.
Yeah. I'm not quite sure.

266
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.240
I, when it came out,
I immediately, He said, Oh

267
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.900
this is clearly photo-sharing technology.
But I thought, you know,

268
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.450
you you're in MSN messenger,
pops up a thing and

269
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.700
says, Carl Franklin wants to have
a sharing folder with you.

270
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.400
And then immediately I said,
Oh good, finally a use

271
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.880
for, for this stuff. But
it never works for me,

272
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.760
frankly. The other thing that
never works for me is

273
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.400
a video conferencing. You know,
when was the last time

274
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.620
you successfully got a video
conference to work over a

275
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.940
messenger for me, it's about
three out of 10. Just

276
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.290
can't seem to get it
to work unless I'm on

277
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.510
the wide open firewall, free
internet. Yeah. If you're going

278
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.100
to do stuff like that,
that's another guy actually a

279
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.720
good, good reason to, to
forward a port and bust

280
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.280
a few holes in your
firewall. If you're going to

281
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.370
be doing video conferencing with
your, with your parents a

282
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.480
lot. Yeah. The, the folder
share stuff built into messenger.

283
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.660
Definitely. It has some problems,
but I believe, and I

284
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.490
do, but I do believe,
yes, it is a, a

285
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.660
Photoshop based technology. Although folder
share works all the time.

286
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.020
Never had a problem with
it either. Yeah. So you

287
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.720
gotta have, so the point
there was ask yourself, what

288
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.150
level of access do I
need back into my own

289
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.880
system from, from outside, if
I'm on the road, if

290
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.610
any, and what do I
want to do about it?

291
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.960
I could leave my firewall
completely locked down and use

292
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.530
something like folder share to
access an occasional file. Certainly

293
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.570
make sure that you have
a really strong password if

294
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.270
you're gonna be using any
kind of remote technology like

295
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.650
this, right? Some people just
port forward, the RDP, the

296
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.700
remote desktop port, or they
use VNC, right? Virtual network

297
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.330
computing that VNC there's about
you use tight VNC, ultra

298
00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.980
Ultra VNC. Yeah. But I've
used, I've used a few

299
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.820
different ones. Ultra has the
features that, that I need,

300
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.480
Right. Ultra has the ability
to send a file upload.

301
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.500
You can, auto-scale the graphics,
you can auto scale, the

302
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.890
color depth, any one of
these remote tools or for

303
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.450
something simpler, something like copilot
for occasional control or go

304
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.480
to my PC. Right? Those
are those all, you know,

305
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.990
provide a, an attack vector
on a bit of surface

306
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.570
area. It's being exposed for
the evil people to get

307
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:31.210
into. So when you're putting
together a home network, you

308
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.130
want to ask yourself, what
is the access that I

309
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:38.080
require and how can I
make it minimal, but still

310
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:42.190
functional. Yeah. Same things applies
to things like, am I

311
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:47.410
going to broadcast my, my
SSI D right. You know,

312
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.840
for awhile I used, my
last name is my assets

313
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.240
ID, but then someone could
potentially be driving down the

314
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.340
street. See my last name,
know that I lived there

315
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.520
and find them, you know,
find the house. Yeah. You

316
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.490
can also use things like,
you know, eight Oh two

317
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.340
dot 11 X and Kerberos
and set up, you know,

318
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.320
certificate based authentication. So you
can go to whatever level

319
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.190
of, of careful that you
want, but don't just turn

320
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.070
on your router and, and
forget about it. Or I

321
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.110
gotta put a little thought
into it. Right. So we've

322
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.150
been talking about wireless, but
here's something that I actually,

323
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.800
I wanted to talk about
early on, but I got

324
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.950
caught up in it all.
I really am a fan

325
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:27.760
of wired networks. Better performance.
Yeah. Way better. Especially with

326
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.400
gigabit now being so cheap.
Oh, price is coming down.

327
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.660
It's crazy. You want to
find out, can you pull

328
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.480
the Kayla yourself? Are you
building a house? Do you

329
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.880
have walls that you can
get into? Can you bring

330
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.360
a professional cable puller in
best thing I ever did?

331
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.640
And I was a little
expensive. I spent about $1,100

332
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.730
about a thousand dollars, but
I spent that thousand dollars

333
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.260
five ago and I went
and had cable pulled into

334
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.660
every room in the house,
put in very nice plugs

335
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.330
into the wall. Looks like
a phone plug, right? RJ

336
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.900
45. It's just a wider
version of RJ 11. So

337
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.550
people don't look at it
and go, what's that weird

338
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.760
thing on your wall. And
I've got two network ports

339
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.370
in every room in the
house. And this is an

340
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.190
important point when your cable
polar does this stuff and

341
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.640
you start plugging in those
ports, do an actual real

342
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.930
world test. Yes. Before you
bet, before you, before you

343
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.540
pay the guy before you,
yeah. Before you seal up

344
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.840
the walls. Right? So what
we ended up doing was

345
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.870
he wired the whole house.
He did cat five at

346
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.670
the time. I think cat
six is what you want

347
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.040
to do now. I'm not
sure yet. So he did

348
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.800
cat five everywhere in the
house. And then I started

349
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.320
going to each room and
I would watch a video

350
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.760
over the new wired network
and found two rooms where

351
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.610
we were getting bad, basically
bad throughput. Huh? So we

352
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.670
ended up moving some things
around. We had hypothesized that

353
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.940
perhaps we'd moved a cable
by an electrical, you know,

354
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.400
too close to an electrical
outlet. We jiggled some things

355
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.830
around. We moved some things
from side to side. He

356
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.720
had some kind of a
signal sensor that he would

357
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.940
put on both sides. So
then the guy in the

358
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.760
attic move things around and
then we got our full,

359
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.340
you know, nearly saturated. I
think we ended up with

360
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.220
like 60 or 70, cause
you're talking about a hundred

361
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.220
megabit network. Right. But it
saturates somewhere around 60 or

362
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.240
70, you know, with room
for burst. But the difference

363
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.940
is it's the difference between
copying a four gig, you

364
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.850
know, a virtual machine file
and having it take less

365
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.190
than an hour versus having
to take all day. Right?

366
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.650
So if you're moving big
files around, if you're planning

367
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.470
on doing especially streaming of
high definition video, you know,

368
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.970
this sure. It requires huge
amounts of bandwidth. And with

369
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.430
the setup that I already
had with the replay TVs,

370
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.370
which are those, those DVRs,
those are networked and they

371
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.190
let me watch shows that
are on the other. So

372
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.100
I could be taping a
show downstairs, watching it upstairs.

373
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.350
Did you ever have it
find a need for more

374
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:56.750
than two drops? I did.
Interesting, very good point. So

375
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.690
initially I thought who, who
in the world could need

376
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.450
more than two drops Her
room. Right. But I mean,

377
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.270
if you've got TiVo in
a week, there you go.

378
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.790
So what I ended up
doing was I got these

379
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.420
little adapters from, I think
it was geek. It was

380
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.390
it think geek, right? Geek
toys. One of those geek

381
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.530
websites where it's a, it's
a Y adapter for ethernet

382
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.620
basically uses one of the
unused pairs. You plug it

383
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.080
in to the, to the
wall and it turns your

384
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.050
one port into two. And
then you have to have

385
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.010
an identical adapter on the
other side. So it, a

386
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.600
lot of them, it's like
a $10 thing and it'll

387
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.720
automatically turn one port into
two. That's kind of a

388
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.700
poor man's hub. When it
just, you don't want to

389
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.560
go and plug in a
hub and do all that

390
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.140
for the rooms that I've
got a lot of stuff

391
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.990
in. I ended up indeed
mounting a mounting, a hub

392
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.120
on the wall and doing
it that way. Right. So

393
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.720
yeah, in retrospect, I would
have put in a, probably

394
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.450
better quality wire. I would
have got whatever the top

395
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.580
of the line was at
the time. Cause you only

396
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.010
going to be in your
wall once my neighbor put

397
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.150
in some PVC piping. So
he's got room to pull

398
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.370
more cable if he ever
wanted to. So he could

399
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.740
pull fiber optic if he
felt like it that's something

400
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.230
that I was not clever
enough to do. So if

401
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.670
you are going to open
up a wall or if

402
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.530
you're gonna do it from
the ceiling and pushed down

403
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.960
through the insulation, if you're
in the States and you

404
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.840
have a wood house with
hollow walls, all my friends

405
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.880
from outside the States laugh
at us, what they have,

406
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.370
they have very strong, you
know, brick walls, concrete walls,

407
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.590
right. And they'll just run
a wire and then cover

408
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.390
it with a conduit or
something with a conduit or

409
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.400
something. And then when they,
when they hear that our

410
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.070
houses are made of paper
and we're shoving cables in

411
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.520
the walls through, through blown,
in puffed pink insulation, I

412
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.550
think they think that's pretty
funny. Yeah. So I would

413
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.950
have actually put tubes in
and prepared myself to be

414
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:43.270
able to pull other cables
in the future. But for

415
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:48.700
me, the we and the
tablet PC are the only

416
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.600
wireless things I think I
have left. And I, you

417
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.460
know, and I may actually
come up with a way

418
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.400
to, to just turn the
wireless off entirely when I

419
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.430
went, you know, when I
don't need it. Right. Because

420
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.190
I just, I find, I
find the wired, maybe I'm

421
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.440
an old timer, but I
think that there is value

422
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.190
in wired installations, especially when
you're talking about your main

423
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:14.520
machine. Right? So Scott, I
have this, I'm like, you

424
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.890
probably, you know, I subscribe
to digital cable and I

425
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.310
have this, a Motorola box
cable box. So we've talked

426
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:25.140
about before that most people
have, and it seems it

427
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.500
does have a network Jack,
but of course there's no

428
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.690
way to use it that
I know of. And it

429
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.800
also has a, a USB
port for external hard drives.

430
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.110
But of course that doesn't
work either. Is there any,

431
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.640
any difference, any change in,
in a technology coming, anything

432
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.790
that you can do? Well,
if you're talking about the,

433
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.690
the Motorola, I think it's
the 65 12, I believe

434
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.680
you're right. This is an
interesting box because every once

435
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.330
in a while, every three
or four months, I'll just

436
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.520
stop by. And this is
weird of me, but I

437
00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.090
stopped by my Comcast cable
location. I bring my box

438
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.680
with me and I have
to add this. Isn't really

439
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.020
working very well. And they'll
give me another one. And

440
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.860
it'll say like 65, 14
<inaudible> and it'll have a

441
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.410
slightly different thing going on
in the back. And I've

442
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.710
done a lot of Googling
around about this. It's really

443
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.680
a hardware platform. The Motorola
guys have said, here's a

444
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.150
hardware platform, here's a development
kit. Here's some, some things

445
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.600
like recording services and things
like that, but the hardware

446
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.600
isn't baked in. So there's,
there's the Motorola kind of

447
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:32.040
reference platform. There's the TiVo
port implementation of, of the

448
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.300
stuff onto the media, under
the Motorola platform, right? There's

449
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:41.640
also a TV guide implementation.
So they've created this hardware

450
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.280
platform. It's just that whoever's
doing the development. If it's

451
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.330
Comcast or the cable company
or TV guide or whoever

452
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.730
they haven't chosen to exploit
those things personally, I think

453
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.860
it's because they're afraid of
the support. But I, I

454
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.360
suspect with the external hard
drive issue, they're a little

455
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.460
concerned about that. That content
escaping, I personally would love

456
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.010
nothing more than to plug
in a 250 gig, external

457
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.250
hard drive. Cause right now
we've got stuff queuing up,

458
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.480
you know, whole, whole seasons
of Right. It doesn't, you

459
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.950
know, it doesn't take long
for it to fill up,

460
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.220
especially with HD content. Yeah.
I've only got like 17

461
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.800
hours on my little Mueller
roll and it's very frustrating.

462
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.450
I've got a whole season
of Dexter I need to

463
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.520
catch up on, or I'm
gonna lose. I've attempted to

464
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.400
Google anybody. Who's replaced the
hard drive with a bigger

465
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.670
version, but I've heard through
the vine that that sort

466
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.520
of doesn't work. Right. And
then of course, they've got

467
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.760
a, an RJ 45 plug
in the back. Nothing happens

468
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.790
when you plug into it.
Right. The only device that

469
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.480
I've seen that really makes
use of a home networking

470
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.510
is the, is the, the
replay TV, which is largely

471
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.780
considered the beta max of
digital video players. Yeah. The

472
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.380
replay TV would allow you
to stream between rooms and

473
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.370
it would allow also allow
you the, the controversial feature

474
00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.360
of sending your show to
a friend this also involved

475
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:06.040
opening ports. And there was
a website called <inaudible> P

476
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.410
O O P L. I
haven't checked on lots of

477
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.980
see up. And it's basically
like a Craigslist for shows.

478
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.400
So it would say, Hey,
I didn't see Dexter last

479
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.010
night. Anybody got that? Oh,
I have it. I'll send

480
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.840
it to you. They add
you as a friend and

481
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.210
your friend's list and they
send it to you. And

482
00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.650
you're not, it's not a
share. It's not, it's not

483
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.450
as bad as it sounds.
It's not a sharing in

484
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.450
the sense that they'll send
it to you. You can

485
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.910
watch it or deleted. You
can't copy it. Can't do

486
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.310
anything with it. Can't send
it along. So it's not

487
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.160
like Napster. It's just like,
Hey, your friend wants to

488
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.990
share this episode of the
Simpsons with you. I've got

489
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:40.000
a quick anecdote and then
we'll wrap it up. And

490
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.720
that is, I missed one.
I missed a show on

491
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.490
TV. And so I decided
to go with a BitTorrent

492
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:53.170
client and find it and
download it. And I did

493
00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:57.340
that. And then I re,
and then about a week

494
00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.630
later, the internet went down
and it was down, you

495
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.520
know, I'm used to an
outage for an hour or

496
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.760
two, but when it goes
for a day, I call.

497
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.480
And when I called, I
found out that they saw

498
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.570
that I had downloaded that
they watched me, they watched

499
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:19.210
my stream. And because, because
that was unauthorized, they fricking

500
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.000
pulled the plug on my
internet service. Same thing happened

501
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.940
to me. We talked about
bit torn a while back.

502
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.460
And I used a bit
torrent to download a show

503
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.890
that I had missed. Right.
I think it was an

504
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.320
episode of heroes. And about
two days later, I got

505
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.220
a letter from the legal
department saying, here's your IP

506
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.380
address? Here's the time you
did it. Here's the show,

507
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.860
knock it off. And that
was the day I stopped.

508
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.000
I was like, you know,
cause lots of people downloaded

509
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.800
stuff on Napster back in
the day back when we

510
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.360
didn't think about it, but
I've gotten so much more

511
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.490
focused on kind of like
intellectual property. If I want

512
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.030
to download, if I want
to. It's interesting. I'm more

513
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.970
concerned about music because I
think it directly affects the

514
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.830
artists. It wasn't something I
hadn't already paid for. I

515
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.890
have cable, it was on
cable. I could have watched

516
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.960
it, but I missed it.
Well, you know, and that's,

517
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.080
and, and totally, I would
definitely would encourage people not

518
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.990
to use their BitTorrent clients
to download TV shows just

519
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.960
because the legal exposure is
too great. I haven't figured

520
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.790
it out yet. I checked
out just today, nbc.com. It's

521
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:25.100
fantastic. They've got every episode
of heroes, very high quality

522
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.570
video, full screen available for
watching online. And here's the

523
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.970
part that's amazing to me.
Like that's becoming more and

524
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.310
more common. Almost every network
here in the U S

525
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.950
has the shows go online
a couple of days after,

526
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.960
so you can watch them
if you miss them, but

527
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.060
they include like a picture
and picture cast commentary. So

528
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.690
you've got basically two simultaneous
video feeds. And it's interesting.

529
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.320
They've got a button that
says minimize audio. So basically

530
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.600
it lets you turn down
the mix on the main

531
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.670
show and turn up the
mix on the commentary. And

532
00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.470
they've got like the director
of the writer and the

533
00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.320
producer sitting in a chair,
watching the show with you

534
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.470
and explaining what's going on,
just like DVDs. So stuff

535
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.870
like that when they make
it easy for me and

536
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.180
they provide extras that are
as good or better than

537
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.790
a DVD. I mean, it's
not just commentary, but it's

538
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.850
actual video commentary of them
talking. Yeah. Then I'll be

539
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.160
much less likely to go
and try to hunt for

540
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.090
something on online via, via
bit torn. All right, Scott.

541
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.090
Well, I think that's, It's
about covers everything I can

542
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.420
think of in home networks
In conclusion. Think about pulling

543
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:31.580
cable. If you can understand
what your requirements are, consider

544
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.870
doing a static DHCP leases,
be aware of what ports

545
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.440
are busted open in your
firewall. If any, consider turning

546
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.230
off UPNP. If you think
you can get away with

547
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:46.790
it, don't broadcast your wireless
SSI D and also consider

548
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.810
your wireless security options. And
then, and then think about

549
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.700
how you're going to get
back into your house if

550
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.010
you're away, whether it be
something like a remote control

551
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.550
piece of software or a
VPN or a private network,

552
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.690
like a hamachi. Wow. Awesome.
And with that, we'll talk

553
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.060
to you later, Scott. Thanks.
And we'll see you next

554
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:14.930
week on handsome minutes. <inaudible>.
