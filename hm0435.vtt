trans hack. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

12
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.330
episode of Hansel minutes, and
I'm chatting today with dr.

13
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.560
Courtney Ryan Ziegler. Dr. Ziegler
is based in Oakland and

14
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.250
has a wide body of
artistic and academic work focusing

15
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.370
on queer and trans issues
and is the founder of

16
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.520
this amazing new thing called
trans hack. Thanks for joining

17
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.510
me. Thank you for having
me excited. Thanks. So you

18
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.990
you've got not just a
PhD in African American studies,

19
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.080
but in fact, the first
person to get a PhD

20
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.830
in AA studies from Northwestern.
Yep. Does that mean that

21
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.480
it was the beginning of
that program or did you

22
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.870
help design that program? How
does that work? Yeah, I,

23
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.810
wasn't a PhD in 2005
at university of Illinois, and

24
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.630
I wasn't feeling that program.
And at the same time,

25
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.810
Northwestern was, I guess, developing
their PhD. They had an

26
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.860
undergraduate degree in African American
studies at their school, but

27
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.260
they were becoming the seventh
program in the country at

28
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.800
that time to develop a
PhD doctoral level studies. So

29
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.620
I threw my hat in
the ring and decided to

30
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.770
apply. And I was part
of the first cohort. There

31
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.080
were five of us accepted
in 2006 and I crossed

32
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.580
the finish line in 2011.
That's fantastic. And you've been

33
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.790
online and kind of in
the, in the online space

34
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.460
for years now, over 10
plus years, you had a

35
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.290
popular blog going back as
far as 2003. Did that

36
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.960
blog, was that your first
foray into online in the

37
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.990
online space? No, I think
I tweet about this a

38
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.740
lot, but I was a
child of like the 19

39
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.300
nineties.com thing happening. Right. So
I got my first computer

40
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.270
when I was 15 and
was chatting on AOL and

41
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.530
prodigy and all of those
things and taught myself how

42
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.430
to develop web pages through
the internet and all the

43
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.440
AOL just that I would
get in the mail. So

44
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.100
I guess that would be
my first foray into like

45
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.490
Online life, developing this profile.
And not only that, but

46
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.700
finding people and connecting with
people and building relationships over

47
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.430
the years and how these
identities have shifted as different

48
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.810
technologies have emerged. Right. Shifting
from AOL to prodigy to

49
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.150
friend, sir, I remember than
my space, but you know,

50
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.360
and everybody's aging, but we're
aging through social media. So,

51
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.770
and then, yeah, once I
got addicted to the internet,

52
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.460
I just never stopped. And
when I was in graduate

53
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.290
school, one of the things
that helped me a lot

54
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.900
was putting my work online
and connecting with other scholars

55
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.020
who felt some sort of
isolation in the Academy, or

56
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.300
just felt that they weren't
smart enough to be there,

57
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.270
whatever they felt, I needed
some sort of connection. So

58
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.590
I felt that way and
started blogging and my blog

59
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.030
became extremely successful and won
multiple awards and things like

60
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.780
that. And I stopped blogging
in 2006 because I was

61
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.050
entering my doctorate well into
my doctoral studies at Northwestern.

62
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.030
So, so yeah, it was
great. I remember being part

63
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.950
of, I guess, w you
know, a data where at

64
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.480
feminist blogosphere, right. That's what
it was called and the

65
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.440
early two thousands. And it
was great connecting with all

66
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.200
these women and queer folks
and writing articles before think

67
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.920
pieces where like the official
thing to do, we have

68
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.180
blog carnivals and all kinds
of awesome stuff. So Yeah,

69
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.430
this was really on the
forefront. Your blog was called

70
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.230
Blackademic and it seemed like
it was really the beginning

71
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.710
of academics getting online. And
I think your point there

72
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.380
that people felt disenfranchised by
academia itself and when basically

73
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.260
went online to create their
own academic circle for deep

74
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.880
think pieces and analysis online.
Exactly. And you were one

75
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.030
of the first people to
do kind of grassroots funding.

76
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.220
Again, all these things that
we take for granted in

77
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.390
2014, when you went in
2000, I think it was

78
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.850
2007 to 2008 to do
your first film, you and

79
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.570
your producer went online to
do a, get your funds.

80
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.850
Exactly. Thanks for bringing that
up. I, yeah, I, but

81
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.250
I follow the method with
other black queer filmmakers have

82
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.430
done before me, which is
yeah. Kickstarter before there was

83
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.470
Kickstarter, you know, crowdfunding locally,
you know, amongst your community

84
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.510
and your friends and activists
and things like that because

85
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.490
they want to see the
story to be seen. Right.

86
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.910
So I use Blackademic to
crowdfund for still black eye

87
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.480
shots. And maybe if three
minutes, like really just basic

88
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.700
basic trailer of a black
trans man, his name is

89
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.810
Ethan, even Thomas Young. And he
lives in Ohio and shot

90
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.200
his little interview, whatever, and
put it on the internet

91
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.690
and was like, I'm trying
to raise money for this

92
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.000
film. And if you contribute
to my film, you will

93
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.850
be credited in the credits
forever for, you know, contributing

94
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.780
to history. And there was
no, there weren't any perks

95
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.560
or any things like that.
It was just like, you,

96
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.550
you know, no matter what
you donate, you know, you

97
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.250
will be credited because this
is important. It hasn't been

98
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.460
done before. And we raised
a significant amount of funds

99
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.880
to have the film complete.
And if you watch it

100
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.830
today, it still has all
the lists of all the

101
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.410
funders who really helped to
make history from $5 to

102
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.060
a thousand dollars to $2,000.
People really put all their

103
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.710
pockets to help make this
film. So, Wow. So a

104
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.660
bunch of little associate producer.
Exactly. And this is in,

105
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.450
you know, like you say,
almost seven, eight years ago

106
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.300
now, and that of course
went on to win a

107
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.020
number of awards for best
documentary and at film festivals.

108
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.880
And as you're, as you're
looking at this, this space

109
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.850
online, and you're a creative,
you're an academic, you've made

110
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.000
a film, you also do
public speaking. How did you

111
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.070
move though into tech? Because
I don't see programmer or,

112
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.680
or, or hacker on your,
on your resume until recently?

113
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.090
Yeah. Well, I'm not a
programmer, but I think I've

114
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.920
always been a hacker. And
when I think of hacker,

115
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.620
I think of someone who
right. Really uses technologies that

116
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.960
make something new, right. Kind
of pulling together from different

117
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.410
things. Like I said, I'm
a self-taught web developer, and

118
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.140
that has been an important
skill that I've used to

119
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.950
not only develop my blog
in the early two thousands,

120
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.500
when all you had was
like blogger and some plugins.

121
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.690
And if you knew, you
know, HTML and CSS, you

122
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.470
could really make something awesome.
Right. So that was definitely

123
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.130
part of my, not only
like online development as developing

124
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.610
my scholarly voice, but my
technical voice. And also as

125
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.220
a filmmaker, I think when
we think of tech, we

126
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.180
limit it to programming. And
that's a problem because we

127
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.440
never really talk about how,
you know, being able to

128
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.070
have software literacy as part
of tech, right. Being able

129
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.490
to use these programs, to
tell our stories. And so

130
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.190
I'm also a self-taught editor
and filmmaker and everything that

131
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.310
I've done. Like, for example,
when you watch the black,

132
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.070
you see that I edited,
I did the sound, I

133
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.630
did, you know, I was
a cinematographer and those things

134
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.740
take technical skill that we
don't really give legitimacy to

135
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.240
or credibility to. And so
that's important. So I've always

136
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.150
had a technical background, but
I really wanted to shift

137
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.400
that yet. So I'm really
working to shift what the

138
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.250
idea of tech is, but
also living in the Bay

139
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.290
area, Silicon Valley, I guess,
participating in tons of hackathons

140
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.990
and tech events as a
filmmaker, as an artist, as

141
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.630
a scholar, I really got
to thinking like, wow, this,

142
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:53.080
this, this space is really
awesome for collaboration and innovation

143
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.470
and all these kind of
buzz words, people type toss

144
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.340
around. It's important. It will
be great if I could,

145
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.880
you know, utilize the space
in a different way than

146
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.720
just, you know, knowing these
skills, but also trying to

147
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.230
bring visibility to the community
that I am, that I'm

148
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.290
in. And so that's when
I kind of devise transact.

149
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.260
So Is the goal to
bring visibility of the existence

150
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.870
of tech and the idea
of technical literacy to the

151
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.080
trans community, or is it
to bring the visibility of

152
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.510
the trans community into the
tech space? Or is it

153
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.240
a little of both? It's
both, it's all of that.

154
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.920
It's to, you know, give
trans people a representation of

155
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.320
themselves that were there, we're
early adopters of multiple types

156
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.440
of technologies that I don't
think were, were included in

157
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.630
those discussions of that, right.
We're consumers of technology as,

158
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.270
so there's all these. So
there's multiple angles in which

159
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.770
my goal with trans transac
and the work that I

160
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.760
do is trying to address,
and also really focusing on

161
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.920
how to funnel, you know,
resources to the community, right?

162
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.530
I think, again, living in
here in Silicon Valley where

163
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.320
there's so much wealth and
so many, you know, wealth

164
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.100
given to people with, again,
using a buzzword, innovative ideas,

165
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.250
our community is very innovative.
We're brilliant where some of

166
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.040
the most highly educated people
in the country, if you

167
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.440
look at our statistics, but
we're also the most underemployed

168
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.480
and unemployed and discriminated against.
So why not really focus

169
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.490
on a space in which
there's so much possibility and

170
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.890
focus on the trans people
who are part of that

171
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.990
possibility and those who wants
to be included as well.

172
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.740
So, So you brought up
an interesting point that, you

173
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.940
know, the statistics, education, statistics
show that transgender people have

174
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.550
advanced degrees have, but again,
have a high high rate

175
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:54.620
of unemployment, unfortunately, high rate
of hopelessness homelessness, and the

176
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.470
average income is very low.
W why is that? Why

177
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:03.290
are, why are they so
disenfranchised Discrimination people, you know,

178
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.250
there's, there aren't any up
until recently now. And there's,

179
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.790
you know, president Obama about
a few weeks ago signed

180
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.680
an executive order to cover
Trent coverage, gender identity, and

181
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.790
workplace protections, right? And so
prior to that, there's still

182
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.760
like 36 States, 32 States
where you can fire somebody

183
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.310
for not only being trans,
being gay, queer, whoever, you

184
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:30.230
know. And so without policy
and legislation, I think to

185
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.370
protect people there, it doesn't
matter how amazing and brilliant

186
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.850
you are when people are
legally allowed to discriminate against

187
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:42.500
you. Right? So there's that
side. There's also just ignorance.

188
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.580
People are ignorant. I think
people fear a lot of

189
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.070
the unknown and those trends
is very visible now and

190
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.640
shifting so many perspectives and
identities and, and, you know,

191
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.490
trans is almost like a
household transgender, at least as

192
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.460
almost a household term now.
And people are learning what

193
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.740
ASIS is and cisgender and
all these different uses of

194
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.220
pronouns and things like that.
It's great. That's also not

195
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.960
translating into people. Hiring trans
people are really doing the

196
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.670
work to figure out that
yeah, you do have a

197
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.670
community of people who are
just so highly educated, but

198
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.740
because there's not enough, I
guess, pushed to, to discuss

199
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.990
that it leads to disinfect
to, to disparity of all

200
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.690
sorts. So, Yeah, I think
that when in the early

201
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:35.520
nineties, late eighties, when I
was in high school amongst

202
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.470
peer, my peers and peer
groups, there was a lot

203
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:42.240
of out there in the,
in the open discrimination against,

204
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.080
against gays. And then the,
and this is just one

205
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.780
example, but then when you
started to see shows like

206
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.710
will and grace and more
gay people on television fast

207
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.580
forward 20 years, and you
have a young, a group

208
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.440
of young people, who've grown
up and seen that, and

209
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.240
you can see while there's
still bullying in schools. I

210
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.520
have seen, at least in
my kids' schools, people basically

211
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.620
saying, Hey, man, that's not
cool. Like we don't do

212
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.320
that, that they even joke
about that on the movies

213
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.290
like 21 jump street, where
a kid who went to

214
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.390
high school in the eighties
comes in and immediately finds

215
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.340
the first gay kid and
punches him in the face,

216
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.890
thinking that that would make
him cool, but he missed

217
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.000
out on 20 years of,
of change and of, of

218
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.390
progressiveness both in the media.
And, and then that became

219
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.100
an inappropriate thing for him
to do. And that was

220
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.440
joked about in this movie,
but in the, in the

221
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.650
trans space, it's only been
the last, maybe two years

222
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.640
when we started to see
transgender people get recognized for

223
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.330
their work in movies. Like
for example, Lorraine Cox was

224
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.540
on the cover of time
recently and is on oranges,

225
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.700
new black, suddenly that issue
is coming to be in

226
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.540
the forefront. Do you think
fast forward, 20 years that

227
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.780
we'll see that same kind
of a sea change happen

228
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.000
that we are beginning to
see or have seen amongst

229
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.510
the gay and lesbian space?
I hope Not because if

230
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.400
it's like this in 20
years, that means we haven't

231
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.790
made that much progress. Right.
So I think like images,

232
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.400
you know, women like the
Vern costs are so important

233
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.250
in Janet mock and people
like Tyler Broaddus and all

234
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:16.800
of these figures who are
really Pudding, You know, even

235
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.340
myself, I always include myself
in, in, in this kind

236
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.780
of shifting of, of discussions
through trans individuals and trans

237
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.010
voices and, and advocacy. But
yeah, it's definitely gaining the

238
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:33.810
momentum and that's great because
again, it brings up issues

239
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.630
of how do we shift
policy? How do we, you

240
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.210
know, hire more trans people?
How do we even know

241
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.460
that trans people even exist?
Kind of things like that,

242
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.820
how do we make services
better? How do we produce,

243
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.370
you know, compassionate amongst people
so that they feel that

244
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.640
they have some kind of
human connection to trans people.

245
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.380
All of those things I
think are happening right now.

246
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.370
And so hopefully in 20
years, you know, a completely

247
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.320
new, and it sucks to
say that a completely new

248
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.730
identity will be, you know,
people will like find some

249
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.660
interest in trying to eradicate
bigotry and hate surrounding that.

250
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.570
But I think, yeah, you
know, this is definitely a

251
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.310
trans moment and I'm excited
to be a part of

252
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.880
it and see what happens.
So, Yeah, it's amazing. And

253
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.630
you've been actually recognized more
than just nationally. Of course,

254
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.370
you fly all over the
world speaking, but you were

255
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.430
at the white house. I
was following you on Instagram.

256
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.700
And then I saw your
invitation and I saw some

257
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.130
selfies with the president. And
then, you know, you kind

258
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.620
of went, went dark for
a minute there, and then

259
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.390
you were back at the
white house. Again, you went

260
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.940
twice in a month. Yeah.
I went twice in a

261
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.530
week. I, yeah, I flew,
I did an overnight or

262
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.410
red nights ago. I was
invited by the president to

263
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.890
attend the LGBT reception that
he has in his house.

264
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.670
It's so crazy. It's he
has in his house and

265
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.160
I just, one day was
walking home and, you know,

266
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.990
got an email alert and
checked it out. And I

267
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.420
was like, this is like
a joke. Like why would

268
00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.820
the president invited me, you
know, that imposter syndrome, people

269
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.970
talk about a lot about
that. I'm not worthy of

270
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.490
being invited. And it's like,
well, actually Courtney, yeah, you've

271
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.410
been doing decades of work.
You are worthy of being

272
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.740
invited to have your work
honored and recognized by, you

273
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.700
know, the president of the
United States. So I went for

274
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.080
that, but I also had
another obligation prior to that.

275
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.460
And that was the white
house held its first ever

276
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:31.420
LGBT innovation summit, which invited
LGBT entrepreneurs and people in

277
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.320
tech and innovators across industries
who are really focusing on

278
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.290
creating solutions to all the
problems that, you know, the

279
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:43.030
community experiences. And so I,
as a representative of transac,

280
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.320
along with other founders of
organizations, put our money and

281
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.670
mows together and filled up
the auditorium at the white

282
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.720
house with amazing trans and
queer and lesbian and gay

283
00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.910
entrepreneurs and had an amazing
day of, of potential policy

284
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.830
talks and also fireside chats
with people and elevator pitches

285
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.560
where people shared their work
with one another to secure

286
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.640
funding and, you know, formulate
relationships. And then we had

287
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.920
an awesome reception afterwards and
it was just such an

288
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.510
amazing time. So yeah, within
one week I was in,

289
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.630
in Washington, DC at the
actual white house for two

290
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.930
separate events. But I think
the first one hanging out

291
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.200
with the president and drinking
whiskey was awesome. That was

292
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.020
just like, that was amazing.
The second one was super

293
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.050
cool because it was amazing
to, you know, to partner

294
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.900
with other Oregon and make
sure trans people and their

295
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.800
voices were represented at, at
this summit. But yeah, again,

296
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.260
it's just being in the
space in the same room

297
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.160
with the first black president
as a black trans man

298
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.770
from Compton is, you know,
it's amazing to me, I'll

299
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.360
never forget that day. So
W what, what does it

300
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.440
feel like to have so
many likeminded people in one

301
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.830
space, like the density of
people in your space and

302
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:05.450
your space of ag advocacy,
trans people in one location,

303
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.640
not just such an amazing
location as the white house,

304
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.100
but does that give you
a sense that things are

305
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.290
going to be okay? Does
that give you energy and

306
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:17.720
buoyancy when you're kind of
feeling lonely or disconnected? Totally.

307
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.240
And, you know, it's like
those moments where, you know,

308
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.000
the world is pretty difficult
and we all have our

309
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.150
issues and we all struggle
too. I think we're all

310
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.360
struggling or working towards being
good people and doing it

311
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.270
things no matter what industry
we're in, but it's always

312
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.500
an important and beautiful and
uplifting and energy recharging or

313
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.760
whatever you want to call
it to be in a

314
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.400
room of people who have
a similar goal and a

315
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.100
similar idea of how to
make our species better, because

316
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.980
yeah. Then, you know, there's
still like, I don't know,

317
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.490
almost 7 billion other people who
disagree with you. Right. And

318
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.800
so it's, it's beautiful to
be in that space. It's

319
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.160
uplifting. It makes you feel
that your work matters in

320
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.560
those times where you feel
crazy and someone tells you

321
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.580
it doesn't, you know, so
definitely. So the goal, of

322
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.060
course, ultimately, whether it be
for someone who's transgendered or

323
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.090
someone who's, cis-gendered like, like
I am, is I think

324
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.460
well said when we say
life, Liberty, and the pursuit

325
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.650
of happiness, people should be
able to go out there,

326
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.040
do good work, receive a
fair wage for that work,

327
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.670
not be homeless and feel
generally, I think the best

328
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.400
word is empowered in doing
what they're doing. And that's

329
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.810
what you're trying to do
with trans hack. And I

330
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.560
understand that you had an
event in Chicago recently, how

331
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.000
did that go? It went
spectacular. It was a fantastic

332
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.130
event. Transac launched last September,
actually. Yeah. We'll be in

333
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.420
existence a year, this September.
So we had our first

334
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:48.440
event September 13th through the 15th
of 2013. And it was

335
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.290
amazing. We had about 40
plus hackers, about eight speakers,

336
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.970
people who trans people who
work in tech at multiple,

337
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.120
at Google Apple, you had
Janet mock who talked about

338
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.870
her hashtag girls like us.
We had a wide variety

339
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.230
of trans identities and people
came up with some amazing

340
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.340
things, an app, a Yelp
like app, where you can

341
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:18.890
find resources and rate them
social surveying app website, where

342
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:24.710
you can Lin your anonymous
information to trans you know,

343
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.670
research studies, which are, is
important because there is a

344
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.310
lack of that on so
many of our lives, but

345
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.500
a lot of trans people
because of privacy issues, don't

346
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.060
feel comfortable being kind of
research subjects for multiple reasons.

347
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.340
And that's, that's awesome. So
things like that have kind

348
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.400
of emerged from the first
couple of events and we

349
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.470
traveled to Las Vegas, just,
you know, really tap into

350
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.900
what's happening to that startup
scene there. And that was

351
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.320
really awesome. And yeah, our
last event was in Chicago

352
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.550
a couple of months ago.
And that was amazing because

353
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.790
we partnered with the trans
100. And so the winners

354
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.620
of this particular hackathon were
able to pitch their, their

355
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.460
app in front of a
live audience that was broadcast

356
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.370
to the world. And in
front of Laverne Cox, who

357
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.820
was the guest speaker. So,
and out of that came,

358
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:25.330
I want to say like
nine prototypes of multiple apps.

359
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.160
One in particular, which was
featured in wired magazine is

360
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.790
an app called tramp mobile
app called transgress. And it's

361
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.600
a content filtering. Yeah. That
allows you to access pages

362
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.110
that are relevant to the
trans experience that are perhaps

363
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.530
blocked through certain servers or
sites. For example, like, you

364
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.950
know, a lot of schools,
you know, elementary schools or

365
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.940
whatever, if you're doing a
search for transgender, it might

366
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.810
be considered poor, not pornographic
because there, there is a

367
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.300
lot of transport. Isn't much,
there's a lot of non

368
00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.740
transport, however, because we're not
yet and a society that

369
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.990
is sometimes separate trends from
sexuality and pornography on those

370
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.490
sites may be blocked. Right?
And so transgress an app

371
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.400
where you can enter that
site into, right. It will

372
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.120
replace words that are blocked
with a symbol, so you

373
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.820
can access that site. And
that's, you know, it's, it's

374
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.120
a basic kind of idea,
but it's really helpful. Didn't

375
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.350
exist before. And it's really
fascinating. I think that one

376
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.290
of the beautiful things that
transact is doing is allowing

377
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.080
other trans developers to have
their work showcase and a

378
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.080
national and international audience in
a ways that haven't been

379
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.730
done before. So that's really
amazing. People have had, there

380
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.620
were again in the wired
magazine wall street journal, we

381
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.140
were mentioning tech crunch and
all these other awesome sites

382
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.800
where people who are not
myself, but if we're doing

383
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.880
other types of amazing development
in the field or getting

384
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.810
shine. So I'm super proud
of that. And that definitely

385
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.590
needs to continue happening. Another,
I'm gonna say one more

386
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:08.280
thing about th the, the
Chicago event. One really cool

387
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.980
thing that came out of
it is that, that I'm

388
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.920
the winner. Not only being
able to pitch in front

389
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.490
of Laverne Cox, but it's
live audiences, but they developed

390
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.690
a it's called rad remedy.
And it's a database where

391
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:27.390
people can rate potential trans
health care providers, which is

392
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.450
awesome. And these are, it's
a database of health care

393
00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.360
providers that are specifically grocery
trans individuals. There was all

394
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.520
of this data that was
sitting on the internet in

395
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.390
a file, a CSV file
of surgeons or surgeons or

396
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.940
medical providers who did, you've
worked with the trans community.

397
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.560
It was just sitting there.
And so this took it

398
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.220
and went through all the
files and erase people who

399
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.310
no longer practice or who
had since passed on. So

400
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.910
they updated the information. And
now they've in the process

401
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.840
of making an actual organization.
They just got their actual

402
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.860
business license and everything last
week. So they're an actual

403
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.190
new trans based organization that
grew out of winning trans

404
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.710
hoc. And so things like
that are just quite amazing.

405
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:14.840
I think in terms of
the impact that transac has,

406
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.180
has done. And not only
is shifting conversations of diversity,

407
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.310
but actual producing and Mo
you know, startup nonprofits, right.

408
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.200
So it's quite, quite awesome.
Very empowering. I mean, that's,

409
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.090
that's the point. I think
that there's a lot of

410
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.350
people who are, who might
be thinking, gosh, why do,

411
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.480
why do trans people need
their own hackathon? I don't,

412
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.790
I don't have a random,
I don't have straight white

413
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.130
guy hackathon. Why do I,
you know, we have those

414
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:46.090
they're called hackathons. Exactly. You
know, we do those things

415
00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:51.070
because they empower us why
shouldn't different slices of people

416
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.230
who are different, interested in
different things, be able to

417
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:57.280
create empowering tools that will
help them. This is a,

418
00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.320
this is a, a, a
week, a week parallel. It's

419
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.650
a hardly a parallel. So
I hesitate to give the

420
00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.080
example, but I'm a, you
know, I'm a type one

421
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.190
diabetic, I take three or
four different shots, you know,

422
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.040
injections every day to keep
me alive. I'm on an

423
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.220
insulin pump. I've got different
implants. All of these things

424
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.040
work together to keep me
alive. And they are something

425
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.110
though that it's not, you
can't look at me and

426
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.770
tell that I have this
problem, but I interact with

427
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.320
people a lot of times
that here diabetic. And then

428
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.840
they start telling me things
about my life and how

429
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.230
I operate in order to
what you're taking. You can't

430
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.390
have that cake. Can you,
or, Oh, well, my dad's

431
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.650
diabetic. I understand how that
works. Even worse when those

432
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.230
people are in a position
of power or position of,

433
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.800
of, of medical power or
a doctor. And I'm actually

434
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.620
going to be speaking at
a diabetes conference in front

435
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.100
of a bunch of diabetes
educators who are themselves not

436
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.140
diabetic. And one of the
things I'm going to talk

437
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.960
about is that you are
our allies. You are our

438
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.110
helpers, but make no mistake
at three in the morning

439
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.910
when I'm having a blood
sugar issue or for the

440
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.750
last 20 years, as I
have lived the diabetic experience,

441
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.260
I know more about this.
You may have a master's

442
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:12.220
in diabetes education. You're still
not a diabetic. And that

443
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.380
can apply to deaf communities,
diabetes communities, multiple sclerosis, anyone

444
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.740
who has a unique thing
or multiple unique things. So

445
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:22.990
when you get into the
space of, of allies, there's

446
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.840
this term allies where someone
is there to help the

447
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.790
LGBTQ community, are they more
trouble than they're worth? I

448
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.670
mean, are non trans people
trying to help trans people

449
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.830
not required? Not No, its
allies are always useful. I

450
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.480
think the thing with allies
is that a lot of

451
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.810
people don't really there's, you
know, multiple definitions of what

452
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.690
it means to be an
ally out there. There's multiple

453
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.750
definitions of what power and
privilege are. I think that

454
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.080
when there's any type of
allyship or ally relationship, all

455
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.140
those things need to be
transparent. And those and transparency

456
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.630
is not from the initial
point of being like, I'm

457
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.960
an ally to this community.
There needs to be trust

458
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.710
built. And so there's always
these stumbling blocks, right? So

459
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.010
it's not, if allies are
more trouble than they're worth,

460
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.040
it's just that I think
that we don't, I don't,

461
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.130
I mean, I'm trying to
be diplomatic with answering this

462
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:27.540
question because people see me
as yes, exactly. Someone who,

463
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:35.790
who critiques allies often. And
I think that I am

464
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.760
not one critiques allies often.
I think that I critique

465
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.940
again, what it means to
be an ally and addressing,

466
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.450
you know, like what you're
saying, like who has power,

467
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.250
because one can say, I
can relate to your experience

468
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.720
and I want to help
your experience out. But then

469
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.420
there's also allies. I think
I'm going to speak for

470
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.760
your experience. I know your
experience better than you do

471
00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.240
my best. Friend's such and
such, or, you know, I'm

472
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.630
not, but I have access
to. And I think it's

473
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:09.660
important. One things that allies
have to remember, whichever community

474
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:16.110
you're you're aligning yourself with
is that you're sending behind

475
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.140
if community, you have their
back, literally you're not their

476
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.770
front. And when you have
someone's back, when you have

477
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.280
someone's back, you, you know,
you're, you're letting them leave,

478
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.950
but they can turn around
and ask you for help.

479
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.020
Right. They can be, you
know, you know, you got

480
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.840
my back, let me ask
you, you have resources. Cause

481
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.360
you know, let me use
our resources, but I gotta

482
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.970
lead still because I know
this better than you. And

483
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:42.390
so I think that that's
an important way for allies

484
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.270
to kind of position themselves,
remember that their voices are

485
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:49.410
important and that they are
very helpful, but that you

486
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.330
have to allow others to
lead with that. You can

487
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.210
use your resources to help
them become more efficient leaders.

488
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:59.270
Of course. So, Yeah, I
definitely, I appreciate that, that

489
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.540
imagery, that the, you know,
a line of individuals, you

490
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.110
know, marching forward to take
control of their situation and

491
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.990
their reality and I'm behind
them and they can turn

492
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.270
around and call on me
and I can be like,

493
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.220
you can do it. Let's
go, let's go. But I

494
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.670
shouldn't be taking the sign
and stepping in front of

495
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.720
the line and saying, let's
go everyone this way. And

496
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.450
allies though, they mean, well,
and not just allies, but

497
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.750
also friends. It seems like
there's this, this is concept

498
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.470
of microaggressions and in the
trans community, this idea of

499
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.160
mis-gendering and you wrote a
piece for model view culture,

500
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.380
and we actually had Shanley
and some of the folks

501
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.170
from model view culture on
a couple of months ago

502
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.970
where people have you, when
meeting you for the first

503
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.670
time, how do you deal
with that? Where this is

504
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.340
clearly a person that means
well, but they're really not

505
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.570
meaning well right now. Exactly.
I guess it's first, the

506
00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.760
first step is for me
to have that like one

507
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.660
nanosecond of debating, whether they
mean well, or if they're

508
00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:02.460
intentional. And I say that
because a lot of people

509
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.610
who follow my work, know
who I am and they'll,

510
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.530
I, you know, I don't
always say I'm trans, I'm

511
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.870
trans I'm trans, but I
think that in some spaces,

512
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:17.190
people know that I'm transgender.
Right? And so upon meeting

513
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.870
me in person to deny
me of the identity that

514
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.990
I, you know, that I
publicly represent myself for people

515
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.760
who say, Oh, I, you
know, I follow your work

516
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.560
and you do all this,
you follow my work, then,

517
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.560
you know, I don't use
a, for lack of a

518
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.300
better term. So don't be
mad at me, people feminine

519
00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.120
pronouns. And I'm using that
with scarecrows, everybody. So I

520
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.320
don't use that. Right. I
use he, him Courtney. And

521
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.410
so, and that's been for
quite some time now. And

522
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.810
so sometimes I have to
sit with myself and like,

523
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:55.350
is it intentional because bigotries
intentional. I, I don't think

524
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.050
it's, it's subconscious, but I
think there's also moments where

525
00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:02.010
people are just being intentionally
malicious. Right. And I'm not

526
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.470
going to deny that from
people who miss Jen who

527
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.860
purposefully mis-gender trans people, but
then there's also, yeah. There's

528
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.540
people who are just ignorant.
So I, you know, it

529
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.900
hurts and you know, but
I also don't want it

530
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.830
to happen again. So I
have to step up and

531
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.750
educate them when I don't
want to educate them because

532
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:27.990
it depends on my safety
for one and my dignity

533
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.720
for, you know, another and
just also being able to

534
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:34.230
work with me in the
future. I can't work with

535
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.140
people who, who see me
as somebody that I'm not.

536
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.310
So, Yeah, that's, that is
a difficult thing. I think

537
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.670
for people who are cis-gender
to remember that, you know,

538
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.270
sexuality and gender identity and
these things are, are all

539
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.950
different. And if some of,
you know, if someone feels

540
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.650
mis-gendered then refer to them
by the gender that they

541
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.080
prefer to be referred to
and move on with your

542
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.220
life, it's real, pretty straight
forward. I wanted to end

543
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.710
on a discussion that you've
got another business venture. You

544
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:03.090
like, I like that you
said that you were a

545
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.820
hacker, even though I said,
you mentioned you weren't a

546
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.970
programmer, you've been basically hacking
the system for, for years.

547
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.840
Not just whether it be
film and speaking, but in,

548
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.070
in business space you have
a new business venture. Yes.

549
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.930
I, after a transaction cargo,
it was Cole organized by,

550
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.720
by Tiffany. Michael was my
co founder of black star

551
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.410
media right now, but she
co-organized transaction Chicago with me.

552
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.830
And she was working at
dev bootcamp, Chicago at the

553
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:34.740
time after the amazingness, that
was transaction cago. We, she

554
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:36.810
actually, she approached me and
was like, I really want

555
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:38.970
to work with you again,
I'm thinking of, you know,

556
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.500
needs to be a space
specifically for folks of color

557
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.880
to, you know, have learn
and kind of acquire entrepreneurial

558
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.040
tools, you know, a different
kind of space and like,

559
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.110
yeah, there isn't really right.
There's, you know, we can

560
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.510
go to websites and people
will get five tips and

561
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.520
all of these different things,
but there's really no space

562
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.750
in which people of color
see themselves reflected as educators

563
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:02.590
of honor when you were
at curriculum and as consumers

564
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.350
of entrepreneurial curriculum. Right? And
so we're trying to address

565
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.040
that problem because we really
think it's important that education,

566
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:14.290
that really increased wealth specifically
in communities of color and

567
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:20.380
particularly amongst blacks folks, that
location is important, but it

568
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.110
is important for it to
come from people who represent

569
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.990
who you are, who look
like you. Right? And there's

570
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.610
a number of studies that
we can go into. The

571
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.270
hot shows that, you know,
a lot of people in

572
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.680
tech talk about how diversity
is important and they spout

573
00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.950
off studies about how companies
with more diverse, you know,

574
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.860
executive boards or whatever, you
know, make more money. Right.

575
00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.280
I think the same thing
goes with in a different

576
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.860
way with black entrepreneurship, you
have to really foster this

577
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.060
diversity of black and it
an image of people of

578
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.570
color, where they are leaders,
but they also educate one

579
00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:00.070
another. So also to, to
really increase any type of

580
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.480
sustainability in the community. So
that's what we're focused on.

581
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.290
And our company is called
Blackstar media and blaster media

582
00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.260
existed. Oh, it has been
in existence over a decade.

583
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.110
And all my film work
has been produced under that,

584
00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.280
but now we're shifting it
to really focusing, focusing on

585
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:23.260
helping creative founders there's do
their thing. So cool. So

586
00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.440
that encompasses interactive. It's a
complete kind of full service

587
00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.220
agency almost. Yeah. It's a
complete full service agency. We

588
00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:35.380
do. We're doing research about
black entrepreneurship. We're doing online

589
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:39.760
and onsite of courses. We
did our soft launch, July 28th,

590
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.510
where I gave a course
about how people with research

591
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.150
based degrees can build a
public image, right. A public

592
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.870
brand, because many of us
in the Academy, we follow

593
00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:53.410
this, this pathway of fighting
for tenure ship, or, you

594
00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:54.910
know, this would be right.
We publish and we do

595
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:57.730
all of these things. And
then we have these degrees.

596
00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.670
We can't get a job
because of the draconian tenure

597
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.880
system. I'm also because of
racism, right? We're we also

598
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.890
have people who do beside
our tenure, who don't look

599
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:09.670
like us, no matter how
hard we work, academic success

600
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:11.770
is not afforded to all
of us. And it's also

601
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.320
a hostile environment for many
of us to be in

602
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.260
when I'm talking specifically about
the Academy. Right? And so

603
00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.870
many of us seek outside.
Like I want to be

604
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.330
an entrepreneur, but I don't
know how to. And the

605
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.580
amazing thing is, is that
we've already spent all these

606
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.730
years developing our writing skills,
developing our research skills, developing

607
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.180
your art skills or persuasion
and argumentation, which are so

608
00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.830
integral to being any type
of entrepreneur. So Menard was

609
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.960
based on that and really
focusing on again, research based

610
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.530
degrees and how you can
become an entrepreneur with your

611
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.640
degree. So we're, we're really
trying to shift what it

612
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.340
means to be a black
entrepreneur. And again, yeah, like

613
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:54.510
I said before, hacking the
system hacking education. So that's

614
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.610
fantastic. Well, thanks so much
for chatting with me today.

615
00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.670
Thank you. We will put
up in the show notes,

616
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:04.050
links to dr. Ziegler's site
and transact.org. You can learn

617
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.100
all about dr. <inaudible> work
online. This has been another

618
00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.830
episode of Hansel minutes. We'll
see you again next week.
