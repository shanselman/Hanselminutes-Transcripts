episode of Hansel minutia, Scott

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.980
talks with Richard cam. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman, and

10
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.040
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And this week

11
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.010
it's Hansel, minutia, and who
else to bring on the

12
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.250
show for Hanselman new ship,
but our very own Richard Campbell.

13
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.140
Hey sir. How's it going?
I am well, sir. How

14
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.980
are you? Oh, brilliant. Brilliant.
Now you're you're on vacation

15
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.930
or on the road or
running around somewhere right now.

16
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.270
I'm at work. I'm a,
I did some meetings in

17
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.520
Boston and then I popped
down to new London and

18
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.830
you called and said, Hey,
can we do a minutia

19
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.240
show? And I'm like, yeah,
sure. Why not? But I'm

20
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.300
going to be a pop
studios anyway. So fantastic. I'm

21
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.970
actually at the studio. No,
Carl around he's off doing

22
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.620
errands. So I got the
place to myself, which is

23
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.770
challenging because there's lots and
lots of equipment here and

24
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.040
no labels on anything, just
knobs and knobs and buttons

25
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.020
and everything is just black.
And there's no way to

26
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.880
know what anything does. That's
right. They all go to

27
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.480
11, but they don't actually
say anything. That's a Carl Franklin

28
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.060
security system. Yes. This is
sound recording through obscurity. So

29
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.560
one of the great things
about the minutia shows is

30
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.890
that they have no agenda
and most people are just

31
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.930
going to find their time
completely wasted, which is a

32
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.940
challenge considering that the whole
point of this show is

33
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.770
to not waste your time.
So it's a certain kind

34
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.360
of a balance that we
have to. And I'm glad

35
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.920
that when you think about
wasting time, you think of

36
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.040
me. I do. I say
to myself, what Canadian could

37
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.980
I call that would best
waste my listeners time. So

38
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.130
it helps it go ahead.
No, you go. If you

39
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.040
see, so let me see
what's going on. I'm building

40
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.300
a garden, I'm building an
arcade machine in the, in

41
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.650
the garage. I'm dedicating my
life to being handy. And

42
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.850
I caught your Twitter where
you said that buying lumber

43
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.960
was the most incompetent you've
ever felt. Yeah, I was

44
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.390
really having trouble with it,
frankly. I mean, I went

45
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.580
in and I was all,
I kind of like prepared

46
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.170
the speech. It was almost
like when you go to

47
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.880
a foreign country and you
prepare your opening speech in

48
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.750
Spanish or whatever, you know,
I was in Morocco and

49
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.180
I planned my first three
sentences in French. Right. Just

50
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.300
so I can make them
appreciate that. I appreciate them.

51
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.060
I did the same thing
at the lumberyard, heard my

52
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.050
initial lumberyard speech so that
they would appreciating this, this

53
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.850
kind of little cultural anthropology
here that the lumberyard people

54
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.500
would understand that I was
one of them and not

55
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.260
fear me. And I just
went in and I said,

56
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.180
yeah, I'm gonna need a
couple of two by fours.

57
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.890
Brush treated in a couple
of two by tens, but

58
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.900
I'm gonna be cutting it.
You know? And somewhere in

59
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.390
there, I, I made a
mistake or maybe then my,

60
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.570
maybe my accent was wrong
or something, but they knew

61
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.750
that I was not, it
was almost like, Hey, I

62
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.220
was in two by fours,
two by tens and get

63
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.500
a of, and you're a
computer person. Aren't you dammit.

64
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.700
How did you know what
it was? It was, it

65
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.860
was it posture, you know,
wasn't the, I'll do this.

66
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.680
T-shirt what did I do?
What did I do wrong

67
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.660
to give me away? So
anyway, so then it became

68
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.890
the, they started talking to
me like it was a

69
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.630
kindergartener, well, a four by
fours, not really four inches

70
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.070
by four inches. Oh, you
know, weight, weight, pressure treating

71
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.470
does not involve arsenic. And
hasn't for the last 15

72
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.070
years. Oh, where did you
learn about all this Google?

73
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.840
You know, so yes. So
then it's even worse when

74
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.810
they start loading the lumber
into my minivan, which in,

75
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.780
that was also kind of
an embarrassing thing. Right? Move.

76
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.660
I literally moved the emergency
diaper kit aside so that

77
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.250
I could get my two
by tens in they're so

78
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.370
good about feeling good about
that. And then I had

79
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.550
to buy a saw, that's
a very emasculating experience. I

80
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.870
bought a handsaw. Everyone at
the lumberyard assumes that you

81
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.960
have some kind of a,
what are those things called?

82
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.980
The circular saws that cut
people's fingers off. Yeah. The

83
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.380
circular saw circus song. Is
that what it's called? Yeah.

84
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.900
Everyone assumes you have a
complete, like you've dedicated one

85
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.080
entire garage to Working. Yes.
You must have By all

86
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.310
this I'm like, can I
buy a saw? Which was

87
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.970
a problem. Cause yeah, That
simple gave it away. Yeah.

88
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.870
Very clear signs. You are
not a professional. Will you

89
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.040
have anything? No, I'm really
good at calling professionals though.

90
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.940
So you, you just hire,
use, pay, you throw money

91
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.190
at the problem. I figured
this, you know, people pay

92
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.550
me to make computer systems
work well, while I'm doing

93
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.470
that, I'm making enough money
to pay the guy, to

94
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.170
paint the fence. You know,
there's an irony in this

95
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.020
because I'm all about outsourcing,
right? I'm the first guy

96
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.010
to say, dude, hire DBA,
dude, hire a designer. You

97
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.190
know, please let someone else
host this profession, your own

98
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.100
website at your house. Yeah.
Let the professionals do their

99
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.010
jobs. I can't do that
because it's a manly thing

100
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.710
to chop down trees and
cut wood and build things.

101
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.620
And I need to be
involved. You need to do

102
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.170
that yourself. Right. Cause I
don't know if you know,

103
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.840
but I'm at the final,
like six weeks of a

104
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.470
one year renovation of my
house. Really? Yeah. Are you

105
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.320
doing this yourself now? I've
been hiring professionals for a

106
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.180
year. Wow. But my wife
and I did the design.

107
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.770
We spent almost a year
on the design before we

108
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.720
got started. And we basically
took the whole main floor

109
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.330
off the house. We left
the server closet intact. So

110
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.600
don't, don't worry. It's okay.
The office survived the whole

111
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.640
thing, but we, yeah, we
rebuilt the whole main floor

112
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.710
and we added another floor
And you're the general contractor

113
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.960
in this context Actually. Stacy
is my wife is because

114
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.020
remember she's a professional project
manager on the garment industry.

115
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.570
So there was a point
where we had the architect,

116
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.030
the general contractor and both
of us in the room.

117
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.450
And I said, we have
entirely too many project managers

118
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.550
here. At least I have
two, at least two of

119
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.350
us have to step back.
And in that case it

120
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.100
was the architect and me.
Wow. So you had a

121
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.270
server room in your house
now, Wiring closet. Now, what

122
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.010
is the difference between wiring
closet and server room is

123
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.350
just square footage. I think
that's part of it. Well,

124
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.480
I, so I have a
rack that has all the

125
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.000
wiring on it. That's one
30 rack. And then I

126
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.860
have a separate 30 year.
Raca has a servers on

127
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.380
it. You have a rack
in your house. Two of

128
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.220
them That's, that's pretty bad
ass. And I put little

129
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.740
racks built into the desks
as well. So the workstations

130
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.980
rollout on rails and you
can service them too. You're

131
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.260
my hero. I I'm here
to serve man. And did

132
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.970
I point out that all
the machines in the, in

133
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.320
the office are water-cooled Now
you are a water cooling,

134
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.050
man. I rec I, you
said this to me before.

135
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.720
Yes. Cause I've got my
big quad power machine. And

136
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.430
I think if I remember
correctly, you told me that

137
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.570
I wasn't pushing it far
enough from a, an overclocking

138
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.700
perspective. And you said water
cooling was the way. And

139
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.420
I said, running tubes of
water through electrical boxes was

140
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.110
a mistake. You are no
huge watercolor. I find it.

141
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.900
I find it deeply rewarding
to pour water into my

142
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.840
PCs and have it be
a good thing. It just

143
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.680
feels good. But you mean,
the funny thing is I'm

144
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.040
not an overclock here. Right?
I don't worry about overclocking.

145
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.060
I think the machines have
enough performance. I'm trying to

146
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.810
get rid of noise. So
I, the whole thing with

147
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.810
my, when you walk into
my office, there's 16 PCs

148
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.470
in my office. There is
not a sound, right. The

149
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.700
room is almost entirely silent.
Really? Yeah. That doesn't matter

150
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.920
because I've got six PCs
in my, and it's like,

151
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.350
it's like being on an
airplane all the time. Well,

152
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.690
that's the thing is that
what I did was eliminate

153
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.070
every single fan from the
office. All the fans are

154
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.680
in the server closet and
the server closet is soundproof

155
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.030
and air conditioned and so
forth. Huh. And is that,

156
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.950
is it worth the effort?
I mean the hours you

157
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.780
pour into that you get
those hours back just with

158
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.480
blissful smile. Absolutely. And you
remember, I share my office

159
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.270
with my wife. It's a
two station office. So, you

160
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.240
know, station, office, we're side
by side That make it

161
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.890
difficult for you to just
screw around and not get

162
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.260
any work done. No, because
the screens wrap all the

163
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.850
way around me. So there
are several couple of screens.

164
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.820
She can't see how many
screens do you have? I

165
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.060
used three on the development
machine and one on the

166
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.300
secondary machine. And then I
have the laptop, You know,

167
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.360
I've got four monitors and
I'm going to have to

168
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.060
give up one of them.
I'm building that Mame machine

169
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.510
and building an arcade cabinet.
Right? When I'm, I mean,

170
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.820
let me rephrase John bat
Dorff and I have, have

171
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.790
bought a old cabinet. We
are gutting it and putting

172
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.920
a PC in it because
I don't want to just

173
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.720
play arcade games. I also
want to be able to

174
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.900
play doom on this thing.
And everyone's like, Oh look,

175
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.610
I can play donkey Kong.
And only cost me three

176
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.080
grand and took four weeks.
I'm overpowering this thing. I

177
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.330
want to be able to
play far cry, but standing

178
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.210
up. So I'm going to
put an LCD in it.

179
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.490
Even though the arcade purists
are telling me to put

180
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:10.590
a 27 inch, you know,
arcade monitor 300 pound CRT.

181
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.950
So this is going to
mean sacrificing one of my

182
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.490
beloved four by three LCDs
from my four monitor set

183
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.070
up. Yeah. I'm sitting here
looking at my four monitors.

184
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.100
I've got acquaint left to
right. I've got webpages, outlook

185
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.400
tweet, deck Zune. And I
just it's like trying to

186
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.130
pick a child. You know,
it's like Solomon, which of

187
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.680
these kids do I not
love that much tech? Is

188
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.350
it the, is it the
Zune? I don't know. Well

189
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.210
then I can't buy a
four by three LCD anymore.

190
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.030
You just can't they're all
going to be 16 by

191
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.230
nine now. And I'm amazed
at how quickly tweet deck

192
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.580
owns screen real estate. I've
never seen an app other

193
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.430
than visual studio. There's no
app that gets better. The

194
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.370
bigger you get more than
that, Like a trader, like

195
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.250
a, like a, I'm not
a trader Trei, but a

196
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.710
trader like someone on wall
street. Right. You know, like

197
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.540
why would someone need more
monitors? I'm like, well, gosh,

198
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.580
if I could dedicate an
extra three monitors across the

199
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.530
top To tweet deck the
river of news, I don't

200
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.890
remember dedicating a monitor point
cast. Yeah. I remember playing

201
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.830
CAS, but that, that was
you didn't you needed to

202
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.280
save like a hundred pixels
by 800 pixels for point

203
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.370
cast. You didn't need much
for that. But tweet deck,

204
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.920
it's all the different searches
you've got running and you

205
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.770
just, you cannot have too
much screen space on. I'm

206
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.780
telling you, Taking one of
these monitors and getting rid

207
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.010
of it is going to
be a problem. And I'm

208
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.620
seeing people online that are
saying, gosh, you want a

209
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.530
20 inch LCD four by
three, can't buy one, buy

210
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.650
a 24 inch 16 by
nine, and then just cover

211
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.210
the sides with paper. I
like it. Arcade solution for

212
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.390
that cardboard black cardboard to
make it. And that's the

213
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.580
equivalent of a 20 inch
screen. Yeah, No, no. I

214
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.100
think you should go get
one of those 24 inch,

215
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.320
19 2012. I was his
time to come to the

216
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.610
16 by nine. World's got
it's time. It is, well,

217
00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.980
I appreciate 16 by nine
from a information perspective, but

218
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.810
I guess I'm just going
to have to replace it

219
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.080
with another 24 cause four
monitors, man, once you live

220
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.630
the Multimin life, you just
can't possibly give it up.

221
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.200
Yeah. I, I, my triple
screen rig is the 30

222
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.460
inch in the center and
then two 20 inch, 16

223
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.430
by 12 hung in portrait
mode. And I've just found

224
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:25.190
that that 1600 pixels high
is incredibly useful really portrait

225
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.070
mode. Well, the two side
screens are because the center

226
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.830
screen is 25, 60 by
1600. So the whole thing

227
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.530
was how many screens can
I get going? 1600 high.

228
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.990
And so hanging those twenties
in portrait mode, they made

229
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.510
them the same height as
the 30 inch. Now that's

230
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.760
interesting. Now you got me.
So I've got a 24

231
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.130
inch, which is the 24
inch Dell from two years

232
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.800
ago. I love the way
that Dell does their numbering.

233
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.130
It's a 24 Oh seven.
So it was made in

234
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.490
2007 and it's 24 inches.
Right. I just think that's

235
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.050
finally, that makes sense to
me. Yeah, totally. So this

236
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.570
is 1920 by 1200. See,
I'm trying to figure out

237
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.700
which of my other monitors,
I've got a bunch of

238
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.300
basically 1200 tall appears to
be my thing. Right. I've

239
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.280
got to figure out. So
you're saying I would get

240
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.000
a 16 by nine. That
was at least that wide

241
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.580
and then flip it over
and that can put documents

242
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.820
and stuff over there. Yeah,
you could do. Yeah. Setting

243
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.160
up a 1920 by 1200
in portrait would be interesting.

244
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.460
Cause the height is awesome
on that. Yeah. That's interesting.

245
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.410
I think that that's what
I'll have to do. I'll

246
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.600
remove the tweet deck one
and I'll have to switch

247
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.900
my, my, my 16 by
nine and flip it over

248
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.510
that. Doesn't the, the, when
you flip something over like

249
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.480
that, you go from having
RGB left to right pixels

250
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.720
to RGB, top to bottom,
which makes clear type rendering

251
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.590
a little wonky. Yes, no.
To as well. I haven't

252
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.420
found a problem with it
actually with the, with the

253
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.310
last mission, the machine that
I built like that it

254
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.210
was able to tolerate it
quite well. There, the, there

255
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.490
is a difference between the
screens is when you, when

256
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.920
you drag across them, but
it's not horrible. Cause they

257
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.160
well, the plus the triple
approach you have the center

258
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.250
screen is much bigger than
the wings. So the center

259
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.580
screen is your focus of
work. That's what studio owns.

260
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.180
And then the wings are
supporting information, right? They are

261
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.500
documentation. They're invariably some kind
of search going on there,

262
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.080
you know, the are running
a running dialogue, something like

263
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.600
that. Yeah. Huh. It's just
a way of orienting yourself.

264
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.880
But, and then of course
now there's folks that do

265
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.440
another row of screens above
the main row. Yeah. That,

266
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.760
which I think is another
level of insanity entirely. I

267
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:36.930
haven't gone there yet. And
I do say yet. Yeah.

268
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.010
It's inevitable without a doubt.
Yes. He talked to me

269
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.940
about MVC cause I saw
your blog post about MVC

270
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.150
shipping. Yeah. Yeah. The, the
guys Phil and God goo

271
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.090
and the various and sundry
people really worked hard to

272
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.480
get it released as open
source. And so far it's

273
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.880
been very positive. Although we
did see a very interesting

274
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.060
comment in a, in a,
what do you call it?

275
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.730
A dead tree magazine. And
what was it? Redmond developer

276
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.220
news, Stephen forte, a friend
of ours, a friend of

277
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.390
yours. And mine said that
he was concerned that what

278
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.270
happens if people start forking
in VC and he didn't

279
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.980
think that was a good
thing. So he was actually

280
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.060
concerned. We were releasing the
source because people might make

281
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.610
their own versions and that
he wouldn't, you know, he

282
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.250
would be overwhelmed by that.
I guess. Well, therein lies

283
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.100
an interesting question, which is,
so why do, why release

284
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.350
the code is open source?
Well, because why not? Right.

285
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.720
I mean, that's, that's what
we're trying to, to get

286
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.870
people at Microsoft to think
about is Why not? Yeah.

287
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.150
What happens when we release
source? So you have no

288
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.450
plan. You're not actually thinking
this is going to change

289
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.280
X you're saying, let's just
throw it out there. See

290
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.130
what I mean? It's not
like, you know, release the

291
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.430
source and then kind of
mentally, you know, change, you

292
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.790
know, I don't know. What's
the, I'm hypnotized the community

293
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.190
into doing X now. There's
no like master plan behind

294
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.560
what folks will do with
it. The point is that

295
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.170
there's no reason for us
not to release the source.

296
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.390
If it makes, if it,
if it's useful and it

297
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.300
makes people happy and they
can do something with it.

298
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.660
I mean, why it's like,
well, this is kind of

299
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.630
a silly analogy, but like
I released that might you

300
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.790
received my, you see my
tweet sandwich thing I released,

301
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.550
I haven't seen it. Okay.
So I go to Quiznos

302
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.340
for lunch occasionally. Right? And
the guy at Quiznos is

303
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.600
a former tech CEO type
and the OPO. And he

304
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.840
opened the tweeze nose as
a Quiznos. By the way,

305
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.700
for those of you who
are not from the U

306
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.070
S is a sandwich place,
you go in and you

307
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.610
get a toasted sub sandwich,
submarine sandwich. So it's a

308
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.360
franchise. And this tech vice
president CEO type bought it

309
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.780
as his retirement and he's
a geek. And he said,

310
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.670
you know, Hey, it's really
cool. I'm on Twitter, you're

311
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:45.920
on Twitter. You should make
it so we can tweet

312
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.190
the order. And then I
wrote a program in a

313
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.130
couple of hours that would
call tweet sandwich that would

314
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.410
look at his Twitter account
for replies. And if anybody

315
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.660
put in the word order,
they would automatically kick it

316
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.940
out of his printer. So
then the kids that work

317
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.340
at his sandwich shop just
go to the printer and

318
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.940
they get the orders and
it's called tweet sandwich. And

319
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.020
so now you order your
sandwich via Twitter, probably from

320
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.120
your phone, you know, as
you're on your way there

321
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.070
as I'm on the way
there, if I'm at a

322
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.560
stoplight, you go order it.
My usual is be there

323
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.350
in a minute and the
sandwich is waiting and it's

324
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.050
beautiful. Now it could have
been done over email. It

325
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.460
could have been over pager
could have been over a

326
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.080
thousand different things. It could
have been a straight web

327
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.600
service, but the fact that
Twitter as message bus is

328
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.250
interesting. Right? So what does
this have to do with

329
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.940
NBC? Well, it's one thing
to make something like that

330
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.340
and throw it up on
your blog and say, look

331
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.760
at this. It's cool. Here's
some screenshots, but it's another

332
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.450
to say. And here's all
the shores have fun. That

333
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.090
seems very significant to me
do what you want. So

334
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.850
I just, literally, as we're
talking here, a guy tweets

335
00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.830
that he just made a
Twitter to growl bridge growl

336
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.220
is an open source notification
system. It's the one that

337
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.340
most people on max use,
where if you want like

338
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.180
balloon help or what's often
called toast to pop up

339
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.000
and notify you, toast comes
up down there by the

340
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.170
clock, right? So he wrote
a Twitter to growl bridge

341
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.260
things that go through Twitter,
then pop up through growl.

342
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.170
And he did this using
tweet sandwich as his starting

343
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.890
point. Nice template. Fantastic. Totally.
And like, am I now,

344
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.620
am I going to say
now? Yes. Master plan. This

345
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.340
was the goal release tweet
sandwich so I could make

346
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.700
it growl bridge. No, that's
the whole point release it,

347
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.600
have fun. Do something wonderful.
Hi, it's Scott here from

348
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.490
another place in time. I
hope you're enjoying the show

349
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.160
so far. I apologize for
interrupting it, but I wanted

350
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.110
to let you know that
assembling a podcast like this

351
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.230
every week, isn't free. Certainly
the bandwidth bill crushes us

352
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.640
every month. So I want
to let you know that

353
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.310
this show is sponsored by
Tellerik. They make the show

354
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.230
possible and it makes pretty
cool products as well. For

355
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.450
example, if you're trying to
build a web 2.0 Ajax

356
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.450
application, trying to use the
web 1.0 components, it's kind

357
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.760
of difficult. You got to
get the next gen stuff.

358
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.680
If you want to build
the next gen websites. And

359
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.020
that's exactly what the folks
at Tellerik have got and

360
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.440
their new upcoming product, which
is codenamed, rad controls. Prometheus's

361
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.260
big pack, a web controls
built entirely on top of

362
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.200
the Microsoft ASP and Ajax
stuff that you already understand.

363
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.570
It's going to give you
a lot of performance interactivity

364
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.480
on your next project. They
mirror the ASP net Ajax

365
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.380
API. So the development's really
straightforward client scripture's shared loading

366
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.140
time is pretty fast. You
set a couple of properties.

367
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.270
You can even bind a
web services for really efficient

368
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.570
operation. The new rad editor
for ESPN at Ajax loads

369
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.270
up to four times faster
than before. And the rad

370
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.270
grid will do thousands of
records in milliseconds. But of

371
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.100
course it's, it's better to
try these things for yourself.

372
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.800
So you can visit <inaudible>
dot com slash ASP, net

373
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.830
Ajax, and download a trial.
Thanks a lot for listening.

374
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.460
And we'll get right back
to the show. Yeah. I'm

375
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.620
just thinking in terms of,
I mean, we're talking about

376
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.280
MVC, we're talking about the,
you know, fairly low level

377
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.030
chunk of code, but what's
it written in and be

378
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.580
sure C sharp, right? Yeah.
So, I mean, this is

379
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.620
not, this is not lightweight,
easy things. I'm just trying

380
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.860
to think what people might
build with it. I could

381
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.440
see your tweet sandwich being
open source immediately. You know,

382
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.980
first thing jumps in my
mind is growl. Sure. But

383
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.890
when I think of MVC
out in the wild, what

384
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.170
are people going to do
with that? COVID who are

385
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.110
we to say? Right. I
guess that's true. I mean,

386
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.990
I hear what you're saying,
but, but you know, to,

387
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.110
to not, you're basically saying
to not release it because

388
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.200
I can't think of anything
someone could build. Let's say

389
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.460
someone didn't like the controller
action Invoker. They just didn't

390
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.250
like the way that actions
were being invoked and they

391
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.890
wanted to completely change it.
And they wanted to change

392
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.280
it in such a way
that the existing extensibility points

393
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.760
were not appropriate. There's like
13 or 14 points of

394
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.480
extensibility. They didn't like it,
or we marked something sealed

395
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.430
or internal and we shouldn't
have, or whatever, and they

396
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.220
don't want to wait. They
can just build it themselves.

397
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.560
You know what I mean?
Yeah. I do get what

398
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.230
you mean. It's interesting. And
then, like I said, it

399
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.510
is a template they could
work from to build some

400
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.240
alternatives. Let's think of some
other patterns they could implement

401
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.950
instead. Yeah, I dunno. I
mean, I you're actually what

402
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.960
you're actually kind of asking
me to think about what

403
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.910
they could build with it.
I don't know maybe nothing,

404
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.690
but I want Microsoft to
do it kind of flip

405
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.270
things from, you know, guilty
until proven innocent, innocent till

406
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:18.620
proven guilty and release stuff,
open source, unless there's an

407
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.640
incredibly compelling reason not to
Well, and then, then therein

408
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.550
lies the question, what source
should be open and what

409
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.430
source should, I mean, it
makes sense. No, I don't

410
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.770
know. Right, right. I mean,
this is the thing because

411
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.490
kind of the, the open
source, hardcore people sometimes will

412
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.190
say, well, everything. Right, right.
But then you have to

413
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.620
make some money, right? So
then people say, Oh, well

414
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.370
you make money off of
services, sources free. But I

415
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:47.000
think if you build something
with like a, let's say

416
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.050
you use log for net,
right. As you're logging tool,

417
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.590
but you make an application
that cures cancer, but software

418
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.960
or something, you know, maybe
you want to patent that,

419
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.090
but that has nothing to
do with log for net.

420
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.030
So should you release your
top, you know, the top

421
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.220
part of your application, just
because the bottom part was

422
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:08.560
opensource, you mean build it
with the bill, take all

423
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.030
these atoms 80 O M
and build molecules and then

424
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.990
put those out there. But
I wonder if the open

425
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.730
source, do you think open
source should be open source

426
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.920
applications are open source frameworks
and open source building blocks?

427
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.310
Well, I think the only
real reason that you make

428
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.670
frameworks open sources to compensate
for deficiencies in the framework

429
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:37.120
where apps become templates to
other ideas. Okay. This just,

430
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.240
you know, thinking of the
two different approaches on there.

431
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.920
I mean the one that
jumps out to me immediately

432
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.710
is should we open source
windows? What would, what would

433
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.280
happen that would be good
or bad from OPD sourcing

434
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.180
windows, Windows itself. Yeah. Well,
I mean, it'd be almost

435
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.620
impossible to build it cause
it's so big. Yes. Someone

436
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.860
could make evil windows. They
certainly could that those like

437
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.080
key loggers built in at
the low level or something

438
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.000
like that, they could customize
stuff they couldn't before. I

439
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.430
don't know. I mean, they
could, when they opened the

440
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.920
open source Linux, there was
a lot of chaos and

441
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.290
a lot of distros and
then that kind of relaxed

442
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.460
a little bit. And then
people started coming out with,

443
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.150
with better distros and the
new boon to happen. And

444
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.100
then it's kind of calmed
down. There's a lot fewer

445
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.000
distros now, and there are
a lot higher quality. So

446
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.040
I suppose if you opened
sorts windows, there'd be absolute

447
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.080
chaos for a while. And
then it would, there'd be

448
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.940
a couple of really good
versions that everyone would just

449
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.500
know about. Yeah. It's just
a windows is a whole

450
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.990
bunch bigger than Linux, so
it might be hard to

451
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.150
even get there. I don't
know that to be true,

452
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.750
isn't it? Yeah. I don't
know the exact details on,

453
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.950
I guess the impression of
it is that, yeah. I

454
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.530
don't know. That's a good
some lines. I think one

455
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:54.540
of the things about windows
that is that there's a,

456
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.120
there's probably a lot of
things in windows that are

457
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.700
work arounds for, for compatibility
reasons. You know, I think

458
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.770
that's probably true with all
operating systems, maybe less so

459
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.470
on the Mac, the idea
that windows has to support

460
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.610
anything, doing anything at any
time. Yes. And all, yeah.

461
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.700
All the old apps. Yeah.
All of those different things

462
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.700
and the hardware diversity like
yeah. It's windows has a

463
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.900
tough job. Well, I think
this is on Vista. If

464
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.540
I right click I'm right
now, I'm in, I'm in

465
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.590
windows seven. If I right.
Click on properties and go

466
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.270
compatibility, you know, there's all
of this compatibility mode stuff.

467
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.850
Yep. There's stuff like, you
know, remember back in the

468
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.410
day it was an XP.
You would, you would get

469
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.600
these things on windows update
that were the, you know,

470
00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.170
the April, 2000 and whatever compatibility
mode thing. And then you'd

471
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.170
hit the help button and
going up to the support

472
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.370
that microsoft.com it would say,
you know, a patch for

473
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.130
Arthur's teacher trouble for windows,
you know, it makes it

474
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.510
work better. Those weren't patches
for Arthur teacher trouble itself.

475
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.590
They were patches for, for
windows. Yeah. To make sure

476
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.380
that people didn't think this
is the thing. Right. If

477
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.080
something doesn't run on windows,
people think poorly of windows,

478
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.440
you don't think poorly of
them. Yeah. Which is funny,

479
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.750
but yes, that's exactly. Yeah.
But you know, so suddenly

480
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.250
Arthur's teacher trouble stops working.
We hate windows. We don't

481
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.490
hate Arthur's teacher trouble in
Broderbund. So then a patch

482
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.190
comes out. So there's a
whole application compatibility thing underneath

483
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.530
windows. I should probably try
to find those guys and

484
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:24.220
do a show with them
because they're always testing stuff

485
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.860
to make sure it still
works. Absolutely. And there are

486
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.770
guys who are specialists. We
did someone run as radio

487
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.380
actually talked to one of
the guys who's who gets

488
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.690
brought into companies like Broderbund
to help them with their

489
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.080
compatibility challenges. Which episode was
that? How long ago was

490
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.300
that though? Good idea. It
was a while ago, but

491
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.340
it, it, yeah, it was
just an interesting, it was

492
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.130
very much an it discussion
of you've you're trying to

493
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:50.080
upgrade <inaudible> and how do
you deal with old school

494
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.360
apps that you, you can't
retire? You know, what do

495
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.850
you gotta do? There's a
lot of I'm surprised that

496
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:59.290
stuff still works. Like, you
know, just the different dos

497
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.500
applications that I'm still able
to run. Yes. It's amazing

498
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.630
that the amazing as much
works as it is on

499
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.700
run as it was a
guy named Chris Jackson show

500
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.790
93 and yeah. And he's
just, he's one of the

501
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.940
specialists at Microsoft that deals
with, they call it the

502
00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.930
application experience SWAT team, and
they deal with making apps,

503
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.260
run old, old windows app
run on new versions of

504
00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.140
wind. You know, that's a
really good point cause that

505
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.420
people don't appreciate being able
to right. Click on something

506
00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.230
and say, lie to this
program. You're really running on

507
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.050
windows 95. Yeah. That's so
cool. You know, and that's

508
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.200
just a patch for the
get version call, you know,

509
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.360
there's an API call at
the low level that says

510
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.370
get version. So they put
in some kind of a,

511
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.760
of a, of a patch
that says when this thing

512
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.280
calls get version, lie to
it. Yeah. Chris called them

513
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.890
shims shims is that that's
fantastic. But they also show,

514
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.950
you know, shim the registry.
So even though it said,

515
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.490
go right to the, the
local computer redirected over to

516
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.460
the special area in user
and, and what he tries

517
00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.640
to write to the, to
the system, 32 directory, there's

518
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.680
a shim here that, that
pushes it over to the

519
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.550
application folder for the user,
that sort of stuff, all

520
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.120
the things we were supposed
to do as developers years

521
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.670
ago, when they said stop
writing, this is 32, you

522
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.670
know, those sorts of things
right now, they've actually overcome

523
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:19.180
them with these shifts Disc
path virtualization. Yeah. I've seen

524
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.450
that before where you, you
know, this application just flat

525
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.020
out, writes to winder slash
system 32. Yup. Which of

526
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.050
course is not allowed anymore.
So it ends up in

527
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.890
app data somewhere in a
virtualized folder. So basically the

528
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:37.480
right succeeds and the application
never knows because he'll also

529
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.450
read from there. Yep. And
things are okay, which is

530
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:44.400
funny because they spent all
this time saying behave and

531
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.030
they still have to pay
the price. Yeah. Afterward When,

532
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:54.080
and remember when remember code
access security, whenever it happened

533
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.410
to that, it just sort
of went away. That's a

534
00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.300
good question. You just kind
of gave up on it.

535
00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.400
Right. These are all these
things that Microsoft told us

536
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.560
to do in an effort
to try and make our

537
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.570
machines more reliable. Really. And,
and I guess at some

538
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.270
point, get to realize people
just weren't using it and

539
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.780
they stopped putting energy into
it. I don't know. I

540
00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.970
think that it would be,
it would be nice to

541
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.800
be like a Mac because
Macs can say, and, and

542
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.960
I mean, max, I mean,
Apple can say, you know,

543
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.020
screw it. We're going to
break this. And people are

544
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.780
just going to have to
get over it. Yeah. And

545
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.730
I made it, this is
the impression, I mean, I've

546
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.190
got one, two, three, one,
two, three max in the

547
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.040
house too. I use all
the time and you know,

548
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.530
stuff just breaks, but inevitably
you can go up to

549
00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.560
that small vendor and find
the version that fixes it.

550
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.790
They seem to be willing
to break stuff for the

551
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.300
purpose of moving forward. While
my Microsoft seems to be

552
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.420
less willing to break stuff.
Well, you could argue that

553
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.290
fundamentally the whole UAC crisis
in Vista was Microsoft trying

554
00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.530
to finally trying to break
stuff. Right. And people freaked

555
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.780
out. Cause it's so many
moved my cheese. Yeah. That's

556
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.880
it. They messed with the
cheese and it was just

557
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.760
a disaster for them. It's,
it's a, it's almost like

558
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.070
a double standard. I don't
know how Microsoft could do

559
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.190
that. Better. Almost like a
double standard. Yeah. Just a

560
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.590
little bit like a double
standard. Just suddenly vaguely, you

561
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.320
may see this vaguely as
somewhat something resembling a double

562
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.380
standard. Well, but The argument,
the argument I always get

563
00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.390
when I complained about these
things at work is that,

564
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.000
well, Microsoft is so big.
And so many people are

565
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.300
using windows that, you know,
if, if you break it

566
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.900
some three man construction company
that uses, you know, upgrades

567
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.820
from windows 95 to Vista
is going to be mad

568
00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.420
when their little construction company
program breaks. And no one

569
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.510
in that, no one cares
enough to update that program.

570
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.180
So they'll be screwed. I
think another side of this

571
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.140
is the idea that, that
Microsoft tries to resist losing

572
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.180
customers. That way that people
just don't upgrade. I think

573
00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.680
there's still a bunch of
people running around with old

574
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.290
Macs. Cause they can get
their old software to run

575
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.810
a new max. That's true
because I guess what is

576
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.190
it I used to be,
I used to have a

577
00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.250
bunch of stuff running and
was it like <inaudible> compatibility

578
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:05.140
mode? And then that stopped
working recently and no, but,

579
00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.790
but some people complain, but
not enough that anyone cared

580
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.090
Right. Not enough. Well, and
they also think that when

581
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.610
you're Apple and a small
portion of the market, you

582
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.720
really can't go to the
federal trade commission and say,

583
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.690
this is destructive to business.
You know, like there's just,

584
00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:26.000
there's that Microsoft's got the
same fear that IBM had.

585
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.580
We know there'll be this
whole thing of when you

586
00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.940
are the biggest, there's always
that stress from the, the,

587
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.270
at the federal level that
will actually, you know, you're

588
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.800
going to end up in
front of Congress because you

589
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.460
didn't support some kind of
compatibility layer. Yeah. Man, running

590
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.110
a company is hard. Well,
Especially a company that's that

591
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:50.040
big. It'd be nice to
be a boutique and avoid

592
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.940
talking to Congress. But at
the same time, of course,

593
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.590
what's the boutique trying to
be. But the big guy

594
00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.320
Valid point, I just always
thought it would be nice

595
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.620
to run a boutique and
just not get big ever

596
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.990
there. I think it's like
set that as a goal,

597
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:08.700
as a company goal, we
will never go public. We

598
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:12.360
will stay small and be
a boutique. Yeah. As soon

599
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.830
as I bring a hundred
people, I'll lay people off.

600
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.600
So I'm back down to
a hundred again. Right. Exactly.

601
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.020
Yeah. First guy just run
it as a cue. Yeah.

602
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.570
Sorry. And yeah. That, other
than that guys has to

603
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:25.080
leave now. Yeah. We want
to hire somebody new. We

604
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.030
have to find somebody to
fire. Are you? I used

605
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.520
to work for a company
like that that had 35

606
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:33.230
or so people and the
founders were 50 50 and

607
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.270
it wasn't 49 51, but
it was two guys. And

608
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.260
like we promise, we'll run
this place as a boutique

609
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.720
and it'll be small and
we'll all get to pay

610
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.780
our mortgages and everything will
be wonderful. And then, then

611
00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.560
the nineties happened and it
became absolute chaos as we

612
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.630
tried to go public. And
the whole thing fell apart.

613
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.070
Yeah. They, I think the
greed takes over that comes

614
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:59.490
a point. I want more,
You know why, as soon

615
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.440
as I have enough money,
you're never going to hear

616
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.110
from me again while I
hope you'll send a Christmas

617
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.470
card. Well, I mean, I
might make text you occasionally,

618
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.980
but effectively. You'll never hear
from me again. It'll be

619
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.430
wished you weren't here. Postcards
And things like that. Yeah.

620
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:18.780
I'm glad I'm here too
bad. You're not See, ya

621
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.690
know, I just, I I'm
very much looking forward to

622
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.640
becoming like a, like a
high school teacher or something.

623
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.270
I read a book recently
on vacation. Actually I took

624
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.520
a week, took the girls
down to Mexico, sat on

625
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.450
a beach and read nonfiction
for a week and not

626
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:42.090
technology fiction, not non-technology nonfiction.
I really economics books, history,

627
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.550
books, that sort of thing.
And one of the books

628
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.180
unplugged. Yeah. No laptop, nothing
magical. One of the books

629
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.600
I read was a book
called small is beautiful economics

630
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.430
as if people mattered Economics
as if people That's right.

631
00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:02.820
And the FA the concept
is Buddhist economics, the economics

632
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:09.060
of sufficiency. Yeah. See, that's
the thing, this whole great

633
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.630
depression. 2.0 thing has got
me wondering if capitalism as

634
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.090
a concept is kind of
overrated. And I don't mean

635
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.130
that in the end now
let's all be socialists. I

636
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.310
mean, in the, we can't
grow at 5% a quarter

637
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.300
forever. Absolutely. And you certainly
can't. And so the thing

638
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.490
is you have to Sally
and I put that in

639
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:32.100
quotes, Solly capitalism with regulation
solely meaning screwed up wealth

640
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.030
and restricted limited in ways.
Right. And you've got, you've

641
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.220
got to put regulations in
place so that it's not

642
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:45.280
actually this lazy fair capitalism
because people do matter. Hmm.

643
00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.150
Someone might say that that
means perverting capitalism and screwing

644
00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.790
it up. Absolutely. And I'm
sure I'll get a few

645
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.320
emails from folks saying, I
can tell you been up

646
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.420
in Canada too long. You
definitely sound like a socialist.

647
00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.750
Yeah. Yeah. Well then you
get into the whole distributing,

648
00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.460
the wealth thing and all
that kind of stuff. Well,

649
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.250
and, and there are degrees
at the same time, people

650
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.680
do need to be compensated
for their efforts and they

651
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.040
do need to have an
opportunity to succeed and to

652
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.320
do better than their parents.
You know, those are, are

653
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:17.050
interesting, fundamental motivators, but there
is still this idea of

654
00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.740
sufficiency. Yeah. Well, and you
know how people say absolute

655
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.880
power corrupts. Absolutely. They don't
seem to say power corrupts

656
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:29.830
period. Right. It's that whole
absolute thing. I mean, so

657
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.860
I, at one time I
said to someone that, you

658
00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.050
know, as soon as I'm
done making my millions, then

659
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.540
I'm, you'll never hear from
me again. This was actually

660
00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.250
my boss that said this
at the time. And he

661
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.800
says, well, I'll probably be
here for you always, because

662
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.180
with that kind of an
attitude, you're never going to

663
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.360
make a million bucks, nice
people who have that attitude

664
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.240
don't make piles of money
because I'm always asking myself

665
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.430
why didn't so and so,
you know, whoever, the latest

666
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.460
guy who like the Twitter
guys, right. They, they sold

667
00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.150
their stuff to the, they
made blogger, Evan Williams, right?

668
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.150
Like 23 years old. And
he, he made a kajillion

669
00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.370
dollars when he sold blogger
to Google and here he

670
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.280
is doing the same thing.
Again, it's not like he

671
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.160
doesn't have enough money to
hang out. Why didn't he

672
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.740
hang out? Why isn't he
teaching high school? Because the

673
00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.860
personality type to make the
money in the first place,

674
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.890
can't stop. I'm I'm with
you. I ha I have

675
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:21.310
friends like that who, you
know, made a huge pile

676
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.830
of money. Really doesn't need
to work. Always has a

677
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.800
few projects and they go,
but I just isn't creative

678
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.660
enough. You know, if I
had a billion dollars, I

679
00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.750
think all I do all
day is practical jokes. You

680
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:34.030
know, while you were at
work, I'd have your car

681
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:38.890
converted a right hand drive.
Cause I think that's hilarious.

682
00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.630
You get in the car
to steering wheels on the

683
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.720
other side. Yeah. Like there's
just, I got a hundred

684
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.430
of these. We can just
go The best thing that

685
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:48.370
a millionaire could be doing
with his time. Absolutely. Right.

686
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.500
Yeah. I'm going to have,
I'm going to demolish the

687
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.670
stairs with the front of
your house and have him

688
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.060
remade with one extra. I
wonder if life really becomes

689
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.240
so boring after the first
million? Nah, I don't know

690
00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.580
a million dollars. Isn't that
much money anymore. Well, touch

691
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.830
data. I don't know. What's
a lot of money. $4 million

692
00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.620
is a lot of money.
A lot of money means

693
00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.020
you can live in a
nice house and hang out

694
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.110
and watch TV all day
forever. Well, the, yeah, the

695
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.120
idea that even if I
don't get up today, I've

696
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.060
still made more money than
I spent Today. There you

697
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.450
go. Yes, exactly. When your
burn rate matches your passive

698
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.310
income rate, that's right. A
lot of money. That's the

699
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.460
basic concept of wealth, Right?
Well, you know, what is

700
00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.160
it they always say about
the Chris rock was talking

701
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.950
about the difference between being
rich and being wealthy. Right?

702
00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.100
He said that Shaquille O'Neal
is rich, but the man

703
00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:40.050
who signed Shaquille O'Neal's check
is wealthy. Right? Yeah. I

704
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.940
think the basis it's true.
It's absolutely true. So yeah,

705
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.130
building wealth and that passive
income kind of a sense,

706
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.200
but those, those people take
risks that I'm not willing

707
00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.360
to take. Right? Like my
wife was like, you know,

708
00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.690
we need to buy another
house, rented out and I'm

709
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:55.610
thinking now, how can you
buy a house? Now? This

710
00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.440
is the worst possible time
to buy a house. Oh

711
00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.620
goodness. Well, but see the
one person, the people who

712
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.610
are going to make a
lot of money are the

713
00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.340
ones that are going to
buy houses right now. Maybe

714
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:07.610
they're taking a risk. Yeah.
Or they'll all be homeless

715
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.100
soon. I dunno. Yeah. All
of these things are possible.

716
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.080
This is true. Hmm. This
is a show about nothing.

717
00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.470
This is like, this is
the Seinfeld of Hanselman. Seinfeld.

718
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:20.870
Do you think this is
the show in which we,

719
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.390
in fact wasted people's time.
I don't know. I hope

720
00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.780
people read smallest. Beautiful. I
really enjoyed the book. Really.

721
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.570
Just as an interesting way
of thinking about there is

722
00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:32.750
other ways to operate in
economy. Let's let's do this.

723
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.570
Let's end the show on
book recommendations. All right. Any

724
00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:40.730
others? Well, not necessarily in
the Buddhist econ economics category,

725
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.250
but old man's war by
John Scalzi. S C a

726
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.880
L Z I and anything
John Scalzi writes is fantastic.

727
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.690
Is all good. All good.
Old man's war is wonderful.

728
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:59.780
It's kind of a Heinlein
kind of Starship troopers kind

729
00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.460
of a thing. Okay. Very,
very good. The time Traveler's

730
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.570
wife is a book that
I recommend to everyone, because

731
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.780
it's just amazing. If you
heard about this book. Nope.

732
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.210
It's it's it's I won't,
I won't give the whole

733
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.430
thing away, but the, the
general idea is it starts

734
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.760
out and each chapter basically
says a, I forget their

735
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.070
names. It's just say Frank
and Ann, I don't know

736
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.580
what the people's names are.
It's like Frank is 26

737
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.310
and is eight. And then
the next chapter it's like

738
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.630
Frank is 35 and is
34. And it's about their

739
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:36.290
relationship as he jumps through
time. And she runs through

740
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.410
time normally. Wow. So it's
like a 60 year love

741
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:43.700
story, except he experiences it
from one timeline because he

742
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:49.130
has temporal displacement syndrome and
hops around his own timeline

743
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:54.320
and she doesn't and how
they maintain a relationship time.

744
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.370
Traveler's wife. That's interesting. Oh,
it's fantastic. And it's less

745
00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:01.520
about time travel and more
about, I mean, yeah, maintaining

746
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.240
an interesting relationship. Another book
I read in my, my

747
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.840
week off was the case
for democracy by a guy

748
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.130
named Natan Sharansky. Okay. He
was a dissident in, in

749
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.250
Russia who was part of
the end of the Soviet

750
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.160
union. And, and just as
a very interesting way of

751
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.150
looking at how you end,
how you create new democracies

752
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.330
From the point of view
of someone who did not

753
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.460
live in a democracy. Right,
Right. And values it very

754
00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.860
greatly now that he does
and is very conscious of

755
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.680
what it, what it took
to cause the Soviet union

756
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.460
to collapse. Hmm. Very interesting.
Absolutely. All right. Let's see.

757
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.080
What else am I reading
right now? Oh, alright. I'm

758
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.160
kind of in a bunch
of stuff. It's time to

759
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.440
do a reading list post
cause a man I'm just,

760
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.330
I'm just devouring books. I
got the Kindle. You have

761
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.070
the Kindle. I do not
have a Kindle. I'm in

762
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.200
Canada and it's hard to
use it. It is hard

763
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.570
to use it in Canada.
Sorry for you in Canada.

764
00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.390
Yeah. Loving the Kindle. I'm
reading so much more than

765
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.190
I was before. It's really
obnoxious. And I was reading

766
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.080
a lot before, but just
cause he got it with

767
00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.430
you all the time and
it's got a pile of

768
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.530
books in it. It does
well, and I'm also getting

769
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:02.850
lots of free books. I've
been reading a lot of

770
00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.370
this Cory Doctorow you know,
the science fiction writer that

771
00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.650
gives this stuff away. Yeah.
Yeah. He's got a really

772
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.200
interesting book. I'm halfway through
right now called little brother.

773
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.420
It's like big brother, but
it's a little brother and

774
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.260
it's about a 17 year
old after a nine 11

775
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.430
style attack in San Francisco
and how he, how he

776
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.580
deals with that as a,
as a young techie and

777
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:28.320
how you shouldn't trust anyone
over 25, that was kind

778
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.080
of the sixties all over
again. But in 2000, whatever

779
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.150
he's Canadian, you know, Cory
Doctorow is a Canyon. Absolutely.

780
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.870
Well that explains, that explains
a lot of the book.

781
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:43.200
Then there you go. Interesting.
Cool. Well, thanks so much

782
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.200
Richard Campbell for coming on and
wasting everyone's time. I appreciate

783
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.990
it very, very much. I'm
here to serve, sir. All

784
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.930
right. And we shall have
