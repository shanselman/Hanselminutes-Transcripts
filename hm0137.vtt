The announcements made at the

2008 PDC in Los Angeles.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman

11
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.120
and this is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And I'm

12
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.710
here in Las Vegas. The
nation's armpit at dev connections,

13
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.900
not, not all of Las
Vegas, just the strip part.

14
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.330
And I'm at the Mandalay
Bay. And I'm talking with

15
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.420
Richard Campbell. How are you Richard
neon armpit. I would say

16
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.090
the nation's neon aren't. There
you go. That's actually it's

17
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.190
on the license plates. The
brightest light in the world

18
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.500
is here. It's at the
Luxor. It is really, really

19
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.300
bright. And he's a really
bright this year from space.

20
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.610
Actually, when I saw the
Luxor light, it wasn't like

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.770
amazed about it or trying
to figure out the engineering.

22
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.420
I wanted to know what
kind of permits they had

23
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.010
to file. That's like as
an engineer that my, my,

24
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.070
my first knee jerk reaction
was I was thinking about

25
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.830
amps and cable and just
how much power is actually

26
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.620
being wasted, doing that. It
just blown right back into

27
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.510
the sun. That's right now,
if it was done with

28
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.240
solar power and they just
returned it to winch from

29
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.730
whence, it came that would
it be impressed. You're okay

30
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.460
with that. But if it's
coal-fired, if the light that

31
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.980
comes out of coming from
the Hoover dam, that's bad,

32
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.170
it's still, it's a waste
of electricity. I mean, honestly,

33
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.900
this place is insane. Yeah.
But I mean, the good

34
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.990
news is both of us
are immune to gambling. So

35
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.450
we, we are not their
customers right off the bat,

36
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.590
but I don't think I'm
Las Vegas as customer. I

37
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.010
always tell people that like,
Hey, you're in Las Vegas,

38
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.450
aren't you having a great
time? So, well, I don't

39
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.420
drink, I don't gamble. I
don't cheat on my wife.

40
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.100
I have nothing to do
in this town. Even if

41
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.490
you didn't even eat excessively.
I mean, you, you, you

42
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.560
really don't qualify to be
here. Yeah. The two for

43
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.110
one buffet, just not so
much from, no, it really

44
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.870
hasn't, but that's not why.
I mean, the one thing,

45
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.880
the convention centers here are
outstanding. I mean, I'm tired

46
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.280
of the Mandalay. I've been
here a lot, but it's

47
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.650
hard to touch it in
terms of workable space. I

48
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.600
mean, it is a big
convention center and we have

49
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.240
great sessions here. Yeah. Now
I'm going to be going

50
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.240
and giving us a presentation
and a little bit for

51
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.880
dev connections and at about
half an hour, but a

52
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.160
couple of weeks ago I
was at PDC. And so

53
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.840
was I, and you were
as well. And we didn't,

54
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.400
we didn't get a chance
to hook up and do

55
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.620
a, do a show, which
is a shame. What did

56
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.570
you think of the announcements
that came out of PDC?

57
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.580
PDC was interesting. I mean,
it's not like PDCs Of

58
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.210
lore, right? The old PDCs.
It wasn't, there wasn't one

59
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.870
big message. I felt, I
mean, as you know, You

60
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.390
don't think this was the
cloud PDC, like that one

61
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.740
was the complice PDC and
the Net PTs and the

62
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.260
Longhorn PDC. I don't feel
like this was the cloud

63
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.990
PDC as much as I
think Microsoft really worked on

64
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.240
doing that, that certainly was
the keynote and so forth.

65
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.000
And it was nice to
see, I felt Ray Ozzie,

66
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.060
best keynote I've seen him
do yet. Really? I was

67
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.190
expecting to, I want him
to dance and say, developers,

68
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.680
developers. I want it. I'm
with you. I want to

69
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.230
show yet. Oh, I think
he needs to do better

70
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.560
still, but at least I
see some progress. Yeah. But

71
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.210
yeah. So I think there's
definitely shaped it that way,

72
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.140
but I saw people with
stronger reactions to surface with

73
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.110
strong reactions to Oslow, but
there was some really great

74
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.950
things at PDC. Azure was
not the only thing. Oh

75
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.870
yeah. That's a good point.
I mean, there was the

76
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.840
windows seven windows seven. I
mean touch multi-touch. Yep. The

77
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.510
multi-touch in general. I mean,
windows seven is very powerful

78
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.910
from that perspective of, I
think we're hungry for another

79
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.510
iOS. I think the focus
that we're seeing, like synopsis

80
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.370
a synopsis, you knocked it
out of the park really.

81
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.410
I mean, he is such
a pleasure to watch. And

82
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.960
I also know him he's
deeply immersed in this whole

83
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.180
window, seven thing as well.
And I think the vision

84
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.270
we're seeing around windows seven
is resonating with, with the,

85
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.340
the digerati so to say,
Well, what do you think?

86
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.750
I mean, it doesn't, it's
not a revolution. Nope. It's

87
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.350
I think it's there. And
the refinements we desperately need.

88
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.420
Have you been playing with
windows seven? Has that been

89
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.570
running on two different machines?
I have not. I wanted

90
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.100
on hardware and I haven't
been home. I haven't been

91
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.350
home. You're still on the
road. I'm still on the

92
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.850
road and I'm on the
road for another three weeks.

93
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.920
Oh, that's obscene. I have
not been well, that's not

94
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.150
true. I haven't home. It's
not that I am at

95
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.490
home at all. I'm home
every weekend for about 24

96
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.680
to 36. Well, you know
what, Oprah and dr. Phil

97
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.600
say that you wouldn't be
doing it. If it wasn't

98
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.180
working for you. I really
enjoy being at conferences and

99
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.090
doing the talks and so
forth. I really, really do

100
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.610
enjoy that. I do try
and get home. I had

101
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.980
a great summer with my
family. This is my job.

102
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.290
It's I do derive a
lot of pleasure from it.

103
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.390
So I, I, I think
that's a very good excuse

104
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.010
for not obsessively installing every
windows 17, you know, build

105
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.400
Like I am. Yeah. Well,
and I do, I definitely

106
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.240
want one, but I'm willing
to wait. You know, I

107
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.610
though I'll pick the version
that makes me happy and

108
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.900
I'll run with it for
a while. I have enough

109
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.800
hardware to afford, to have
a machine that's cranky or

110
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.140
troubled. And if it's really
compelling, I'll use it everywhere.

111
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.060
I certainly was an early
adopter of Vista for the

112
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.340
same reason I could make
it work. Well, I haven't

113
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.650
put my main machine on
windows seven yet. They're not

114
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.710
quite at that point because
I feel that it's nothing.

115
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.910
But man, it is a
joy. It's, it's a refinement

116
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.980
I was expecting to be
blown away. You know, I

117
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.800
want an operating system to
walk up and just slap

118
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.200
me in the face and
call me Sally. And you

119
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.630
know, this isn't that, that
operating system, right? Like windows

120
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.450
95 was the first time
that that happened. Right. And

121
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.820
then XP was the second
time. And Vista was kind

122
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.550
of a light sleeper. He
was a refinement to XP

123
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.340
was a refinement of 2000.
It was the stability. Yeah.

124
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.580
Windows only ran for a
day. Yeah, it was crazy.

125
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.460
But 2000 was the breakthrough,
but it wasn't compelling to

126
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.740
a lot of people because
it was still very ish.

127
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.530
I mean, for Harvard geese,
like me, it was revolutionary.

128
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.960
I still have 2000 servers.
I can't give up. Well,

129
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.970
it's actually, you know, the
thing about Vista that's impressed

130
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.670
me the most is been
64 Bit fists. Oh yeah.

131
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.910
I mean the stability, This
laptop hasn't been rebooted in,

132
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.680
you know, I don't know
how long you just it's

133
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.760
just suspended, suspended. It just
runs forever. But back to

134
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.530
windows seven, my initial reaction
when I installed, it was

135
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.990
like, right. It looks like
Vista. And then I started

136
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.010
poking around there's all these
little things that are gonna

137
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.680
make my dad's life easier.
Right? Like if you hit

138
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.910
the start menu and you
type in Ram just ran

139
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.270
or how much Ram, right.
You get an answer. Wow.

140
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.670
How much Ram does this
computer have? And you hit

141
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.280
enter and it brings up
system properties. Now system properties

142
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.100
already exists. Right. But it
happens to have the answer.

143
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.590
Sure. But instead of them,
instead of your dad calling

144
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.790
you and saying, how do
I find out how much

145
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.340
I click on my computer?
Yeah. So if, And I

146
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.530
don't know, transparent or glass
arrow or anything like that,

147
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.630
any word you can think
of to describe why are

148
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.430
these freakin windows? See-through you
get an answer, adjust the

149
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.380
transparency of windows and you
click on it and it

150
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.150
takes you to the stuff.
And there's like two or

151
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.010
300 of these little tasks
that are indexed and available

152
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.910
in the, the start menu.
And very much that natural

153
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.280
language thing has been integrated
in that. Yeah. Yeah. There's

154
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.590
dozens and dozens of cute.
So you've got 250 plus

155
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.060
tasks, times some number of
keywords, you know? So there's

156
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.510
many, many, many entry points
into this And there's always

157
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.120
the, the Microsoft way. I
mean, I know you, you

158
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.000
wax poetic about 95, but
95 had its issues. 98

159
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.740
was the good version. The
one that did everything I

160
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.540
was supposed to 2000 was
a breakthrough version. XP was

161
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.780
the compelling one. Yeah. That's
a good point. So Vista,

162
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.610
which is a big jump.
I mean, look at how

163
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.590
much, Oh, I see. There's
the jump. And then the

164
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.620
refinery, The ones that make
you happy are the one,

165
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.170
the refinements of the gel.
They should stay. And the

166
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.450
plea, this is what I'm
saying. This is what I'm

167
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.800
saying. Yeah. I think that's
a very good point. It's

168
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.820
it's all the things that
were irritating about Vista, right?

169
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.550
Just aren't there anymore. Yeah.
But, but cause they did

170
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.290
the hard work in Vista,
which was the new driver

171
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.860
model, the new graphics model,
all of the sort of

172
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.940
core things that ended up
being a little rough in

173
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.640
the end, the UAC UAC
is necessary. It is a

174
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.850
good technology. We need it.
It is rough in Vista

175
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.730
and it's refined in windows
too In windows seven or

176
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.260
at least the build, the
beta build that they gave

177
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.020
us a PDC. There's just
a slider bar. Right. How

178
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.240
often and how irritating do
you want me to be?

179
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.640
You know how parent, it's
a paranoid, it's a paranoid

180
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.540
knob. Right? Exactly. So That's
good. We need that. Right.

181
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.150
We need that adjustability. But
first we need an infrastructure

182
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.970
place to stop the apps,
Destroying your machine. You know,

183
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:03.140
one other nice thing about
the seven was that I

184
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.690
immediately went off to download
stuff. Like I was like,

185
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.390
okay, I need to burn
an ISO image. I'm running

186
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.170
windows seven. I'll go download
my favorite ISO burner. And

187
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.930
I noticed that the ISO
had its own new, special

188
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.940
icon. Oh. So I double
click on it. I and

189
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.550
pops up. They have an
ISO burner built Hilton. Thank

190
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.070
you. Double click on it
and hit burn. So that's

191
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.150
just one example. I was
like, <inaudible> should be one

192
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.220
more utility. I don't need
to be concerned. I mean,

193
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.460
I want the stack of
stuff I install before I

194
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.790
do anything on this machine
to be zero. Yeah. Right.

195
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.270
I just want this stuff.
Exactly. A word word pad

196
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:48.560
looks creepily. Like We're 2000.
Yes. It has open XML

197
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.980
support. So you can save
as an O O O

198
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.920
O F XML file or
whatever, but basically it's office

199
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.430
XML and you can open
that and, and other applications

200
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.200
like open office or whatever.
I mean it's a real

201
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.050
little word processor. Yeah. It's
like works. Yeah. It is.

202
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.380
It's like the shipping works.
We could miss notepad. Is

203
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.630
that what you're saying? Oh,
I like notepad. Oh your

204
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.270
notepad too. Yeah. Well I
went back and forth. I'm

205
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.050
using an editor called the
E text editor that E

206
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.540
okay. It's it takes some
serious stones to come out

207
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.360
with a piece of shareware
that's called E just try

208
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.190
your, like when you go
and Google for it, you're

209
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.570
actually competing with the letter
E and you know, E

210
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.540
for electron E for energy.
You know what I mean?

211
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.370
So to show up in
the first page at all

212
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.890
is a feat, but no
it's called E text editor

213
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.070
and it's basically text mate
the Mac text mate, right.

214
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.890
For windows. Okay. So I'm
using that one more and

215
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.850
more. So let me see
what else came out of

216
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.980
PDC, the multi-touch stuff. Did
you get a chance to

217
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.790
caress the HP touchscreen? Oh
yeah. And I love the

218
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.520
fact that they're going, they're
opening up to an SDK

219
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.720
now to third party developers.
So yeah. But it's No

220
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.040
seven is going to do
this as well. I mean,

221
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.870
we're just coming to recognize
that this is the new

222
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.630
UI element we want is
some kind of multi-touch solution.

223
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.460
Yeah. And when they're baking
it in, I got a

224
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.770
chance to talk to some
of the touch guys at

225
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.150
the booth there. And I
was like, well, how is

226
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.590
this going to cause I
was a developer. It's like,

227
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.170
okay, that's great. I can
touch it. How, how does

228
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.880
this look? I mean, they're
making it all the way

229
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.860
down. Of course they have
to at the winter to

230
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.320
two level. Right. So just
as there's, you know, WM

231
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.030
mouse move, they've got WM
touch, right? So these are

232
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.830
window messages for those folks
that are not surface plus.

233
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.940
So you can write, you
know, your hardcore unmanaged C

234
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.370
plus plus app that knows
lots and lots of information.

235
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.700
And then it will also
be exposed in WPF in

236
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.760
some really, really high level
way. Like for example, when

237
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.370
I poured it baby smashed
to the surface, I just

238
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.450
went from a key down
and mouse down to contact

239
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.110
down. You know, those will
become touch messages And come

240
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.340
all the way back up.
And I love the fact

241
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.540
that when you got it
onto the surface, I think

242
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.670
it was at Tim's party.
That was Tim Huckabee's party

243
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:59.040
actually for posts. I don't
know. I did a talk@pdconthisproductcalledbabysmashthatihavemaybesmash.com.

244
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.830
And I went to a
party at Tim Huckabee from

245
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.800
inner Knology who just happened
to have a surface in

246
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.860
his bag. Those things are
happened to Tim. This is

247
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.470
the kind of person Tim
is. Yeah. Yeah. There's the

248
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.760
PlayStation. Oh, there's the surface.
Yeah. Oh, here's here's the

249
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.790
original pinball machine from 19
four. Oh the surface. You

250
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.010
want to see the surface?
Yes. So yeah, I happened

251
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.040
to have the surface simulator
version of my baby smash

252
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.950
application on a thumb drive.
So I stuck it on

253
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.570
the thing. They loaded it
up and we had a

254
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.540
baby. We actually had her
baby. It was Clemons faster.

255
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.210
It's just someone's Vassar's baby
little baby got there. Got

256
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.370
right on top of the
surface and started smashing it.

257
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.350
It was beautiful. It's pretty
cool. Yeah. It was hilarious.

258
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.320
People have a visceral reaction
to touch. I have always

259
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.890
wanted to have that minority
report. You know, I want

260
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.360
to pick up a window
and I want to throw

261
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.280
it over To the other
monitor. I agree. I just

262
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.130
think that that vertical makes
no sense. It's tiring, actually

263
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.350
the wave, your arms around
like that. Try it for

264
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.490
15 minutes. I'm just stipulating
wildly now, but actually keep

265
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.850
your arms moving. And the
precision movements at that angle

266
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:04.200
that the horizontal position is
the right position. Hi, this

267
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.750
is Scott Hanselman with a
word from our sponsor. Do

268
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.330
you know how to build
web 2.0 Ajax applications with

269
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.180
web 1.0 components? You really
can't. If you want to

270
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.180
do the next generation web
applications you'll need next generation

271
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.610
components. Just like the ones
that our friends at Telerik

272
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.790
have got their rad controls
for ESPN and Ajax. It's

273
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.340
a huge pack of web
controls built on top of

274
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.080
asp.net Ajax. That'll add previously
impossible performance interactivity to your

275
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.490
next project. The new controls
mirror, the Ajax API from

276
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.540
asp.net. So development is really
straightforward. The client scripture shared.

277
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.910
So loading time is not
a problem. If you just

278
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.530
set a couple of properties
and you'll be able to

279
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.500
automatically bind a web services
for a really efficient operation,

280
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.000
the new rad editor from
ESPN Ajax, Telerik loads up

281
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.640
to four times faster than
before. And the new rad

282
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.120
grid handles thousands of records
and just milliseconds, but as

283
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.760
always, it's best to try
for yourself. So you can

284
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.270
visit <inaudible> dot com slash
ASP, net Ajax, and download

285
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.300
a trial. Thanks a lot.
You know what? I would

286
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.640
like, I would like a
surface that looked like a,

287
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.250
like a dinner tray that
you would like bring breakfast

288
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.680
in bed on. Absolutely. And
I would want to That

289
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.230
in front of me in
front of my monitor. So

290
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.390
The ha I would have
looked down, I'd see my

291
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.360
keyboard. And then in front
of my, and behind my

292
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.390
keyboard, Oh, moving away from
my body would be a

293
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.890
horizontal tray. And then going
up would be my monitor.

294
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.890
Well, it's when you start
thinking of the coffee table

295
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.500
being sort of a three
foot interface to the 10

296
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.270
foot vertical interface of the
television screen. There's interesting possibilities

297
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.100
there. Well, and there's a
lot of white space. There's

298
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.780
a lot of space there,
but that's just from between

299
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.970
the couch and the TV.
But I'm thinking from my

300
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.440
office desk to my office
monitor, right? If it's my

301
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.570
desktop, what if I could
literally pick something up off

302
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.530
of my vertical monitor and
bring it down onto that

303
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.650
surface piece, We can get
away from the whole projection.

304
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.000
The thing that needs to
be a table ended up

305
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.890
at the dad. Now it's
nice and flat. I need

306
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.140
a half by 11 page
sitting in front of your

307
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.590
keyboard. Yeah, exactly. An eight
and a half by 11

308
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.980
page or an a four
page, right. That I could

309
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.980
pick up. So I could,
I could take stuff, drag

310
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.890
it off of my window
and kind of stroke. It,

311
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.320
downloads that thing. And then
take that thing with me,

312
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.900
Right. Or drop your cell
phone onto it and load

313
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.270
it into the phone. I
mean, this, this whole dynamic

314
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.200
of the surface model of
communication, Actually, you know, speaking

315
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.390
of you know, the idea
of taking your phone and

316
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.480
putting it onto something, I
guess Sony just announced, I

317
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.560
forgot the name of it,
a new, not Bluetooth, but

318
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.430
a new wireless protocol where
you could basically, it's very,

319
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.640
very, very low power and
incredibly short range. It's a

320
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.320
little Really, it almost has
to be touching, but you

321
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.600
don't actually have to plug
it. Exactly. They're saying that

322
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.270
Bluetooth is too hard. Pairing
is too hard. The range

323
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.210
is too much power requirements
are too much, but what

324
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.770
if I could just take
my cell phone and just

325
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.270
put it on a plate
on my desk and leave

326
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.690
them all sitting there, then
things could transfer, but they

327
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.700
need to be within inches.
And you will find with

328
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.440
that as long as we
get the charging in that

329
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.750
too. Yes. Let's assume that
you have charging, but this

330
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.590
there's only thing is primarily
an issue of, of, of

331
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.940
data transfer. So then we
put those there. Then I

332
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.770
think about that in the
context of the live mesh.

333
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.170
So Sony is the hardware
in this case, live meshes

334
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.780
the idea of being synchronized
everywhere. It would be interesting

335
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.900
to just drop something into
a folder on my desktop.

336
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.570
And because my cell phone
was sitting on this pad,

337
00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.640
it shows up there, showed
up there without any of

338
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.060
the hassle of, of pairing
and Bluetooth Tooth and sinking

339
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.740
and all of this because
the whole concern about Bluetooth

340
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.050
is security. And someone could
be just cause it's. So

341
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.900
it does too many things,
but there's Yeah. From a

342
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.530
security perspective, of course you
can put files there. It's

343
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.810
within an area Yes. Of
the proximity control. I mean,

344
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.990
folks have played with Bluetooth
where they're literally gunning a

345
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.870
mile. Right. You see the
Bluetooth rifle. So you have

346
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.470
to wonder any wireless technology
could be manipulated to extend

347
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.680
its range. How do we
keep that under control? So,

348
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.000
I mean, it's nice that
they've got it down to

349
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.040
an inch, but kind of
black hat come up with

350
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.620
an antenna that extends that.
Yeah. I mean, as a

351
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.200
security guy, of course you
have to take my utopia

352
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.870
and spoil it. I'm a
paranoid guy, man know just

353
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:12.310
cause you're not paranoid. Doesn't
mean they aren't out to

354
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.190
get you. That's true. I
still like the idea of

355
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:20.800
completely punting on the security
proximity concept by saying, Touching

356
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.840
has to be touching this
thing is if it could

357
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.610
put it down on a
surface and the physical contact

358
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:27.010
of that surface would be
the conduit, but I don't

359
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.170
want to discard the point
of the real reason I

360
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.210
plugged my phone in to
transfer data is to charge

361
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.840
the phone. So any solution
that transfers data must transfer

362
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.210
power And we need to
get into the whole wireless

363
00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.240
power transfer That stuff exists.
We just got to commit

364
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.820
to a standard and start
building phones, But don't, they

365
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.240
waste ridiculous amounts of power.
Yeah. Now you've got a

366
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.890
whole other can of worms,
right? Because we were in

367
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.570
Vegas power, wasting land of
all. Yeah. It's power inefficient.

368
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.290
Even the contact ones. I've
seen the little plates and

369
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.480
they always say, and one
day you'll have a desk

370
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.910
that has all, but they
leak just obscene amounts of

371
00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:03.440
power. These osmosis based systems.
I remember the smartwatch, the

372
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.660
Microsoft spot watch the spot.
It had an all kind

373
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.390
of an osmosis style thing
where you'd set it on.

374
00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.850
You just set it on
its holder In power with

375
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.340
trends. That would be enough.
But yeah, It must've leaked

376
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.840
huge amounts of, I don't
know. I don't know enough

377
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.030
about power. Well, it's just,
Yeah, they're not, they're not

378
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.460
particularly efficient, but therein in
lies the essential problem with

379
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.470
all of these things. I
mean I'm far happier carrying

380
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.180
a phone that has a
mini USB plug in it

381
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.910
so that I don't have
a custom cable that I

382
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.310
can always plug it in.
That's my sink. That's my

383
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.820
charge that I'm having so
many cables. Well, that's why

384
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.440
I want a standard cable.
I mean the mini USB

385
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.170
makes me happy because I
can buy that cable anywhere.

386
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.570
Okay. I'll give you that.
So then we need to

387
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.220
start using a lot of
the power that we're already

388
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.860
generating. Like the idea that
I have a watch that

389
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.040
needs to be charged is
obscene. I'm walking outside, I'm

390
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.980
in the sun and I'm
shrinking my arms all day

391
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.840
long. You gotta be a
collective power. This is why

392
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.450
I can't stand Bluetooth headsets.
Besides the fact that I

393
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:54.950
just ended up leaving my
phone in my pocket and

394
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.310
getting brain cancer, testicular cancer
at the same time, that's

395
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.400
a separate issue. Charging the
bloody headset makes me mad

396
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.370
New phone coming out that
has a headset built in

397
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.590
that he talks in the
back of the phone. One

398
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.420
less thing to charge. One
less thing to charge. Yeah,

399
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.980
exactly. And I think we'll
see that where you can

400
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.430
slide the slide, the Bluetooth
out of the phone, or

401
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.530
it's hidden in the phone
somewhere. Well, and also then

402
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.060
you have it with you
too. You don't leave it

403
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.550
places and forget about it
and don't have the charging

404
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.950
cable and all of that.
Am I the only guy

405
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.960
who covers my mouth when
I'm talking on the phone

406
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.490
in public? No, there's a
few people who do it,

407
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.370
you know, who does that?
Carl Franklin does that. I can't,

408
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.860
I was talking to Jesse
Liberty today and I'm walking

409
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.740
on the elevator and you
know what I said, I'm

410
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.890
getting on an elevator. I'll
call you right back. Right.

411
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.750
So I get on the
elevator and there's three guys

412
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.750
in the elevator talking on
the phone. I'm just here

413
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.660
on the elevator with a
bunch of bunch of people,

414
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.180
you know, everybody say hi.
I don't think they can

415
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.540
hear me, but what is
that? So I'm, I'm now

416
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.520
at the point where I
don't have it with me

417
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.340
right now, but I have
a little jammer with a

418
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.200
push button on it. It'll
hang up every phone with

419
00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.200
yeah. Jammer, 15 feet radius
around me. That's like those

420
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.540
little remote controls that only
do one thing. They turn

421
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.780
off. I've got the equivalent
for cell phones. That's brilliant.

422
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.390
Totally illegal. I must have
that. Yeah. I'll, I'll arrange

423
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.820
you if you're not one
that's fantastic. The phones I'll

424
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.920
disconnect. And the funny part
is, so what really, my

425
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.440
real experience with that is
I pushed that button and

426
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.960
everybody says, hello, can you
hear me all the same

427
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.240
time? Awesome. I need to
take that into movie theaters.

428
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.990
Cool. So, so what about
cloud computing? You didn't think

429
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.860
it was the cloud PVC?
Well, I think they want

430
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.650
Would just be the cloud
PDC, but I think the

431
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.470
question is how important is
cloud computing really? You know,

432
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:35.090
we talked about the core
of this technology, this whole,

433
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.390
you know, putting your data
remote in a data center,

434
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.450
that's owned by a third
party during the.com boom. And

435
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.270
the general reaction was my
data's where, That's the thing

436
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.340
that's so interesting when I
was working on, like, I

437
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:51.640
worked on eight hundred.com gear.com.
There was that big discussion

438
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.640
early on. Do we, as
a, as a company that

439
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.640
sells stuff, right. Have our
own data center. And they,

440
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.350
they not only built their
own data center, but they

441
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.990
kept them in the warehouse
and they did it like

442
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.230
donut style. So in this
giant abandoned warehouse in the

443
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.640
middle, they built this kind
of like MCP Tron thing

444
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.060
that was like in circled
in, in, you know, diamond

445
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.600
and crusted glass so that
anyone around the warehouse could

446
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.280
look into the center. But
the Four there is that

447
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.360
this data center is the
heart of your company. That

448
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.240
was the metaphor in the
late nineties, early two thousands.

449
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.360
But because the trust wasn't
there, no one could trust

450
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.910
an ISP to be up.
As, you know, nine, five

451
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.150
nines are always The internet
set up for five nines.

452
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.120
How can any remote data
center via profile? So was

453
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.920
it just a matter of
time? Did we just need

454
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.550
to build up trust? I
don't know that we have,

455
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.790
I just know that our
technology's advanced, you know, who's

456
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.720
actually using this stuff. I
run my host, my blog

457
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.330
at Orks web. Right. But
I know people who host

458
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.630
their blog at home on
the other side of their

459
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.910
cable modem collection connection, or
the other side of their,

460
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.070
you know, at some point
somebody is going to be

461
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.840
down. But for some reason,
they just don't want to

462
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.490
give that up. Well, Jeff
Atwood doesn't host on a,

463
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.680
on a physical piece of
hardware. Like I do. He

464
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.500
actually just has a VM.
So when he moved holsters,

465
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.410
he just shut, he shut
the VHD down and handed

466
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.960
it to another guy. And
so on one hand, the

467
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.180
cloud, the whole is your
platform. There is the VM

468
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.400
model and that's being used
in a lot of places

469
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.500
where it's just another way
to host in different places.

470
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.000
But the coding model is
much more challenging from a

471
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.860
sync, from an it perspective.
We're still getting back to

472
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.310
this whole issue of there.
I see two core audiences

473
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.240
here. One is the large
enterprise that is just not

474
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.060
prepared to come to commit
that massive infrastructure it's going

475
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.720
to take. They'd rather buy
by utilization and S and

476
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.270
get the geo distribution and
so forth. But now they're

477
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:53.070
dealing with their, the regulatory
requirements of somebody else has,

478
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.320
this is in control of
this stuff. They're dealing with

479
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.440
that sort of core competency,
you know, is this appropriate

480
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.330
for our business? Our shareholders
will be okay with that.

481
00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:04.260
So forth. The other audience
to me is the little

482
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.140
guy, the little guy who
has nothing and is just

483
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.230
winging it. It created trying
to create the next flicker

484
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.110
or Twitter, or one of
the things. My question is

485
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.040
when the little guy becomes
big, will the cloud platform

486
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.430
grow with them. So for
example, Jeff runs his blog

487
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.850
on a single VHD, right?
Let's say his blog became

488
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.910
the most popular blog in
the universe, right. He, he

489
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.090
can't scale beyond that one
VHD, right. Or, I mean,

490
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.620
scaling, it is not going
to be a simple thing

491
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.360
to do, but yeah, Let's
just think about it simplistically

492
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.990
for a second, because it
is a reasonable, it is,

493
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.660
it is a good example.
He runs this little virtual

494
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.720
machine. He can put it
on bigger hardware, but ultimately

495
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.920
that VM has minimum, you
know, a amount of memory.

496
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.860
It's an atomic unit so
far, it's a VM. He

497
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.130
can't scale out. He can
only scale up, scale up,

498
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.500
add memory, add processes. He
has to redesign. If he's

499
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.930
going to go bigger and
say exactly now with this,

500
00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.900
with this Azure platform and
platforms like it, like the

501
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.620
elastic cloud computing platform, you're
building to an API. So

502
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.230
you're building kind of, I
guess, more, I don't know

503
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.330
if the, if this metaphor
works anymore, you're, you're building

504
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.870
these smaller units. Maybe they're
electronics that works. I don't

505
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.590
know, but they're smaller. And
they don't know that they're

506
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.230
in a machine. They know
that they're in an environment

507
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.170
and theoretically they can scale
out as far as you

508
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.360
want it. So the question
will be what is the

509
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.870
first tiny startup that goes
with a platform like this?

510
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.740
And then It's a big,
yeah. And I don't think

511
00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.890
it's happened in state. Well,
one example, at least on

512
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.530
the <inaudible> side, which is
more storage based, not computing.

513
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.380
So it would be the
smug mug. Right, right. There,

514
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.130
I think are probably the
most popular, you know, web

515
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.340
2.0 startup that I can
think of that that really,

516
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.780
really, really depends on Amazon
for their, And with the

517
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.450
problems involved. I think the
other challenge around this, which

518
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.830
is one thing that didn't
come out of PDC was

519
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.560
the pricing model. This whole
thing can, the little guy

520
00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.580
actually afford to use this
infrastructure and pay. He goes,

521
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.220
if you need to be
competitive, right. Yeah. It's going

522
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.200
to be very challenging because
I think those two different

523
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.150
audiences, that large scale system
and that, and the little

524
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.510
guy have very different pricing
tolerances. Like it's, it's going

525
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:11.980
to be interesting to see
if that actually works, but

526
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.510
you know, one of the
things that came out of

527
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.310
that whole discussion over and
over again, and I heard

528
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:20.020
this was, can I run
the Azure servers myself? I

529
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.630
don't want you, I want
my own cloud. Right. You

530
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.850
can have your cloud, Michael.
I want my own personal

531
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.340
cloud. Yeah. Yeah. And it's,
and I can see us

532
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.700
doing that maybe for development
purposes initially. But I actually

533
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.620
think that enterprises are going
to want to run in

534
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.490
that infrastructure It's clearly possible
because there is a developer

535
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.530
cloud, which is the cloud
you use when you develop

536
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.530
on your own machine, but
whether or not that's where

537
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.780
their will wants to take
them. I don't know. We'll

538
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.030
have to find them and
ask them. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

539
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.370
and whether, whether they're actually
going to do that. But

540
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.520
it's interesting to think that
way. I think we still

541
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.740
have this core issue of,
am I willing to do

542
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.040
this remote? And almost this
could be a bridge that

543
00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.500
I start off running with
my own infrastructure. And then

544
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.280
as you know, peak loads
come in, my infrastructure is

545
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.530
hitting its limits that I
can start offloading this to

546
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.350
the external cloud. What if
Microsoft moved some of their

547
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:12.700
stuff, something important of theirs
into the cloud? Well, But

548
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.470
I also think that there's
energy around this. You know,

549
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.190
you look at the initial
story of Azure, as it's

550
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.560
told, which was really, they
collected up all of their

551
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.890
online products, the MSNs and,
and live and so forth

552
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.270
and said, well, a lot
of this stuff has stuff

553
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.420
in common. We should be
running a common infrastructure. I

554
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.300
do think that Microsoft should
be moving those products into

555
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.030
this infrastructure as proof, but
also because it's probably a

556
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.950
really good way to run
it. Yeah. That's a good

557
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:39.160
point. Duplication of effort. Yeah.
Why would we, I think

558
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.660
that's how they got there
in the first place was

559
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.940
this recognition of we're duplicating
effort all over the place.

560
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.000
Let's come up with a
common platform for it. That

561
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.780
helps us. That's a good
question. Amazon got here too.

562
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.730
You know, nobody really sat
down and said, Hey, let's

563
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.850
create cloud computing. It's really,
we're doing this ourselves. Why

564
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.520
don't we sell some? Yeah.
So the remainder, yeah. The

565
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.680
left, you know, to me,
I always made sense to

566
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.920
me that Amazon was selling
unused computing horsepower. They had

567
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.750
well, cause where they're saying
is that we've become so

568
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.080
good at doing our work
that we have this leftover.

569
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.240
We have leftovers, you can
have it for a fee.

570
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.580
And I think that's true
of Microsoft too. I mean,

571
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.590
they talk about Microsoft being
one of the largest purchasers

572
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.350
of computing power in the
world that really are good

573
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.810
at it. They're going to
move. I presuming they're moving

574
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.640
their stuff to this infrastructure
as well. And that's going

575
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.410
to help give everybody confidence
that they can do that.

576
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.870
But I still have this
sense that people want to

577
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.720
run their own cloud computing
servers. Hmm. You know, it

578
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.820
just, I think that will
be an interim step and

579
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.640
it'll help facilitate that larger
step if it's really going

580
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.280
to happen. Believe me, I'm
not convinced I'm a cynic

581
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.800
on all of this stuff.
You shouldn't be. It's healthy.

582
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.950
Absolutely. I, you know, I
have to still let it

583
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.480
mindset changes. Good. You go,
first change is good. You

584
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.040
go first. Yeah. Well, I'm
going to hunt down some

585
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.540
of these cloud computing guys
and see if I can

586
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.130
get some answers to the
very good questions that you

587
00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.650
brought up. Thank you very
much. Richard Campbell for sitting down

588
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.570
with me today. Always a
pleasure, man. All right. This

589
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.700
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and I'll see

590
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.540
you again next week.
