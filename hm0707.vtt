11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.560
Scott Hanselman, this Hansel minutes
today. I'm talking with Sharon

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.880
steel CEO at commuter log
author of empathy at work.

13
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.220
And I first learned about
Sharon when I saw her

14
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.930
Ted X talk. How are
you? I'm great. How are

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.540
you doing? I'm very happy
to be talking to you.

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.570
We have been digital friends
now for many, many years,

17
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.210
and I've, I've watched you
just kicking butt all over

18
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.720
the internet. And I, I
saw your first year TEDx

19
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.200
talk some years ago, but
you've been thinking about the

20
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.150
space of, of empathy and
building collaborative environments for, for

21
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.700
many years before you kind
of blew up in the

22
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.500
TEDx space. Yeah, yeah, for
sure. I actually got it

23
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.320
started speaking CAC in 2000.
Gosh, fourteens splits been about

24
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.770
five years now. I gave
that TEDx talk in 2016

25
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.250
and I got started speaking
on the advice of a

26
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.150
speech therapist I was seeing
at the time I'm a

27
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.390
person who stutters. And so
I had sort of like

28
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.530
come to the spot where,
you know, I was so

29
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.240
uncomfortable just like talking that
I would avoid social situations.

30
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.900
I would avoid talking to
people and it was, you

31
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.290
know, quite frankly just destroying
my career. And so she

32
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.730
suggested I pursue like public
speaking as a way to

33
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.640
sort of just pace the
fear. And so, you know,

34
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.180
I, of course being me
was like, absolutely not. And

35
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.240
then after she like packed
me off of the ledge

36
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.730
and said, don't worry, it's
not going to kill you.

37
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.810
I said, okay, sure. And
so that's kind of how

38
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.810
the whole thing again, let's
just as a way to

39
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.800
sort of, you know, pace
a fear and see if

40
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.700
I could do it or
not. When you're at a

41
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.240
speech therapist who is talking
to you about how to

42
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.680
adjust this, this, this affecting
situation. And then they say,

43
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.910
Oh, you know what? You
should do international keynote speaker.

44
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.760
That would be a great
idea. Like, what are you,

45
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.020
what are you thinking at
this moment? Well, so here's

46
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.980
the thing, like, it wasn't,
Hey, you should like go

47
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.000
on a plane and you
should fly to, you know,

48
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.320
Sydney and a photog in
front of like a thousand

49
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.910
developers. No, no, no. It
was like, how about you

50
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.170
go and speak to a,
a F fluency's seminar, like

51
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.280
at a graduate college and
just talk to them about

52
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.760
not like your experiences as
a person who stutters. And

53
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.660
so, you know, in my
mind, I mean, I had

54
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.530
spent my entire life and
I'm not kidding, like a

55
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.750
great school, you know, like
high school, college, like of

56
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.190
voiding, you know, these kinds
of situations. And so for

57
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.200
her to sort of Cresent
this idea was just like,

58
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.840
why, like why, what I've
fallen terribly? You know, like

59
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.480
do this thing that has
traumatized me. I don't know

60
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.020
how many times my entire
life. And so just in

61
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.260
my mind, it was just
like, there's no way that

62
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.370
that could even work even,
even a little bit. And

63
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.580
so that's what I was
thinking. And I had no

64
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.620
idea that it was going
to turn into, you know,

65
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.140
the thing that it's turned
into now. No, no, no

66
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.130
clue The idea that that
one would or could take

67
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.340
something that was affecting them
and, and turn it into,

68
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.380
I don't know. Is it
fair to say it's an

69
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.440
asset? I mean, does it
get you recognize? It's like,

70
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.570
Oh yeah, I saw you
like, you're the, you're the

71
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.930
woman who stutters or does
that make it worse? Oh,

72
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.690
no. I actually think it's
made it better. And like,

73
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.100
so in all of my
talks now, like I sort

74
00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.330
of talk about my like
poignant, you know, my homelands

75
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.490
along a way like that
have sort of taught me

76
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.900
about communication as a person
who stutters and then just

77
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.760
communication, like as a person
in a world that is

78
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.330
just like increasingly divided. Right?
And so another sort of

79
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.310
high product of speaking has
been actually me is getting

80
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.550
a lot more comfortable talking
about stuttering and stuttering and

81
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:43.590
<inaudible> general. And I wasn't
expecting that to be the

82
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.620
case. I mean, I thought,
you know, I was always

83
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.890
just going to be uncomfortable
with how I spoke. And

84
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.040
so I didn't know that
there was a way to

85
00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.860
sort of speak freely and
at the same time until

86
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.010
I became a public speaker,
When I, and forgive me

87
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.740
if this is a bad
analogy, but let's try this.

88
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.520
When I was diagnosed type
one diabetic, I didn't know

89
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.860
anything about the situation. And
I went and I was

90
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.510
at work and I told
a bunch of people and

91
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.560
I was like, Oh my
goodness, you went to the

92
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.080
doctor today, I'm diabetic. I
got these needles, look at

93
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.090
my needles. And I was
just, I was young and

94
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.500
I was telling everyone all
about this and what a

95
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.480
fascinating and horrible thing it
was. And it, because it

96
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.480
was the thing in my
life. And a woman in

97
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.960
accounting pulled me aside, like
in a hushed tone, into

98
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.300
a, into an alleyway. And
she was like, don't talk

99
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.640
about this. What are you
doing? And I'm like, what

100
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.620
are you talking about? Like
I'm diabetic, but they don't

101
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.200
know because they're gonna, they're
gonna take away your insurance

102
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.570
and they're gonna, they might,
they might think you're weak

103
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.680
and they're not going to
want, they're not gonna give

104
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.900
you assignments because they know
that you've got this, this

105
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.500
thing. And she for about
two years taught me to

106
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.340
be consciously, visibly ashamed of
this thing that I just

107
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.830
thought was a thing. Like
I thought everyone has something

108
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.800
and it messed me up
for a pretty good amount

109
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.950
of time. But then when
I started doing speaking and

110
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.660
I would have, you know,
a low blood sugar or

111
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.000
have to fix my pumper,
stab a needle in myself

112
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.550
on stage, I'd have people
come up afterwards and say,

113
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.940
wow, it's so nice to
see a visible diabetic in

114
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.300
today's world. Is it good
to be a visible blank?

115
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.690
Whatever your thing is, like,
we've got supermodels with a

116
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.850
bit of lanugo and we
have international keynote speakers or

117
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.670
stutter, like everybody's got something.
Is that a good thing?

118
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.210
Oh yeah. I mean, of
course it is. I think

119
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.770
that, I think that the
more people who are a

120
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.730
little bit different, a little
bit outside of the box

121
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.270
who are, you know, like
out there doing a thing

122
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.080
that people don't think that
they can do because of,

123
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.050
you know, blank. I think
that that's a great thing.

124
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.770
I mean, I think that
we're telling kids, I think

125
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.470
that we're telling adults add
like, you know, all of

126
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.090
us are, you know, we
all have our own things,

127
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.100
right. We all have our
own insecurities, our own disabilities

128
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.970
and you don't have to
be quiet about those things.

129
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.760
Those things are actually kind
of a benefit to us

130
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.320
because they give us a
different perspective and they can

131
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:24.730
show the world a different
perspective. Right. I mean, it

132
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:28.480
also helps you to connect
with people who you didn't

133
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.590
think that you had anything
in common with than you,

134
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.540
you know, have some sort
of common ground. I mean,

135
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.780
I can't tell you, you
know, how many people have

136
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:43.150
like come up to me,
you know, when I've spoken

137
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.030
and said, yeah. You know,
I stutter too. And you

138
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.960
know, I have had a
really a challenging time, like

139
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.520
speaking up at work or,
you know, taking phone calls.

140
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.780
Like I just like constantly
avoid talking on the phone

141
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.250
and shit and, and seeing
you, you know, he on

142
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.180
stage and be confident and
be comfortable like that, you

143
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:13.200
know, just kids, me, it
gives me a feeling that

144
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.850
I can, you know, speak
with confidence and that it's

145
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.670
okay. And so, yes, you
know, of course I think,

146
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.540
I think that the more
that we make things in,

147
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.340
in visible, the more that
we give those things, how

148
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:36.030
power over us and over
our choices. And I think

149
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:41.520
that we should, you know,
do everything we can to

150
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.350
sort of take that power
back. Yeah. And let me

151
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.690
ask you this though. Like,
it feels like it takes

152
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.820
a lot of willpower. Like
I was, you know, every

153
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.070
couple of years, I'll be
honest with you. I will

154
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.790
have a crying day and
it's not all the time,

155
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.370
but it's just like every
couple of years, diabetes just

156
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.810
gets me down and like
the well of, of willpower

157
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.880
goes away and it's just
like, you know, I just

158
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.870
can't today and you just
want to break. Right. It's

159
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.630
been 27 years. And it's
just like, I need one

160
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.910
day where I can have
a freaking cookie and then

161
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.890
I've cried. I get over
it. And then I move

162
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.760
on. Not, not everyone has
a well of willpower that

163
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.540
is as deep as someone
else's. How do you teach

164
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.030
someone that like, well, they
might say, well, Sharon's, you

165
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.070
know, she's on stage, but
she's got that power. She's

166
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.500
got that. That's something that
I don't have. How do

167
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.370
we teach others to have
that ability as well? Right.

168
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.070
I mean, like, it's such
a small thing, right? Like

169
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.050
I just want a cookie
and now I'm crying about

170
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.800
it. However, I have those
exact same moments. I was

171
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.530
at a party a couple
of weeks ago. And so

172
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.820
people who stutter, like the
one word that we can't

173
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:58.850
get around is our name.
And so when we are

174
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.610
introducing ourselves, he can't say,
hi, well, I'm this awesome

175
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.130
person, blah, blah, blah. And
I do this and this

176
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.550
and that. No, it's like,
I have to say hi,

177
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.950
I'm, she's just, she's just,
she's just, she's just Sharon.

178
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.110
And like, occasionally it doesn't
come out as quickly as

179
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.680
it should. And so people
kind of give you this,

180
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.850
like, Oh, this is weird.
I'm either going to little,

181
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.360
a little, a little, a
little, a little, a little

182
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.070
look, half at you because
I'm uncomfortable or I'm just

183
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.750
going to completely avoid you
because I'm uncomfortable. And so

184
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.750
I was at this party
and we, you know, for

185
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.850
like going around and saying,
hi, you know, I'm smoking

186
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.700
so high I'm smoking. So,
and then I said, hi,

187
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.550
I'm <inaudible>, she's just Sharon
and a woman who I

188
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.570
was talking to just like,
was like, Oh, hi. And

189
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.620
then she just avoided me
for the entire night. And

190
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.990
I remember going up to
my husband and being like,

191
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.990
I want to leave. Like
I was so upset. I

192
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.140
was so overwhelmed with just
like, this is so embarrassing.

193
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.210
I'm so ashamed. Why do
like, I have to stutter?

194
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.340
Like, I just want to
be normal. Like, I just

195
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.440
want to go to a
party and say my name

196
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.500
and have fun and have
good conversations. And so, I

197
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:29.440
mean, I think that when,
you know, people see people,

198
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:37.720
you know, like you and
like I as strong and

199
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.530
confident all of the time,
well, they're only seeing a

200
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.350
very, very, very small part
of our lives, right? Like

201
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:52.030
on Twitter or on stages
or on these podcasts. Like

202
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.600
that's only like a very
small part of us, you

203
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.520
know, I have to be
this person. You, you, you

204
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.230
have to be this person
all day, every day. And

205
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.890
there are times when I
don't feel strong. Like there

206
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.760
are times when I'm just
not gonna call anyone because

207
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.520
I really don't feel like
having to talk to someone

208
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.950
right now because it's going
to be hard. And my

209
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.960
life is so hard and
I'm like, I'm just going

210
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.240
to stay in bed because
this is the worst. Right.

211
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.300
And so, I don't know.
I mean, I think that

212
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:28.600
people kind of view willpower
as strength, and I don't

213
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.830
see those things on the
same claim. I feel like

214
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.280
having we'll we'll we'll we'll
we'll we'll we'll, we'll, we'll,

215
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.650
we'll, we'll, we'll we'll Hauer
is, you know, kind of

216
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.390
peaks and valleys. It's like,
I have awesome days and

217
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.760
I feel confident and I
feel amazing and I feel

218
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.080
really, really, really, really strong
and tough. And then it's

219
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.490
on those days, then I
do feel weak and I

220
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:03.910
do feel small and I
choose to continue now to

221
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.870
continue pursuing a thing or,
you know, co on stage

222
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:13.600
anyway, or, or take that
call anyway, like that's willpower,

223
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.600
like that's like real true
strength. You know, I really

224
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.790
appreciate that you pointed that
out. I had not thought

225
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:25.080
about that before that I
think I primitively had thought

226
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.720
of willpower as being strength
and that I was weak.

227
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.690
If I didn't have it,
let's flip the idea that

228
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.900
willpower is not strength. There's
not a direct access there.

229
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.800
And flip that on its
head. And think about your,

230
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.200
your book and your reported
O'Reilly empathy at work. If

231
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.290
willpower is not strength, does
that mean that empathy is

232
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:49.230
not weakness? I mean, I
feel that, and that's a

233
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.270
great question. I know I
get a lot of people

234
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.890
who sort of come up
to me and say like,

235
00:14:54.890 --> 00:15:01.010
well, like that touchy, feely
soft skill thing. Isn't really

236
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.350
all that important. And I
say, well, yeah. I mean,

237
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.930
well one, because like these
quote unquote soft skills, and

238
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:14.240
I absolutely despise that term.
Those are the only skills

239
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.920
that you are going to
consistently need throughout your career.

240
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.260
And then, you know, like
at, you know, your parents'

241
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.230
house or with your kids
or with your spouses or

242
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.530
with your friends, like these
are the things that sort

243
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:36.740
of like further relationships and,
you know, build scholar connections.

244
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.890
And so, you know, like
how can a thing, like,

245
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:46.130
it, it, him pithy, you
know, B equate it to

246
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.160
weakness when it's such a
powerful connector. And it helps

247
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.610
us to really like lay
the foundation for, you know,

248
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:09.470
pursuing, understanding other people's perspectives
and, and other people's opinions.

249
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.990
Like those things don't make
us weak and make us

250
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:24.890
header. They improve us as
people, they expand our minds

251
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.710
and all of those things
are going to help us,

252
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.720
you know, truly connect with
others. How can that possibly

253
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.950
be a weakness, Sick of
waiting for your CEI test

254
00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.750
to pass or having to
manage different CII servers for

built kite.com/hanselman. Is it something

265
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.760
that can be taught? We
take, we, we, my wife

266
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.290
and I are kind of
deep in the middle of

267
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.540
the tween years. My, I
have an 11 year old

268
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.360
and a 13 year old.
And you know, at this

269
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.280
moment in time, you know,
I love my kids, but

270
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.960
they're just jerks. Just, just
awful, awful little people, you

271
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.140
know, because they have zero
empathy of any kind. And

272
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.030
I'm, you know, in your
book, you actually call out

273
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.570
three types of empathy, emotional
empathy, cognitive empathy, and empathetic

274
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:52.020
concern. They effectively have none
of these things, except maybe

275
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.280
they can manipulate us using
empathy as like a tool.

276
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.340
What we're looking for them
to really have is primarily

277
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.780
cognitive empathy, which you say
is perspective taking. And unfortunately,

278
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.780
as you point out in
your report, that's the kind

279
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.420
of empathy it requires work
and, and little boys don't

280
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:18.320
like to work. Yeah, no,
I mean, the research shows

281
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.690
that like a lot of
these things that we're talking

282
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.310
about, you know, now, like
aren't just in parent and

283
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:30.680
if you think about it,
you know, like we're sort

284
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:37.220
of, of generically, like we
are protectors of, you know,

285
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:43.700
ourselves and our tribes. And
so then we are faced

286
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.770
with an outsider. We are
not like attempting to like,

287
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:54.800
understand them. It's almost like
a fight or flight sort

288
00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:01.280
of reaction. Right? And so
like, this is a skill

289
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:05.990
that, you know, the vast
majority of us that have

290
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.080
to squirt of learn as
we go. And we have

291
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.320
to sort of like take
the time to really cause

292
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.910
and to really think about,
you know, like where other

293
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.660
people are coming from and,
and fill in the gap,

294
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.420
fill in the gaps of
the things that we don't

295
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.910
know, or, or you just
kind of have to accept

296
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.450
like that. We don't have
all of the context and,

297
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.080
you know, have to assume
that other people are coming

298
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.230
from a good place. All
of those things are not

299
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:49.670
things that are in parents
in us. And so it

300
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:55.940
does require some trial and
error and a whole lot

301
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.120
of work on The, I
never really thought about the

302
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.650
idea that it isn't intuitive
to some folks because it

303
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:08.120
may be evolutionarily, not a
beneficial thing. Like it depends

304
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.430
on the world you live
in, if you are in

305
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.920
a cave and your focus
is the three people in

306
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.820
your space, then yeah. You
should be empathetic towards those

307
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.820
three people and everyone else's
an enemy, but in a,

308
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.330
in a connected global world,
it's actually quite useful to

309
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.910
do. And certainly when a
world of social media being

310
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.900
empathetic towards people is only
a good thing. Oh, for

311
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.460
sure. I mean, especially now
when we're, you know, constantly

312
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.150
bombarded with, you know, like
all kinds of news and

313
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.210
all kinds of contents and
all kinds of opinions, a

314
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.420
lot of those opinions, they're
just like, I don't agree

315
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.880
with that. How am I
supposed to, you know, like,

316
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.840
he'll like what these feelings,
I mean, I feel like

317
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.590
we've gotten to a point
where like, if we're confronted

318
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.210
that the person who liked
hasn't agreed with us on,

319
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.790
you know, like a few
obvious topics, then we just

320
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:12.070
don't want to talk to
them at all. And that

321
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:17.770
is the complete opposite of,
you know, trying to pursue

322
00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:23.170
understanding and like trying to
get perspective. We live in

323
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:29.200
a world that makes it
empathy incredibly typical. And so,

324
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.890
you know, like we have
to work quite a bit

325
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.570
harder in order to achieve
our goals of like truly

326
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:47.850
connecting with people. Especially if
we disagree with them, The

327
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.000
I'm hoping that the boys
are gonna learn empathy on

328
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.770
their own, but I'm going
to keep trying to explain

329
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.840
it to them. I don't
think having them read your

330
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.520
research papers is going to
work for an 11 year

331
00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.720
old, but I'm going to
do the PA. We may

332
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.150
assign this as homework. In
fact, I think that's a

333
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.490
great idea. I mean, why
not? You know, you might

334
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.980
as well get them started
young. I'm sure they would

335
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.760
love that. Well, you call
it out, right? It's learned

336
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.520
it's not, it's not innate,
like some empathy is built

337
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.610
into our brains, but the
most of it is how

338
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.590
we're learning that it's difficult
if you've been, if you've

339
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.600
had a tough life and
your life in life has

340
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.580
beaten you up, I'm sure
that would probably beat the

341
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.000
empathy out of you Or,
I mean, like it could

342
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.980
do the I'm entirely, you
know, opposite thing and, and

343
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:35.760
force you to be incredibly
empathetic. I mean, I know

344
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:41.580
people who stutter, who kind
of view fluent people as

345
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.210
like, wow, you know, like
your life is so easy.

346
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.700
How can you ever be
uncomfortable talking on the phone?

347
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.190
How can you ever be
uncomfortable getting up on stage?

348
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.920
And I'm like, you guys
hold on. Like these things

349
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.050
that we're doing like me,
every time I get on

350
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:59.400
stage, I'm not just concerned
about stuttering. You know, I'm

351
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.140
concerned about the content I
am delivering, right? Like, I

352
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.870
mean, every time like I
have to hop on like

353
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.170
a conference call, you know,
I'm, you know, of course

354
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:16.380
concerned about stuttering, but I'm
also concerned about, you know,

355
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.210
kitting across my point and
convincing clients that, you know,

356
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.980
like the thing that God
I want to do for

357
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.040
the company, you know, is
going to work for them.

358
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.520
And so, I mean, I
think it depends on, you

359
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.700
know, who that person is
either. They're going to be

360
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.440
like, wow, your life is
really easy and you don't

361
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.470
have any problems or it's
going to force them to

362
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.280
sort of take a step
and say like, Hey, like

363
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.760
I kind of understand, you
know, how you could feel

364
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.650
that, you know, like this
is an uncomfortable situation and,

365
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.060
you know, I can empathize
with that. Yeah. I think

366
00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.250
one of the important things
is that, and I always

367
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.520
encourage people to try to
avoid playing the oppression Olympics.

368
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:06.100
This is not a point
based system. That's a great

369
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.570
term. I'm going to use
it. Yeah. I mean, okay.

370
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.360
So like I have type
one diabetes. Okay. So what

371
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.450
you're right. I got all
this. Yeah, exactly. Well, you

372
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:20.260
know, but here's the thing,
right. But we are in

373
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.030
a, in a country that
can support us. We are

374
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.740
in a time that can
support us. I mean, you

375
00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.540
want to talk about who
would be a lousy caveman.

376
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.630
Right. I got it. I
got LASIK. I would be

377
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.300
the blind, diabetic eating lettuce
in the back of the

378
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:37.150
cave, you know, That's so
true. We're very lucky. And

379
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.250
I think that empathy is
also applying these things to

380
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.920
yourself. Like everybody's got something
and what a wonderful time

381
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.250
it is that we can,
we can all just survive

382
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.530
together. One thing that you,
you said there, I had

383
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.990
that heard that to him,
you called us the fluent.

384
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.210
I've called people. The normally
sugared or just the normals,

385
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.880
you know, someone at work
is like, can you eat

386
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.180
that cake? And it's just
like, Oh, you're normals. Yeah.

387
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.030
You can get off my
lawn. Exactly. I know that

388
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.410
there are people that, for
example, in the, in the

389
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.140
deaf and hard of hearing
community who have some kind

390
00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.100
of feeling about someone who
might get a cochlear implant,

391
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.180
are there things in the
stuttering community that can, I've

392
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.090
heard about hearing AIDS that
talk back into your ear?

393
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.030
Is there a push a
button and fix it option

394
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.160
and is that considered a
good thing or a bad

395
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.860
thing? Well, so I know
that there are the hearing

396
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.620
AIDS, and I know that
those, you know, do work

397
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.570
for some people. However, I've
heard that, like after a

398
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:46.540
certain time period, like they
stopped working. But other than

399
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.780
that, I haven't heard that
there's any cure for it.

400
00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.690
And I think that people
are like trying to find

401
00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.230
a cure. I was actually
seeing a therapist who said

402
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.350
that he helped, you know,
one of his clients cure

403
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:04.000
stuttering by like complete accident.
And he did it by

404
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:11.440
putting him on some sort
of like anti-anxiety pills. And

405
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.630
then the client was also
smoking a lot of pedicle

406
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:23.050
marijuana. And so that combination
actually cured stuttering for him.

407
00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:28.630
Now the therapist is like,
look, I don't suggest going

408
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.150
out and getting a lot
of weed and smoking it.

409
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.750
But I'm just saying, there's
a way that we could

410
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.620
help you stutter less. And
those are the side effects

411
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:43.830
though. I mean, who knows.
Yeah, exactly. Even now. But

412
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.010
I mean, I think that,
I think that the community

413
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:50.340
is kind of split. I
mean, so you have this

414
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:57.810
conference it's called the national
stuttering association conference and it's

415
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:04.380
every year around the 4th of July.
And so like a lot

416
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.570
of the people that stutter,
like they kind of come

417
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:10.260
from all over the world
to sort of just connect

418
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.560
and to go to different
art shops and hear talks

419
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.420
and you know, like all
of that stuff. And so

420
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.460
there are people there who
say like, I would take

421
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.530
a pill and then I
would have a go away.

422
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.810
And then there's a lot
of other people there who

423
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.990
are like, I would never
take a pill because stuttering

424
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.840
is the best thing that's
ever happened to me. Now

425
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.570
I'm a person who could
probably say that this is

426
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.360
the best thing that's ever
happened to me. But if

427
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.740
I could take a pill
to maybe like, not stutter,

428
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.790
like 98% of the time,
I would consider taking that

429
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.830
pill. I mean, I just
think it makes my life

430
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:52.860
day to day, life way
easier. However, I mean, I

431
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.520
kind of like, can't imagine
me personally, like my life

432
00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.750
about stuttering. I mean, I
don't know where I would

433
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:05.340
be. So it depends on
who you talk to. Some

434
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.110
people are like, I'm going
to start it for life.

435
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.720
And others are like, just
give me the pill, give

436
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.560
me the pill. We, we
always talk about this in

437
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.780
the diabetes community. Like if
they cure me tomorrow, I

438
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.940
would still be pricking my
fingers and checking my blood

439
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.080
sugar because I would not
believe it was true. So

440
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.870
I would be diabetic at
heart. I would eat cookies.

441
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:29.540
And then I would just
check my blood sugar and

442
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.460
be like, that's amazing. Let,
let you, it's been perfect

443
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.900
for like all this time.
So w w you have

444
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.270
a company called communal log
and you do basically empathy

445
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.870
can such an empathy consultancy.
Are you giving workshops and

446
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.240
traveling around to, to companies,
people can hire you to

447
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.990
talk about these things. Yeah.
Yeah. So I began as

448
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.940
a speaker. And so, you
know, I was talking about,

449
00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:59.660
you know, improving communication with
empathy, and then it kind

450
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:04.760
of just shifted into like
going into companies and working

451
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:11.690
with either their teams or,
or doing like breakouts at

452
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:16.340
their like internal company events,
like where we sort of

453
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:24.980
had these discussions around, like
how to engage empathy at

454
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:30.410
work in an impactful way.
And so I work with

455
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:35.600
companies on sort of improving
communication collaboration, you know, through

456
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:42.400
oppor, rationalizing empathy on their
teams and in their apartments

457
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:49.900
and in their organizations as
a whole. And so the

458
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.400
breakouts I do are between
us 60 minutes and three

459
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.120
hours. And so we try
to get a lot done.

460
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.970
And I think that the
thing that I've learned the

461
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.310
most, I mean, so I
am coming from like a,

462
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:08.230
a speaker keynote sort of
background. And so, you know,

463
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:12.580
I only have like 30
minutes, 45 minutes had liked

464
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:18.640
doing these workshops. You know,
I didn't realize just how

465
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.930
has separately people and, you
know, companies and in the

466
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:29.920
corporate space are just tying
to like, have conversations around

467
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:36.730
it, empathy and insecurities and
vulnerability. I mean, you know,

468
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:42.220
your employees want to talk
about these things. And so

469
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.910
I'm the person that companies
bring in to sort of

470
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:53.880
create the space to have
those conversations. The thing that

471
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.130
I thought was the most
powerful, or kind of surprising

472
00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.530
about what you just said
was you said opera up,

473
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.420
it's hard to say for
anybody to give me No.

474
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.160
If I made that word
up or It's pretty awesome

475
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.390
operationalizing empathy, because you're not
just coming in and saying,

476
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.050
Hey, let's talk about squishy
things. You're saying let's optimize

477
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:17.220
business outcomes. And like being
pleasant and facilitating conversations around

478
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.450
empathy, it can actually help
your business. Shocker, shocker. I

479
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:26.190
know, right. A lot of
people like don't believe in

480
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.080
it are just like, well,
how is this going to

481
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.810
help my business? Well, do
you want your teams to

482
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.500
collaborate more? He wants your
teams to be more productive

483
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:40.950
while they're not going to
be highly collaborative or productive

484
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:45.600
if they don't get along
well. Or even if they

485
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.140
like completely can't stand each
other, like they have to

486
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.700
respect each other. And it,
empathy, you know, is going

487
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.520
to increase all of those
things. And it's just going

488
00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.140
to help collaboration, communication, all
of those good things. It's

489
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.620
just going to help it
just go much smoother. Have

490
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.110
you ever come into a
company and presented this information

491
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.730
to them? And they just
sit there with their arms

492
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.380
crossed and then just storm
out at the end. And

493
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.550
they're like, yeah. Okay. I
just did this workshop. So

494
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:17.220
it actually happened one time
and it wasn't at a

495
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.560
company. It was at a
conference. And so I have

496
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.090
to give you just like
a little bit of background

497
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.640
on this. So it was
the first time I had

498
00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.640
given any sort of content
like this. It was all

499
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:32.970
day and it was in
Stonier. So every possible carrier

500
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.160
I could have to succeeding.
I had it. And long

501
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.730
story short here did not
go well at all. And

502
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.800
I remember calling one of
my other consultant, friends and

503
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.800
being like, I can't do
this. Like, I'm not good

504
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.320
at this. I'm just going
to stick to keynotes. And

505
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.190
she was like, okay, look,
calm down. Like, let's talk

506
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.360
about like who you are,
like, what you bring to

507
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.280
the table and kinda like
what you, who well, and

508
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.280
it turns out, you know,
all of the answers to

509
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.020
those questions are all of
the things that I did

510
00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.630
not do when I was
giving this like full day

511
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.730
workshop to a culture that's
completely different from mine. And

512
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.130
so, yeah. I mean, like
after that first time of,

513
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:26.660
you know, learning like, look
like I'm not going to,

514
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.930
you know, tell you anything
that like, you don't already

515
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:34.460
know, all right. Like I
am here to, you know,

516
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.060
create the space for conversations.
I'm not here to teach

517
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:41.210
you anything. Like, I want
you guys to be able

518
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:44.690
to solve your own problems.
I'm not the problem solver.

519
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:48.680
I'm just the vehicle. And
so after I got that

520
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.310
down, yeah, kinda, it was
fine. It was great actually.

521
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.010
But that first time, man,
let me tell you that

522
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:58.370
was, that was rough. It
was a rough day and

523
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:01.030
couple of weeks after That,
actually that actually hits me

524
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.920
pretty hard cause I'm supposed
to be in Estonia next

525
00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.080
week. So now I'm going
to have to get some

526
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.170
real, No, it'll be fine.
You'll be fine. It was

527
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:12.940
just me. I was just
wholly unprepared for every single

528
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:16.390
thing that I was walking
into. I think it's really

529
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:19.150
cool that you are conscious
of that because stoning is

530
00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.240
great. And your empathy now
has to go two ways

531
00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.760
because you have to put
yourself in their heads and,

532
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.370
and you probably learned a
lot and you're a better

533
00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:33.610
speaker for Oh, absolutely. 1000%.
Well, thank you so much,

534
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.880

536
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:45.190

and I'm so happy. I

537
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.760
was finally able to get
to talk to you online

538
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.550
and not just talk to
you through words on a

539
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.690
page. Fantastic. Thanks so much.
I'll make sure to put

541
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.590
