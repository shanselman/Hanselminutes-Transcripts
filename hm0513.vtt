<inaudible> From Hanselman it's dot
com. It's Hanselman. It's a

9
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.420
weekly discussion with web developer
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This

10
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.730
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number
517. In this episode, Scott

11
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.000
talks with captain Brent Chapman
who works for the new

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.780
defense innovation unit experimental at
Moffett field, California. Hi, So

13
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.840
Scott Hanselman, this is another
episode of Hansel minutes today.

14
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.500
I'm talking with captain Brent
Chapman and you were a

15
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.900
research scientist at the army
cyber Institute, but now you've

16
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.120
just moved. I'm talking to
you from your new location.

17
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.660
That's right. I'm now in
a Moffett field, California at

18
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.710
the new defense innovation unit
experimental. That's very exciting. Congratulations.

19
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.740
Thank you. So it sounds
like the army is getting

20
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.380
into a, to cyber things.
You were at the army

21
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.510
cyber Institute. I didn't know
we had one of those.

22
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.750
We did a fairly new
organization, only a few years

23
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.990
old, and it sort of
follows the same timeline as

24
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.910
the new, the Army's new
as a branch, which is

25
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.270
the cyber warfare branch. So
after about 17 years or

26
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.780
so, army finally decided to
create a new branch specifically

27
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.700
focused on generating effects and
conducting operations in cyberspace. That's

28
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.380
very cool. I want to,
I want to dig into

29
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.360
that. I want to find
out about how that along

30
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.010
is as well as your
journey to be a maker,

31
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.190
but let's, let's back up
because I went over to

32
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.430
your, your website, your own
personal website, which is@brentmoorelabs.com. And

33
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.790
it's just a great site
with blog posts and projects

34
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.490
and YouTube videos and stuff
that you've done at maker

35
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.170
fair and all these kinds
of things. It sounds like

36
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.260
you've been tinkering since day
one. I haven't, yeah, it's

37
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.460
sort of my, my number
one hobby taking things apart,

38
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.700
sometimes putting them back together,
but really it's all about

39
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.240
sort of creation with tech
and with building a sort

40
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.240
of a, a way to
express myself sort of artistically

41
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.670
to where did you, when
did you start? Were you

42
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.760
taking things apart as a
toddler? Oh yeah. So my

43
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.220
I'd say it goes back
as you know, when I

44
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.770
first moved to the States,
my family and I immigrated

45
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.350
to the U S when
I was four from South

46
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.460
America, a little small, a
small country called Guyana, and

47
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.730
we moved to the New York
city. And I remember seeing

48
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.440
my first piece in technology.
In fact, it was, it

49
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.570
was a radio and just
thinking like, wow, this is,

50
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.820
this is magic. You know,
it sort of blew my

51
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.970
mind and, you know, so
I thought then, so the

52
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.770
next step for me was
like, well, how, how does

53
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.380
it work? I want to
get into this thing. So

54
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.810
I grabbed my, my dad
was a carpenter, right? So

55
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.640
he had his whole suite
of tools and sure enough,

56
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.410
I made my way over
to that toolbox and grabbed

57
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.390
the screwdriver. And that's how
it was, how it all

58
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.720
began. How do you, what
do you think people do

59
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.910
that? Like, why are there
people who want to take

60
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.880
the toaster apart and other
people just accept that the

61
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.700
toaster makes toast? I don't
know. It's a, it's a,

62
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.590
some that I kind of
think about to this very

63
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.600
day, especially as it relates
to my work, you know,

64
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.080
I, we have a lot
of products that are presented

65
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.770
to us with a set
of capabilities. And sometimes, you

66
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.260
know, we want to do
something just slightly different than

67
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.340
what it's built to do
or marketed to do, but

68
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.380
so it's kind of frustrating
to know that all you're

69
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.240
so close, but, you know,
if I can only tweak

70
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.890
this one thing or add
this one thing, you know,

71
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.960
it'd be, this would be
a perfect thing. And so

72
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.900
for me, that's a huge
motivation. And I think that

73
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.510
certainly I wasn't thinking about
that when I was four,

74
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.540
but it's sort of evolved
and matured into that to

75
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.690
this day. So I like
to see possibilities rather than

76
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.060
the products, you know, I
like to, to see what

77
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.070
else a cell phone is
capable of doing. You know,

78
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.570
it can, it can be
a remote, it can be

79
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.240
a flashlight. You know, we
only know we know all

80
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.520
these things, but taking that
mindset to almost everything on

81
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.330
a daily basis. For me,
it's kind of exciting When

82
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.760
we're trying to encourage people
to be makers and try

83
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.930
to encourage people to explore
how important is it to

84
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.170
teach people that mindset of,
you know, go and think

85
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.450
about systems and go and
think about opening up, you

86
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.430
know, things that you already
have and take apart stuff.

87
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.990
Don't be afraid of it.
How important is it that

88
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.430
we instill that into Tinder,
beginners and makers? I think

89
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.320
it's critical. And I talked
to some of my friends

90
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.490
and who, you know, who
have, they can remember back

91
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.330
to their granddad who loved
getting his hands dirty and

92
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.880
fixing something, whatever it was,
whether it was a car

93
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.640
or some type of electronics.
And he, that granted sort

94
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.550
of always knew, you know,
how things worked or his

95
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.200
first step when something was
broken was to sort of

96
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.120
just get in there. And,
you know, but when I

97
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.940
talked to my friend in
this case, it's, it's, well,

98
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.770
why don't you do this
since they're sort of afraid,

99
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.820
they're sort of, they've been
growing up with products with

100
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.170
planned obsolescence, you know, products
that are, that intimidate them.

101
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.020
And so they've sort of
lost that spirit of getting

102
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.050
into things and trying to,
to fix it first. Now

103
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.790
it's more, if something doesn't
work, you just sort of

104
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.130
get rid of it. And
it a new thing. And

105
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.220
for me, it's critical when
I educate or when I,

106
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.470
you know, I do my
daily duties as a cyber

107
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.200
warfare officer, I think it's
critical to sort of get

108
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.430
back to that and understand
how systems work, knowing what

109
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.260
you can do, knowing what
rules you can bend, what

110
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.680
rules you can break in
order to win over around

111
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.260
the system. And to be
more efficient about the way

112
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.230
we go about things. You
said that your, your dad

113
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.150
was a carpenter and you
were doing this from age

114
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.490
four and you were using
his tools. I can assume

115
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.750
that they encouraged you in
this, in this direction. Not

116
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.470
so much. I was actually
kind of, I was like,

117
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.510
my brother absolutely hated me
because whenever he got a

118
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.760
new toy, he sort of
knew what that really meant

119
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.430
that I got an, I
got a new experiment yeah.

120
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.000
Later that night. So, yeah.
And that's not really that

121
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.480
strange, you know, in, in,
in popular culture, like the

122
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.700
maker or the hacker, you
know, if you look at

123
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.230
it from the computer security
point of view was sort

124
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.120
of villainized forever from, and
it's really only until fairly

125
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.160
recently that it's now sort
of become the cool thing

126
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.070
with, you know, you could
see the evidence in popular

127
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.020
culture with shows like mr.
Robot, where it's not like

128
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.630
the cool thing to be
the one who knows how

129
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.750
systems work and how to
bend these rules. So growing

130
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.130
up, it was kind of
the same thing with me.

131
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.070
I was, I was sort
of the, not the wild

132
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.920
kid, but just like the,
I was destructive rather than

133
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.280
curious just how they saw
it. Yeah. I struggled with

134
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.230
that a little bit. You
know, every generation has their

135
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.780
idea of what a hacker
is, but like, I was

136
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.060
more of a phone person,
right. Remember phone freaking and

137
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.580
things like that. 2,600 figure
out. Yeah. I'm trying to

138
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.550
figure out what, you know,
what those tones meant. And

139
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.500
when someone came and poked
around on the phone system,

140
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.570
they would plug their wires
in and start sending tones

141
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.880
down and you realize you
get free long distance. Oh

142
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.530
yeah. Someone told me I
wasn't voted most likely to

143
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.640
be convicted of a white
collar crime. Oh yeah. Not,

144
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.870
not, not the kind of
thing you want to be

145
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.420
thought of at school. You
know, I, I look back

146
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.550
to my, like my teenage
days and I was certainly,

147
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.590
you know, I was, I
was in the gray space

148
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.850
if you will. Right. I
think I have a tone

149
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.830
for that. I've, I've done
my service now and I'm

150
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.030
all good. But you know,
that, that curiosity, you know,

151
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.070
at the time as a
teenager, you know, you certainly

152
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.950
don't fully grasp the legalities
and policy policy wise, what

153
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.810
you should and shouldn't be
doing on, on other people's

154
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.710
networks. But, you know, I
was curious and I wanted

155
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.950
to see how far I
could push things before they

156
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.380
sort of blew up in
my face. I I've definitely

157
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.810
toned it down and matured
quite a bit now, but

158
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.230
I think still that spirit
is so important in getting

159
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.990
that across the kids, that
it's okay to experiment within

160
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.170
reason, you know, to, to
want it, to be curious,

161
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.380
to find out how things
work. And sometimes that involves

162
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.210
taking things apart And exploring
boundaries, which, which actually brings

163
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.520
me to kind of an
interesting, if not a little

164
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.950
bit a complicated question, I
hope you don't mind if

165
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.590
you were, if you're a
security person, if you are

166
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.390
a maker, if you're an
Explorer, you're going to push

167
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.150
boundaries, but I don't think
of the army or the

168
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.090
military as being a boundary
pushing place. Is it hard

169
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.740
to, to balance those two
aspects of your personality? It

170
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.530
is, you know, and I,
I aim to strike a

171
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.660
nice balance on a daily
basis. You know, the military,

172
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.490
as you could imagine, is
built and has been successful,

173
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.020
especially, you know, the U
S military has been very

174
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.220
successful in working at scale
and being very efficient at

175
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.670
scale because of the rules
and the policies and procedures

176
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.830
in place. So something like
making or hacking, or even

177
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.280
cyber operations, you know, there
are some skills or some

178
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.910
mindsets that are fundamentally at
odds with that traditional military

179
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.940
mindset. And so there's friction
on almost a daily basis.

180
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.180
If you design a system,
for example, a military system,

181
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.830
you can expect it to
be lots and lots of

182
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.950
rules, but if you're conducting
cyber operations, even, you know,

183
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.810
in defense, you may need
to bend those rules in

184
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.070
order to come up with
an optimal outcome. And with

185
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.750
those two things at odds,
you can see how it's

186
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.380
very sort of can be
frustrating at times, because you

187
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.430
want to be good. You
want to be good at

188
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.860
what you do, and you
want to have fun and

189
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.170
to keep people safe, but
sometimes we get in our

190
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.460
own way from the military
point of view. Yeah, definitely.

191
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.560
It seems like the mindset
for being a good hacker

192
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.870
is different from perhaps being
a good soldier, but finding

193
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.270
that balance is what, what
you, what you're trying to

194
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.650
accomplish right now. That's right.
Yeah. And so when you

195
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.020
think about making and stuff
and doing work, I know

196
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.120
that you did work with
a maker fair and you

197
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.030
published lots of maker projects
on your, on your blog

198
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.550
and on your site. Is
that something that you can

199
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.980
do on the side? You
just tell the bosses at

200
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.930
the army, like, Hey, I'm
going to go to speak

201
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.360
at maker con this year.
How does that work? Yeah,

202
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.140
I think there's been a
really, I've been fortunate in

203
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.900
that my last job at
the U S military Academy

204
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.200
at West point in the
army cyber Institute and here

205
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.170
at the defense innovation unit
experimental, you know, my, my

206
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.950
bosses see this as a
great thing because our, you

207
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.880
know, their goal in both
organizations was outreach, finding out

208
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.390
ways to get the DOD,
specifically the army, you know,

209
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.520
back to the cutting edge
where we used to be.

210
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.410
And we sort of lost
that loss and lost that

211
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:39.620
edge over the many decades
of conflict of incredible influenced

212
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.420
by the defense industrial base.
You know, you can, you

213
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.370
can sort of think of
the large defense contractors and

214
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.530
defense companies. And if you
want to, we want to

215
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.380
get back to a better
relationship, a more productive relationship

216
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.680
with, with the public. So
when they see that I'm

217
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.350
willing and I, I have
the interest and I'm willing

218
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.160
to on a weekend or
over the summer, or what

219
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.290
have you go to the
maker fairs and the maker

220
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.130
cons go down to visit
ADA fruit, New York, for example,

221
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.280
CDs, makerspaces see that who
the Titans are and want

222
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.710
to create these relationships and
strengthen these relationships. I think

223
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.720
that's a great thing. So
I'm going to keep doing

224
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.720
it while as long as
they let me. Yeah. I

225
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.640
saw it on your, on
your blog that you got

226
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.280
some pretty, pretty sweet invites.
Not only did you go

227
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.960
to like the eight of
fruit, but you also saw

228
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.260
a tour of the MIT
media lab. I didn't. And

229
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.020
in fact that was a,
I was actually going as

230
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.540
a prospective student for that
visit. So that was kind

231
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.480
of neat. Yeah, it's immediate.
That was one of the

232
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.340
few places as you, as
you know, in the country

233
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.180
where it's, you have this
really nice mix of tech

234
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.440
and arts and math and
engineering, but, and, you know,

235
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.510
they've had quite a history
and I mean, they've been

236
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.870
doing it very successfully for
a long time. So you're

237
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.150
able to balance all of
this. You're doing work, you're

238
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:55.840
doing your job. You are
fairly recent, a master's degree,

239
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.120
graduate from Carnegie Mellon. If
I don't quite understand it

240
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.760
correctly, how are you managing
all of this at the

241
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.710
same time? I know that
I've just, it's all I

242
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.450
can do to do a
podcast, to have a full

243
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.110
time job and get the
occasional Arduino project done. How

244
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.120
are you managing all of
this 26 hours a day?

245
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.210
Yeah. Well, I think the
key is that I love

246
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.940
everything that I do. Right.
I love my job. I

247
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.750
love what I do. I'm
in the military. I love

248
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.820
what I do in my
garage or my basement. Right.

249
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.780
I love learning. And so
it all is not really

250
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.700
work for me, you know,
I don't, I don't really,

251
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.170
haven't worked a day in
my life. Right. So, and

252
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.890
so I'm, I'm fortunate that
way. I know a lot

253
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.990
of folks really don't have
that luxury, but it's, it's

254
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.530
worked out for me so
far. So thinking about some

255
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.560
of the tools that you're
using, you know, I, I

256
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.880
was talking to someone recently
who was working on a,

257
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.800
a movie or a TV
show and they're, you know,

258
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.350
doing techie type stuff. And
we joke sometimes as techies

259
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.890
about how uncomfortable the dialogue
is in, in, in TV

260
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.070
shows, except for, of course,
mr. Robot that you pointed

261
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.380
out is one of the
great shining examples of tech

262
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.000
done right on TV. And
someone used the term military

263
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.790
grade, which makes me always
think about like that rugged

264
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.010
Panasonic tough book. You know
what I mean? When I

265
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.750
think about, yeah, you're right.
But I realized that in

266
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.360
the last five to 10
years, like Arduinos and raspberry

267
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.020
pies and these small tiny
devices kind of came up,

268
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.200
is that something that was,
was around, did we have

269
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.920
these miniaturized full spec computers
before, or, and has that

270
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.720
changed as some of the
army is aware of, is

271
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.920
the military realizing that computers
can be hidden under someone's

272
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.190
tongue? Yeah. You know, it's,
it's, it's interesting. You have

273
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.130
a, you know, so these
are, this has been a

274
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.380
fairly recent phenomenon, these sort
of microcomputers and microcontrollers at

275
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.130
the price point, right. I
mean, they've been around for

276
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.540
a while, but just primitively
expensive. And the military certainly

277
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.580
aware of these, but it's,
you've got to think about

278
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.820
it from the military acquisition
process is something that is,

279
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.410
you know, I don't wish
upon my worst enemy having

280
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.600
to go through a, you
know, we look at a

281
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.320
piece of X, so whether
it's a tank or a,

282
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.080
a fighter jet or helicopter
or computer, and we say,

283
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.660
well, we need, we need
this thing to do these

284
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.810
a number of tasks. And
so we spent some time

285
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.090
making this list of tasks
that this device is supposed

286
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.710
to do, right? A tank
is supposed to be able

287
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.970
to withstand so many rounds
or this type of concussion

288
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.050
right. Of force. And so
we spent some time writing

289
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.000
these tasks and what we
want this tank to look

290
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.830
like. And it takes a
lot of time. Then we

291
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.510
have to, you know, bid
it out and get someone

292
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.970
to build it. And these
things take years, and years

293
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.910
and years, military is trying
to apply that same sort

294
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:37.470
of scheduling and construct to
technology, you know, like sort

295
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.290
of lower-end technology thinking about
to computers, the desktop computers

296
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.980
to microprocessors making controllers. And
it just doesn't work because

297
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.650
in the same eight years,
and it takes you to,

298
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.560
as you would a tank
in terms of setting everything

299
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.100
up, you know, and that
same eight years, this is

300
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.060
Moore's law comes into effect
several times over. And that

301
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.490
in device that you initially
sort of made the list

302
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.750
of, of competencies and bid
out for and wrote this

303
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.810
contract for is now obsolete
several times over. So we've

304
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.790
got to, as a DOD,
come up with an alternative

305
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.610
to an ex you know,
something that works well for,

306
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.250
for certain types of acquisitions,
but we need to come

307
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.580
up with an alternative specifically
focused on this tech. So

308
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.760
we're aware that it's out
there, but we have to

309
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.310
fix the system on how
we actually acquire it for

310
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:31.210
use in the DOD. Hey
folks, I wanted to take

311
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.970
a moment to tell you
about Reagan and their new

312
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.240
product called pulse. Reagan is
an error and crash reporting

313
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.170
software provider and their new
product pulse. It's a realtime

314
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.500
user monitoring product. It gives
you performance data and user

315
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.670
insights. Lets you understand exactly
what's happening when users interact

316
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.360
with your software. So you're
never left guessing. Reagan provides

317
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.820
you with the answers to
your performance questions and they've

318
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.930
found over 10 billion that's billion
with a B bugs and

319
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.320
customer apps with their crash

You're talking to someone from,

326
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.780
from NASA recently And they
were also talking about the

327
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.050
idea of reliability versus, Hey,
this is fun and cool

328
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.780
and exciting. And you know,
there's not a raspberry PI

329
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.470
sitting on a Mars Lander
robot because not only is

330
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.870
it there's the acquisition that
takes years, but also that

331
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.360
we don't know if that's
a reliable thing. We do

332
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.460
know that we do know
a 46 is an extremely

333
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.040
reliable thing. So that's why
four 86 processors go to

334
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.930
space. Yeah. I mean, don't
get me wrong. It's a,

335
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.180
their reasons. And there are
great upsides as to why

336
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.560
we have this rugged, this
rigid process. Rather than that,

337
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.180
that's perhaps a good thing
about the bureaucracy. We're guaranteed

338
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.880
that the thing or we're,
we're, we're confident that the

339
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.220
device is going to perform
as described to us. But

340
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.050
you know, I think there,
you know, that works, but

341
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.450
what if, you know, at
the, at the price points

342
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.070
where some of these devices,
maybe you don't need it

343
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.810
to work a hundred percent
of the time and maybe

344
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.000
we shouldn't aim for a
hundred percent to be the

345
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.540
standard, perhaps as 80% solution
will work, if it's cheap

346
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.100
enough, right. We talk about
obsolescence and devices. If this

347
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.280
device that does this cool
thing works 80% of the

348
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.110
time, but it costs me
a hundred dollars to acquire.

349
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.760
Well, then I'll just acquire
10 of them. Instead of

350
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.030
buying the top a thousand
dollars device, that'll take way

351
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.770
longer to acquire. So that's
acquisition when it comes to

352
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.530
like official, you know, army
type stuff. But I understand

353
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.560
that you're also trying to
encourage the creation of makerspaces

354
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.600
on post are makerspaces, something
That people who maybe aren't

355
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.060
doing the job that you're
doing, like just kind of

356
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.070
regular rank and file army
people could come and get

357
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.300
involved in and learn about
making as well. So I'm,

358
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.510
I'm really excited about this
initiative and this is, you

359
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.660
know, perhaps this Makerspace will
be on posts, perhaps it

360
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.670
will be just off post,
you know, in the community

361
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.870
because after all, we're trying
to help form better relationships

362
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.390
between the military and the
public. So perhaps being off

363
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.250
post might be a better
option just for folks to

364
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.470
get visibility on service members
and sort of see that

365
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.930
service members are people too,
when our makers too, you

366
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.210
know, that's kind of fun
and on and on the

367
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.330
converse, you have, you know,
service members, folks in the

368
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.760
army, for example, learning from
the community. Cause we have

369
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.700
a lot of talented engineers
and educators and students out

370
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.730
there in the community that
don't get the chance to

371
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.640
interface as much as we'd
like. And we also think

372
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.460
it's pretty important to, to
look at these makerspaces as

373
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.950
perhaps a, you know, we
have, you know, we have

374
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.860
engineers and technicians in the
army, but we have some

375
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.920
infantryman, right. That are really
technically talented and just didn't

376
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.250
know it, that they're also
they're makers and they're working

377
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.050
on their cars and you
know what they're making in

378
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.450
their free time. They just
don't call themselves that. So

379
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.730
perhaps this maker space is
a way to identify them

380
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.390
from an already existing, talented
pool of, of soldiers and

381
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.930
individuals that, you know, these
folks are out there and

382
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.730
this can help highlight some
of those skills that make

383
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.210
them proud of it. No,
that's really interesting that that

384
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.910
term maker there's been a
lot of discussion about that.

385
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.700
And there was interestingly, a
medium blog post a couple

386
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.580
of days ago where an
individual basically thought that was

387
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.700
a bad name, that the
term maker put too much

388
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.120
emphasis on, on creators. Like
we all have to go

389
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.060
out and create and be
unique snowflakes and stuff, and

390
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.910
sometimes just tearing things apart
and plugging them in differently

391
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.520
and putting them back together
again is, you know, has

392
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.920
value as well or being
a really good consumer of

393
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.440
something. Do you, do you
think that this term maker

394
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.190
is being overused and that
there's a negative connotation to

395
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.800
it? Is it exclusionary? I
dunno, I, this, of course

396
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.790
this might be quite biased,
but I think that I

397
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.180
see nothing but good things
in the term maker. It's,

398
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.670
I'm seeing it more and
more certainly, you know, between

399
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.820
all the various events from
maker media and the publications

400
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.540
and those types of things.
So I'm seeing, unfortunately I'm

401
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.930
seeing a very positive light
on the term maker. Yeah.

402
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.410
So yeah, I tend to
think so as well. I

403
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.490
don't, I mean, I realize
that not everyone can be

404
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.210
a, a creator and I
think sometimes people may ascribe

405
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.570
the sense of consumerism. And
you know, when I say

406
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.030
maker, I think about solving
problems less than I think

407
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.760
about creating products to sell.
You know what I mean?

408
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.400
Yeah. You're making, you're making
products and you're also making

409
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.520
solutions, which are of course
less, less tangible. You know,

410
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.180
ideas are hard to get
our minds around in terms

411
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.470
of when you're creating something
physical, it's you have much

412
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.450
more visceral reaction, right? Because
of course you can handle

413
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.100
it and touch it and
things like that. But through

414
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.980
sometimes just creating a process,
making a new process is

415
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.310
almost as valuable, Right. I
really liked the idea and

416
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.340
I'm hoping that my will
have the same sense of

417
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.360
the, and also my partners,
Tiran, who I'm working with

418
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.140
on with this marches for
makers.com all the month of

419
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.290
March is the idea that
that making something or being

420
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.450
able to make something is
a sense of power and

421
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.560
empowerment. And I think that
it would give young people

422
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.190
and people in general, for
lack of a better word,

423
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.680
you know, a straighter back,
you walk more tall when

424
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.190
you know how to do
things, you know, like woodworking

425
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.380
is just so visceral. And
so you have such a

426
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.510
sense of accomplishment and I
feel the same way, whether

427
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.300
it be soldering or whatever,
you know, and we should

428
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.350
all have that feeling of
power. I agree. I think

429
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.420
it's a, you know, one
thing I don't, I didn't

430
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.460
like as an educator, I
didn't like seeing in my

431
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.430
classrooms where, you know, the
sort of the, the techie

432
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.390
students sort of revered for
his prowess on whether it's

433
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.580
a computer or a phone
or, you know, whatever technical

434
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.360
thing, you know, as in
I'm a technologist at heart.

435
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.800
But I still thought that
was kind of a negative

436
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.160
thing. I wanted my, my
English majors in my history

437
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.500
majors to be just as
involved and just as excited

438
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.860
about the possibilities of these
wonderful technical tools as this

439
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.600
computer scientist was. Right. Exactly.
Imagine what we would feel

440
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.850
like if we were talking
about being literate reading, and

441
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.210
we, if someone was a
naturally good reader, we would

442
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.910
Revere them and make the
other kids feel lousy about

443
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.580
not reading. And then eventually
the kids would just give

444
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.460
up and stop reading altogether.
I feel the same thing

445
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.310
happens with, with, you know,
quote unquote, computer people or

446
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.770
techies, or you, you get
self identified as a techie

447
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.300
and there may be cultural
reasons, economic reasons. There could

448
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.520
be any number of demographic
reasons that may cause you

449
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.310
to either be identified or
not identified as not being

450
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.640
a techie. If we did
the same thing to numeracy

451
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.980
or literacy, I think we
would be up in arms,

452
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.900
we'd say this is unacceptable,
but we seem to think

453
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.750
it's okay for computer people
to do this. Yeah, I

454
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.030
think, I think it's improving
though. We're getting to the

455
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.910
point where we're realizing as
a nation, as a society

456
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.230
that, you know, computers and
cyber and cyber security, aren't

457
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.270
really technical issues. You know,
there are human issues that

458
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.600
are, and then the computers
and our connectivity or the

459
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.210
tools behind it. So I
like looking at a lot

460
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.940
of these things that I
talk about, especially in security

461
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.770
from sort of the human
lens. I mean, we can,

462
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.710
we have all these whizzbang
products and the latest and

463
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.380
greatest firewalls, but at the
end of the day, you

464
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.420
know, these are humans using
it. These are humans making

465
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:17.220
mistakes. And sometimes we're looking
to exploit these mistakes to

466
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.860
our advantage, right? And we're
looking to prevent that from

467
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.590
the defensive point of view.
So if we can learn

468
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:27.390
to appreciate our technical world,
our technically saturated world from

469
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:28.950
more of a human lens,
I think we will be

470
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.790
better off One of the
shows that I did recently,

471
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.480
that it got a lot
of people thinking where a

472
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.000
woman named Keisha Rogers said
that we should stop teaching

473
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.940
kids, how to code and
start teaching kids how to

474
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.530
think about systems and how
systems fit together. And that

475
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.280
systems level thinking is something
that was being completely deemphasized

476
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.710
as we run around frantically
trying to get kids to

477
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.440
learn Python or for what
do you think about that?

478
00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.520
I think she's got it.
The, our world is obviously

479
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.480
becoming much more interconnected, you
know, on a day by

480
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.420
day basis. We have, you
know, the internet of things

481
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.500
has been the buzzword for
a while. Our computers, phones,

482
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.430
fridges, toasters, you know, in
a connected. And you know,

483
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.550
if you told me this
10 years ago, I would

484
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.820
have said, well, that's ridiculous.
Well, imagine, imagine what the

485
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.470
world will look like in
10 years from now, you

486
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.940
know, there, there are things
that will be out there

487
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.040
that we can't even wrap
our heads around right now.

488
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.800
But you look when you
sort of take a step

489
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.360
back, you realize that these
are all systems. These are

490
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.030
all many times unique systems
that have their own set

491
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.550
of rules. And we're finding
really true, really clever ways

492
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.880
of putting them all together
for hopefully to, to make

493
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.570
things easier for us. And
so if we can take

494
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.160
it from that point of
view, understanding that these are

495
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.760
system of systems of systems
and seeing what lessons we

496
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.330
can learn from that relationship
and that interconnectedness. And I

497
00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.430
think that's the way to
go, rather than thinking about

498
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.740
it strictly from a low
sort of low level technical

499
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.140
point of view, understanding what
they are in terms of

500
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.830
systems. It's an awesome thing.
I feel like, like layers

501
00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.220
of abstraction are getting, so
the layer is so opaque

502
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.280
now that people just take
certain aspects of technology as

503
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.950
just being Yeah. You know,
it's one of the, one

504
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.890
of the downsides of, of
the wonderful products that we

505
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:12.310
get from the major companies,
tech companies is that yeah,

506
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.800
they make our lives easier,
but it's, it's, we're almost

507
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.680
becoming numb to how incredible
this technology really is and

508
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.680
how much effort goes on
behind it. These things just

509
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.950
work now when I was
growing up computers and just

510
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.570
work, and they're always, there
was always some aspect you

511
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:32.770
had to troubleshoot. And in
that troubleshooting process, you were

512
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.380
going to learn something for
sure. Now things just work.

513
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.420
And if they don't work
it's well, let me just

514
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.370
go around and get another,
or let me restart it

515
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.710
or something. And there's no,
there's not much learning going

516
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.590
on. So if we, if
we could force ourselves to

517
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.480
think about what's going on
behind the, under the hood

518
00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.060
force, our students to do
the same and they will

519
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.290
be much better postured for
understanding from a security point

520
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.730
of view, why these things
fail and what we can

521
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:56.860
do about it. And just
from a usability point of

522
00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.780
view, you know, sort of
get a better appreciation of

523
00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.620
these products. Yeah. I think
that's very, very true. Just

524
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.440
last week I had a
guy, I had a knife,

525
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:10.540
a new iPhone, and every
five minutes like clockwork, it

526
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.180
would drop a phone call.
And I put up with

527
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:18.910
that for a week. Not
because of any poorly placed

528
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.640
loyalty towards Apple, but because
I really wanted to know

529
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.850
why, you know, is it,
is there a loose wire?

530
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.730
Is it a, is it
a antenna issue? And I

531
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.500
actually spent a lot of
time at the Apple store

532
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.180
trying to get them to
tell me something and they

533
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.690
wouldn't go any deeper than,
yeah. That is weird. Let

534
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.250
me go ahead and swap
that out for you. Yeah,

535
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.890
no, no, no, no, no.
I don't really want to

536
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.840
sit here and I want
to root cause this with

537
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.670
him. Well, I don't really
want a root cause with

538
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.890
you. I just want to
give you a new phone.

539
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.020
So this went around for
a week and a week

540
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.970
and basically I just got
a new phone. So now

541
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.210
I will never know why
this thing would loo you

542
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:55.770
know why every five minutes,
but I can't pop the

543
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.680
thing open cause it's disposable.
And that's just ridiculous. A

544
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.410
quad processor, a magical device,
super computer in my pocket.

545
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.500
That is now disposable. Yeah.
Yeah. They just swapped it.

546
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.850
It was, it was surprising.
So what kinds of IOT

547
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.280
projects are you doing at
home? I loved exploring on

548
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.820
your blog. You, you made
your own height, adjustable table

549
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.340
out of some mahogany and
some legs that you got

550
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.650
got all sorts of great
projects that you're working on.

551
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.490
What are you currently tinkering
with? So yeah, one of

552
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.800
my, as you mentioned, one
of my favorite things to

553
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.830
do with, of course tinkering,
but I'm also a huge

554
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.740
woodworker. So whenever I can
combine the two worlds, you

555
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.110
know, I absolutely love it.
So I actually built that

556
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.300
desk for my wife, who
is a, we have a

557
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.890
home office, we've had homeless,
she's had a home office

558
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.560
for a while. And so,
you know, the, the big

559
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.230
trend or, you know, these
standing desks. So I said,

560
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.840
you know, I can make
one of those and make

561
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.370
it prettier or make it
cooler or whatever. So I

562
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.460
built one and she's, and
she's loved it, but I

563
00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.460
sort of get a little
jealous. So just a few

564
00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.320
months ago I finished, I
finished the second one for

565
00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.530
myself, so it's okay. My
soldering station there and everything

566
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:04.610
else. But so whenever I
can combine those worlds, I,

567
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.160
you know, I absolutely love
it. I'm working on right

568
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.930
now. A I've got two
small dogs, right. And I

569
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.270
built a dog house a
few years ago. And now

570
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.430
that we're back in sunny,
California, you know, it's out

571
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:17.810
there. I think you'll get
some, they'll get some use

572
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.510
out of it, but I'm
looking at it adding a

573
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.610
few sensors to this dog
house. So it's sort of

574
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.850
a, the door can open
whenever they get nearby. You

575
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.830
can get some, some status
updates on where they are.

576
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.760
Exactly. If they're sleeping in
the dog house, that sort

577
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.990
of thing, all may maybe
powered by a raspberry PI.

578
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.390
I'm not sure yet I
haven't selected it, but I,

579
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.030
you know, I love combining
all those worlds. Okay. When

580
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.650
you, when you pick a
project like that, like if

581
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.600
someone who's listening is thinking
like, Oh, that sounds like

582
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.430
something that I could do.
How much time do you

583
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.820
spend thinking about, you know,
the components and having confidence

584
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.070
that you can write it
from scratch versus seeing if

585
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:56.150
someone else has made a
doggy door opener, you know,

586
00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.420
project all in one, it
sounds like you're probably more

587
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.240
of a looking at like
what level of Lego piece

588
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.250
are you looking for the
complete solution and you follow

589
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.340
the instructions, or are you
thinking about wires and chip

590
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.270
sets? I think there's, I
probably it's probably split for

591
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.790
me. You know, of course
the, the first first thing

592
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.560
I do is see what
else is out there. I'm

593
00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.660
not about to reinvent the
wheel if I don't have

594
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.400
to. And there are a
lot of really talented folks

595
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.680
who are, who share freely.
Of course you, that's the

596
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:25.010
beauty about the, the net
is that folks who like

597
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:28.430
to do this tend to
document really well and their

598
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.830
plans and their successes and
failures. So that's the first

599
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:34.100
place I look. And sometimes
in fact, you know, I'll

600
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.480
have an idea. I'm sure
that I want to do

601
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.520
a certain thing, but then
I'll look, I'll look online

602
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.430
and I'll see, you know,
some that I hadn't considered

603
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.970
and that in turn can
help in turn can help

604
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.540
refine my idea into something,
something even greater. Sometimes I

605
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.270
do have to sort of
roll my own code, right.

606
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.160
Or invent my own way
of doing a certain thing,

607
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.020
but it's kind of fun.
It always starts out though,

608
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.320
seeing, seeing what else is
out there. And, and that's

609
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.780
the coolest part of the
whole learning process. I think

610
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.390
I really find more and
more than I do solutions

611
00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.780
that solve a particular problem.
I really admire people who

612
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.620
can make art related installations,
where they can do something

613
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.000
and I'll ask them why
they did it. And they'll

614
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.640
say because it was pretty
or because it was awesome.

615
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.580
For some reason, I keep
looking for problems in my

616
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:21.370
house and then wanting to
fix them. So like the,

617
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.450
the idea of a smart
home for pets, that's like,

618
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.340
I can get my brain
around that and I can

619
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.050
jump into that, but I
don't know if I could

620
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.210
do an art installation for,
for no other reason that

621
00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.490
it is pretty, I think
that's just how I'm wired

622
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.930
for wanting to solve problems.
The thing is that I,

623
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.460
I would say that I
agree, but I think back

624
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.850
to some of my, my
projects that have to do

625
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:46.680
with something artistics and whether
it's a sound activated, light

626
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.290
display, or an led cube
or something, and those were

627
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.960
actually, you know, that's art.
And I had my fun

628
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.790
in terms of soldering all
the joints and things like

629
00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.000
that and planning out the
circuits, but in the end,

630
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.030
what did these things do?
Well, nothing really, but they

631
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.470
look pretty. So I don't
know. I wouldn't, I want

632
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.500
to sell yourself short there.
I think you're, you're probably

633
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.650
plenty artistic everything about it.
Well, like you have a

634
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.640
great led cube. Number two
that you did there is

635
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.520
that has, this is huge.
What do you got? 64

636
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.710
LEDs in an array. Do
you still have that Foreign

637
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.660
it's sitting on my desk
here on my shelf here

638
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.350
And is, and it sounds
activated as well. This particular

639
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.440
one isn't I have actually
the table that I described,

640
00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.410
my little soldering, some electronic
expense and soldering station. I

641
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.950
actually, I glued a strip
of LEDs to the back

642
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.500
of the table so that
when it is sound activated,

643
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.990
the light reflects off of
my white wall. So it

644
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.200
gives us cool glow whenever
I'm playing music or, or

645
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.960
whatever, it's kind kinda neat.
It's very soothing. You know,

646
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.570
if you're putting on some,
some jazz or some classical

647
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.600
while you're, while you're smelling
a solder fumes, it's fine.

648
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.210
I like, I think I'm
going to make the arc

649
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.060
reactor that you, that you
did a couple of five

650
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.540
years ago. Yeah. I really
liked that one because I

651
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.090
was in the middle of
Afghanistan for that particular project.

652
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:08.460
And yeah, it was, was
in October. So approaching Halloween.

653
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.460
And as you can imagine,
there not a whole lot

654
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.610
of Halloween party planning in
the middle of Afghanistan, but

655
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.680
one thing they do have,
there's a lot of like

656
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.820
stuff, broken stuff. So whether
they're optics from, from an

657
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.420
aircraft that have bullet holes
through them, or all types

658
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.870
of stuff that was upgraded
tech that was upgraded and

659
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:32.130
disposed dispose of. So there
was tons of parts that

660
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.910
had access to. And so
I thought, you know, I'm

661
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.680
not going to let this
Halloween pass by with a

662
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.970
little fun. So I found
a couple of led Rings

663
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.490
and I built my own
power supply and hit it

664
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.520
under my uniform. And so
Halloween night, you know, their

665
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.710
folks sort of around getting
dinner and trying to have

666
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.130
a little downtime in between
operations, I, I made it

667
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.190
so that my, my Ironman
arc reactor that was hidden

668
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.210
underneath my uniform was controlled
by a remote in my

669
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.670
hand. So you can imagine
the surprise as I'm walking

670
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.790
around the fog, the Ford
operating base, and this, this

671
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.790
led is slowly starting to
get more and more intense

672
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.440
on anything. My uniform is
kind of, kind of a

673
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.260
trippy sight, but folks around
me love it. And so

674
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.470
it's sort of, you know,
it's, you know, it brings

675
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.630
itself a sense of calmness.
It was fun for me,

676
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.570
but it also helps, you
know, it helps everyone remember

677
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.970
remind themselves of like, you
know, what fun is when

678
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.370
you're out there in those
tough times. Yeah, definitely. I'll

679
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.950
be sure to include links
to your blog, to your

680
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.680
projects and in this project
in particular. I think the

681
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.600
other thing that surprised me
about this one was that

682
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.460
you powered that arc reactor
with a 13.5 volt battery.

683
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.800
And I'm looking at a
picture here where you actually

684
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.160
cut open a nine volt
battery and made it made

685
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.940
a one and a half
nine volt battery power of

686
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.080
supply, which I I've never
done that. I've never, I

687
00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:49.910
never thought to open up
the battery. And so it

688
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.620
was in there. I know
it's sort of what I

689
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.050
had at the time. Right.
I had like these weird

690
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.170
LEDs that had certain power
requirement and they didn't have

691
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.080
the exact thing. So I
took apart a few batteries

692
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.050
and just sort of made
it happen. That's fantastic. Well,

693
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.030
I really appreciate you chatting
with me today. This has

694
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.700
given me a lot of
inspiration about how to apply

695
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.910
these things. Not only to
my personal life, but also

696
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:13.610
at work. And I really
admire what you're doing down

697
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.360
there. Thanks so much, Scott.
This has been another episode

698
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.550
of Hansel minutes and we'll
see you again next week.

699
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:27.070
