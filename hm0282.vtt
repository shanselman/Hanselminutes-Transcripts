search engine. Duck, duck go.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.240
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today just

10
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.940
because I decided at this
very moment, it's the first

11
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.080
episode of our startups series
and I'm talking to Gabriel

12
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.840
Weinberg, founder of duck, duck
go. How's it going, sir?

13
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.690
Very good. Thank you for
having me. Thank you for

14
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.360
being here. I looked on
your blog and did some

15
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.840
research on you and you
are an overnight success that

16
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920
took about 15 years. You
could say something like that.

17
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.220
You have this great blog
post that's a, it might

18
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.500
even be like your most
popular. That is a list

19
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.570
of all of your successes
and failures. What's the ratio.

20
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.520
Typically you think of people
who are in the startup

21
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.980
space. How many times do
you have to fail before

22
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.550
you actually hit it? Hmm.
That is a interesting question.

23
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.060
And I've also failed in
different types of ways, like

24
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.280
give you something for a
week or a month or

25
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.920
even years. And so I
don't know, but I think

26
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.040
failure shapes you in a
good way. And so, I

27
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.140
mean, that's why I wrote
that post is to get

28
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.380
out there. That failing is
is okay. And I actually,

29
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.560
the other approach that I
like to take to it

30
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.790
is having a career path
as you have a startup

31
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.340
career path. And so if
you think about startups as

32
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.550
a career path, it takes
you awhile to learn how

33
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.640
to do it. And what
you don't want is to

34
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.560
have the one and done
attitude where you give it

35
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.350
one shot and it fails.
And then you're back to

36
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.510
your job because that almost
never works. So I don't

37
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.980
know how many times you
have to fail to make

38
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.620
it successful, but I know
you're generally not successful on

39
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.070
the first shot. So that's
a really interesting that just

40
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.890
like clicked something in my
brain. Like take like two

41
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.560
people, both 20 years old,
both coming out of college.

42
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.940
One goes to work at
like, you know, I don't

43
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.520
know, Aflac insurance, the other
one goes and does a

44
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.910
startup. It's always expected that
the startup guy is either

45
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.920
going to succeed or fail.
And then after if he

46
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.510
fails, he'll just, you know,
he'll work at Jack in

47
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.190
the box, the rest of
his life. But you never

48
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.050
hear about like the guy
at Aflac saying, yeah, I

49
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.060
went in there and I
just, I kicked this jobs,

50
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.610
but now I'm 22 and
I'm a VP. It's always

51
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.890
understood that the Aflac guy
is going to have to

52
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.130
work for 20 years. Why
is it, why is there

53
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.280
a myth of that? A
startup somehow has some that

54
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.370
you go out there and
you nail it and you

55
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.240
knock it out of the
park as opposed to taking

56
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.060
20 years at apprenticing and
journeymen and all that kind

57
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.080
of stuff. Exactly. And there
are paths to do that,

58
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.380
right? So the apprentice journeyman
thing is you can be

59
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.490
the first employee at a
startup. Another thing I did,

60
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.570
which is do consulting on
the side, but really restricted

61
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.530
to only working four hours
a day. And, you know,

62
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.120
I upped my rate a
bit, but I was living

63
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.090
very frugally, but I could
focus most of the day

64
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.040
on startup stuff. And, you
know, consulting web consulting is

65
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.640
great for that because you
can really limit it to

66
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.290
two hours like that. Hmm
I've I've, I've always been

67
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.290
afraid to do a startup
after I got married and

68
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.400
had kids because, and I'm
always fascinated in the like

69
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.950
day to day, how do
you live part of it?

70
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.020
Like you've got kids and
you put, you've also got

71
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.740
a pile of startups and
ideas and failed deployments kind

72
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.240
of under your, you know,
your experience bag. What was

73
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.160
it like? Did you get
married and say, all right,

74
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.390
this is what we're going
to do. We're going to

75
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.970
live frugally. This is my
career. My career is going

76
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.470
to be a series of
failures. But if you stick

77
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.490
with me, I'm going to
nail one or two. Yeah.

78
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.450
I was lucky in that
this, the success happened before

79
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.950
we had kids though. And
I think it, that I

80
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.590
could see it being a
lot more difficult if you

81
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.110
ha if you try to
start after you have kids.

82
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.180
Right. But my spouse also
works, you know, has a

83
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.680
great job. And so that
also helps as well. But

84
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.710
I, I think it becomes
a lot easier, right? When

85
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.080
you're college example, if you
start right out of college

86
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.560
because you don't have kids,
then usually, and that's what

87
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.080
I did. I started right
out of college. And then

88
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.770
once you're, you know, it
took me six years or

89
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.800
so, or seven before there
was six or seven before

90
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.350
there was a success, but
I was still only, you

91
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.980
know, 26, 27. And we
didn't have kids yet, but

92
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.660
there's a lot of years
in your twenties. In other

93
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.270
words, what I'm saying, But
presumably you weren't discouraged at

94
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.510
this point. No, I was
not discouraged. So it sounds

95
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.430
like you had a practical
idea that, okay, this is

96
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.260
gonna take a while. This
is a slog. It's not

97
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.450
going to be like Facebook.
Yeah. Although honestly, it wasn't

98
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.930
as thought out a plan
as you're making it to

99
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.690
me. When I graduated school,
I just decided I wanted

100
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.600
to do it. And I
did it. And I wasn't

101
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.990
thinking about success or failure.
And the first failure really

102
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.950
hit me hard actually. And
that's when I had put

103
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.840
everything into that, raised some
friends and family money. I

104
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.980
lost that. And that's when
I sort of regrouped and

105
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.840
slowly got back into it,
doing consulting and just did

106
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.790
it again because that's what
I liked and wanted to

107
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.070
do. I didn't necessarily, wasn't
thinking I'm going to do

108
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.230
it for X years if
I'm not successful sweat, you

109
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.490
know what I mean? I
just sort of kept That's.

110
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.940
That's interesting that with the
benefit of hindsight, I think

111
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.540
that anyone with some measure
of success then eventually gets

112
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.140
asked by some, you know,
young upstart, like, Oh, how

113
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.540
can I have your success?
And when you tell the

114
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.290
story backwards of how it
went down, it could look

115
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.450
like it's a master plan.
And even though you tell

116
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.070
them, well, there was no
plan. I had no idea.

117
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.990
I mean, we had like,
there's like three guys in

118
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.180
a futon and there was
a keg and now there's

119
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.240
a startup. But in retrospect
it always seems magical. And

120
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.610
I have people tell me,
like, you know, how do

121
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.290
you, how do you get
it immediate? How do you

122
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.810
do blogging? How do you
go work for Microsoft? And

123
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.480
I tell them the story
about how I fell into

124
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.250
a community college. And I
was supposed to meet a

125
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.530
buddy there and he never
showed up. And I enrolled

126
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.960
in the computer science program
and that's what happened, you

127
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.590
know? And it it's like
disappeared. They don't believe it

128
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.990
though. They don't believe that
there was no plan at

129
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.350
all. None of this was
planned, but it could be

130
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.200
a recipe of success if
you follow it. Exactly. I

131
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.500
suppose, I believe A lot
in the, who was it?

132
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.730
Was it Woody Allen? 90%
is showing up or something

133
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.540
like that? I, I believe
a lot in that. And

134
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.480
with startups in particular, there's
a lot involved in timing.

135
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.690
And so if you're around
for a while, doing something

136
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.170
often, your time comes if
you're not, you know, 15

137
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:22.390
years early. And so, you
know, I sort of believe

138
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.090
in general in life, if
you're super persistent and you

139
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.010
just work at it in
the same thing is true

140
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.930
with blogging. As I've learned
the last couple of years,

141
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.580
you know, eventually it generally
works out. I, I listened

142
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.550
to this really great interview
with Mark Marin. Who's a

143
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.060
comedian who started turd, a
podcast and his, his time

144
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.460
has never come. And that's
kind of like the, the

145
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.820
angsty thing about his podcast
is he, it's basically him

146
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.730
interviewing his famous friends. And
he's the one guy who

147
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.910
just didn't ever happen for.
And he interviewed Paul riser,

148
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.810
the American comedian and sitcoms
star, and Paul riser was

149
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.440
talking about how one, one
day he was like, I

150
00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.920
think he's like 19 or
20. And he went up

151
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.860
to Peter Falk who played
Colombo. And he said, Hey,

152
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.630
I really want to write
a script. You wrote this

153
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.090
great script. How do you
write a script? And Peter Fox

154
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.250
said, well, you, you put
some paper in a typewriter

155
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.390
and you type fade in
and you keep typing. And

156
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.720
he was like, wow. And
he never like absorbed it

157
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.740
quite like that. But so
many people who fail just

158
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.410
simply don't finish. So it
was interesting when I looked

159
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.110
at your list, you were
pretty hard on yourself. You

160
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.720
were basically saying, here's a
great project. Here is a

161
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.910
great project. This didn't work
out, that didn't work out,

162
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.070
but I kind of re
I'm reading into it a

163
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.920
little bit, but it seemed
like the ones that you

164
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.410
regretted were the ones that
you never even deployed, like

165
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:42.820
they exist and only on
your hard drive. Yeah, exactly.

166
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.920
I mean, I think you
have to, you have to

167
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.430
put yourself out there for,
for things to be successful.

168
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.630
You know, it's like the
first thing you have to

169
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.310
do. And a lot of
people don't get to that

170
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.380
point and they're just shooting
themselves in the foot as

171
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.780
was I, you know, on
those, I did a, I

172
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.150
did a post recently about
being a phony and the

173
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.320
idea of the imposter syndrome.
And that resonated with me.

174
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.630
Vis-a-vis your list of failures?
It seems like when people

175
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.180
talk about that stuff openly,
like everyone comes out of

176
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.510
the woodwork, like with your
posts that you wrote about

177
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.490
all the failures, it's like,
wow, you mean you didn't

178
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.130
just invent duck, duck go
like out of nowhere and

179
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.860
had no experience failing at
all. Yeah. I, I saw

180
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.960
your post to it and
liked it. And I agree.

181
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.660
They really bring people out
of the woodwork. And I

182
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.290
wrote this other post recently
about blogging. Cause I committed

183
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.270
to blogging a couple of
years ago. And it was

184
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.270
the first time I, similarly
I had started lots of

185
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.550
blogs and failed at them.
And then this time I,

186
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.740
I would just like your
typewrite example. I said, I'm

187
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.510
going to commit. I'm just
going to write a hundred

188
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.540
posts in 2010 and try
to make them quality posts,

189
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.810
you know, and whatever happens
happen, and you know, worked

190
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.420
well. And in 2011, I've
slowed down the pace, but

191
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.870
done longer things. But it
was basically just writing, you

192
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.180
know, spending the time to
write it, write stuff down.

193
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.820
But with the, with this
commitment post about blogging and

194
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.400
it was thinking in retrospect,
it's like, there's so little

195
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.290
of these posts and they're
so impactful for people. I

196
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.500
don't know why people don't
more write about stuff in

197
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.750
the trenches. You know, people
just want to write when

198
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.360
they're successful and say, look
here I was successful. But

199
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.270
they, even at those times,
they don't like to write

200
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.790
and reveal exactly why they
think they were successful and

201
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.240
all the numbers behind it,
but people love reading it.

202
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.100
You know, I think if
you, if you, there's a

203
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.200
shortcut to blogging, there's an
under utilized, you know, there's

204
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.930
an area of posts that
is completely under utilized and

205
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.030
that's it. If you're a
startup, you could go out

206
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.340
and start writing all, all
that stuff down. And I

207
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.160
think people would eat it
up. Yeah. I totally agree.

208
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.980
One of the websites that
I read a lot of

209
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.520
is Marco Arment, the creator
of Instapaper. And I think

210
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.220
he worked at Tumblr and
what's great about his blog

211
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.860
as he talks about like
the actual stats, like, you

212
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.770
know, I'm thinking about removing
support for this version of

213
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.800
iOS. And here's what, how
I am making my decision.

214
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.860
It's like detailed statistical analysis
about what I'm going to

215
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.070
do before he does it.
So rather than a post

216
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.620
about I did this and
it worked out great. And

217
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.070
aren't, I awesome. It's almost
like him using like, Oh,

218
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.530
what am I going to
drop support for three? What

219
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.120
am I going to, well,
I could do this. I

220
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.310
could do that. And that's,
that makes the success not

221
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.360
seem like it is just
simply, you know, gratis and

222
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.910
just happens for him. You
can see that there's work

223
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.240
involved in doing this. And
I'm surprised that so many

224
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.670
people, not just in their,
in their startup work, but

225
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.410
in any work at all,
try to keep things a

226
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.080
secret. Maybe they're afraid of
being judged, or maybe they're

227
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.780
concerned that we're going to
look, look down on them,

228
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.260
but say what you're working
on and the decisions behind

229
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.480
it and how it makes
you feel. There's like less

230
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.260
honesty in blogging now, you
know, and I think is

231
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.950
related to the Fear of
kind of rejection and criticism.

232
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.240
And I think that's legitimate,
you know, people, I ha

233
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.060
almost every post I write
that gets submitted somewhere. You

234
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.160
know, you read the comments,
a lot of them, you

235
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.290
know, people are critical in
general on the web, but

236
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.140
you have to get over
that. You know, it, it,

237
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.690
it reminds me a lot
about public of public speaking

238
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.120
and the fear of there,
which is a valid fear,

239
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.610
but it just, I think
everyone would be better off,

240
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.960
especially in the startup world
because startup involve risk. If

241
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.180
you got over those fears,
you know, it would help

242
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.160
you. Yeah, absolutely. Let's shift
gears a little bit and

243
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.250
talk about dr. Go, because
I think that's, what's, there's

244
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.320
a couple of interesting things,
as I, as I, again,

245
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.780
read into patterns in your,
in your list of failed

246
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.210
projects, as you actually come
up to one that's very

247
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.510
successful. Is that in each
of your projects, you say,

248
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.030
well, this is essentially this
or this is essentially that

249
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.890
I wrote this and it
was kind of like posturing.

250
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.090
And I'm curious are your
projects that you compare to

251
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.190
successful projects, the ones that
you failed on that you

252
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.910
compare to successful ones? Were
they first, or were they

253
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.780
similar because DuckDuckGo is essentially
Google, but then essentially not

254
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.150
at all in ways that
you'll tell us which you've

255
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.640
done several other projects that
you compare to ones that

256
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.700
we've heard of. All the
other ones I compare it

257
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.580
to are pretty much first.
And I was too early.

258
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.030
And part of the failure,
there was like I was

259
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.580
saying before, it's just not
staying around long enough, you

260
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.540
know, take taking the site
down and it wasn't successful,

261
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.640
not, you know, a B
testing enough. Some of those

262
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.820
were too niche, but yeah,
they were generally first and

263
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.090
duct echo is obviously, you
know, a way late to

264
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.930
the search engine market, but
offering a different approach to

265
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.960
it. And then my last
company that the other one

266
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.890
was successful was sort of
in the middle. I, it

267
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.230
was just sort of a
weird company. It was close,

268
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.730
closest thing. You compare it
to his classmates.com who, who

269
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.580
bought it eventually. But when
we started out, it didn't

270
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.380
look like that at all.
I mean, that's eventually where

271
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.720
we ended up, but it
was just sort of on

272
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.480
its own. It's funny how
those kinds of things happen.

273
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.300
So when did you have,
like, when, when were you

274
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.370
just sitting around and have
the audacity to say, you

275
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.950
know, not so much with
the Google, let's do our

276
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.790
own thing. So both a
reason why it's one reason

277
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.890
why there's so many lists
of projects is the second

278
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.110
and third time I was
really trying to start a

279
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.650
company. I started a bunch
of different projects and then

280
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.800
worked on them all at
the same time and, and

281
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.560
let them flow. And then
eventually, you know, picked one,

282
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.290
I was lucky enough that
one sort of ended up

283
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.160
being successful and I could
focus on that. And so

284
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.980
most of those just started
out as side projects or

285
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.410
just things I was interested
in. And so the doctor

286
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.940
go in particular, started out
with this side project. It

287
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.070
was two different side projects,
actually. So at the end

288
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:49.770
of 2007, I had taken
a stained glass class and

289
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.980
I was unhappy with the
Google links that it was

290
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.370
returning. When you typed in
stained glass, they weren't very

291
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.760
relevant and they were very
commercially oriented. And, you know,

292
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.980
in particular, the person who
run the class had given

293
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.190
us a different set of
links and they were more

294
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.040
in line with the links
that on Wikipedia, as external

295
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.380
links and delicious was given
at the time. And my

296
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.010
thought was twofold. One, is
there a way to get

297
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:24.110
rid of all the SEO
parked domain, useless domain crap

298
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.790
out of Google. And two,
is there a way to

299
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.540
use, you know, these other
curated sites like Wikipedia and

300
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.160
delicious to make better results.
And so my side project

301
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.060
was mashing up Wikipedia and
delicious, and just seeing what

302
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.550
came up when you typed
in results and I've done

303
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.500
over a weekend. And then
the other side project was,

304
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.380
if I start crawling, the
web can identify some of

305
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.070
these spam sites. So I
did those in parallel. It's

306
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.490
just two projects. And then
I liked the results on

307
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.230
both. And I decided just
to, you know, put them

308
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.210
together and try to come
up with something to launch.

309
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.430
And so that's how I
got really, it was born,

310
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.770
but I wasn't set out
trying to make a general

311
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:06.250
search engine. Hi, this is
Scott coming to you from

312
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.490
another place in time. Are
you using agile practices to

313
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.680
manage your software development? There's
lots of tools in the

314
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.990
market that manage the steps
of a project, but most

315
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.930
of them focus on individual
roles, get ready for a

316
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.300
solution that caters for the
success of the whole team.

317
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.200
Guys at Tellerik introduced team
pulse to an agile project

318
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.770
management tool. That'll help you
gather ideas, estimate plan, track

319
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.670
progress in a common workspace.
Finally, companies, regardless of their

320
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.830
size can use a lightweight
and convenient tool that makes

321
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.250
all the stakeholders work as
a United team. Even if

322
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.640
they're in different countries by
combining intuitive user interface and

323
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.430
the power server light team
poles removes the roadblocks that

324
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.070
you typically face and applying
agile in an effective manner,

325
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.880
no more lost data, no
disparate systems, no lack of

326
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.750
critical analytics regarding the health
and philosophy project. So if

327
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.750
yourself get a free copy

please do thank tolerance for

329
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:07.270
supporting Hansel minutes on their
Facebook fan page, facebook.com/t L

330
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.440
E R I K coloring.
We do appreciate it. It

331
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.510
wouldn't be a handsome, and
if there wasn't, Tellerik helping

332
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.890
us. So if I, if
I understand correctly, you're saying

333
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.750
that you, this is going
to sound like, like, like

334
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.940
a, like a softball question,
but literally when I was

335
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.680
developing it in my mind,
it sounded like the right

336
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.050
thing to say. But I'm
thinking to myself, you're saying

337
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.750
that you actually care about
the results that are coming

338
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.810
out of your search engine.
Like, I mean, like when

339
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.050
someone types in stain glass,
you would like your search

340
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.690
engine to return the kinds
of things that an expert

341
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.900
in stained glass would like
you to know, as opposed

342
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.020
to what 10 million people who
want to sell you, stain

343
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.270
glass would like you to
know. Exactly. Exactly. And, and

344
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.500
initially one of the approaches
I had was actually something

345
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.950
that Mahalo and Squidoo, I
guess, tried to do a

346
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.460
bit, which was find experts,
you know, and get them

347
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.050
to tell you those links,
you know, or use experts

348
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.980
like from delicious and stuff.
But the expert notion managing

349
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.070
your own community ends up
being difficult for a lot

350
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.290
of reasons. And so I
got away from that a

351
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.990
bit, but yeah, that we
care very deeply about the

352
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.300
search results. I mean, that's
the basic premise. Well, Mahalo

353
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.120
was like, they were trying
to basically crowd source, Google.

354
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.470
They're like a combination of
Wikipedia and crowdsourcing and say,

355
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.390
let's find a bunch of
really smart people and they'll

356
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.310
go and they'll write and
they'll do that kind of

357
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.770
a long tail thing, right?
Like a long tail is

358
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.750
not as important, but the,
the main stuff people are

359
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.700
searching for, we can find
smart people to go and

360
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.330
write those results and curate
those links, but they never

361
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.250
really took off. I mean,
it's out there and I'm

362
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.870
sure there are people who
are obsessed with it, but

363
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.600
I, I haven't even thought
about it in the last

364
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.500
year until you just said
it, Pivoted, Amanda says startup

365
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.510
term for changing their direction
recently. And now they're doing

366
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.530
how to videos sort of
high quality how to videos.

367
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.820
But yeah, I mean, it
didn't really take off and

368
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.460
there were other ones like
that. So, you know, yeah.

369
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:14.240
The original Yahoo directory was
sort of like that, except

370
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.730
Yahoo did it internally. And
then DeMoz if the open

371
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.850
directory project, if you remember
that, which is still around,

372
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.120
but very spam written at
this point, try to do

373
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.180
that in an open source
way and have editors appointed

374
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.270
for various topics. But both
of those became very hard

375
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.960
to manage and eventually were
littered with, you know, expired

376
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.880
and irrelevant links that have
changed hands. You know, people

377
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.790
weren't paying enough attention to
it. So are your links

378
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:45.080
curated? I mean, is there
a human out there? So

379
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.500
right now we're sort of
a hybrid and we do

380
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.720
a couple things differently. So
we are drawing on, on

381
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.000
deep search results generally from
other search engines. So we

382
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.280
have a bunch of indexes
on top of them that

383
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.560
remove spam and rearrange them
and try to get more

384
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.450
along the lines of what
we're talking about. But then

385
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.330
we have our own indexes
that we often put on

386
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.330
top of those results. And
some of those are links,

387
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.000
you know, for like originally,
like I said, from Wikipedia,

388
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.520
external links, that's one of
the sources and there's, you

389
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.520
know, about 50 others. And
then some of them, we

390
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.530
put on top of their
results and that's the most

391
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.010
visible difference where we put
this red box on top

392
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.620
that I call zero click
info. Or if you search

393
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.460
for something like a general
topic, often you'll get this

394
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.770
red box that defines it.
And that's also from a,

395
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.830
a source like Wikipedia. And
that's key. That portion is

396
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:41.090
curated. So it's a hybrid.
So I just, I just

397
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.910
ego searched for myself. And
I got a red box.

398
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.890
The top of the picture
of my, which is creepy.

399
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.060
Thank you. And it says,
Scott Hanselman is affiliated with

400
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.940
Microsoft more at Crunchbase. And
then it actually tells you

401
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.210
the last two places that
I worked. And then it

402
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.370
actually has my blog with
a link that says official

403
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.770
site. So I'm verified. I
feel very excited about that.

404
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.340
So you've somehow someone or
some machine somehow has figured

405
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.570
out that that's really me.
Yes. And all that, all

406
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.010
that part is, is, is
curated. And then that Twitter,

407
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.110
then it shows your Twitter
that, that those links that

408
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.060
look different, you know, see
how they don't have snippets.

409
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.760
No one else can see
this, but maybe they can

410
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.510
search for you on the
site. Those are, those are

411
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.450
those cure, more curated links
that I'm talking about. So

412
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.760
it says, got my Twitter.
And then this is interesting.

413
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.470
It's actually got Facebook and
LinkedIn and Quora, and it's

414
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:37.530
somehow has collected all of
the MES, my social identity

415
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.350
all over the place. Yeah.
So One of our approach

416
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.100
is that when you search
something on Google, generally, there's

417
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.190
a place out there that
gives much better results than

418
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:51.240
the algorithmic results. And part
of our job is to

419
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:54.540
make, do that ourselves. But
what we've become, or we're

420
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.480
trying to become is a
recognition that there are tons

421
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.320
of other engines and data
sources that do very well

422
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.480
at certain searches. And we
want to bring those in,

423
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.150
you know, so in this
case, Crunchbase does a good

424
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.830
job. So we want to
put that on top, but

425
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.320
this Twitter case is an
API example. This is actually

426
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.790
using queerly Q w E
R L y.com. And they

427
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.180
have an API that associates,
Twitter handles with all your

428
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.270
other stuff. Wow. And so
when we recognize, we know

429
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.860
that it's your Twitter. So
we put that on top

430
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.750
and then we recognize it's
a Twitter link. And so

431
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.360
we'd go out in real
time and call their API

432
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.160
and then add in all
these icons for you. And

433
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.640
you do this in real
time. What if they're not

434
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.350
as popular as you are?
And suddenly you have this

435
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.990
relationship with queerly, which of
course, and I can't see

436
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.510
that relationship from this link,
but you're now querying them.

437
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.830
You have a dependency on
them. Yes. And so generally

438
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.610
for topical stuff, there's multiple
parties we could work with

439
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.430
for something like clearly, if
it fell apart, for some

440
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.280
reason we'd lose this nice
feature, but it wouldn't be

441
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.060
the end of the world,
you know? And there are

442
00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.360
other replacements for it, but
we haven't had that kind

443
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:05.160
of issue yet. And the
thing when I said the

444
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.960
word audacity before, the idea
that the player in your

445
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.370
space is so huge, does
that make it either more

446
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:18.030
difficult or less difficult to
enter the space? Cause like

447
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.620
some people might say, well,
who do you think you

448
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.750
are fricking Google, right? I
mean, you're going up against

449
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:25.620
Skynet. So generally if there's
a huge player in the

450
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:30.060
space, I think it's good
for you because it means

451
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.480
there's a huge market. And
you know, you can generally

452
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.420
form a niche within it
and get some people to

453
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:40.890
switch to you and they
validated it. And also people

454
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.580
don't like other entrepreneurs often
don't go for it because

455
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.260
they're scared of it. In
the Google case, it gets

456
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.040
a little more complicated because
Google is so entrenched in

457
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.930
people's mind with search, they
have such a far and

458
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.950
away monopoly that it's hard
to get people to switch,

459
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.390
but that didn't bother me.
It didn't bother me too

460
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.720
much in the sense that
I know that there are

461
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.070
niches within, I believe that
people do prefer a different

462
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.290
search engines in the same
way. They prefer different web

463
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.010
browsers. And you know, we'll
be able to find our

464
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.110
niche. And I mean, we,
we are starting to now,

465
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:22.270
but I think it's a
bigger percentage of people As

466
00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.130
I'm, as I'm scrolling down,
I'm just using my I'm

467
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.660
not completely Romania, but I'm
using my ego search as

468
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.530
an example. Cause I know,
I know what I get

469
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.570
when I search for myself
elsewhere, I'm scrolling down and

470
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.530
I'm noticing that it's like
attractive. It's a pleasant looking

471
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.110
for series of results. There's
like favorite icons on the

472
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.920
side. Occasionally my smiling face
will show up and then

473
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.530
I get down here and
I see a link and

474
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:49.120
it says results by being
alongside something. So it sounds

475
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.850
like you have relationships maybe
with other search engines. Yeah.

476
00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.630
So that's the hybrid piece
where for the, for deep

477
00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:59.290
results, we also use a
bunch of other search engines

478
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.510
and it's sort of a
meadow way. And then we,

479
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.260
if you compare the two,
you'll notice they're a lot

480
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:10.360
different generally, but that's because
we, you know, rearrange everything

481
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.420
and, you know, change things
around. But some of those

482
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:18.220
search engines that we use
have branding requirements. And so

483
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.020
that's where, that's where we
have a bang and Yahoo

484
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.010
logo there. Does that mean
that the one, the, the,

485
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.630
the result that is next
to that logo is the

486
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.630
one or does that mean
that it's interleaved? Yeah, Julie,

487
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.030
I just took the approach
to, we probably don't have

488
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.830
to do it that we
probably don't have to put

489
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:40.000
it there or that prominently,
but I took the approach.

490
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.620
Just put it way Very,
it's very nice to give

491
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.560
people, people, their props, I
guess. Yeah. And then there's

492
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.160
a bunch of others listed
in the FAQ page, but

493
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.820
yeah, we use, you know,
being in Yahoo, including we

494
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.240
use the startup search engine
and let go some and

495
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.670
an entire web and you
know, then we use other

496
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.200
APIs, like the quarterly one,
but also things like, well

497
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.050
from alpha. So how much
of this is you and

498
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:04.810
how much of this is
like, like before Google and

499
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.770
this is dating myself as
being astonishingly old, but I

500
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:12.250
used MetaCrawler and like, there
was a time there, like

501
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.350
maybe about a year, whereas
like, man, there was nothing

502
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.210
else in the web except
MetaCrawler. And it was the

503
00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.610
crawl of the crawl, the
other crawlers. How much are

504
00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.800
you a MetaCrawler like, what
percentage of the pie chart

505
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.200
is you and your results
and you just being smart

506
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.530
about using other people's results.
Right? So it's a little

507
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:30.040
hard to tease out because
what we want to do

508
00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.920
is for about 80% of
the searches have that red

509
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.540
box and curated links on
top. And then the rest

510
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.490
will be using other people,
but people click the vast

511
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.290
majority of on the top
stuff really. And they often

512
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.350
don't even look or click
on anything below the top

513
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:53.850
three. And so if you
count, you know, and we

514
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.910
have infinite scrolling, right? So
as far as us, so

515
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.200
if you count like all
the things below, right, you

516
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.700
might say, Oh, we use
a lot of other people's

517
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.550
results. But if you think
about that, this our stuff

518
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.790
is generally on top. Then
it's often the majority of

519
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.060
stuff is ours. So it's
hard to say, but that's

520
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.210
why I just say we're
a hybrid. I love that

521
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.640
you have infinite scrolling though,
because I'm in this, I'm

522
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.830
in this Epic battle right
now with the Scott toilet

523
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.680
paper people, you gotta be
the first Scott on Google,

524
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.930
because this is joke that,
you know, if you're, if

525
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.120
you're not on the first
page of Google and you're

526
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.180
just not on the internet,
the second page doesn't even

527
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:34.010
exist. But with infinite scrolling,
it does. Yeah. I mean,

528
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:38.150
unfortunately it still doesn't exist
much. Yeah. I hear you.

529
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.730
W w if you don't
mind my asking some technical

530
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.040
questions that help me understand,
like, what is this, what

531
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.720
is this built in? I
mean, the, the idea of

532
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.360
indexing the web or indexing
anything that big, it seems

533
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.280
really overwhelming, Right? So because
of the hybrid approach, we

534
00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.210
don't have to, we don't
index like crazy and use

535
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.240
a lot of storage cause
we can compress our stuff

536
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.210
down to pretty small, but
we do do a lot

537
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.180
of crawling and we do
have our indexes. And so

538
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.670
most of the code is
actually right in Perl language

539
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:13.160
wise for database stuff, we
use a bunch of different

540
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.210
data stores depending on the
source. So we have some

541
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.440
in solar, the Lucene based
search engine. We have some

542
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.050
in PostgreSQL the database, and
then we have some in

543
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:29.270
some flat file formats, a
a lot in this sort

544
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.260
of esoteric format called CDB,
which is a read only

545
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:38.540
database format. That's optimized for
speed, but those are the

546
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.700
main stores. And then we
use engine X for the

547
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.470
web server with memcache and
we run everything on ECG

548
00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:49.040
now. Oh, okay. So when
I'm hitting that, I'm hitting

549
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.440
duck, duck go, I'm indirectly,
I'm hitting the web server

550
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.530
and everything's being served through
ISTE too. Yep. So you

551
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:57.740
sit on top of Amazon.
Yep. And what does, what

552
00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.920
does success look like? Like,
is this a boutique, like

553
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.810
sometimes start up, people will
say they want to start

554
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.760
a boutique. And that just
means I want a company

555
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.800
that will support me as
I do my other stuff.

556
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.890
Or is there an exit
where Google like calls you

557
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.320
and they're like, we give
up, you're awesome. Let's work

558
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:19.250
something out. The market itself
is very, very lucrative. And

559
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.940
so, and I, my argument
is that our approach is

560
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.930
very mainstream and I think
lots of people would refer

561
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.660
what we're doing. So my
argument is I think we

562
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.120
can capture real market share
and build a very big

563
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.260
company out of it, independent
of anyone acquiring us or

564
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.490
anything. And so that's the
goal. That's cool. So at

565
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.000
some point some future time,
you've got 20, 30, 40%

566
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.530
of the market and you
know, it's like, Hey, you

567
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.500
know, when they're having a
panel with, with Google, they

568
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.260
gotta get duck to come
hang out too. Well, I'm

569
00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.600
not going to go so
much on the audacity to

570
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.060
claim 20, 30%. I, you
know, the first goal is

571
00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.240
1%. Right. But I think
that we, I think this

572
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.380
approach, this hybrid approach could
get up to a 10%

573
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.770
kind of level. Something like
that. Since, since I worked

574
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.430
for Microsoft, although Microsoft is
not affiliated with this podcast,

575
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.130
when Bing came out, I
was like, you know, kind

576
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.890
of obligated to give it
a try. And I think

577
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.160
it's really pretty. And I
like it as my startup

578
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.600
page, but maybe I don't
know, 30, 40% of the

579
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.120
time, I don't find what
I want. And then I

580
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.730
go and Google for it.
And I call that Googling

581
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.340
with being so I'll, I'll,
I'll, I'll go and open

582
00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.350
a bingo for something or
whatever the hell they call

583
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.810
it. And then I'll Google
for it. How often when

584
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.660
you're using your own product,
do you search for something?

585
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.460
And then you go, Oh,
Hey, where is, I know

586
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.380
that that link is there.
Where is that? And then

587
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:47.240
how do you solve that
problem? So we have abilities

588
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.650
to get to Google pretty
quickly. We have this thing

589
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.040
called bang commands, where you
can add a exclamation point,

590
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.220
anything and go to that
site. So you can add

591
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.290
10 to your search exclamation
point G and go to

592
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.510
Google or a, and go
to Amazon. And there's about

593
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:06.330
a thousand of these. I
pretty much use octagon exclusively.

594
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.320
Occasionally I will try stuff
if I run out of

595
00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.270
stuff in Google or bang.
And actually if we were

596
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.160
not a results, we just,
we have a link directly

597
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.560
to Google and being, you
can try it yourself. I

598
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.310
would, we encourage you to
try it. But I generally

599
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:24.000
don't find if I run
out of results here, I

600
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.900
didn't really don't find it
anywhere else either. But there

601
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.660
are definitely edge cases where
we just totally screw up.

602
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.920
In which case other times
other search engines will do

603
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.930
a better job, you know,
and vice versa. And then

604
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.310
how do you solve that
though, as the guy who

605
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.470
owns the company, do you
say, well, what is it

606
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.920
algorithmically that caused us to
not get that? Or do

607
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.760
you, do you ever go
hunt that down and say,

608
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.160
guys, go figure out why
this link. Isn't something we

609
00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.580
know about. Exactly. I do
that all the time and

610
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.770
we encourage feedback. And so
there's a link in the

611
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.860
bottom, right. Of each page.
And it's also on the

612
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.930
menu at the top to
give feedback. And so we

613
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.900
get tons of feedback and
I'm constantly chasing down these,

614
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:06.360
these cases to try to
improve it. I like this

615
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.280
idea of the Spang thing.
It's interesting, you know, it

616
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.560
doesn't seem advertised, I guess
it's deep in goodies on

617
00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.050
your, on your homepage. Right.
But I can type in,

618
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:17.730
you know, myself and then
get, say, exclamation point G

619
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.500
and go to Google. If
it didn't work, which means

620
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.560
I could keep duct deco
is my homepage and still

621
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.160
have access to now three
search engines without a lot

622
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.100
of extra clicking or typing.
Yeah. And it w what's

623
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.350
great is besides other search
engines, you can get to

624
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.290
all these other sites that
you want to generally go

625
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.870
to and search, not through
a search engine. So like

626
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.770
I w I use Amazon
all the time. Some people

627
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:41.510
have learned just to type
in Amazon, something in a

628
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.820
search engine, but I find
it much better to go

629
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.420
directly to Amazon and search.
Generally, it takes longer if

630
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.850
you're just on Google to
do that. But with the

631
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.280
bank commands, you can just
put exclamation, Hey, I do

632
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.500
the search and it'll do
the exact search for you

633
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.730
on Amazon. So it actually
saves you time. So I

634
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.470
use that, and then I
use a bunch of programming

635
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.540
ones. Cause there's, there's tons
of programming ones in there.

636
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.550
So I do pro a
lot. So I do like

637
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:10.040
C pan and I use,
you know, like CSS and

638
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.070
that kind of stuff. Interesting.
And this is, this is,

639
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.080
this is different than typing
in Amazon. Like I do

640
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.240
that 10 times I'll type
in Amazon. Plus the thing

641
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.000
I'm searching for that doesn't
tell Google necessarily to go

642
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.130
search for that. It just
adds Amazon into the keyword

643
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.890
list. Well, this seems much
more targeted. Exactly. The other

644
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.800
one is suboptimal a number
of ways, but it's actually

645
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.810
faster. If you had to
go to Amazon and then

646
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.380
find the search box, but
what the bank command, it

647
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.510
ends up being faster. And
so I think it's a

648
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.450
more optimal solution. No, that
is slick. And it looks

649
00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.460
like you've got hundreds of
these things and there's a

650
00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.400
dropdown down. That'll let you
get to them. Yep. Yep.

651
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.800
Basically any big site, we
probably have it. And then

652
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.120
we have tons of other
ones, tons of programming related

653
00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.710
tech related ones. And is
it all word of mouth?

654
00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.360
I mean, is my mom,
how's my mom, wouldn't learn

655
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.930
about duck, duck go. Other
than me telling her We've

656
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.620
grown mainly through word of
mouth. We've had some decent

657
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.830
press, like we were named
a one a time as

658
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.720
best 50 websites earlier this
year, over 2011. And so

659
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.940
that gave some press, I
actually bought a, we bought

660
00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.660
a billboard at San Francisco
on around privacy that said,

661
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:17.590
Google tracks you, we don't,
that also brought in some

662
00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:24.040
users, but you know, that's
an open question. Well, this

663
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.370
is pretty amazing stuff. And
people can check out your

664
00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:32.800
blog at <inaudible> dot com
and you've got like lots

665
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.480
of really interesting posts. And
if they just go to

666
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.690
Gabriel weinberg.com, they'll be able
to see you information about

667
00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.720
you, where they can follow
you on Twitter and duck,

668
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.720
duck go also has a
short URL, right? Isn't that

669
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:48.070
a ddg.gg. Yep. Very cool.
Well, thanks so much for

670
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.440
chatting with me. I really
appreciate it. Thank you much

671
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.770
for having me. This has
been another episode of Hanselminutes

672
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.210
and we'll see you again
next week.
