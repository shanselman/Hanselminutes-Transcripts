00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.660
about malware on the web
today. Scott Hanselman. This is

10
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.510
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I've got Brad Rittenhouse

11
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.740
from AVG technologies, their antivirus,
and an internet security. And

12
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.120
do you're the AVG link
scanner team lead? That's correct.

13
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.310
Thanks for having me on
Scott. Thanks for hanging out.

14
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.520
We actually met at build
and ended up talking for

15
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.230
quite a long time about
malware, and it's pretty scary

16
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.560
out there right now. Isn't
it? The world changes every

17
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.900
day when it comes to
malware and you know, the

18
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.260
bad guys are getting better.
And so the good guys

19
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.630
have to get better too.
And it it's, it's a,

20
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.060
it's a changing world all
the time. What are the

21
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.700
bad guys want from me?
Like why do they want

22
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.490
my computer? And I believe
it or not. I think

23
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.450
most people don't really consider
themselves this, but every person

24
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.480
is a commodity. And so
the more information that the

25
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.340
bad guys can get about
you, if I can get

26
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.700
your logins, if they can
get especially your bank log-ins,

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.610
then they can then turn
around and sell those. So

28
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.340
anything that can be made
at commodity, someone is going

29
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.460
to sell it. So that,
that brings up an interesting

30
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.550
question in my mind that
you know how people are,

31
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.420
they complain about Facebook, but
they're not paying for Facebook,

32
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.150
right? And they always say,
well, if you're not paying,

33
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.350
then you are the product.
Facebook is a big information.

34
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.130
Miner would that mean that
Facebook is really no different

35
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.440
than any of these virus
companies? You said they just

36
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.800
get their information. Cause we
hand it to them. It

37
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.200
all depends on what your
use is, what your intent

38
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.570
is and what you want
to do with that information,

39
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.960
to why they, they sell
that information. Where do the

40
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.530
Facebook sells it to advertisers,
which at least is somewhat

41
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.860
noble or maybe not noble
that somewhat and somewhat American,

42
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.600
right? They're mining our information
in a fairly anonymous way

43
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.010
and saying, OK, you know,
white guys in Oregon, like

44
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.940
peanut butter or whatever, and
that's valuable information. What are

45
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.070
these malware writers doing? Do
they want me personally, my

46
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.430
information, like my social security
number? Or do they want

47
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.260
it Aggregate? They, I think
they would get anything they

48
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.890
can. And, but like everything
else, the driving goal for

49
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.230
these guys is money. They
want to wipe out your

50
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.430
bank account. They want to
use your logins where you've

51
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.500
logged into other websites and
bought things. They want to

52
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.530
use anything they can about
you to generate money. And

53
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.220
a lot of times generating
that money is simply selling

54
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.270
your information to somebody else
that is in some kind

55
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.520
of a criminal activity. They
are, they like loners. Do

56
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.520
you think that these are
just like, I always imagined

57
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.170
some 16 year old Norwegian
kid, who's just writing a

58
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.950
evil toolbar or some piece
of malware just to be

59
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.710
just to be a jerk.
But like, do you think

60
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.540
that they hang out together?
Do they have any sense

61
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.690
of, of, of morality? I
think the world used to.

62
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.940
I mean, that's, that's the
image that we've had in

63
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.970
it that it's some kids
in there in their garages,

64
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.010
what used to be called
script. Katie's where they would

65
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.680
download scripts and share these
things online. Nowadays, it's a

66
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.860
completely different world. It's an
industry that's commercialized malware. Nowadays.

67
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.690
You can buy a tool
kit to generate and distribute

68
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.970
malware. So these are professional
companies, the, the, they release

69
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.920
versions of their tools that
are put out and their

70
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.010
QA in these things, just
like any other software company,

71
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.910
The idea of like a
software company with like, you

72
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.370
know, six folks all go
to work, you know, they

73
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.230
get up, they go to
lunch together. You know, they

74
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.640
have like agile methodology source
control. That is extremely disturbing.

75
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.270
It is, but the stakes
are high. There's a lot

76
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.040
of money to be made
in any time there's money

77
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.170
to be made. People are
going to put together in

78
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.660
their book. They're professionals at
it is where we are.

79
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.520
How do you guys categorize
what, what I would think

80
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.710
of as malware, which is
truly evil software. And I

81
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.270
don't know if there's a
word for it yet, but

82
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.460
you know, just shady software,
you know, that kind of

83
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.410
software that just makes it
just a little too hard

84
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.240
to uninstalls, like trickeries and
things like that. Right? We

85
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.930
there, it used to be
now we had ad ware

86
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.520
and things like that. Got
pushed on your machine and

87
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.900
it's just showing you ads
nowadays, something we would consider

88
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.740
malicious it's anything it gets.
It's a gray area. You

89
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.650
could say. Well, just because
it's annoying that it's malware,

90
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.840
it's doing something in your
machine, even though it may

91
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.120
not be stealing your information.
And then there's the other

92
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.000
side that you know, nothing
about it. It's sitting on

93
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.440
your machine, it's logging keystrokes
and learning all it can

94
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.380
about you and your logins
and information online and how

95
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.630
to get money out of
you or steal your money.

96
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.550
Do you think that I
should be more worried about

97
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.000
JavaScript and websites and links
that I might click or

98
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.060
is it about native software
that actually runs on my

99
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.710
machine? That's written in C
I think both of those

100
00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.340
are equally concerns for everyone,
a native application, that's going

101
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.890
to be downloaded onto your
machine, obviously has a lot

102
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.670
more control. It has a
lot more power to affect

103
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.920
you and to take down
your machine, if you want

104
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.650
JavaScript and cookies that are
injected in the pages, I

105
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.000
mean most binary malware, it
gets on your machine through

106
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.620
JavaScript. You hit a web
page. And sometimes whenever there's

107
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.990
what we would call a
drive by download you, go

108
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.100
to a site, something is
downloaded to your machine and

109
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.170
it's binary and can do
bad stuff. You didn't have

110
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.930
to click on anything, but
JavaScript is what was on

111
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.690
the page. Being used in
most cases, to get that

112
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.830
to you, JavaScript is not
only a way for them

113
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.170
to collect stuff, but it
is so it's, it's two

114
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.230
things. JavaScript is a payload
that could go and do

115
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.150
things on its own, but
it's also just a way

116
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.430
to deliver an, a payload
so that they can get

117
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.230
you twice. They can collect
everything that they could find

118
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.530
on your and your browser
and whatever cross site scripting

119
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.270
and cookie stuff that they
do. And then when they're

120
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.010
done, they can go and
send something else down to

121
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.710
cause trouble. Right? And a
lot of that, a big

122
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.730
concern is with privacy these
days and tracking cookies. And

123
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.930
there's a lot more advanced
methods of knowing which sites

124
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.540
you go to and reporting
that information back to various

125
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.820
sites. Do you guys have
any firm relationships with the

126
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.190
bad guys? I mean, I
think if you kind of

127
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.790
like is the police and
sometimes the police will have

128
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.850
like informants and they'll have
relationships with the bad guys

129
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.910
and they'll, they'll meet them
in shady places, Confidential informant

130
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.980
and CIS and things. I'm
just trying to get a

131
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.810
sense of like the, who
the players are. So if

132
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.910
you're the good guys, like,
do you ever like meet

133
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.790
a bad guy? I think
you have to be a

134
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.470
little bit of a, you
have to be in a

135
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.850
gray area. Sometimes my me
personally, my team does not

136
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.910
do the actual research on
web threats, but we do

137
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.350
work closely with them. And
so in order to catch

138
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.300
a bad guy, you kind
of have to think like

139
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.190
a bad guy. You have
to know what they're doing.

140
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.170
You have to know what
tools are available, where they

141
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.410
hang out, if there's underground
kind of forums and things

142
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.180
that they're on, you want
to be on those. You

143
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.150
want to know that information.
And so if at all

144
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.450
possible then yes, then researchers
are going to be in

145
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.610
those areas to try and
learn as much as they

146
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.450
can. And when you guys
in your, your product ABG

147
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.680
link scanner is kind of
a layer of security against

148
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.470
web threats and hacked websites
and things like that. When,

149
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.730
when, when you watch things
evolve, do you start to

150
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.310
notice like fingerprints and say
like, Oh yeah, this is

151
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.860
so, and so's exploit. I've
been seeing that more and

152
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.680
more as people have learned
how, you know, how, how

153
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.650
he, he or she used
that and this kind of

154
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:45.010
evolution of coding, Absolutely exports.
They evolve because it's a,

155
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.390
it's a never ending cycle.
A bad guy puts out

156
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.350
an exploit. Antivirus company comes
up with a detection method

157
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.280
for it. They detect it.
That exploit changed. The malware

158
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.330
gets changed. Everything is always
changing so that you can,

159
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.030
something can be downloaded on
to someone's machine and affected

160
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.530
in whatever way is intended.
There was a thing a

161
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.520
couple of days ago on
hacker news about, I guess

162
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.030
there's an exploit in a
part of, of rails. And

163
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.030
when, when it kind of
got discovered, the kind of

164
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.430
the alert went out and
it was like, okay, there

165
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.590
will be a proof of
concept of this in the

166
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.260
next four to six hours.
So get ready. And then

167
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.150
we're going to put it
in a thing called meta

168
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.510
sploid. It's a, you know,
it's like a, it's a,

169
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.640
it's amazing. It's a suite
of, of badness. You know

170
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.280
what I mean? It's it's
yeah. I mean, it's The

171
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.920
biggest one. These days is
called, it's called black hole,

172
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.370
the black hole tool kit.
And it's just, it's an

173
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.440
exploit and malware toolkit. It's
I think it accounts for

174
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.110
the last total, like 65%
of all malware out there

175
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:59.300
that's being detected is somehow
related to delivered with the

176
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.660
black hole toolkit Black hole.
Wow. And it's almost like

177
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.090
they're not right there. There
are a flavor of script

178
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:10.400
kitty that is, I'm writing
this software just by snapping

179
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.550
it together from other pieces.
Like they're not doing innovative

180
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.430
and interesting new things. They're
saying, I want a piece

181
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.790
of this and a piece
of that, right. Propagated more

182
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.940
that way. But then again,
you also have ones that

183
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.400
they are coming up with
something new. They are coming

184
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.490
up with something that is
hasn't been seen before. And

185
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.040
those are the bad ones.
Especially if you can hit

186
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.640
a top website and you
don't have to click anything

187
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.480
and it, something gets onto
your machine, then that's a

188
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.420
big deal. And that becomes
an enormous commodity in itself

189
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.790
because you can track people.
You can follow people, you

190
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.240
can find out what they're
doing. How, how safe can

191
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.140
people feel like I haven't
had a virus in years,

192
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.640
I think, right. I mean,
I don't know if I

193
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.150
don't have a key logger
right now. Right? Because A

194
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.910
good virus, a good piece
of malware, you don't know

195
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.010
that it's sitting there, you
don't know that it's reporting

196
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:08.840
back. So that's why relying
on security company, security, software

197
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.260
and everything like AVG is
a suite. Security is built

198
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.050
on layers. You have to,
you know, when you have

199
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.820
a building, you don't just
put a lock on the

200
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.400
door. If it's a museum,
you have a lock on

201
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.880
the door, you have, you
know, electronic stuff, guards, there's

202
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.400
a lot of different layers
that you want to use

203
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:30.530
in order to, Mm do
you, we were told when

204
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.540
we were talking to bill,
you had some, some stories

205
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.880
about particularly nasty experiences that
you've had in finding these

206
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.090
things. When the researchers bring
an exploit to you, what

207
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.920
are some, I guess I'm
not sure what you're allowed

208
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.660
to say and what you're
not allowed to say. Is

209
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.700
there anything you can talk
about? You know what I'm

210
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.070
saying? Big stories of failure
in stories of fail, I

211
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.330
Think would be the way
to phrase it. That's my

212
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.690
friend that likes to say
we had, we had one

213
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.730
and I'm, I'm allowed to
talk about it. It's on

214
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.310
our website. I think it
was blogged about, and you

215
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:09.400
can read about it and
blindness August. And just to

216
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.870
give you a little background
internally with antivirus, one of

217
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.510
the big issues is because
you have the power to

218
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.410
block both network connections and
delete files in someone's machine,

219
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.710
just as the nature of
the software. One of the

220
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.060
big worries is about what's
called false positives. So that's

221
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.950
alerting on something that really
isn't bad. And so we

222
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.320
have a lot of mechanisms
in place because if you,

223
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.890
if you do that and
you push out something and

224
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.430
everybody's machine detects, this one
thing that's really not bad,

225
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.650
bad, and you can get
alerts, it's bad, press, it

226
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.450
looks bad. And it also,
you know, you can denial

227
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:52.990
service your own servers with
that because certain people, when

228
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.690
you install AVG, you do
have the ability to opt

229
00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.580
in, to report, whatever is
found back to AVG. And

230
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.570
so one of the big
things we had last August,

231
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.360
there was internal. And we
started getting a lot of

232
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.270
a massive amount of detections
and hits and things being

233
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.730
reported back to the servers.
And at first we thought

234
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.490
it was a, it was
a false positive. We thought

235
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:20.710
it was wasn't actually real,
but, but the detection that

236
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.860
was being alerted on was
a few days old, which

237
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.860
mostly if it's a false
positive, you'll get it immediately

238
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.240
or within a short timeframe.
And so within like about

239
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.090
a 12 hour period, we
had about 1.6 million detections

240
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.650
and it was detections on
Facebook. And so people are

241
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.160
kinda up in arms and
you know, that's a huge

242
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.990
deal. People are complaining, wanting
to know how to turn,

243
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.790
how do you turn off
this AVG? Cause it's bad.

244
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.840
What had actually happened was
on Facebook. When you go

245
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.010
on the sidebars top bottom,
you have ads. And in

246
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.980
those ads are usually served
up by ad what we

247
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.630
would call ad rotators at
services. And in one of

248
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:06.190
those, there was actually a
black hole, a black hole

249
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:11.440
exploit had been injected into
an ad. And so Facebook

250
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.730
had the added come from
another company. And then the

251
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.760
exploit itself had come from
another company, even from that

252
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.160
and gotten on the Facebook.
And it was hitting people's

253
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.900
machines and link scanner was
alerting everyone about it. But

254
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.070
because there was so ma
so much of it at

255
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.980
first, we thought it was
a false positive and was

256
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.690
like, okay, we might need
to turn this off. We

257
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.790
might need to get rid
of it, but it just

258
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.160
goes to show that, and
in this case, you didn't

259
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.830
have to click on anything.
You didn't have to say

260
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.020
anything. He didn't have to
type anything. It just, you

261
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.970
went to the page and
it hit and it hit.

262
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.450
And we have a good
relationship with Facebook. And luckily,

263
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.000
you know, they were able
to take, take their things

264
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.510
down on their side. And
they're very diligent about security

265
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.030
and getting back and taking
care of that. But with

266
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.220
a site like that, you
can imagine it's an enormous

267
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:06.370
problem. So, so the, the
speed at which it spread

268
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.670
was so fast that it,
of course it must be

269
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.370
a false positive, right. It's
just far too successful. Yes.

270
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.270
It's only based on the
number of detections. It wasn't

271
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.120
really spreading. We figure we,
we protect it probably about

272
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.460
1.3 million people. But when
it happens all at one

273
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.120
time, you know, that's a
big load. And so, yeah,

274
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:30.040
it's, it just goes to
show that Facebook is considered

275
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.530
everybody considers it a safe
site, but you never know.

276
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.350
Right. I mean it is,
but, and they do a

277
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.050
good job of watching out
for and protecting it. But

278
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.320
when things like that happen,
you know, you do, you

279
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.600
still need software to be
protected. And if these people

280
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.760
hadn't of had AVG installed,
they would have gotten in,

281
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.390
You know, it's, it's funny,
there's the, the software engineering

282
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.360
kind of mantra of like
don't trust, user input. Yes.

283
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:58.000
And w with, with Facebook,
right. They trust themselves. But

284
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.040
user input in that case
would be the people that

285
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.520
submitted the ads that's right.
Right. And they don't have,

286
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.250
they may not have full
control over it. Or, you

287
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.650
know, even if they're running
things to try to detect,

288
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.390
is this a good or
bad ad on their end?

289
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.060
Maybe they don't, you know,
it's brand new, you don't

290
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.070
have a way to detect
it yet. And it gets

291
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.190
through and it falls through
Yeah. Not a malware thing,

292
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.710
but kind of another example
of not trusting user input,

293
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.550
I guess that the Apple
app store recently shut down

294
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.160
the ability to go in
after the fact and change

295
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.300
screenshots. Yeah. Because people were
uploading stuff with one screenshot,

296
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.510
getting some, getting okayed and
put in the store based

297
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.340
on that. And then sneaking
in later and changing the

298
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.190
screenshot, because that was never,
that, that, that part of

299
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:43.720
the, the submission process isn't
checked, right. That's really, really

300
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.880
evil. The, these, this job,
these JavaScript things I hear

301
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:53.470
about JavaScript malware, like I
was pretty familiar and comfortable

302
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.430
with how malware worked maybe
five, six years ago. I

303
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.000
haven't been thinking about JavaScript
as, as a malware delivery

304
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.540
thing. And I've been noticing
a lot that you'll go

305
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.960
to a website and then
it'll be hacked, or you'll

306
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.380
get a note that says
this site is infected and

307
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.230
we're blacklisting it. And it's
because some JavaScript that is

308
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.020
known is on that machine.
I know that my SQL,

309
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:24.560
my sql.com famously got hacked
in September of 2011. How

310
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.030
does that work? A piece
of JavaScript somehow got onto

311
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.780
the web server and then
served from it, or they

312
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.470
hacked the homepage. I mean,
how does that happen? A

313
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.770
web server is just a
piece of software as well,

314
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.410
and it's connected to the
network and people are able

315
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.590
to access it. And so,
like anything else, there can

316
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:50.040
be an exploit on that
web server. And somehow the

317
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.590
bad guys were able to
get JavaScript to be served

318
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.270
up through webpages. We get
a lot of our researchers

319
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.790
get in a lot of
ways, act as technical support

320
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.300
sometimes because we have a
lot of sites that come

321
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.370
back at us and say,
well, you're detecting me as

322
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.130
bad. And I'm not. Somebody
goes and looks at it.

323
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.660
And they're like, Hey, look,
you've got this piece of

324
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.850
JavaScript. That's going out to
some other place and it's

325
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.200
on your server. Here it
is. You know, it's, it's

326
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.350
proven. And what had happened
was somehow somebody had injected

327
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.900
this JavaScript onto their page
and it caused a hit

328
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.920
to some other site. And
so once you can initiate,

329
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.180
initiate a server connection, then
there's all kinds of ways

330
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.480
that you can deliver some
kind of a malware payload

331
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.280
to someone I see. So
it could be something as,

332
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.210
as, as basic as they
actually got ahold of the

333
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.410
index dot HTML or whatever
served the initial homepage, but

334
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.810
it could be, they stuck
it in a comment or

335
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.690
in an ad, Or it
would just anywhere that a

336
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.540
JavaScript block of code is
going to run, they can

337
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.540
put that in. Hmm. It
makes me wonder where I

338
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.910
can put a new file
up or whatever, and then

339
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.280
have a link to it.
It makes me wonder why

340
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.780
doesn't happen more. You know,
I mean like, like everything

341
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.480
else in the industry, everybody
tries to patch flaws, like

342
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.100
IIS walls, get patched whenever
they're found, but it's always

343
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.870
going to be software. It's
always going to be written

344
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.650
by people. And there's always
going to be something that,

345
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.380
that you're allowed to exploit.
If I were going to

346
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.200
go to work at, at,
at AVG and work on

347
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:29.000
malware and JavaScript malware detection
stuff, would you have me

348
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.810
practice writing malware? Like in
a, in a lab environment?

349
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.550
We always say, honestly, I,
I never worked in the

350
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.070
security industry before I worked
at AVG. I've worked there

351
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.250
five years. And so I
w I wasn't really familiar

352
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.000
with it, but being around
researchers, talking to researchers, the

353
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.090
people that do this, hiring
people is a really hard

354
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:56.720
thing because it's kinda, it's
part art, it's part technical

355
00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.910
knowledge. It's, there's, you can't
really teach everyone to do

356
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.850
it. So you have to
find kind of the right

357
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.190
kind of person that thinks
that way, that has all

358
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.070
these crazy tools that they're
able to put together and

359
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.880
use and watch what's coming
off of websites, watch what,

360
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.520
you know, registry, entries, files,
everything that's happens on a

361
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.590
machine. They have to be
able to interpret it and

362
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.660
kind of figure that out.
And they have to know

363
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.270
how to go and find
it. So there's some kind

364
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.750
of social interaction there as
well, but, you know, maybe

365
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.450
they can get in or,
you know, act like they're

366
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.670
a bad guy or whatever,
but just to get in

367
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.510
and talk to other people
When, when you're writing a

368
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.020
detector, you're, I assume you're
looking for some kind of

369
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.320
hashes or some kind of
fingerprint that indicates that this

370
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.050
is the thing that you're
looking for. Is that right?

371
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.160
I mean, do you, do
you take a chunk of

372
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.090
text and hash it, or
do you look for variable

373
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.040
names? What are things that
would tell you that something

374
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.380
is, is malware once you've
identified it, he's like, okay,

375
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.940
I know this is bad.
I need to go and

376
00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.030
find that everywhere. It's. So
that's what you normally, you

377
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.900
kind of reverse engineer what
the exploit or malware is

378
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.490
doing, what the delivery method
is. And also what what's

379
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.120
it, what it's going to
do when it gets on

380
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.540
your machine. So you're reverse
engineering that part to detect

381
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.040
it. Yes. Static a of
just looking at strains that

382
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.620
are coming over the network.
That's a simple method to

383
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.040
do it with, but there's,
like I said, with security,

384
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.900
there's layers to it. So
you do that, but you

385
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:30.360
also do other things like
heuristics, you do behavioral analysis.

386
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.000
You know, if your machine
is connecting to an, a

387
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.360
bunch of different servers that
you've never been to before

388
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.180
that that's probably going to
be a bad thing. And

389
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.840
so there's, there's layers to
that. You, you were asking

390
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.020
about JavaScript earlier and with
that analysis, one thing that

391
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.980
makes it difficult is that
especially black hole, we call

392
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:55.590
it obfuscated JavaScript. Well, if
you wrote a detection that

393
00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.690
just looked for a certain
string and you put that

394
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.520
out, well, the bad guys
just have to change that

395
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.070
string. Okay. That's fine. So
you, you, you do a

396
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.900
lot of different things in
order to detect it, but

397
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.110
the bad guys go one
more, one more step. They

398
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:15.030
deliver JavaScript that actually gets
randomized whenever the server serves

399
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:21.060
it up to every different
machine. And so in that,

400
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.370
when it gets to your
machine, the first thing the

401
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.430
JavaScript does is it probably
has some sort of a

402
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.420
key in it. And then
there's a block of text

403
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.290
probably looks like basically for
text that a loop will

404
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.800
run through and it will
unencrypt it on your machine

405
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.440
that was randomized for your
machine, and then it will

406
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.370
run it. So in that
case, you can't really look

407
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.070
for a certain string every
time. Sometimes you have to

408
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.680
look at the method that
is going on behind the

409
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.590
scenes. Okay. Wow. Cause I
was thinking if you know,

410
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.350
there are, there's so many
ways that you could potentially

411
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.370
have false positives. Like if
you look for the wrong

412
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:02.550
thing, you're going to find
that thing potentially in perfectly

413
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.180
reasonable code. Right. If you
find something that's a Google

414
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.690
analytics, JavaScript, you know, that's
on tons of webpages. And

415
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.720
so you're, you're going to
start alerting on everything. Oh

416
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.670
my goodness. Okay. Wow. What,
what are some trends that

417
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.630
you're seeing in, in JavaScript
malware? Or are we, are

418
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.140
we ahead? Is it, is
it kind of the same

419
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.400
old, same old, or are
we, are we on an

420
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.800
upswing of new techniques? Cause
I know that everyone is

421
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.800
obfuscating their stuff and they're
always looking for new ways

422
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.550
to obfuscate it. So it's,
it's, it's JavaScript within JavaScript

423
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.760
within JavaScript. They'll, they'll use
biter, rays of Unicode and

424
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.780
coded bytes. That's just scripts
within script, within scripts. Like

425
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.490
in the old days, they
would just think of ways

426
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.280
to mess up the script
tag. Right. And now they

427
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.210
just focus on how many
nested layers you know, of,

428
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.920
of inception. Can they make
before the actual code itself

429
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.650
gets, gets executed? What kind
of things are you seeing?

430
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.090
Well, like I said, I'm,
I'm not on the front

431
00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.800
lines with that part of
it, but the things that

432
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.890
I'm aware of, a lot
of it, it just, it

433
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:07.660
continues to be black hole
type things where they it's

434
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.050
kind of a centralized development
of the techniques. And then

435
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:15.190
it's distributed as a product
where I don't, I don't

436
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.280
know that there's a lot
of really new techniques that

437
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.120
are going that are out
there. But then again, sometimes

438
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.460
people publish that, Oh, this
is sort of a kind

439
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.210
of vulnerability with certain things,
but then someone else gets

440
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.210
ideas from it. Bad guys
can see that. And then

441
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.990
push that out to something
that could explode. Everybody's always

442
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.400
looking for that zero day
thing where they can push

443
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.510
it out and it'll affect
someone. Some big site that'll

444
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.820
affect everyone that comes to
it. And so that's what

445
00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.760
they're really looking for. But
don't most of these JavaScript

446
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.980
employee exploits ultimately end in
someone calling evil a couple

447
00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.500
of times, like, they'll go
and they'll do. So this

448
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.330
is the thing about JavaScript.
It's so dynamic. They'll, they'll,

449
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.550
they'll write some code and
they'll, they'll make itself modifying

450
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.920
code. Like you said, it's
encrypted to you and then

451
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.740
it's decrypted and then it's
obligated. But ultimately someone's going

452
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.850
to call evil. Could, could
we catch it at evil

453
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:19.360
or stop allowing evil? I
mean, we could stop stopping

454
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.540
and what, like, you would
know, like you said, getting

455
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.570
data from somewhere else and
then just running it. Well,

456
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.970
you never know what you're
going to get. And so

457
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.270
yeah, you just cut out
evil then, you know, maybe

458
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.310
that's what would happen, but
there's a, there's a lot

459
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.460
of different ways to get
there. You could on escape,

460
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.090
basically your escape, things come
through escaped and stuff like

461
00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.490
that. You you'd never know,
you know, what's going to

462
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:47.890
happen with them, but it
can get executed with a

463
00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.380
couple of different ways that
if it gets in a

464
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.140
string and something's going to
run it, then yes, it

465
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.450
could be bad. And if
that was all cut out,

466
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.640
sure it would work. But
I think that also would

467
00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.060
probably cut down on a
lot of that dynamic nature

468
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:05.470
that JavaScript does allow websites
to implement. It's going to

469
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.150
cut down on certain features
that you may be able

470
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.100
to do, but don't know
that it's as simple as

471
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.380
just, Oh, turn off evil
and everything will be perfect.

472
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.870
That is the thing, right?
The most secure machine is

473
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.300
one that's not hooked up
to the network. Absolutely one

474
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.560
that's not turned on. That's
that's even more secure. It's

475
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.200
funny. You know, I, I
used to work in online

476
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.580
banking and you know, you
know, some bank a was

477
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.130
talking to some government agency
B that was ultimately talking

478
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:35.410
to some other bank. See
I'm obfuscating obviously, and extremely

479
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.690
obfuscated because someone will know.
But basically it was one

480
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.090
of these things where we
had built this amazing, you

481
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.790
know, high tech web service
that would allow transfer of

482
00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.890
money from entity one to
entity two. And we had

483
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.950
no idea that one of
the steps in the process

484
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.330
literally involved a guy named
Joe taking a three and

485
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.140
a half inch floppy and
taking a file, like a

486
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.690
file from like a dump,
like a batch off of

487
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.710
one machine turning around in
his swivel chair and going

488
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.900
to the other side of
the room and putting it

489
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.620
into another machine. You see
what I'm saying? Like imagine

490
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.720
had this kind of the
Rube Goldberg and like amazing

491
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.870
bit of real time web
service technology that we created.

492
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.330
And then it turned out
like, why is it so

493
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.650
slow today? What will Joe
is out? Joe needs another

494
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.830
cup of coffee. Joe's Joe's
not there. He'll catch up.

495
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.920
He'll catch up tomorrow. You
also want to make sure

496
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.410
Joe knows the importance of
his job too. He just

497
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.960
thinks it's a random thing.
And nobody cares. Well, that's

498
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.400
a, that's a big difference
too. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. We

499
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.590
can definitely make the very,
very secure web. This is

500
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.640
why I noticed more and
more, a lot of developers

501
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:49.040
and kind of digerati, you
know, literati are running without

502
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:53.100
JavaScript enabled, which, which I've
always kind of thought was

503
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.470
a little bit nuts, but
now you're starting to make

504
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.600
me wonder if I should
be doing that. I already

505
00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.110
run with flashbacks. Yeah. Well
people and people use no

506
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.040
script and a lot of
these other things. There's a,

507
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.080
I mean, how would I,
how would I explain that

508
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.020
to my dad? That's right.
Well, no, dad, you can't,

509
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.120
you can't click on this
because we turn off JavaScript

510
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.100
and none of your menu,
things work and nothing really

511
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.790
fancy works. You know, we
stepped back in time on

512
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.740
the functionality of it. Yeah.
I don't know the, would

513
00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.590
you, do you just surf
regularly or do you, do

514
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:28.580
you have, do you remember?
No, I serve regularly with

515
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.800
strips And they're not concerned
about it because I have

516
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.590
had comments of, of people.
I don't know if they're,

517
00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.580
you know, tin, foil hat,
people, but I've had comments

518
00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.320
on my blog. People saying,
well, you're a fool to

519
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.480
be, to be surfing with
JavaScript, John, what are you

520
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.360
insane? And you're asking for
trouble, they're going to, you

521
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.200
know, Yeah. I mean, I'm
not a tenfold head. So

522
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.140
I surf with JavaScript on,
I don't really worry about

523
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.300
it that much, but then
again, I'm not, you know,

524
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:58.610
I'm not doing anything that
I, they really feel, you

525
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.770
know, somebody who's going to
want. And then that's exactly

526
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:04.100
my problem. Right. Right. Because
you feel, Oh, well I'm

527
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.470
not doing anything my wants.
I think it's one of

528
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.800
those things until you get
bitten, the foot that you

529
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.710
didn't know, you're like, ah,
I should have been doing

530
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.980
this. And that's education of
users. It's education of people.

531
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.500
I don't know that, that
there is a good answer.

532
00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.930
I mean, you can't turn
off your machine, turning off

533
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.150
JavaScript and a lot of
websites that you can't do

534
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.540
anything in it if you
did. And so there's gotta

535
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.060
be some sort of a,
something in the middle, obviously,

536
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.420
you know, software that is
watching out for you is

537
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.570
one of the better solutions
to that because you get

538
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:39.590
to function like you normally
would. And then hopefully it's

539
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:44.650
gonna alert you whenever something
bad happens. I think people,

540
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.580
people, the education of people
is some of the big

541
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.770
things with it. People may
think they're protected and they're

542
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.430
not. They, you know, and
they don't go look out

543
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.710
for it either. They're not
searching for it. How much

544
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.510
of this Get nailed are
doing things they shouldn't be

545
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:04.350
doing. But like when you
look at, when you scan

546
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.800
links throughout the entire web,
I mean, surely it must

547
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.630
be the shady bits of
the web that have the

548
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.790
bigger problem. Like am I'm
not going to get a

549
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.950
major exploit. Well, you did
make, you did mention the

550
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.230
Facebook one, but I guess
I'm saying, if I'm running

551
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.830
around on Russian, you know,
video game sites there, I

552
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:23.160
can steal software and torrents
and things. That's the shady

553
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.080
side of the web. Am
I going to get nailed

554
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.670
more there than I am@cnn.com?
Not necessarily because look at

555
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.830
the numbers, look how many
people are going and trying

556
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.830
to download a shady game
from somewhere versus how many

557
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.260
people are going to Facebook
or they're going to Google,

558
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.860
or they're going to a
big site. It's just, the

559
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.730
stakes are much higher on
a normal site than they

560
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.330
are at some underground site
that only a few hundred

561
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.760
people are ever going to
hit. So there's no it's

562
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.100
where you want to put
your energy and where the

563
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.800
bad guys want to put
their energy. And the target

564
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.380
is much bigger on bigger
sites. And so it's always,

565
00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.550
that's always the goal. Look
at YouTube. YouTube is using

566
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.650
a lot of scripting and
there's been some issues with

567
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:08.850
it. So, So they might
be using the shady sites

568
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.150
as a practice run, but
you're right. The, the real

569
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.580
money, I suppose, the people
with money and the people

570
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.040
were who, who we want
would be, like I say,

571
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.620
my mom and dad, and
they're going to get them@cnn.com

572
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.840
and places like That's right.
That's right. You want the

573
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.180
biggest number of people, biggest
bang for the buck. So

574
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.950
if you can exploit a
big site, get a lot

575
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:30.500
of information, then that's where
they want to be. I

576
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.330
dunno, I still would have
a real emotional problem with

577
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:37.020
like sitting down and writing
software for the V for

578
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:43.320
the, the discreet purpose of
it, Hurting people. I guess

579
00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.660
there's people that they may
not care about. That part

580
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.900
they care about. I'm making
money. And these days, like

581
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.810
I said, like I said,
it's, it's organized, it's like

582
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.110
organized crime, but it's organized
software. It's organized cyber criminals

583
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.280
and they're piecing everything together.
If they find, you know,

584
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:04.590
there's there's reports where a
bot net whoever's in charge

585
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:06.990
of a Bodden head or,
or something like that, that's

586
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.240
receiving a lot of this
information. You have to think,

587
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.570
okay, once my machine's compromised,
what happens to the data?

588
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.440
If it gets sent to
someone there's a market there's

589
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.490
markets where people put up
websites and you can buy

590
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:24.720
your log into Amazon or
whatever other sites that you're

591
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.460
going to, even your bank
account, if there's a bank

592
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.370
account connected, it's probably cost
more, but you can buy

593
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:35.430
a personal access to someone
for $2, $5. And if

594
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.290
millions of those people, then
that's their income. I wonder

595
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.300
if I need to go
and fight Back the access

596
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.380
to my and how much
that would now put me

597
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.000
in the best. And that
would be a great market

598
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.920
right there. And so you
can go and look and

599
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.550
buy back my information. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, Brad Rittenhouse, thanks

600
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.110
a lot for chatting with
me today. I appreciate it.

601
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.930
Thank you for having me
on again. Brad is a

602
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.780
team lead on AVG link
scanners, go and Google and

603
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.450
find that. And this has
been another episode of Hansel

604
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.280
minutes. We'll see you again
next week.
