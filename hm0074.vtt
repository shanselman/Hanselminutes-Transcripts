In this episode has gotten
Carl talk with Jeff Atwood

12
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.950
about building a new developer
machine without breaking the budget.

13
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.640
Hi, this is Carl Franklin and
you're listening to Hansel minutes

14
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.780
from Hansel minutes. I'm here
with Scott and Scott's very

15
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.330
special guest Jeff Atwood. Hi
guys. Hello? Hey, Jeff. Good

16
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.810
to talk to you again.
Yeah. So what are we

17
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.540
going to talk about gentlemen?
Okay. So we did a

18
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.060
show a couple of episodes
ago about building the ultimate

19
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.420
developer PC and it went
okay. But ultimately the guy

20
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.210
who's building the PC for
me is Jeff and Jeff

21
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.380
is building it because he
is deeply obsessive passionate about

22
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.070
stuff that I really don't
care about. And he's got

23
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.720
some really great posts that
he's put up on his

24
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.310
blog@codinghorror.com about the process of
the building. He's just about

25
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.500
finished up with those posts
on the hardware side, I'll

26
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.260
be taking them over and
doing the software side. But

27
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.210
what I thought we would
do is we'd go through

28
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.480
some of the comments of
show 69 on building a

29
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.120
developer PC with some people
said, wasn't a particularly interesting

30
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.070
show because the argument is
that a gamer PC would

31
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.320
make a perfectly good developer
PC. So they're kind of

32
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.070
arguing that the postulate was
wrong from the beginning that

33
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.050
any fast machine is a
good machine. Okay. For developers,

34
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:48.290
for developers. Well, do you
think that's true Jeff part

35
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.780
of the hardware that you're
working on and that's the

36
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.620
part that I really enjoy
going a little bit deeper

37
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.710
than the software and actually
seeing how a good developer

38
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.390
will understand, You know, if
you're hitting the disc a

39
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.790
lot, the consequences of that,
you know, when is the

40
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.700
network, the bottleneck, when is
the CPU, the bottleneck, and

41
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.470
when you build the hardware,
that's really what you do.

42
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.170
You're playing a shell game
of where's my bottleneck going

43
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.400
to be and understanding that
I think it's very much

44
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.340
the same as a audio
recording. You know, the way

45
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.390
you get a good recording
starts with hardware, but too

46
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.660
many people put emphasis on
the hardware itself. A lot

47
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.330
of it is, you know,
Mike placement and, you know,

48
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.830
configuration of, of preamp gain
levels and things like that.

49
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.460
Good technique. So on a
PC, I got to think

50
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.400
that, okay, it's good to
have your, you know, raid

51
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.480
mirroring and everything else, but
if you're not configured correctly,

52
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.280
or if you don't have
the right drivers or the,

53
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.160
you know, right. Enabling you
just brought up an interesting

54
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.410
point when you said Mike
positioning. Because the first thing

55
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.720
I thought about and actually
was mentioned in the comments

56
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.630
here on show 69, was
that people don't take into

57
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.940
consideration comfort. I know that's
something that Jeff, you're very

58
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.070
passionate about specifically the chair
and three monitors. Wow. Yeah,

59
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.840
yeah. And that's the first
thing I said to Scott

60
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.150
actually was, you know, Scott,
have you bought your three

61
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.660
monitors yet? Because actually the
computer becomes, I don't want

62
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.210
to say inconsequential, but not
nearly as important as you

63
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.760
know, the things you, you
touch, the things, you see,

64
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.370
things that are going to
have the biggest impact on

65
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.820
your, your, your daily computing
experience. So that's right. We

66
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.210
don't want to lose the
forest or failed to see

67
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.400
the forest for the trees,
if you will. No, I

68
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.680
know I read on your
blog before that you have

69
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.410
a specific kind of keyboard
that you use, that you

70
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.750
like bought the them. They
don't make them anymore. And

71
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.290
you run around on eBay
looking for this keyboard. Yeah.

72
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.710
That was the old Microsoft
natural ergonomic keyboard. Fortunately they

73
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.020
introduced a new model. The
a, I believe the ergonomic

74
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.410
4,000, it's a black keyboard.
Cause I, I personally, I

75
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.410
like the ergonomic, the split
configuration. And then as a

76
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.720
developer, the other thing about
keyboards that drives me nuts

77
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.600
and actually there's developers at
Virgo that use these keyboards.

78
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.150
And I'll never understand is
where they've, they've moved the

79
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.840
configuration of the arrow keys
from the Tetris block shape

80
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.550
to like a diamond or
something crazy. And similarly insert

81
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.970
home page up that cluster
will be rotated. This is

82
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.430
to make the keyboard smaller.
But as a developer, I

83
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.160
mean, those are golden keys.
You know, those all the

84
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.430
time, those cannot move. So
that is one of the

85
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.590
things I look for both
to be ergonomically split. Cause

86
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.630
I prefer that. And then
that it's not what I

87
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.510
call mangled, meaning that the
arrow keys are in a

88
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.590
traditional arrangement and the home
and page up block is

89
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.130
conventional in arrangement. Well, that's
a good reminder to everybody

90
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.860
to kind of rethink the
keyboard. Are you using this

91
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.950
particular keyboard that you're using
now because it came with

92
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.110
the machine or because you've
had it for years or

93
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.720
because it's truly a comfortable
keyboard. I mean, if you're

94
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.360
gonna spend $2,000 on a
computer, why not go and

95
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.280
try out a bunch of
keyboards and spend your 70

96
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.650
bucks on a decent, a
decent keyboard and mouse set?

97
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.930
One of the mice that
I use that I finally

98
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.560
landed on is the evaluate
Verde vertical mouse, hold your

99
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.560
hand and in a handshake
position. So it doesn't cause

100
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.870
the bones of the forearm
to twist over each other.

101
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.120
When you put your hand
over the mouse and that's

102
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.880
made a huge difference, very
important, my hand pain, I

103
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.610
need a new mouse for
that exact reason. One of

104
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.550
the problems I find with
mouse manufacturers is they try

105
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.240
to, they try to improve
a very simple device by,

106
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.090
Oh, here's the worst, the
software that comes with the

107
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.490
mouse. If anybody in my,
in my organization, installs mouse,

108
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.940
software, they're fired. You know
what I mean? Why are

109
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.450
you installing that spyware? What
is it that come, why

110
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.600
does mouse need software? Carl,
that's a really great point.

111
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.670
And it actually reminds me
of a blog entry that

112
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.150
I want to write, which
is nobody hates software more

113
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.260
than software developers. It is
so true. And I swear,

114
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.060
this is true. My wife
was going to install the

115
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.310
software that came with her
digital camera and I saw

116
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.960
her doing it. It was
almost like slow motion. I

117
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.450
had to die. You know,
cause it's just crap where

118
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.400
it's just gonna mess up
the PC and sure enough,

119
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.170
we, we have Vista at
home and she plugged it

120
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.080
into Vista, recognized it automatically
pulled in the pictures. It

121
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.570
was totally automatic. Right? You
don't need any other additional

122
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.620
software. So think the sensitivity
level has gone high Rez

123
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.560
enough. And in fact, I
find myself turning it way

124
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.290
down from what they, you
know, they say, you know

125
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.450
what, that's a selling feature.
A mouse going to agree

126
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.890
with Jeff is not gonna
agree with that at all.

127
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.850
I really don't like highly
sensitive mice. Well, I think

128
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.620
the adjustability is cool and
actually adjustability in hardware. This

129
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.720
is another thing where it's
actually better to have this

130
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.990
feature in hardware because it's
operating system independent. There's nothing

131
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.380
to configure, et cetera, et
cetera. I like my mices

132
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.160
where you actually have the
buttons that adjust the sensitivity.

133
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.220
Cause what I'll do is
when I'm graphic editing, like

134
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.620
I'll turn up the sensitivity
and then turn it back

135
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.260
down for normal browsing and
so on. No problem. That's

136
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.150
a problem. I have, see,
I have a razor mouse,

137
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.580
you know, those are a
Z R mice and you're

138
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.580
probably like this mouse, but
it's got like seven buttons

139
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.650
on the sides and stuff
and I'm always hitting them.

140
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.830
And then the sensitivity just
went up and I ended

141
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.320
up dragging up a really
big file to the recycle

142
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.720
bin by accident. So, so
which mouse do you have?

143
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.550
Jeff? I know you have
one with a hardware adjustable

144
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.420
sensitivity. This is a collaboration
between razor. Now I have

145
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.610
not historically been a fan
of the razor, my third

146
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.570
too hardcore and you know,
just low rider type mice

147
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.240
with like neon and all
that stuff. It's just silly.

148
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.350
But the razor Habu is
actually a collaboration between Microsoft

149
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.680
and razor and it mimics
the classic and telehealth shape,

150
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.330
which a lot of people
love and think it's like

151
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.780
evolutionarily one of the best
mice ever created with the

152
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.630
mouse 3.0 shape. So it's
sort of a mixture of

153
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.180
both. It's got some sort
of cool, you know, on

154
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.190
the fly hardware adjustment features,
but it's sort of a

155
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.680
classic shape as well. And
doesn't have too many buttons.

156
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.620
So I think there's a
good blend of features you

157
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.450
can find. And I think
the lesson here is like,

158
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.690
like Scott was saying, like
don't spend $2,000 on a

159
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.720
computer and just use the
trashy $10 keyboard that Dell

160
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.130
gives you. Right? Like, think
about these that you touch

161
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.590
every day and put some
time and effort into finding

162
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.630
ones that you really like,
you know? And there's also

163
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.720
ergonomic consequences as well. I
mean, I'm fortunate in that.

164
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.300
I almost never have hand
pain, but I know so

165
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.740
many developers personally like Phil
hack, John Galloway and Scott have

166
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.940
all had huge problems with
hand pain. Have either of

167
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.940
you guys use the data
hand or seen it, I've

168
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.710
seen it, but I just
can't justify that kind of

169
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.560
money. Yeah. It is expensive.
But you know, if you're

170
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.710
really trying to solve the
problem and I think that's

171
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.360
a world worthwhile thing. I
can't, I, I haven't, I

172
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.370
use it. Okay. So I
have one and I practice

173
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.070
with it, but I don't
feel comfortable enough yet to

174
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.770
just go out and replace
my mouse and keyboard. And

175
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.390
we'll, we'll add a link.
You should send that to

176
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.310
me, Karl, you should FedEx
that to me and I'll

177
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.780
use it for a couple
of weeks and then do

178
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.180
a, do a review on
it. That's not a bad

179
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.870
idea. So let's let let's,
let's talk about, we talked

180
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.020
about keyboard mice. These are
all things developers touch everyday.

181
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.720
Now when people saw the
configuration of the system, you're

182
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.300
building from each F, they
immediately thought we were building

183
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.690
an SLI gaming machine because
they saw that there were

184
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.780
two video cards and you
kind of came in in

185
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.460
the middle of the comments
and said, Hey folks, this

186
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.460
is for multiple monitors up
to four different monitors. Why

187
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.620
do you feel so strongly
about the number three for

188
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.920
your monitors? Well, there's a
couple of reasons. One is

189
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.440
I think you can never
have enough display space. You

190
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.100
just can't like one of
tough Dee's point Edward Tufty

191
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.040
the, the UI guy is
that displays are so low

192
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.560
resolution. All you can really
do is have a lot

193
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.530
more of them and you
spend less time manipulating windows.

194
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.880
I think I touched on
this a little bit in,

195
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.980
in the dotnet rock show.
And I still believe in

196
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.790
that it's like, it's basically
stop overlapping windows, overlapping windows

197
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.210
does not help productivity. Right?
So the reason two versus

198
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.970
two is one is unacceptable.
You should have two minimum

199
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.620
as a developer. That's part
of the bill of rights,

200
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.960
right? But I think three
is even better if you

201
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.150
can swing it. And I
realize it is more complexity

202
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.460
at that point, you're dealing
with two video cards. So

203
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.470
I totally appreciate the difficulty
in doing it, but if

204
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.750
you're building your own rig,
this is what it's about.

205
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.630
It's about having things that
developers need. And I think

206
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.300
having a center monitor, so
you don't have that like

207
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.820
border directly in the middle
of your, you know, display

208
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.490
space is huge because I
can focus on the middle

209
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.730
monitor and throw things like
in minority report, they just

210
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.310
throw windows around. I'll throw
the windows over to the

211
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.660
side. Then I'm like, Oh,
I'm going to come back

212
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.100
to that. I'm going to
come back to that. And

213
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.380
I focus on the middle.
So having a middle is

214
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.780
a big deal. So it's
really two things just having

215
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.940
a middle and just having
as much display space as

216
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.770
you can. I mean, sometimes
I'll hear developer say, Oh,

217
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.540
why don't you just get
a giant 30 inch monitor?

218
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.420
I'm like, well, why not
get two giant 30 inch

219
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.610
monitors or three? I mean,
it's not a zero sum

220
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.580
game where you have one
giant monitor. I really want

221
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.710
to, you really want to
have to spin around in

222
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.410
your office chair just to
check your email. You know,

223
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.600
I mean, there comes a
time where I think what

224
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.770
he's talking about is filling
up 170, 160 degrees of

225
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.590
your visual space. Now, now
you're now the problem goes

226
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.630
from your wrist to your
neck. I mean, there's, there's,

227
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.240
there's wasted peripheral vision there.
I mean the greatest monitor

228
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.770
set up I've ever seen
was the one that we

229
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.500
did on that we talked
about on the monorail show.

230
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.110
When we talked to the,
the guys from Ellucian software,

231
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.140
they've got a big 30
inch, middle 16 by nine

232
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.830
monitor. That's running like 20,
20, 48 by something I've

233
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.790
seen. And then they took
two 22 inch 16 by

234
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.480
nines and turn them on
their sides. And the width

235
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.940
of them happened to be
the exact height of the

236
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.840
30 inch monitor in the
middle. So Richard Campbell has, he's

237
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.320
got a, he's got a
30 inch in two 24

238
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.820
is I think on both
sides. Now Jeff is my

239
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.380
machine gonna be able to
run that kind of Rez?

240
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.100
Oh absolutely. You should have
no problem. But I think

241
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.590
that's a brilliant configuration. And
that's exactly the kind of

242
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.420
insight I want to get.
When you build your own

243
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.180
PC, you have the flexibility
of using three monitors. So

244
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.130
like use it, do it.
This is what sets you

245
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.260
apart. I mean, granted, you're
not, it's not going to

246
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.420
make you a genius programmer,
but you know, this is

247
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.550
the whole point of going
to all this effort is

248
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.300
to have these new and
interesting options. And I love

249
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.790
the configure described with one
in the middle and the

250
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.920
two on the sides rotated
to match the height. The

251
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.540
only thing you've got to
watch out for, with rotation,

252
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.830
and this is a subtle
point clear type. Okay. So

253
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:59.190
clear you've changed the RGB
orientation of the pixels. So

254
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.650
all of a sudden, instead
of three X horizontal resolution,

255
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.950
you have three X vertical
resolution. And to my knowledge

256
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.670
clear type currently can't change
its orientation. So you gotta

257
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.610
be a little careful there.
That's true. I have personally

258
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.320
noticed that. Well, when you
say you gotta be a

259
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.660
little careful, isn't that a
deal breaker? No, it's not

260
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.310
a deal breaker. It's just
depends on what you're using

261
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.200
them for. I mean, if
you're, if you're sitting close

262
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.690
to them doing, if you
a designer doing work in

263
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.460
blend and you're spending a
lot of time doing several

264
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.030
items and Christmas and clarity
truly matter. But if you're

265
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.210
just using one monitor for
a SQL enterprise manager and

266
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.220
one for outlook in the
middle monitor is where you

267
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.060
live in visual studio. I
think that's perfectly reasonable. I'd

268
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.800
have to, I'd have to
see it to pass judgment.

269
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.140
It's it's truly amazing. I
may, I may think about

270
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.880
given that one of the
thing though, I don't want

271
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.040
to waste anything. I've already
got a perfectly good 20

272
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.680
inch monitor and a 22
and 16 by nine. So

273
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.790
I've got to figure out
what I can do to

274
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.600
conserve those existing monitors. There
is a lot to be

275
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.630
said for having matching sizes,
because I'll tell you at

276
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.060
home, I have matching sizes
and it works. They're slightly

277
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.760
different and it is a
little annoying because things just

278
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.950
sort of warp as they
go from one monitor to

279
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.010
the other. And it's inserting
it is nice to have

280
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.810
alignment on your monitors. Well
specifically DPI alignment. Yeah. I

281
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.450
would almost say you can
do that, but it's physically,

282
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.070
they have to have sort
of the same DPI for

283
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.040
the effect to really work.
It's absolute opt for it

284
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.170
to be optimum. It'll still
be good. But if you

285
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.840
want optimal, I would almost
say sell those on eBay

286
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.810
or just, you know, donate
them or, but just get

287
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.060
matching monitors. You will be
happier in the end. Well,

288
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.160
certainly the wife acceptance factor
won't allow me to do

289
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.990
that. I need to be
pretty specific about what I

290
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.300
do with my money, but
let's, let's move on to

291
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.700
the CPU because one of
the things that I said

292
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.590
is I want this thing
to be obscenely fast, but

293
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.030
I want it to be
as cheap as possible. And

294
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.430
I think the whole thing
is come in under, I

295
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.590
think we're at 1800 bucks.
The last time we talked

296
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.560
and we're talking about a
quad core here, and there's

297
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.680
a gentleman in the comments
of show 69 named Abdu

298
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.650
who comments a lot on
my blog. He always has

299
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.580
a lot of really thoughtful,
thoughtful comments. And he says,

300
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.030
you know what exactly is
a developer's machine? Is it

301
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.610
a machine that has vs
2005? I mean, everything else

302
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.590
is fine. If I have
fast memory and fast, hard

303
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.810
drives, I'm cool. He says,
I'm not sure what a

304
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.640
dual or quad core is
going to buy. You have

305
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.760
XP and visual studio are
not going to optimize themselves

306
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.880
when they see more than
one CPU, he says he

307
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.830
doesn't believe that XP does
well with parallel jobs is

308
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.490
a quad core overkill for
what I did. I don't

309
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.920
think so. In fact, I
think as developers, we should

310
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.920
be on the cutting edge
in terms of multi-core future.

311
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.220
If you predict sort of
the future of where CPS

312
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.660
are going to go, you're
not going to have one

313
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.270
CPU running at 20 gigahertz,
not going to happen. The

314
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.600
physics don't work, what is
going to happen is you're

315
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.060
going to have a core
running at say four gigahertz

316
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.930
with like 64 different processors
on it. So if nothing

317
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.840
else, as a developer, you
want to be experiencing this

318
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.870
multi-core future and thinking about,
Hey, how do I make

319
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.930
my app run faster without
relying on the crutch of,

320
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.530
Oh, let's just increase the
megahertz. You gotta actually fundamentally

321
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.200
code a different way, but
I think it's valuable from,

322
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.930
from on that level. And
then on a practical level,

323
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.270
I know a lot of
people complain that Vista is

324
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.060
slower, but Vista does a
lot more stuff than XP.

325
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.940
It's doing windows defender in
the background, it's doing indexing.

326
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.970
It's doing, you know, tons
of, you know, UAC is

327
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.220
going on in the background.
It's doing a lot more

328
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.620
stuff. I mean, it's, you
know, a five year older

329
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.990
operating system, you would expect
it to do more. So

330
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.260
since it's doing more, it's
multitasking more. So if each

331
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.290
little task has its own
core, like if antivirus has

332
00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.540
its own core, you're going
to have a better experience.

333
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.570
So do you think that
this, I mean, what's the

334
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.520
best way to utilize these
other cores as an app

335
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.850
developer? Or does this mean
that some little shareware application

336
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.530
that I decide to download,
that's going to sit in

337
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.130
the tray might start forking
off other processes to do

338
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.530
some works in order to
get those processes running on

339
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.080
different cores, Right? So the
way scheduling works and you

340
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.580
most modern operating systems are
very good at scheduling tests.

341
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.700
They send tasks to an
idle CPU. So if you

342
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.360
have word Excel, visual studio,
SQL server running, and you

343
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.610
have a four core machine,
basically each one of those

344
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.520
gets in effect kind of
a private core to play

345
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.520
on. It's really shared resource,
but whoever's available will service

346
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.550
requests. So there's four guys
in the queue now waiting

347
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.800
to service these requests. Jeff,
do you ever set the

348
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.640
affinity on your processes when
Justin asked that you nailed

349
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.470
it? Carla, my first question
was like, do I have

350
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.690
to tell outlook to stay
on core three? Or is

351
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.820
this going to happen for
me? This is what I

352
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.770
call useless tweaking. Okay. So
affinity in certain very specific

353
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.830
instances can have effects, but
for general purpose sort of

354
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.680
applications that are doing a
lot of, you know, just

355
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.310
general purpose computing tests, there's
really no value in micromanaging

356
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.660
the CPU time like that.
But that's what the, the,

357
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.790
the operating system scheduler does.
And it does a very

358
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.230
good job at it. Just
not something you really need

359
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.720
to think about. I sure
feel a lot better when

360
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.940
I right. Click on something
in task manager and up

361
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.320
too high or above average
on priority. It sure seems

362
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.570
to make a difference to
me sometimes. But Jeff, that's

363
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:58.350
always been my, my thought
too, as you know, the

364
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.250
operating system scheduler is, is
far better at keeping track

365
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.480
of those things. Then you
are in real time, Right?

366
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.280
And it's just like in
writing and.net, I would have

367
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.470
people that were constantly like
trying to outsmart the framework.

368
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.060
It's like, let me think
about what the framework is

369
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.030
doing and let me like,
you know, manually garbage collect

370
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.850
right now. And it's almost
always a bad idea and

371
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.830
it's sort of the same
Avenue. You can do it.

372
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.170
And there are specific instances
where it actually will help,

373
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.350
but they're really rare. So
basically just let the operator

374
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.450
out of our operating system,
do you know, do its

375
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.660
job and don't sweat the
small stuff, but that said,

376
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.820
and also priority is another
one that can actually be

377
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.400
very dangerous to play with.
I have a whole blog

378
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.200
post on sort of the
danger of sort of manipulating

379
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.600
priority. It's something developers love
to do. Oh, I can

380
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.460
create a new thread. Oh
wow. I can set the

381
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.200
priority as a threat. Right.
You know, and then they

382
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.540
set it to like some
extremely high priority and it

383
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.460
locks up their machine or
just, there's a lot of

384
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.250
bad things that can happen
if you micromanage this stuff.

385
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.370
So, All right. So that's
a very excellent segue because

386
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.520
one of the other comments
on show 69 was by

387
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.760
a gentleman named Matt. And
he says, Carl is such

388
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:05.750
a girl about overclocking now,
Jeff, what is that all

389
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.840
about? I think, what did
I say on that episode?

390
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.720
You basically said you didn't
think overclocking was, was worth

391
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.380
the effort. They said, what
Jeff just said is don't

392
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.570
micromanage this thing, let it
do it, let it do

393
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.420
its job. So to kind
of defend that against what

394
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.870
you just said, Jeff, how
has overclocking differently? I feel

395
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.660
I have to defend being
called a girl about overclocking

396
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.910
here. First. It was said
with, it was said with

397
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.820
a smiley face that helps.
No. Sure. I understand. I'm

398
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.400
probably the reason that I
don't worry about it is

399
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.970
because I'm not a gamer.
And I think probably overclocking

400
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.160
is, you know, that's what
the gamers do to get

401
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.580
more, you know, I never
had a need to overclock

402
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.980
my PC, but see I
wanted to overclock it because

403
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.040
I told Jeff what my
original price point was. I

404
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.660
think I said it was
four grand. And then, and

405
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.250
then I was told by
my wife that it was

406
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.910
not in fact four grand.
And I said, Jeff, how

407
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.190
can I get another thousand
dollars out of this without

408
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:09.080
actually spending another thousand dollars?
Jeff. So, so let me

409
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.690
first answer that the criticism
of this is micromanagement by

410
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.690
first saying that it absolutely
is micromanagement. The fact that

411
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.840
we're building a PC. I
mean, you, you could go

412
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.670
to Dell and buy and
have Dell do the work

413
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.430
that we're going to do.
So we've already committed to

414
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.010
micromanaging. At this point, we
said, you know, look the

415
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.930
kind of control we need
over the PC. We're going

416
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.870
to micromanage this part of
what we're going to do.

417
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.990
So overclocking is a way
of extracting more value out

418
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.890
of that time. So just
building a stock PC is,

419
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.770
you know, it feels like
a way even more of

420
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.780
a waste of time, because
at least if you build

421
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.720
sort of a custom overclocked
PC, you can say, look,

422
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.640
you know, I built it
myself, but look, this thing

423
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.940
goes, you know, 20% faster
than it would normally go.

424
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.520
I saved a thousand dollars
over the CPU that I

425
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.400
would've paid for to get
that speed. And I have

426
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.810
everything exactly the way I
want it. So by definition,

427
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.860
we've entered sort of in
a position of micromanaging by

428
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.290
design because we want to,
we enjoy it. We get

429
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.820
something back out of it.
So it's a reasonable, Well,

430
00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.740
let me ask you this
because I'm on the verge

431
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.640
of having my mind changed
here by Jeff, Jeff. I

432
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.280
don't know that much about
overclocking because I'm not a

433
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.470
gamer, as I said, and
I never felt that it

434
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.700
was something that was necessary,
but do you, do you

435
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.560
think it's safe? I mean,
is it something that's safe

436
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.660
to do? And if it
was, if it is safe,

437
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:29.970
why didn't they come over
clocked in the first place?

438
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.570
Well, they do now from
day, There are some doses

439
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.500
and send in fact our
oral clock. They're very, very

440
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.890
expensive though. So those are
exorbitantly. So they charge a

441
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.500
premium to set a flip
a bit in the bios.

442
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.420
Well, I think they set
a premium to have an

443
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.000
individual human being flip a
bit in the bios and

444
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.680
then burn it in for
a day and do all

445
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.270
the kinds of stuff that
Jeff's doing. You know, it's,

446
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.220
it's not some, not every
processor can be guaranteed over

447
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.620
clock. I mean, they have
a certain personality to them.

448
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.340
They're they are organic things
and you know, one might

449
00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.200
be over clockable and one
might not. I mean, they're

450
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.260
not always stable. And when
you answer this question, Jeff

451
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.570
talked to me about safety.
I mean, one of the

452
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:11.100
guys commons commented on my
post about the building of

453
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.630
this machine and how it
was gonna be over clock.

454
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.730
And he said, he'd had
trouble with a compiler spitting

455
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.210
out bad code and an
overclocked system. Well, that'd be

456
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.290
normal for you. Right. I'm
just kidding. I'm just kidding.

457
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.640
So my philosophy here is,
okay, it's kind of like

458
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.920
the philosophy that I have
towards code. And to me,

459
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.080
there's a lot of parallels.
There's a synergy between the

460
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.880
software and the hardware. Not
that I wanna spend all

461
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.590
my time messing around with
hardware, but I think there's,

462
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.770
there's lessons there that apply
to both sort of disciplines.

463
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.800
And one of those lessons
is it's kind of fun

464
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.770
to break stuff. Like it's
fun to see the failure

465
00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:45.780
modes, because if I can
see it fail, if I

466
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.300
can understand the failure, if
I can take it and

467
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.660
break it and then fix
it, I now understand what's

468
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.690
actually happening. Right? So a
lot of some developers, if

469
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.550
you gave them a PC
and their PC starts started

470
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.630
blue screening, they're like, what
do I do? I'm I'm

471
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.170
completely hosed my machine's blue
screening. Whereas I would go,

472
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.200
let's look at this machine.
Let's, you know, I understand

473
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.330
why machines blue screen, because
I've caused them to blue

474
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.790
screen. Like heat is a
really common problem. So one

475
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:09.930
of the first things I
do say, you know, what

476
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.690
opened the case, put a
house fan blowing directly on

477
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.640
it. If it's still blue
screens, then I can tell

478
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.220
you it's not a heat
problem. It's something else. And

479
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.890
then start swapping parts out.
So I've gone from being

480
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.510
a guy who has to
take my car to a

481
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.390
really expensive mechanic because I
don't know what to do

482
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.640
to guy who can like
change my own tires. If

483
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.080
you know, I get a
flat tire on the highway.

484
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.570
And I think there's a
lot of utility in having

485
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.580
some of those skills, not
all of them, but, but

486
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.920
enough to be converse and
enough to be, you know,

487
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.840
if you get yourself into
trouble, you can get yourself

488
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.330
back out of trouble. So,
so that's sort of my

489
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.040
philosophy there is, is I
want to be able to

490
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.460
break it so that I
can understand it. Now you

491
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.160
can see why I asked
Jeff to build this for

492
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.920
me. Sure. I guess I'm
just getting old guys. You

493
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.050
know, I used to have
the energy to go after

494
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.960
why my machine is blue
screen. Now I just kick

495
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.750
it. You know, It's totally
valid position too. I just

496
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.430
want to emphasize that. I'm
not saying this is the

497
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:01.930
correct right way. And if
you're not doing it this

498
00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.000
way, you're not doing it.
The wholly approved way, it

499
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.520
is totally valid to outsource
this and say, look, you

500
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.920
know what? I let don't
worry about that. You know,

501
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.430
somebody else anyway, there was
a great, great comment on

502
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.510
my blog. And I just
want to read it to

503
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.760
you as an example from
another field. I think it's

504
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.300
similar to how you'll frequently
see celebrity chefs on PBS,

505
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.880
go to a winery, an
organic farm or a bakery.

506
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.100
They aren't going to learn
something there that will make

507
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.800
or break their ability to
cook a specific dish. But

508
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.530
as a master craftsman, they're
passionate about their tools and

509
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.110
ingredients. They want to know
everything they can about them.

510
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.090
And I think that's what
it's about. It's like saying,

511
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.030
Hey, I'm so into this,
I just want to do

512
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.070
this, right. It doesn't make
me better than you. It

513
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.480
doesn't make me worse than
it was just something that

514
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.230
I personally find interesting. I
enjoy that aspect of it

515
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.090
and I want to explore
it. And it does kind

516
00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.380
of feed back in and
sort of make you a

517
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.350
better developer. And in some
ways I think Really that's

518
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.640
a very, very compelling argument.
Sometimes people say that, like

519
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.620
if I go traveling, why
do I bother learning a

520
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.810
local language? I can just
stay at the holiday Inn.

521
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.910
You know, it's the same
kind of thing. It's not

522
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.550
in any way meeting, making
any kind of a qualitative

523
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.320
value judgment about one person's
style versus another person's style.

524
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.890
You know, if you want
to go to Africa and

525
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.050
eat at burger King, you
know, the burger Kings are

526
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.900
there. I mean, they're there.
I mean, you can totally,

527
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.510
you can stay in Bulawayo
Zimbabwe at the holiday Inn

528
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.980
and you can eat at
burger King and there's nothing

529
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.730
wrong with that. That's just
not how I roll. And

530
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.770
then that's not how Jeff
rolls. No. Sure. Right. Yeah.

531
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.180
So hang on though. I
didn't think we answered the

532
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.930
question about is, is the,
is the overclock system going

533
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.780
to be correct? How much
have we overclocked our system

534
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.300
from, Well, how do you
know your code is correct?

535
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.640
This is the whole philosophy
of like unit testing. My

536
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.220
torture test is a unit
test on the hardware, right?

537
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.940
I'm just sitting there running
prime 95 for instances, one

538
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.220
for each core for hours
and hours and hours until

539
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.540
I'm fully confident Prime number
generator that just keeps calling

540
00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.670
or something. What is it?
Prime 95 is a prime

541
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.700
number generator, but as one
of the side effects, it

542
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.950
turned out to be really
hard on CPU. So they

543
00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.490
actually added a menu item
based on its popularity as

544
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.060
a CPU sort of testing
tool to what, to do

545
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.010
various kinds of torture tests
in school. Cause you can

546
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.360
adjust the formula based on
the size of the prime,

547
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.740
the prime number. You're calculating
it either loads like just

548
00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.260
the CPU, the level one
level, two cache. Or if

549
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.330
you do a big enough
one, it starts loading the

550
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.490
memory as well because these
things get too big to

551
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.530
fit in the cash. It's
a really great tool. I

552
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.460
love it. And it exposes
overclocking failures really rapidly, which

553
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.560
is another reason people like
it. Like you may think

554
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.810
you're stable. You could like
compile code all day long

555
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.920
and use internet Explorer or
Firefox all day long. But

556
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.630
the minute you fire up
prime 95, you're going to

557
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.300
fail. And that's why we
love it so much. Cool.

558
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.260
So is there anything we
missed? Well, I think one

559
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.460
last question we didn't cover
that came in all of

560
00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.200
the comments was about whether
or not raid be it

561
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.520
software or hardware was important
to the developer PC. Ah,

562
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.630
well before Jeff chimes. And
I'll just say, I think

563
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.980
I'm mirroring with hardware raid
a system drive is a

564
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.880
necessity today. I, I wouldn't,
I wouldn't build any new

565
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.990
machines that didn't have the
system drive mirrored. I just,

566
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.970
I, you know, I just
don't want to worry about

567
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.610
losing stuff, so Right. And,
and I, and I'll follow

568
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.470
on with Carl's statement by
saying that is the one

569
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.200
method of raid that I
think is absolutely safe and

570
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.520
totally recommendable is if you
want redundancy, mirroring is great.

571
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.290
Cause it's just a binary
copy. So if at any

572
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.410
0.1 drive fails, you just
literally toss it and put

573
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.880
the other one back in
and you're back in business.

574
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.990
There's nothing complicated to figure
out about raid a raid

575
00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.280
mirroring. Now on the downside
of raid though, beyond mirroring

576
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.800
is there's all these different
variants, like many, many different

577
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.800
variants of rates, some are
for performance or for redundancy

578
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.910
and some do both, but
it's all complexity, right? So

579
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.610
you're always balancing how complex
do I want my system

580
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:53.180
build to be versus how,
you know, how reliable and

581
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.340
simple to work on and
understandable do I want it

582
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.010
to be? I've had a
bad luck with a lot

583
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.500
of motherboard raid implementations where
they tend to be very

584
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.550
specific, very proprietary and particularly
raid striping, which a lot

585
00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.240
of people do for performance
where the reads are. It's

586
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.790
very dangerous because it doubles
your chance of drive failure.

587
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.310
And on top of that,
it doesn't really improve performance

588
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.360
really enough to justify. So
my general recommendation with rate

589
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.510
is, you know, just be
really careful with it. I

590
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.640
would, I would advise sort
of shying away from it

591
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.830
unless you have some really
compelling need. Like you do,

592
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.110
you do video, video editing
and you know, that's the

593
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.140
one thing you need. That's
fine. So it's a question

594
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.600
of like, where's your bottleneck,
right? So when we're building

595
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.510
this developer PC, we're building
a PC free of major

596
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.780
bottlenecks, but on a video
editing PC, the disc might

597
00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.330
be more of a bottleneck
than a developer PC. So

598
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.270
that might be a rational
argument at that point. So

599
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.550
I would probably say if
I am putting words in

600
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.880
your mouth, Jeff, that a
10,000 RPM or a 15,000

601
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.650
RPM system drive would be
a better investment mirrored than

602
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.110
a mirror drive. No, I
think Jeff, because I don't

603
00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:01.040
think the system we built
is married, not married. Well,

604
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.810
if you're trying to save
money, you probably don't want

605
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.230
to buy two wrapped doors,
you know? Right. That's right.

606
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.810
So, so it's again a
question of why have two

607
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.570
drives that when you could
have one, right? That's the

608
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.570
simplest, the argument. So rather
than two 7,200 RPM drive

609
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.260
in, you know, a striped
mode for speed just by

610
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.360
one Raptor and you'll get
all the same benefits. This

611
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.790
goes for video as well.
I think Scott was saying,

612
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.910
why mirror? You know, and
yeah, my question is, should

613
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.100
I buy another drive? Should
I put another drive in

614
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.170
the sheet there? Because it
really comes down to ultimately

615
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.460
how much of your time
is worth? What does a

616
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.430
rap tour cost right now?
150 gig, 10,000 RPM wrapped

617
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.650
or Jeff, if your system
drive blows up, is it

618
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.140
worth the time that it's
going to take to whether

619
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.060
with a raid set up,
but let's what does that

620
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:45.940
worth? Jeff? 200 bucks. Okay.
So one 30. So let's

621
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.890
say that you're a consultant
and you're paid one 30

622
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.100
an hour. So you're doing
your work in the middle

623
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.710
of something. And the last
backup that you did was

624
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:58.720
last night. So if you
are running raid and drive

625
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.570
dies, you keep working. If
you're not running Ray or

626
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.810
in your, excuse me, if
you have mirroring and your

627
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.840
drive dies, you're cool. If
you don't, then you're going

628
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.140
to lose more than an
hour as time. Definitely. If

629
00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.810
you're a consultant and you're
doing mission critical work, well,

630
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.770
raid mirroring won't guarantee you
against a corrupt NTFS volume

631
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.710
or a screwed up registry.
If a drive goes down

632
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:33.940
for want of $130, you,
you may suffer, right? But

633
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.890
everybody has a lot of
different backup strategies. I know

634
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:40.030
Scott, you probably have backup
strategies. So you might decide,

635
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.970
you know, as much as
I'm backing up, just another

636
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.770
piece that I have to
add, it's completely up to

637
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.200
you. No, that's totally valid
for me. Folder share is

638
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.570
my mate folder share and
to version are my major

639
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.630
backup strategies. I mean, for
me, I've got my data

640
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.110
spread across five different machines
and photo share, backs them

641
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.120
up within a few seconds
of things changing. So I'm

642
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.560
pretty comfortable. I've also got
several offsite backups. So while

643
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.210
I would still lose an
hour, cause I'd have to

644
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.930
re image the whole system.
I probably lose four hours.

645
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.850
You know, basically let's just
say this, let's be Frank.

646
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.070
You lose a system, drive
you down for the day.

647
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.670
Right? Pretty much you have
raid pretty much if you,

648
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.680
yeah. And even if you
do have raid, they're still

649
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.660
getting down on your hands
and knees on doing that

650
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.330
drive and you're going to
lose maybe an hour, half

651
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:26.530
an hour at tops. Well
guys, I think we've set

652
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.830
ourselves, right. Don't you think
Scott? I think so. I

653
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.210
think we need to just
come up with a title

654
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.980
for this, you know, there's
little a podcasts, the Hanselman

655
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.790
it's part, but the building
a developer's PC this time.

656
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.010
We're serious. Yeah. I think
that, that works for me.

657
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.640
Jeff. Thanks for joining us.
You're welcome. I enjoyed it.

658
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.510
Tell us about this new
machine Scott, when you get

659
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.110
it all up and running,
it's going to be very

660
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.380
cool. Alrighty. We'll see you
next week on Hansel minutes.
