episode, Scott talks with doctor
Neil Rudin about vision-based computing.

9
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.230
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

10
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.750
Hansel minutes and on Skype.
I've got dr. Neil Rudin.

11
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.700
How are you? I'm good,
Scott, how are you doing?

12
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.500
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm
looking at a connect on

13
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
my desk here, plugged into
my PC, and I'm looking

14
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.460
at a leap motion, neither
of which I have used

15
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.970
lately. And I'm feeling pretty
sad about that. I'm not

16
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.190
sure if I'm more sad
about the connect or the

17
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.740
leap motion, but the point
is I'm not using minority

18
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.850
report gestures in order to
control my computer, but I

19
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.420
have the hardware, but you
probably don't have the software,

20
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.150
right. I'm starting to think
that that's it. So I

21
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.820
want to understand today, what
is keeping motion based computing

22
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.500
from taking off in the
way that I think it

23
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.060
should take off and whether
or not my head is

24
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.360
wrong about it? Yeah, it's
a good course. I mean,

25
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.590
I think the, the question
of, you know, is the

26
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.250
hardware ready is, is probably
a fair starting point, but

27
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.090
I think there's also the
question of, are we ready

28
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.730
in terms of the way
we use computers or the

29
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.390
way we think about computers?
I think a lot of

30
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.430
things need to change. You
know what I mean? In

31
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.910
the seventies, people had touchscreens
the tech, the hardware technology

32
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.590
was there. Now it was
a lot rougher than it

33
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.570
is now, but we were
not ready to go, you

34
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.150
know, go to a consumer
with a touch screen. It

35
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.110
was a rough experience. And
I think, you know, it's

36
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.630
took 10, 20 years to
get to a point where

37
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.790
we were even close to
being ready. And I think

38
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.060
vision-based computing. And that's really
what you're talking about here

39
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.600
with infrared cameras and sensors
is, is a, is a

40
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.130
different category of computing. Vision-based
computing is going to create

41
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.660
a, you know, a range
of different experiences. Those experiences

42
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.990
are still early stages. We're
exploring what they could be.

43
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.810
And I think right now
there was obviously a, a

44
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.960
clear rush to the gaming
market connects, you know, kind

45
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.500
of history in terms of
it being released. As you

46
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.040
know, from project Natel for
exports is very clear that

47
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.370
it's focused on gaming and
there's a niche there where

48
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.450
it makes a lot of
sense whether it's social gaming

49
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.130
or, or multi-user experiences in
front of a large screen

50
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.300
kind of living room or
lounge room experience that that's

51
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.670
a very specific marketplace where
Microsoft has clearly done very

52
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.520
well. Leap is an interesting
one because they're trying to

53
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.390
bring the focus closer to
a personal computer world and

54
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.730
personal experience. And what does
that mean? Well, I don't

55
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.340
think anyone really knows what
it means. I think that's

56
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.050
fundamentally one of the challenges
is we don't know. What

57
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.040
does that experience mean? I
mean, right now, if you

58
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.930
think about that close one
foot experience to your screen,

59
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.330
you already have some very
optimized over, you know, 30,

60
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.060
40 years we've been working
on experiences using keyboards over

61
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.450
20 plus years, we've been
working on experiences using mice,

62
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.060
and you're trying to introduce
a new input device, which

63
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.750
probably does have a place,
but the experience is still

64
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.600
very rough. And so you're
saying, well, Hey, this is

65
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.490
just sitting on my desk.
I'm not using it well,

66
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.640
that's because you're comparing something,
that's got a, a one

67
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.230
or two year experience lifetime
with something that's got a

68
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.680
20 or 30 year experience
lifetime. So yeah, there's a

69
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.600
way to go. There's no
doubt about that, but I

70
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.480
think there's some very obvious
maybe to me niche markets

71
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.640
where this makes a lot
of sense. So in the

72
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.190
no touch space where you
really don't want to be

73
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.180
touching a keyboard or mouse,
healthcare is a clear one

74
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.860
to me that there's some
opportunity space here. Every time,

75
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.150
you know, within a hospital
or a healthcare environment, someone

76
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.610
touches a keyboard or mouse,
really. It needs to be

77
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.480
cleaned down. And yeah, if
you could interact with a

78
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.450
computer without having to touch
anything, there are some advantages

79
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.060
to that. So I, you
know, I think there's some

80
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.230
spaces where people can get
some early stage wins, but

81
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.630
I also think that there's
a long way to go

82
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.590
in terms of evaluating the
experience and improving the experience.

83
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.240
And I think it's going
to be a long incremental

84
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.290
process. Now, hopefully it won't
be 20 years, but I

85
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.650
suspect it may be five
to 10. So you're saying

86
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.220
that the, the expectation I
have of picking up a

87
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.160
device at best buy this
consumer electronics store and just

88
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.620
drop into my machine, plug
in the USB, and then

89
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.590
I'm off and running with
the kind of immediate productivity

90
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.040
that I'd have purchasing a
mouse is an unreasonable expectation

91
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.950
on my part. I think
it is an unreasonable expectation.

92
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.500
Yeah. And I think it's,
we're at the stages now,

93
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.700
whereas a techie or a
geek, it's our, it's our

94
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.160
job to work out. What
is it that's missing and

95
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.930
what is it kind of
do to improve this? And

96
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.670
what, what can we iterate
on? What can we, you

97
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.480
know, do over the next
12 months, 24 months to,

98
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.060
to make the experience a
little bit better, or to

99
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.330
at least hit some markets
where there's an opportunity and

100
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.400
say, Hey, this is really
cool. If you were to

101
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.350
use it for ABC and
just do those, you know,

102
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.800
get those things working. I
mean, you probably remember right

103
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.450
when the mouse was first
introduced onto a PC, people

104
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.000
were very kind of curious
as to why, why, why

105
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.160
do you need this thing?
Well, what's the purpose of

106
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.320
it? You know, should it,
should we really care? Like

107
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.530
I can do all my,
you know, my Lotus one,

108
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.450
two, three, and my WordPerfect
purely keyboard trip. So what

109
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.580
the heck, why do I
need this thing? So, you

110
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.830
know, and I think over
time it became very clear

111
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.050
that the mouse has a,
has a, as a pointing

112
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.760
device with a high level
of granularity for touching specific

113
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.970
spaces very easily. And it
has a place, but you

114
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.550
know, there's lots of other
devices that still stay in

115
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.310
the niche. Like think of,
you know, people use my

116
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.470
spot, how many people use
track balls or how many

117
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.090
people use external tablets. And,
and yet there's still very

118
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.600
valuable input devices for certain
markets. Like if you're in

119
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.570
Canada design, you would probably
spend a lot of your

120
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.530
time with a stylist in
your hand, they're using an

121
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.010
external tablet. So, you know,
but that's not for the

122
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.840
everyday consumer. You could use
it, but you don't. So

123
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.420
that brings up an interesting
question. So just to give

124
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.820
you a little lay of
the land here, I've got

125
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:42.310
my regular, what do you
call us? Microsoft ergonomic mouse.

126
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.360
I've got my keyboard. I
have a logic tech touch

127
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.590
pad. It's the logic techs,
six 50. It's a little,

128
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.620
it's like a portable track
pad, right? Yep. I use

129
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.260
that for scrolling around two
fingers, scroll. I'm a big

130
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.540
fan of, to Springer finger
scroll. And then on my

131
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.840
left here, I've got a
Wacom tablet that I use

132
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.080
for, for Photoshop, but it's
pretty clear that if you

133
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.770
stack ranked these, including also
the, the leap motion and

134
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.800
the connect, the mouse is
being used 95% of the

135
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.840
time, the, the track pad
and the misuse being used

136
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.520
maybe 5% of the time.
Although if you were maybe

137
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.250
a primarily a Mac user
or a magic trackpad user,

138
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.340
you would find yourself using
the trackpad 90% of the

139
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.430
time the Wacom is being
used as a specialized input

140
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.250
device. It's it's like, I
would look at it like,

141
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.840
you know, you've got your
X box controller that you

142
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.060
use all the time, and
then you've got your driving

143
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.360
controller that you use when
you're playing driving games. Do

144
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.420
you think that the kind
of vision-based technologies like leap

145
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.290
motion and connect will ever
reach the kind of general

146
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.360
purpose use as a mouse
or keyboard? Or will they

147
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.740
always be the Wacom tablets
of the, of, of interaction?

148
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.190
Oh, that's a tough question.
I think that there, there

149
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.860
will be an increase of
their usage as people discover

150
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.180
new ways of creating software
interfaces for them. I, you

151
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.180
know, whether it will ever
exceed in terms of the

152
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.300
one foot experience sitting right
in front of your computer

153
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.340
will ever exceed the mouse
and keyboard. I doubt, but

154
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.230
for specific scenarios, I suspected
very much will. I think

155
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.830
vision-based computing gets much more
interesting beyond one foot. And

156
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.460
I think that's where connect
really has an opportunity beyond

157
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.900
leap the connect type devices,
where you can be 10

158
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.660
feet away from your computer
and you don't have, you

159
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.580
know, the keyboard and mouse
right in front of you.

160
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.220
And yet you can be
interacting with it. I think

161
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.630
we're not really thinking about
those things because we're so

162
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.960
stuck in this very personal
computer world. And I think

163
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.230
this is actually leads to
a much bigger conversation around,

164
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.270
you know, are we moving
from an era of personal

165
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.790
devices? Not that they're ever
gonna go away, we're always

166
00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.390
have personal devices, but into
an era of many more

167
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.560
shared devices as well. So,
you know, the living room

168
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.200
is already is already, you
know, breaking ground in that

169
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.390
space where we have shared
computing experiences. Is that going

170
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.490
to be something else that
we will find in other

171
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.040
parts of the house, in
other parts of the workplace,

172
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.820
you think of meeting rooms
and you walk into a

173
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.910
meeting room, you really want
to have a shared computing

174
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.270
experience within that meeting room,
where everyone can engage with

175
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.130
the screen, the projector at
the same time and share

176
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.370
that experience. And I think
we're, we're starting to nudge

177
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.400
ourselves towards that. And I
think vision-based computing really helps

178
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.700
because with cameras, you can
identify who the people are

179
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.510
in that space. Maybe not
personally identified that this is

180
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.070
Scott, and this is Neil,
but you could say, Hey,

181
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.400
there's two people in this
room. And the guy on

182
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.100
the left is moving something
in the garden. The writer's

183
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.400
doing something else. And you
can identify who did what

184
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.350
and, and then visualize that
somehow on a screen or

185
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.750
on a display. And I
think that's where it gets

186
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.630
really interesting. So I think,
yes, possibly you're right. That,

187
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.630
that initial experience with the
leap is a little disappointing

188
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.290
because the space they're trying
to conquer is actually probably

189
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.620
the hardest space to conquer.
Whereas connect is taking a

190
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:25.410
slightly less challenging space in
the distance that it's approaching.

191
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.000
And I think you're very
much need to think when

192
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.210
you think about vision systems,
what is the distance from

193
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.000
the interface that that person
is? Because when you get

194
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.090
really close, you have to
question, why not use touch?

195
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.010
Why not use a mouse?
Why not use a cable?

196
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.300
Yeah. One of the things
that I tried to use

197
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.940
the leap for and tried
to like make it a

198
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.850
part of my day was
scrolling. Cause I want to

199
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.830
be able to lean back
and then kind of make

200
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.610
a kind of a flippant,
upward hand motion to indicate.

201
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.180
I want to scroll within
a webpage that I'm, that

202
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.980
I'm seeing. And it seemed
to me like that was

203
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.870
a very simple constrained motion
that is very unambiguous and

204
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.150
the software and the leap
had a lot of trouble

205
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.450
understanding that because they wanted
a, a within a few

206
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.590
inches of motion with just
one finger or two fingers

207
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.180
spread apart in a very
distinct V pushing forward and

208
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.820
kind of jabbing forward into
the air, flipping up and

209
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.250
then moving in a circle.
So what I took as

210
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.220
being a very kind of
off the cuff hand flip,

211
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.010
you know, in, in any
random direction, they wanted an

212
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.970
extremely precise motion. So they
needed precise input to do

213
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.580
what I wanted to and
to understand my intent. Yeah.

214
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.590
And I think that's a
lot of that is, is,

215
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.150
is around context as well.
So understanding the context that

216
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.810
you're in and, you know,
again, we're early stages of

217
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.060
this, although it's something that
people have been doing research

218
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.890
in for 40 years plus,
but contextual computing is something

219
00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.510
that we're going to see
more and more of. And

220
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.970
I think we're already starting
to see in terms of

221
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.120
some of the applications that
you have when your personal

222
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.970
device, like your personal device
knows where you are. So

223
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.800
when you look up a
location, it says, do you

224
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.870
want to know how to
get, well, I know where

225
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.940
you are so I can
get you to that location

226
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.020
and the context of you
being in front of your

227
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.320
computer and what you're working
in. What does this hand

228
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.600
movement mean? Well, the, I
think the software that's understanding

229
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.460
that it needs to know,
are you in Excel or

230
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.490
are you in visual studio
or are you in Photoshop?

231
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.000
And they may all mean
different things depending on your

232
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.820
context, or are you on
a Skype call with your

233
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:35.310
friend? You're just waving to
your friend's child. They're all

234
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.030
different contexts. Yeah. We've all
seen that lack of context

235
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.820
with like, my wife will
say something about the Xbox,

236
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.780
but the Xbox hears her
say X-Box right. And then

237
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.280
the, you know, wackiness and
SUSE and context can mean

238
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.530
so many things, right? I
mean, context can mean, you

239
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.740
know, if the Xbox knows
that there's suddenly 40 people

240
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.230
in your house and there's
not usually 40 people in

241
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.710
your house while you're having
a party. So then maybe

242
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.050
it's context is going to
change more towards things around

243
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.280
party based gaming and music.
But while it's really easy

244
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.040
to say that from a
business requirements perspective, it just

245
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.640
takes one sentence, the amount
of work required, and the

246
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.420
privacy concerns around something as
simple as, Hey, I noticed

247
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.580
that there's more people in
your house that are usually

248
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.950
they're in a movie. We
would find that to be

249
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.020
amazing, but in real life
we would find that to

250
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.660
be super creepy. Yeah. And
I think that's, you know,

251
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.880
the conversation around context, although
we're a little off topic

252
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.340
is, is an interesting one
because people want it, but

253
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.070
don't want it. It's a
bit like, you know, people

254
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.060
want to have computers that
understand their daily lives and

255
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.600
can help them further and
really be a true personal

256
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.940
assist. You know, it's kind
of funny, you talk about

257
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:52.430
the context and you think
about things, the personal assistance

258
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.500
that we used to have
with PDAs, and they really

259
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.670
were not very assistive at
all. And yet, you know,

260
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.030
really in order to be,
to have, you know, the

261
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.130
full capability to assist you,
they need to have a

262
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.640
lot of personal information. And
then you counter that with.

263
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.470
Yeah. But I don't want
to give these guys all

264
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.570
my personal information. I don't
want them to know where

265
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.100
I'm shopping. I don't want
them to know that I

266
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.950
played tennis every Wednesday afternoon.
That's none of their business.

267
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.650
Well, if you don't give
that information, you can't get

268
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.250
the context. And so, you
know, it's that, that trade

269
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.020
off. And I think it's
going to be interesting to

270
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.100
see how companies business wise
play off over the next

271
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.680
10 years with that. Because
you know, some companies are

272
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.470
very clearly saying all your
data is ours and we'll

273
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.600
do what we want with
it. And we can provide

274
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.080
some extra contextual smarts because
of that. Then some companies

275
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.300
are saying, no, no, it's
all very much opt in

276
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.030
and you'll have to provide
this information if you want

277
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.100
to provide it. And we
can be a little bit

278
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.540
smarter if you do provide
it. So yeah, it's, it's,

279
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.250
it's a complex issue and
it's, it's not just a

280
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.310
technology issue. It's a social
issue. It's almost a political

281
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.730
issue now as well. Yeah.
I think that when I

282
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.160
think of my favorite scifi
movies, where someone wakes up

283
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.770
in their kitchen and has
this great conversation with their

284
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.190
personal computer, that's on all
of their walls and they

285
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.200
hear about their weather and
all those things. I don't

286
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.330
think anyone thought that would
be in the cloud. Everyone

287
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.660
just assumed that would be
in the house. Right. You'd

288
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.240
have a personal cloud. I
don't think anyone thought multinational

289
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.540
corporations would get that context
to work through things like

290
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.740
Google now without, you know,
by allowing it to escape

291
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.480
our house and go into
the world. And then they

292
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.150
control that. But that is
definitely off topic. I'll have

293
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.460
to do another show on
that, but let me understand

294
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.190
vision-based computing and how it
works at the hardware level.

295
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.680
So I understand that the
connect, which is on right

296
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.260
now, I have a connect
for windows, which I think

297
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.640
is different than the one
for, Yeah. Okay. So it's

298
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.190
shooting infrared beams at me
all the time. Like, like

299
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.450
a, like a dot pattern
of infrared. That's correct. You're

300
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.600
being bombarded by infrared with
the whole space that you're

301
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.840
in is being bombarded by
infrared beams. And then the

302
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.540
reflection from those infrared beams
is being picked up by

303
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.530
camera, on the connect device
and that's then detecting once

304
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.370
in the space. So then
the size of the dot

305
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.620
or the, is it the
size of the dot that's

306
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.140
telling it that, Oh, this.is
closer. Therefore, this is bouncing

307
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.840
off his hand, which is
closer. Or is it something

308
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.700
about the speed at which
that the light comes back?

309
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.150
Actually, I have no idea.
I'm a software guy, But

310
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.520
it's something like, something like
that in the sense of

311
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.010
far away dots are far
away, you know, it's a,

312
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.790
Yeah. So it has depth
perception. And of course it

313
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.850
has a traditional camera on
it as well, a color

314
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:36.790
camera. And so, you know,
by getting the, the image

315
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.910
from the color camera, getting
the depth image at the

316
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.260
same time and using some
smart software technology, we can

317
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.380
start to determine, you know,
what is in this space.

318
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.710
And we can do some
pretty cool things with that

319
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.620
in terms of say, Oh,
look, I can see something

320
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.350
that looks like a person
let's try and recognize where

321
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.240
their head is and where
their left arm is and

322
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.310
where their right arm is
and where their legs are.

323
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.670
And then, Oh, look, they're
moving now. Oh, they're moving

324
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.400
their left arm to the
right. Okay. That may be

325
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.740
as a gesture. Let's have
a look at my gesture

326
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.060
recognition table and see whether
the left arm moving towards

327
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.310
the right indicates a gesture.
Oh yes, it does. What

328
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.210
should I do? And based
on that gesture, And these

329
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.460
are higher and higher layers
of abstraction, but at the

330
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.240
lowest layer, you're getting back
a, an array. What kind

331
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.330
of a matrix of data
from the connect that indicates

332
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.210
here's the color stuff that
I saw the color pixels.

333
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:33.050
And here are the depth
Pixels, correct? Yeah. Like the

334
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.110
hardware doesn't give me your
left hand is moving right

335
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.900
to left or whatever. That's
also fun. Okay. And this

336
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.910
is where I think things
fall down because it seems

337
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.370
to me like both the
leap and the connect of

338
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.200
amazing hardware, but from a
software perspective, you know, when

339
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.390
I've, when I've sat down
and tried to program the

340
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.120
connect and they're like, here's
an array of ones and

341
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.150
zeros. I'm like, well, gosh,
okay, well, where's, where's the

342
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.750
hand. And there's the, the
SDK, which gives you some

343
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.260
more context. But I think
we've all had that experience

344
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.500
where we've been using a
connect and then suddenly it'll

345
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.990
take maybe like your left
leg and then just throw

346
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.260
it over your shoulder. And
it's completely insane just for

347
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.390
like a split second. You
know what I mean? It's

348
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.400
doing your thing. You're jogging
in place. And then your

349
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.920
flag flies up in the
air. So that again is

350
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.870
a software challenge. What the
connect does within the connect

351
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.040
SDK is that in first
positions, if it can't detect

352
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.980
exact physicians. So, and sometimes
those can be a little

353
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.100
bit bizarre and sometimes the
exact position it thinks it's

354
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.160
detecting is the, is the
bizarre one fact, the inferred

355
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.540
one makes more sense. So
you can use software to

356
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.320
determine that. In fact, there's
a series of getting started

357
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.270
guides and hands on labs
that I've built with the

358
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.600
connect for windows team that
shows you exactly how to

359
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.880
make some kind of sense
out of that. So, you

360
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.110
know, there are proportions that
are normal human body as,

361
00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.160
and you can look for
those proportions and you can

362
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.890
detect the skeleton that's being
recognized in front of you.

363
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.280
And if you suddenly see
that the next frame, their

364
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.010
knee is above their head,
whereas previously they were standing

365
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.740
up and that's probably an
incorrect frame, so you should

366
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.710
ignore it. And so there's
a lot you can do

367
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:21.590
in software to optimize and
remove those really weird. As

368
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:27.440
you say, kind of erroneous
frames from the picture that

369
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.760
you're using, it's where you
get repeated, weirdness that it

370
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.900
will become a problem. So
if someone is crouching down

371
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.490
and then these really are
above their shoulders, you will

372
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.670
have some issues there because
typical skeleton recognizable, look at

373
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.250
that and go, Hmm, no
idea what to do at

374
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.110
this point. So Is this
similar to voice recognition in

375
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.720
the sense of the better,
the voice recognition gets better

376
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.990
and better? The less possible
things that can be said,

377
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.990
like I've got a voice
recognizer in my car. That's

378
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.230
like from the nineties, it's
like, whatever crap Toyota put

379
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.080
in my car, but it
only understands like 15 words.

380
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.330
So it's actually pretty good.
Fantastic. And it's never wrong,

381
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.970
right? Because it can only
hear me say like volume

382
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.590
up volume down and stuff
like that. And I've even

383
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:17.460
made up like mumbly words
that kind of had the

384
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.760
same cadence and it got
it. Right. So I'm wondering

385
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.180
in the connect world, what
you're describing is that the

386
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.160
body is shaped pretty much
the same for everybody, right?

387
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.380
There's only so many ways
you could go. So you're

388
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.200
basically saying, you're going to
constrain it by saying, we're

389
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.940
going to assume people for
the most part are not

390
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.060
double jointed. Correct. And then
start throwing data out. And

391
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.640
that allows you to be
more accurate. Yeah. Yeah. I

392
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.470
know. I think a lot
of that's about filtering, but

393
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.630
it's also, I mean, one
of the things that Microsoft

394
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.910
is doing is using machine
learning algorithms to improve the

395
00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:52.590
skeleton recognition. And in fact,
it's, it's pretty similar to

396
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.100
the algorithms that are used
for speech recognition, similar to

397
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.430
the algorithms that he used
for machine translation for translating

398
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.430
language is from one language
to another. It's really looking

399
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.150
for patterns that recur and
saying, yes, this is a

400
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.230
valid behavioral pattern and therefore
makes sense. And therefore the

401
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:17.640
skeleton is probably doing this.
So in the 1.7 STK

402
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.660
that was released not long
ago, the connect SDK connect

403
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.130
for windows, SDK introduced two
new interactions. One was a

404
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.600
push or press interaction where
the hand, you know, we're

405
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.230
detecting a hand, is moving
towards the screen. And the

406
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.220
other one is a grip
interaction where we recognize closed

407
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.960
fist as opposed to an
open fist gesture. And those

408
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.610
are both trained, using lots
and lots of video footage

409
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:52.380
and depth footage of people
interacting in front of a

410
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:57.120
connect device, carrying out those
interactions. And then using machine

411
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.780
learning to recognize more does
actually mean because people press

412
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.320
in different ways. Some people
will actually physically move their

413
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.110
whole body and move their
arm towards the screen. Other

414
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.590
people will just tip their
hand down towards the screen.

415
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.850
And yet they're both should
be recognized as press. And

416
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.710
so there there's a lot
of work in terms of

417
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.630
what can be done in
software to improve division systems

418
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.380
and the recognition of people's
interactions. Can you talk a

419
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.790
little bit about the layers,
because I understand that I've

420
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.550
seen the array I've, I've,
I've done the basic connect

421
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.740
SDK stuff where it's like,
okay, here's an array of

422
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.200
ones and zeros, and that
indicates the color data. Here's

423
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.410
the depth data. What lays
on top of that? That

424
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.360
gets me all the way
up to a gesture I

425
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.040
can recognize as a press.
Yeah. A good question. So

426
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.570
There's the, the streams of
information that come in there

427
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.640
is there is a, as
you say, a pure depth

428
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.940
stream and, and a vol
camera stream, and you can

429
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.550
just pull those frames out
and then it's up to

430
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.210
you to have fun with
those beyond that. There's also

431
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.780
a skeleton, recognize it. And
the skeleton recognizing we'll give

432
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.380
you up to six skeletons
that can be recognized in

433
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.170
a space at a time.
Now we only tracking, we

434
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.810
only have the ability to
CPU wise to track two

435
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.860
of the four interactions, but
it will see up to

436
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.670
six. And then from there
you can do things like,

437
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:25.070
okay, now we have the
skeleton, the skeleton is all

438
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.470
broken down into a series
of limbs. So it's an

439
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.120
array of components if you
like of the skeleton. So

440
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.100
you can see left elbow,
right? Elbow, wrist, hand, head,

441
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.810
shoulders, knees, toes. I think
we know that song. And

442
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:48.230
so the taking that skeleton
data, which each skeleton position,

443
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.720
each component of the skeleton
will have a position that

444
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.860
changes each frame. You can
then start doing your own

445
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.070
gestures. So you could say
I'm detecting that the left

446
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.390
arm is moving in relation
to the head and therefore

447
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.910
doing a gesture. And actually
Josh Blake did a video

448
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.600
on the connect for windows
blog recently, where he's showing

449
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.500
how to pick out some
of those gestures by just

450
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.160
detecting a hand position and
a head position and saying,

451
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.220
well, the hand is moving,
you know, closer to the

452
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.160
head or further away from
the head Def or indicating

453
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.090
some kind of wave gesture.
So you've got that. And

454
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.150
then above that, there's also
the connect for windows toolkit

455
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.190
and the connect for windows
toolkit. It gives you a

456
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:35.690
set of controls that already
implement some of these interactions.

457
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.410
So you can actually just
pick up a control and

458
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.220
there's WPF controls and direct
to direct two D direct

459
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.120
three D C plus plus
controls that let you detect

460
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.760
things like the grip gesture
or the press gesture. And

461
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.230
then there's controls built using
those gestures that are a

462
00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.160
button control. The ScrollViewer control
that after the box will

463
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.790
get store to magically detect
the interaction and work with

464
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:09.640
it. Okay, that's all, you've
got the, the color stream,

465
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.760
the depth stream, the skeleton
recognizer, those are coming to

466
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.380
you as frame. So I'm
going to get like an

467
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.530
array of body parts, correct.
As, as fast as the

468
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.530
system can give them to
me, are those body part

469
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.240
or that body part array?
Is that coming from the

470
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.510
connect hardware or is that
coming from this It's coming

471
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:29.270
from software left. So the
hardware, the software is interpreting

472
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.310
the debt straight and doing
the skeleton record. And then

473
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.560
I understand that there's a
near a near mode that

474
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.950
was added in the connect
recently, which is the I'm

475
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.170
sitting in front of my
computer mode as opposed to

476
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.730
the I'm dancing in the
middle. So It's, it's a

477
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.750
closer mode connect for X-Box
doesn't, you know, is really

478
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.820
optimized for that living room
lounge room type experience. It's

479
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.950
not optimized for sitting closer
to the computer. So connect

480
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.910
for windows provided a concept
called the near mode, which

481
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.140
really refocuses and does some
recognition based on the fact

482
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.230
that a skeleton will be
closer to the connect device.

483
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.290
And that could mean one
foot, two foot instead of

484
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:17.840
10 foot from the device
Algorithmically, what is the right

485
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.080
way, or what are people
using to detect things kind

486
00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.960
of over time? It's easy
to be stuck in a

487
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.930
while loop or for-loop and
watch for particular behavior that

488
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.020
happens at an instance, but
this is a stream of

489
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.390
things where I might start
moving my right hand at

490
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.280
one point, and then in
the middle of that right

491
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.550
hand gesture, halfway through, start
moving my left hand. So

492
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.420
I've got things happening over
time at different speeds that

493
00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.900
take different lengths of times,
all of which might be

494
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.190
meaningful to my application that
moves from the average programmers

495
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.480
understanding of four loops and
the occasional link query into

496
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:58.280
a pretty complicated algorithmic and
math type type of stuff

497
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.010
that they might not, not
know how to write. Yeah,

498
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.770
it's fun. Isn't it? How
do you do that? How

499
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.490
do you do that, dr.
Neil? Well, do I need

500
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.560
to degree in a doc
and a PhD to do

501
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.420
this Possibly, although probably not
the, the reality is that

502
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.920
it is, I mean, you
know, at the end of

503
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.650
the day, you've got basic
programming constructs and you need

504
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.920
to start building out patterns
and there's a couple of

505
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.050
things you can do it
at a, at a low

506
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.980
level. You can actually just
start tracking position and noting

507
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.470
that something is going in
a direction. And so you

508
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.530
say, okay, and you know,
left hand is moving, right.

509
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.400
Right-hand is moving up. Is
that going to continue for

510
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.650
a period of time? Is
that going to continue for

511
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.170
a set distance? So you
may only be looking for

512
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.590
these two things to happen
over a distance or these

513
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.320
two things to happen over
a period of time, and

514
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.490
then you can trigger your
activity. But like I said,

515
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.740
the other thing that's kind
of where, where, yes, you

516
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.940
probably do need a bit
more intelligence or a bit

517
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.510
more practice or experiences in
the machine learning side of

518
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:06.110
things, which is where you're
actually taking a lot of

519
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:10.820
existing content or footage of
people doing a certain behavior,

520
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.370
and then letting the machine
go at it, see if

521
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:18.260
it can work out using
some machine learning algorithms, you

522
00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.900
know, what is the, what
is the commonality between these

523
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.670
things? And, you know, the
funny thing is we don't

524
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:25.850
actually know what the, you
know, at the end of

525
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.330
the day, what is it
in is specifically the commonality?

526
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.780
What we know is that
percentage wise, we have a

527
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.130
high percentage result when you
feed in a thousand images

528
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:41.920
of video footage of people
doing this thing, that we

529
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.980
now have a high percentage
success result based on the

530
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.540
output, whatever algorithm looks like.
So, you know, you could

531
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.970
dig into it, I'm sure.
And find out exactly what

532
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.130
the details are and what
it's starting to look for.

533
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.730
But I certainly don't care
too much, as long as

534
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.990
I'm getting a high percentage
result out of it. Really.

535
00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:03.840
So machine learning, you're saying
as a, as an engine,

536
00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.570
we are caring less and
less about what it's learned

537
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.780
and more that it has
learned it. Like you throw

538
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.510
it thousands of video footages
of someone making a press

539
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.390
gesture and it draws a
nice bell curve. And it

540
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:19.200
figures out that how accurate
does that need to look

541
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.790
right? You could say, well,
I want to catch all

542
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.010
the outliers. And then you,
you would catch some of

543
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.010
the people doing weird press
gestures, except it might cause

544
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.520
false positives and other instances.
And then that, that bell

545
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.100
curve is built by the
machine learning, learning algorithm. And

546
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.740
you don't care how it
happened. It just happened. Yeah.

547
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.370
I think we shouldn't care
as day-to-day developers trying to

548
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.940
build something with connect for
windows, you know, how, you

549
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.920
know, the details of how
it happened. You should care

550
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.770
that, Hey, I now have
a new interaction that's recognizable.

551
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:51.330
I'm sure it is actually
scientifically. It's really interesting to

552
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.130
try and work out what
is happening in there because

553
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.000
maybe we can build better
machine learning algorithms from doing

554
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.330
that, but at a high
level, in terms of, as

555
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.960
a developer plugging into the
connect SDK, we should say,

556
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.540
Oh, that's great. You know,
and now have this new

557
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.470
interaction for press that someone
else has done the hard

558
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.580
work for. And that's someone
else's partly scientists, but also

559
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.890
partly machine learning algorithms that
have gone and optimized the,

560
00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:22.500
you know, this is the
highest percentage recognition for that

561
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.310
particular gesture. No they're libraries.
I think Carl Franklin has a

562
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.500
library for connect, but I
assume that there's lots of

563
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.960
different libraries out there. Where
can I teach, connect what

564
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.520
a gesture should look like?
And if I just do

565
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.460
it hundreds of times, it'll
eventually learn, actually One's got

566
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.620
a really nice tool called
it's called gesture pack that

567
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:45.840
you demonstrate a gesture to
it and recorded a couple

568
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.780
of times, and then you,
it will generate the code

569
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:52.260
for you to determine whether
that gesture has been actioned

570
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.650
in front of the connect
device. It's really quite a

571
00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.340
sweet little tool. So yeah,
I'd recommend having a look

572
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.840
at that. There are a
number of them out there,

573
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.150
although I think, you know,
Carl has really done a

574
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:07.140
great job of simplifying it
to kind of, and, and

575
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.510
I guess it's expected of
call really of a visual

576
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.900
basic program as level. So,
you know, you can really

577
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.890
take that thing and just
use it and as is

578
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:19.470
it works and yeah, there
are a lot more out

579
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:22.590
there. There's a lot of
open source libraries out there,

580
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.960
and it depends how deep
you want to go into

581
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.380
it. You know, do you
want to go into analyzing

582
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:34.440
all the, all the details
of the interactions or do

583
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.450
you want to just stay
at a high level, get

584
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.470
something that when someone waves
in a certain direction front

585
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.250
of your screen, it performs
an action. So, you know,

586
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.800
I think it really depends
again, on the context of

587
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.980
your application and what you're
trying to achieve. If you're

588
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.980
trying to achieve something, that's
just grabbing people's attention in

589
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.430
a shopping mall with a
connect device, you probably don't

590
00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:00.110
need to have super detailed
level of recognition. And, you

591
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.840
know, if you miss one
in a hundred people's gestures,

592
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.260
does it really matter? No,
it's not critical. If you're

593
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.450
trying to build something where
you're actually going to be

594
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:13.280
doing some kind of healthcare
of using connect more than

595
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.800
your, it really does matter.
So you want a much

596
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.090
more precise recognition system. And
whether we even have that

597
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.730
yet, I would be surprised
right now. I mean, not,

598
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.260
not with off the shelf
hardware, I suspect where the,

599
00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.600
the new, the new device
that was announced for Xbox

600
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.970
one could be really interesting
for that. And whether it's

601
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.370
got again, gain high enough
granularity, I just don't know.

602
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.730
Hmm. Yeah. I think that
it would be, I'd love

603
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.590
to see this for the
deaf. I know there was

604
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.290
a lot of excitement when
connect originally came out that

605
00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.940
the deaf would be able
to use this and have

606
00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.720
hand gesture recognition that was
granular enough that you could

607
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.570
have almost two way translation
between people doing sign language

608
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.900
and people speaking, but then
they lowered the resolution before

609
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.610
release and it turned out
it wasn't going to happen.

610
00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.580
Yeah. And I think that's
probably a cost issue, right?

611
00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.540
I mean, cameras cost money
and the higher the resolution,

612
00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.690
the higher the cost and
the CPU and the CPU

613
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:09.220
processing is expensive as well.
Yeah. So, you know, there's

614
00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.590
no point in releasing a
product that you can't buy

615
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.990
a computer to plug into
and make it work. Whereas

616
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:18.520
obviously over time, Moore's law
still exists. And although you're

617
00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.940
probably slowing down a little
bit in terms of people's

618
00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:28.450
capacity to actually utilize the
processing power, then I think

619
00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.530
we'll see some of these
devices with high levels of

620
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:36.340
granularity being used more, there's
a lot of processing power

621
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.670
on use now in people's
personal computers. So yeah, it's

622
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.980
a big opportunity to go
forward. Yeah. I know. I

623
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.560
was looking at both the
connect and the leap motion

624
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.310
leap motion right now is
using up a 0.5% of

625
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.800
my CPU. If I'm waved
my hand over it, it

626
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.390
uses 3%. And in my
kind of obsessive compulsive brain,

627
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:57.430
I was like 3% CPU.
I don't have that kind

628
00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:01.060
of CPU to spare, but
even right now, we're doing

629
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.540
a high definition, Skype plus
audio recording plus outlook and

630
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.670
visual studio are all open.
I'm only using 10% of

631
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.220
my CPU. I think I
probably have enough idol. Yeah.

632
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.700
You could probably spend 3%.
Yeah. Well, thanks so much

633
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.830
for chatting with me today,
dr. Neil. Oh, you're welcome.

634
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.920
It's good to catch up.
Yeah. And any links at

635
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.180
all you can give me
to put in the show

636
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.520
notes to point people towards
