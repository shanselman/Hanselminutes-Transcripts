8
00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.650
Anthony Highland about hardrive energy
consumption. Hi, this is Scott

9
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.900
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes and on

10
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.570
the phone I've got dr.
Anthony <inaudible>. Thanks for coming

11
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.870
on the show. So Anthony
works for IBM research and

12
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.860
got his PhD in computer
science from Churchill college at

13
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.470
university of Cambridge. So you
spent some time overseas. Yeah,

14
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.010
w it was a wonderful
time. I graduated my undergrad

15
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.190
degree in computer engineering from
Georgia tech, and I was,

16
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.500
I was blessed and fortunate
enough to be one of

17
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.520
about 33 students selected as
Gates, Cambridge scholar to pursue

18
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.550
postgraduate work at the university
of Cambridge. So that's kind

19
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.950
of how I wound up
at Cambridge in and in

20
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.700
the computer science department had
a wonderful experience, met a

21
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.250
lot of great people, and
I think more than anything,

22
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.460
just got to see technology
and education from a different

23
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.940
culture perspective. And that was
just invaluable. Well, I, I

24
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.570
was reading your, your PhD
thesis and, you know, computer

25
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.720
engineering and computer science is
a big, big space. I

26
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.160
mean, that's probably why you
went into it. You have

27
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.960
a lot of choices about
things that you want to

28
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.180
get interested in, Right? That
was actually fairly interesting because

29
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.020
traditionally I would have looked
in the engineering department for

30
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.730
some of the things that
I was interested in, but

31
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.240
it turns out that's, that's
more lumped into the computer

32
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.710
science department. And luckily I
found the digital technology group

33
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.010
that really did a lot
of the hardcore applying the

34
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.280
computer science to actually building
things that imposed attacking things.

35
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.410
And that was, that was
what I enjoyed. Just getting

36
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.660
your hands dirty. It wasn't
enough just to do some

37
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.930
theory, write some equations and
write them program, but you

38
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.270
want to see something tangible.
You want to be able

39
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.910
to touch what you can,
you cannot create, and then

40
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.730
see how it works in
real life. And, and your,

41
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.460
your PhD thesis is called
an analysis of hard drive

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.190
energy consumption. And is, is
this really hardware and electronics,

43
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.880
or does this the bridge
between software and hardware? No,

44
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.200
it's, it's definitely hard drive
and electronics. So there was

45
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.710
a lot of reverse engineering,
black box type testing and

46
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.140
prototyping and experimenting on. So
I, I've got so many

47
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.200
stories and pictures of, of
systems and dish drives that

48
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.260
I've messed up because of
how I instrumented them. But

49
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.820
from the point of having
to create a custom power

50
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.240
measurement board, having all kinds
of wires coming out of

51
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.640
a, a PC that I
had laying on the floor,

52
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.450
and then writing the micro
benchmarks in the micro kernels

53
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.460
to actually test, to run
the control tests that I

54
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.180
needed to capture the measurements.
And then from those measurements,

55
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.060
you start to try to
model how the, how the

56
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.310
hard job operates. And then
you can kind of cross

57
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.340
reference that model with actual
running those tests on the

58
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.570
actual disc drive. And th
th I can read it,

59
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.040
but you can tell me
the essence of what is

60
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.780
the essence of your thesis.
What are you, what, what

61
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.750
did you feel it, you
effectively proved with this, The

62
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.960
stations? So among the major
contributions is I wrote a

63
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.400
dish drive simulator. So basically
given a block, trace the

64
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.980
simulator, lets you know, how
much energy that blocked trace

65
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.280
is going to consume. And
from that understanding of how

66
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.850
this drives, consume energy or
consume power, which, which is

67
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.430
energy over time, you get
to understand how you can

68
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.280
change the operating system interaction
with the district or reduce

69
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.490
power consumption. If that's what
you're interested in, turns out

70
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.790
that that performance and power
consumption walk hand in hand,

71
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.430
if you can improve the
performance, the energy consumption is,

72
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.470
is optimized as well. So
for, for desktop operating system,

73
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.480
I mean I'm sitting on
a desktop computer right now

74
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.090
and I've got a desktop
machine it's probably using, I

75
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.510
don't know, maybe 150 Watts
or more. It's probably burning

76
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.130
power left and right. I
know what heats up the

77
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.740
room. I probably don't care
about that. I might care

78
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.620
more on a laptop, but
in what environment would I

79
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.500
care so deeply about these
tiny, tiny micro Watts of

80
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.190
power? So it turns out
that your ride for, for

81
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.360
the average home desktop user,
you could care less about

82
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.420
how much or unless you're
an extreme somebody just trying

83
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.420
to conserve. You could for
the most part care less

84
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.170
about how much energy your,
your, your PC is consuming,

85
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.820
but in the desktop situation
where you've got a fixed

86
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.400
amount of energy in your
battery, because you don't want

87
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.320
to be plugged into the
wall at all times, you've

88
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.330
got to be a bit
smarter in terms of how

89
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.000
you choose to use your,
the, the, the energy. It's

90
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.180
a more precious resource. So
whether on a laptop, the

91
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.560
brightness of your display, or
you send your, your distracts

92
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.570
asleep when you're not using
it, if you're just reading

93
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.250
the webpage, you don't need
your disc drive to be

94
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.720
spinning at 7,200 RPM, but
whatever speed your disc drive

95
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.160
is, so you can kind
of spin it down and

96
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.490
save significant amount of energy.
So it's things like that,

97
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.980
but it turns out the
problem is more exaggerated in

98
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.660
a data center. So if
you're a Google, if you're

99
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.140
an Amazon, if you're a
Rackspace, if you're an Apple

100
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.110
or if you're a Microsoft
and you've got these, these

101
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.070
humongous data centers that, that
data, and they've got so

102
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.140
many districts spending for the
most part, disc drives, mechanical

103
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.690
disk drives are the way
you achieve the capacity that

104
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.180
we need for data. Granted
things are changing in terms

105
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.310
of trends, but does drive
energy consumption when you exaggerated,

106
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.790
it can become an issue
that you can be concerned.

107
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.060
So that does that mean
then if I could cut,

108
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.480
you know, fractions of a
percent off of my energy

109
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.240
consumption that that would literally
add up into actual money

110
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.790
that I could measure, that
would be significant enough to

111
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.970
tell a boss that we
should change X, Y, Z.

112
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.920
And we're going to save
a couple of hundred grand

113
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.130
on this data center. Almost
definitely there there's been so

114
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.600
much research and, and power
savings and energy savings when

115
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.070
it comes to the data
center. And you can look

116
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.100
at processor, you can look
at dish drives. You can

117
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.720
look at network just in,
in almost any field, whether

118
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.240
it be the actual hardware
or even now just middleware

119
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.240
and software application. You've got
people that are looking at

120
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.540
how do you make this
more energy efficient? I would

121
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.990
have thought as a layman
that the, the energy expended

122
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.420
by a mechanical hard drive
was this, the moving around

123
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.600
of the mechanical parts. I
mean, literally the motors, but

124
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.140
in your thesis, you, you
propose that the energy that

125
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.080
the electronics on the drive
consumer is just as important,

126
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.240
Right? So they, they consume
a more significant amount of

127
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.810
the total energy than one
would initially think. However, it's

128
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.550
still fairly small relative to
how much the mechanical parts.

129
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.400
So you're the platter spin
the motor and the actuator

130
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.380
arm. The electronic still consume
much less than that, but

131
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.890
at the same time, it's,
it's, it's more than you

132
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.660
would think for an electronic
component or an electronic part

133
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.030
that doesn't have any moving
parts, how much energy is

134
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.840
consuming. And some of that
may be proprietary to the

135
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.240
disc drive manufacturer. Some of
it may be due to

136
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.630
inefficiency because a lot of
things we find out is

137
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.740
when, when these particular parts
or components were first manufactured

138
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.400
and engineered w we assume
that we have infinite amounts

139
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.770
of power and energy, but,
but that turns out not

140
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.140
to be the case. So
you can stumble upon parts

141
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.240
that were on optimized or
ill optimized for situation where

142
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.510
you have a scarce resource
such as energy. Hmm. So

143
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.390
when you're, when you're you
spending energy in a hard

144
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.760
drive, you're doing the electronics
work, and then you're, the

145
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.080
electronics works, turns into the
physical movement of, of the

146
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.250
actuator. And, you know, work
happens in that actual molecule

147
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.220
will start moving around. You're
moving that arm to find

148
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:44.080
the data that you requested
and the, where the data

149
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.570
is on the disc actually
affects the energy that is

150
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.320
expended as well. Yes. So
you can look at placement

151
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.000
algorithms to help further reduce
energy. That is correct. Is

152
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.640
that, is that so important
That you would want to

153
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.150
build that into like the
file system driver? Like might

154
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.940
you say that this file
system is more energy efficient

155
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.300
than that one? Well, that's
actually what people do. So

156
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.380
yes, because energy and performance
kind of walk, lock step

157
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.420
the areas on the outer,
most portions of the magnetic

158
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.080
platter. So just take a
step back. The disc drive

159
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.020
is made up of these
platters that for effectively, just

160
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.200
think about three pancakes. And
there's like a stick in

161
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.150
the middle of the pancakes
and the pancakes just spin

162
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.680
around. So outermost edges of
the platter, that's where you

163
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.820
can read and write data.
You're the fastest. And this

164
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.450
is research that's been known
for 20, 30 years now.

165
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.410
And what happens in a
lot of places is this

166
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.880
technique called short stroke. So
effectively you, you limit yourself

167
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.650
to maybe the outer, most
25% of the dish drive,

168
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.560
because that's where you're getting
the performance that you need

169
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.490
for your particular workload. And
you granite you're killing and

170
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.460
wasting so much of your
capacity. You're wasting 75% of

171
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.370
your capacity, but that's the
only way you can get

172
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.590
the performance that you need.
And as a result, that's

173
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.840
going to be the most
energy or that, that, that,

174
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.820
that particular configuration is going
to consume the least amount

175
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.810
of energy across any, any
storage array that you may

176
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.720
have. So if I were
an architect on a system

177
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.090
that was going to be
performing some, some workload, some

178
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.520
large amount of, of, of
work or some continuous amount

179
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.950
of work at what level
does the response to, what

180
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.740
do I, as the architect
know that the responsibility lies?

181
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.440
Is that something that my,
my developers are going to

182
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.170
know about, and we're going
to be able to coerce

183
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.670
the data to live at
a certain place, or is

184
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.450
that at the driver level
or somewhere above that, That's

185
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.520
one of those arguments that
that's going to go on

186
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.730
for the foreseeable future. As
long as we still have

187
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:53.510
the current programmer designer, developer
division of labor, there are

188
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.910
some people that like to
worry about those things. There

189
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.640
are other people that could
care less about those things

190
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.150
and want somebody else to
handle that for me right

191
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.580
now, the majority of the
work that I've seen, it's

192
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.720
been kind of the, the
designer and the dish drive

193
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:14.990
the dish driver responsibility to
manage the layout. However, if

194
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.390
there is a developer that,
that knows what he's doing,

195
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.850
that knows the ins and
outs of his application better

196
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.540
than a designer could then
obviously that developer is going

197
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.240
to want more control over
how data's laid out on

198
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.570
this, whether it's it's a
database developer or something like

199
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.780
that, you just don't know.
But again, that goes back

200
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.210
and forth depending on the
particular use case. Yeah. That

201
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.820
gets me wondering that like
D does an Oracle or

202
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.240
SQL server know somewhere in
the code, or is it

203
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.320
trying to optimize for, for
the way the data is

204
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.450
laid out, taking into consideration
performance and then power consumed,

205
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:56.710
which might be conflicting priorities.
Exactly. It's one of those

206
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.960
things where you, you just
don't know, there may be

207
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.600
some workloads that placement optimization
is much easier and a

208
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.580
more tractable tractable problem than
others. And you just have

209
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.490
to optimize for the majority
case. The amount of, of

210
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.450
information is being transferred as
well, will affect power, Right?

211
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:24.390
So looking at the platters
and the way the mechanics

212
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.840
of the disc drive operate,
understanding how much data you

213
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.410
want to transfer is going
to affect the operation. So

214
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:36.810
this gets us into sequential
operation versus random operation. Obviously

215
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.380
mechanical dish drives really, really
stink it up when you

216
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:46.560
talk about random IO operation
versus sequential, because once the

217
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.670
head gets in place the
disrespecting at 7,200 RPM, so

218
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.430
you're pretty much getting everything
for free, but as soon

219
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.320
as you have to start
moving their head around, that's

220
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.460
when you start incurring those
mechanical penalties and everything kind

221
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.830
of just goes to pot.
So, so this is where

222
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.830
being able to run everything
in memory, or this is

223
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.890
where solid state drives really
come into play. And you

224
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.070
really see the benefit and
the value of their operation,

225
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.030
of them being solid state
memory devices. W so when

226
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.130
you were doing this testing,
you had a board and

227
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.380
you would, you would go
and basically grab some drives

228
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.200
from all different brands, all
different sizes. And then you

229
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.680
would use this custom board
that you guys designed to

230
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.570
do the measurement setup. Does,
did you discover that the

231
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.390
differences between drives were very
different or is it all

232
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.800
basically the same For the
most part? It, it was

233
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.170
fairly similar. There seemed to
be some differentiation when you

234
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.860
look at prefetching and, and
how, how the, the, the,

235
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.930
on this cash operate. And
there, there's also something that

236
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.030
that's called zone bit recording
and, and I won't get

237
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.730
into all the details. I'll
save that well with PDF

238
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:02.730
search, but in, in zone
bit recording. So again, you

239
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.400
think about the, the, the
platters being some pancakes kind

240
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.470
of stacked up with a,
with a spindle going right

241
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.120
down the middle. And there,
there are, if you think

242
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.890
about a race track or
track and field track where

243
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.490
you've got certain lanes, so
on the platters, you've got

244
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:28.050
essentially something very analogous, two
lanes, and each of those

245
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.560
lanes gets a certain number
of bits that can be

246
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.210
written in that lane. And
obviously the outer lanes are

247
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.960
effectively longer than the inner
lanes. So they're spinning faster

248
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.210
than exactly. So you effectively
say this instead of doing

249
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.630
different numbers of bits per
lane on a per lane

250
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.000
basis, you say, well, this
of five lanes gets the

251
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.910
same number of fits. And
so that's kind of zoned

252
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.430
bit recording. And so that
number decreases as you move

253
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:05.090
towards the center of those
platters and the way those

254
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.780
zones are created, and the
way those zones are allocated

255
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.440
a certain number of bits
that that type of proprietary

256
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.120
nature is, is what you
see differentiation between the manufacturers

257
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.240
and the vendors, because that
really goes into how they

258
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.340
get the density that they
can get, how they get

259
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.810
the sequential bandwidth, et cetera,
et cetera. I see. Okay.

260
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.960
So that's, that's their differentiator.
I mean, they, we know

261
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.940
that the disc spins and
we know that the disc

262
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.120
has a general layout of
sectors, but for the most

263
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.130
part, they decide how dense
they want to pack the

264
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:40.180
data, what kind of errors
they want to tolerate. Exactly.

265
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.210
So you can imagine though,
those higher level decisions don't

266
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.440
necessarily affect the overall energy
consumption as much, which is

267
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.440
why you see a fairly
consistent model that we were

268
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.340
able to create a media.
Okay. So then calling back

269
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:59.530
to the, you called it
short, short stroke, short stroking,

270
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.440
or you're keeping on the
outer tracks. Yes. The ones

271
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.210
that spin faster. Yes. Ah,
okay. So by using just

272
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.250
the outer edge, you're getting,
you're getting that kind of

273
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.130
free little burst of speed
because that's the part that's

274
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.470
spinning the fastest. And presumably
you could pack the bits

275
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.220
as tightly as that hard
drives firmware would allow you

276
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.490
to Exactly. There you go.
You got it. Oh, Okay.

277
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:27.430
I'll get my honorary PhD
now. Huh. It's crazy how

278
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.190
you think about what you
know now, and then you

279
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.100
look back to how much
work and how much blood,

280
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.340
sweat, and tears went into
actually doing all this research

281
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.740
and really uncovering it all.
It's, it's really amazing and

282
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.430
fascinating, but that's, that's the
beauty of research. And, and

283
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.770
again, that's the beauty of,
of doing the work yourself

284
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.770
and getting your hands dirty
is you get to synthesize

285
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.530
the knowledge in your own
way. And, and that's why

286
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.600
you, you never can get
tired of talking about it.

287
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.690
Well, it must have been
fascinating for you to kind

288
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.820
of you're sitting on this
and you're thinking about the

289
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.200
decisions that were made in
hard drive design, you know,

290
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.070
20, 30 years before and
even longer and thinking about,

291
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.020
well, gosh, if they'd known
this, what would they have

292
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.160
done differently? Yeah. Th there
you go. One of the

293
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.540
things I, I just can't
stop thinking about is the,

294
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.800
the three and a half
minutes, this form, back to

295
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.260
that, that you can buy
what up with a two

296
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.860
terabyte drive in that's what
they used to sell 40

297
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.950
megabytes and people were happy
to have 40 megabytes. So

298
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.980
Yeah, my first, my first
hard drive was a 40

299
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.020
megabyte MFM hard drive. And
those hard drives would develop

300
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.490
this strange kind of symbiotic
relationship with their condition controller.

301
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.200
The disc controller would have
errors and cause errors such

302
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.770
that the, you couldn't separate
the drive from the controller

303
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.970
because DRI the controller was
separate and it had a

304
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.060
personality, it had errors that
were inherent to it. And

305
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.960
if you ever tried to,
to switch controller with a

306
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.140
hard drive, they wouldn't, they
would reject each other at

307
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.940
like an Oregon rejecting being
rejected out of a system.

308
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.600
So you would have to
pull the, the, the controller

309
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.820
card out and always keep
it together. And people would

310
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.710
have labeled them to make
sure that you never let

311
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:17.480
these symbiotic pair be separated.
I guess it's kind of

312
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.640
like the record player that
only plays one record. Yeah.

313
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.940
Pretty much. That's a, that's
interesting. So, okay. So applying

314
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.740
this information about power consumption
and, and the, the relationship

315
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.680
of a spindle on a
disc or a platter, and

316
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.260
then kind of the macro
view of that in a,

317
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.990
in a data center, like
a Google or an Azure

318
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:41.900
or a, an Amazon could,
can they look at their

319
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.960
larger kind of cloud file
system and make decisions that

320
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.200
would affect the finances they
could see? Cause I assume

321
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.220
that all cloud file systems
run, you know, some custom

322
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.410
file system driver, Right? So
depending on what type of

323
00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.860
service you're providing you, you've
got, you've got everybody doing,

324
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.200
doing different things to optimize
for the workloads that they're,

325
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.080
their customers run the majority
of the time. But, but

326
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.530
yes, I'm sure that there's
much work. That's gone into

327
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.190
really trying to optimize how
these controllers manage these disk

328
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:21.410
drives, obviously again, because performance
is gonna benefit from that.

329
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.870
And you're, you're pretty much
going to get energy savings

330
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.320
as a free lunch, along
with that. But couldn't, I

331
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.380
take a list of hard
drives like you've made or

332
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:35.150
a testing, a testing style
like this. And then when

333
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.030
making my purchasing decisions, maybe
as a cloud provider, I

334
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.690
could say, Oh, I'm going
to buy the Hitachi. I'm

335
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.410
going to buy the IBM,
because this, this is the

336
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.630
drive that is going to
give us the best performance,

337
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:50.240
energy mix in, in, in
this cloud world. Yeah. You

338
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.820
definitely could look at it
and make a decision such

339
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.580
as that. That's correct. The,
the one thing I'm sure

340
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.830
you want to watch out
for some of these vendors

341
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.560
are, are kind of giving
these drives. There are a

342
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.500
mind of their own, if
you will, and you don't

343
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.100
want to disk doing its
own thing when it's supposed

344
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.110
to be doing something else.
So you've got to make

345
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.980
sure that the disk allows
you to take full control

346
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.660
and possibly disable some, some
of its autonomous functionality for

347
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.510
the sake of the global.
Good. What kind of things

348
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.000
are you seeing discs built,
built in? I mean, back

349
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.770
in the day we had
an eight Meg cash and

350
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.900
that was pretty much it.
What, what, what did disks

351
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:32.480
have now? You've got, prefetching
you've got on this cash

352
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.870
is that, that have different
replacement policies. You've got sleep

353
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.810
timers where, where the disc
decides to go to a

354
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.850
certain lower power state when
it hasn't been accessed in,

355
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:50.020
in so long, you got
some discs that allow for

356
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.590
more expressive. And then this
is not necessarily the disk,

357
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.860
but controllers of dish drivers
that allow for more expressive

358
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.540
control of the disc, whether
that that's placement, whether that's

359
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.510
prefetching, whether that's how much
data to read and, and

360
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.090
certain bursts, things like that.
So you've got a lot

361
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.870
of different things that, that
the manufacturers are trying to

362
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.620
bells and whistles, I guess,
that the manufacturers are trying

363
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.890
to, to add on to,
to add increased differentiation, because

364
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.290
everybody's doing the same thing
of trying to pack more

365
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.340
gains. That's something that everybody's
trying to do. And, and

366
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.200
it's kinda like you're, you're
building, everybody's building the fastest

367
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.350
car, but how do I
make the seats more comfortable

368
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.750
that that's kinda the, the
situation where we're in now.

369
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.240
So for, for the average
developer though, I'm not going

370
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.370
to think about this kind
of stuff. I'll presume that

371
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.760
my cloud provider is handling
it for me. I think

372
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.160
that it's safe to say
that I don't know, I

373
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.430
haven't met many people that
say they consciously think about

374
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:54.360
how the described is consuming
energy. We are putting a

375
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.380
lot of thought though, on
small devices about how much

376
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.760
energy things produce. And we've
even had some discussions internally

377
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.180
at Microsoft where someone would
say, well, this feature uses

378
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.430
this much power. So, you
know, we're going to maybe

379
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.850
consider doing that feature differently,
especially when on, on, on

380
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:16.260
small devices. I I'm surprised
there's not more discussion about

381
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.590
that in the large scale,
I got that at either

382
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.080
end of the, of the
spectrum. There should be discussion

383
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.630
around energy. I agree 100%.
And it's, it's not until

384
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.510
you get into some of
these mobile scenarios in these

385
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.780
mobile contexts that you really
start to, to think about

386
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.410
how we're in energy as
the important resource that they

387
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.160
are. And I think from
a developer's point of view,

388
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.150
you think about an iPhone
or excuse me, an iOS

389
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.920
or an Android developer, where
power is in addition to

390
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.820
memory are very, very precious
resources. And these are things

391
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.520
that you have to think
about. So you're starting to

392
00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.930
think about these things on
a much larger basis. Now

393
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:05.400
you participate on a number
of committees and workshops and

394
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.810
different, different conferences. So there
are people getting together, like,

395
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.170
you know, all the PhDs
that are interested in this

396
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.840
space and trying to solve
these big problems. And then

397
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.480
how am I as the
developer kind of many levels

398
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.320
downstream, just going to reap
the benefits as, as what

399
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.560
happens as cloud providers do
the right thing, or is

400
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.040
it hardware providers make better
hardware? Where do your works

401
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.910
and your workshops? I start
effecting me. Well, I, I,

402
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.550
and this is my personal
view. I think the best

403
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.400
result is going to come
once everybody can, can start

404
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:46.730
operating in concert because if,
as the cloud provider, if

405
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.430
you provide me API APIs,
that number one, I don't

406
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.160
understand, or number two, don't
have anything to do with

407
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.470
my particular workload and my
particular needs. Then it's not

408
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.690
quite clear to me how
I best utilize what you're

409
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:04.160
offering me. And as the
developer it's, it's, it's developer's

410
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.020
job to really understand what
the API is mean and

411
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.240
kind of the extent of
control that the API has

412
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.350
have over the hardware and
understand how that affects other

413
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:19.550
people. Because you've got to
understand that these clouds are

414
00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:24.260
used by multiple individuals. So
there there's multi-tendency here and

415
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:31.340
everything has to effectively operate
at a local maximum, but

416
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.600
at the same time, not
causing anybody else else's requirements

417
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:40.280
or their, their, their workload
characteristics to be negatively affected

418
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.920
by a particular local, local
maximum. What if I had,

419
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.780
you know, like you, you
know, we have things like

420
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.750
smart where I can tell
the reliability of a drive.

421
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.690
Do we have the ability
to query drives for energy

422
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.510
usage and then make decisions
in a, in a, in

423
00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:00.250
a dynamic sense as the
driver's doing its work. I

424
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:06.210
haven't seen any smart characteristics
that would allow that, that

425
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:12.910
that's such a dynamic or
feedback in our interaction. However,

426
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:17.110
this drives are smart compliant,
and you, you can, you

427
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.940
can query the district for
certain parameters and understand how,

428
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.920
how it's functioning, however, I'm
not aware of any discontrol

429
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.220
or so describers that, that
do that in, in, in

430
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.720
real time, kind of respond
to the district's power characteristics

431
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.750
for under a particular workload
and make those optimizations and

432
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.360
changes. I mean, I know
it's, most of my questions

433
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.250
are ignorant questions, but is
that, is that the wrong

434
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:40.850
way to think about it?
Is this something that is

435
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.450
a static thing where you
build a profile for a

436
00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.310
drive ahead of time, and
then you say, all right,

437
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.210
now I understand the profile
of this drive its personality,

438
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.950
and then can simply feed
that personality type into a

439
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.020
device driver or an operating
system and say, all right,

440
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.390
well, this is a Samsung,
it has personality type B,

441
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:01.360
and this is a desk
desk star. It has personally

442
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.700
type a optimize appropriately. That's
kind of what my dissertation

443
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.550
work did. It allowed you
to create that model, and

444
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.980
you can hand off that
model to a dish driver

445
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.470
or somebody that wanted to
know what was going on

446
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.290
and say, here, this is
the characteristics based upon the

447
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.990
logical block address that you're
accessing, and you could get

448
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.590
an energy footprint. So that's
the approach that I took,

449
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.100
but I don't, I don't
see anything stopping one from

450
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.760
doing that in a more
real time feedback manner. The

451
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.110
only issue with that is
obviously the getting the work

452
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.500
done is probably priority number
one, and having that type

453
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:43.210
of interruption, so to speak
is going to significantly affect

454
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.970
your performance. However, if possibly
performance isn't the number one

455
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.880
priority in power or energy
are then maybe that is

456
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.050
an approach that will be
more amenable to someone. Okay.

457
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.780
So maybe that's just something
that isn't quite as dynamic

458
00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.510
as I would think it
would be. Right. I think

459
00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.180
that will be more of
a novelty than something somebody

460
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.430
is trying to put into
production because nobody's going to

461
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.850
be able to tolerate those
types of delays. So as,

462
00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:11.240
as spinning disks or as
we call them lovingly at

463
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.700
work, spinning, rushed, starts moving
towards solid state. Does that,

464
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.190
you know, for lack of
a better word, kind of

465
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.270
obsolete your, your research, were
you doing work just as

466
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.880
we were switching to SSDs
or does it still have

467
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:32.060
a valid purpose? I think
there's definitely still validity and

468
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.240
the work that I've done,
because again, it's, it's really

469
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.290
hard to match the capacities
that we need with SSD,

470
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.380
but at the same time
too, I don't think mechanical

471
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.710
distract are going to completely
fall off the face of

472
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:51.020
the earth because they may
simply replace tape as more

473
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.990
kind of deeper archive responsibilities.
So there, there still may

474
00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:00.170
be reason to, to be
cognizant of, of the power

475
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.750
and energy of mechanical disk,
but it may be from

476
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.710
a different perspective. I would,
I would imagine, but definitely

477
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:10.430
solid state disk drives as
soon as we can get

478
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.820
the dollar per gigabyte at
a place that, that people

479
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.900
are able to more easily
consume because the IOPS per

480
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.100
per dollar are, are killing
mechanical disk drive. So, so

481
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.050
everybody wants SSPs in terms
of the I ops and

482
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:31.730
I ops means IO operations
per second, SSDs will definitely

483
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.090
replace mechanical disk drives. And
then you've got other things

484
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.840
to storage, class memories and
those of those new up

485
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.930
and coming research prototypes that
probably will be on the

486
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.590
market here in the next
five to 10 years out.

487
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.470
I would imagine in, and
then in more consumer grade,

488
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.250
The idea that that SSDs,
you know, overall are going

489
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.610
to take over everything. It's
just not maybe on the

490
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.590
desktop or maybe in the
laptop, but in the data

491
00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.320
center, you're just not going
to get that price storage

492
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.200
ratio that you're going to
get that not anytime soon,

493
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.890
at least, Well, I don't
see it happening, but unless

494
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:12.590
you can make the justification
for paying the price for

495
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.430
SSDs as the price exists.
Now, I don't think you'll

496
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.220
see this, this big overhaul
of the data center, because

497
00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.710
again, there's, there's a lot
of capacity out there and

498
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.190
to match that capacity need
with SSD is going to

499
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:30.170
be tremendously expensive. However, there
are some shops that, that

500
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.990
I have heard about that
are biting the bullet and

501
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:36.380
replacing as much as they
can with SSD, just for

502
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:41.030
the sake of the performance
benefit and these SSDs, depending

503
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.600
what type of grade that
you get and get very

504
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.800
expensive. But Eric, but arguably
though, I mean, aren't you

505
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.770
talking about going from numbers
like 500 to a thousand

506
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.830
IOPS up into hundreds of
thousands of IOPS, just by

507
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:56.640
just, just by quote unquote,
just by jumping from spinning

508
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.280
rust over to an SSD.
I mean, those numbers are,

509
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.820
you know, orders of magnitude.
Yeah. So, so at the

510
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.270
top end of your SSD,
yeah, you're definitely talking hundreds

511
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:11.220
of thousands of, of IOPS.
And for the most part,

512
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.430
I think some of the
higher end disks are, are

513
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:19.020
getting maybe creeping into the
thousands of IOPS per second,

514
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.960
but, but you're right, that
that is orders of magnitude

515
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.720
and, and that's performance that
you see, and that's not

516
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.680
hidden performance that performance that
you see, and, and as,

517
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.490
as a customer, you will
be very pleased with that.

518
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.610
Yeah. I was at a,
a conference in Europe and

519
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.010
there was a, I forgot
the gentleman's name, but he's

520
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:41.760
in charge of cloud computing
for, for Netflix. And he

521
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.180
was talking about putting their,
their system over on the

522
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.960
SSDs and moving from spinning
rushed SSDs. And they were

523
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.340
doing it a little bit
at a time just to

524
00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.950
test things out. And I
think the numbers he were

525
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.800
giving were fairly general, but
he said something like, you

526
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.830
know, I can spend a
dollar here for a regular

527
00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:02.800
magnetic disk or $3 for
SSD. And I think he,

528
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.130
he uses Amazon, but I'm
going to go from a

529
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:09.300
thousand IOPS to, you know,
3000 or 5,000 or 10,000.

530
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.750
He said, the numbers just
simply are so compelling that

531
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.730
he wants to move entirely
over. It's going to make

532
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.580
things more expensive, but the
IOPS, he just could not

533
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.710
express how much better that
made their databases. And I

534
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.330
thought one of the interesting
things that was said by

535
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:27.180
an audience member was he
started kind of going off

536
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.930
on all these details about
SSDs and reliability and trim

537
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.170
and all the things that
he felt that the head

538
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:37.200
of cloud computing at Netflix
needed to worry about. And

539
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.930
after kind of the audience
member gave his big, long

540
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.470
diatribe on why this was
fullest way for the gentlemen

541
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:48.240
to think the speaker from
Netflix said, I don't care.

542
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.450
I'm just renting them. And
it just hit me like

543
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.730
a ton of bricks. It
was just like, yeah, it's

544
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:59.130
just not his problem. Exactly.
And that, that's the beauty

545
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:05.310
of cloud that as the
lease leaser of the cloud

546
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.430
infrastructure have to worry about
a lot of those things.

547
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.230
As long as you can
make sure you don't lose

548
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.940
valuable data that you can't
regain, then the net, that's

549
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.300
not your issue. And I
agree that that that's absolutely

550
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:21.900
true, Right? He felt that
the power benefits, the, you

551
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.810
know, the, the concern was
about reliability, but his, his

552
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.230
answer to the reliability question
was if the cloud provider

553
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.680
manages their reliability infrastructure appropriately,
he said, half the drives

554
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.460
could fail and that's their
problem and their issue. And

555
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.670
they'll deal with it by
potentially changing pricing. Exactly. Yeah.

556
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.610
Interesting. Well, thanks so much
for chatting with me today.

557
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.980
No, Scott I've really enjoyed
it. Thank you so much

558
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.740
for having me. This has
been Anthony Highlet from IBM

559
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:52.220
research, and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes. We'll

560
00:32:52.220 --> 00:33:02.510
see you again next week.
