00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.650
It's Hansel minutes, a weekly
discussion with web developer and

9
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.980
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number 544.

10
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.080
In this episode, Scott talks
with Jason Scott about archiving digital

11
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.360
experiences using emulation. Hi, This
is Scott Hanselman. This is

12
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.360
another episode of Hansel minutes.
And today we're talking with

13
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.920
Jason Scott, he's the creator and
the owner of text files.com

14
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.030
a very popular website that
archives files from historic bulletin

15
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.310
board systems. I had a
BBS and I think I

16
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.290
was actually mentioned in his
2005 documentary film about PBS

17
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.310
is called BBS the documentary,
and he also is a

18
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.660
historian and archivist. Thanks so
much for chatting with me.

19
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.520
Ain't no problem. I I'm
been a big fan for

20
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.610
many, many years because I
had a BBS early on.

21
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.820
I ran a FIDOnet node
and I really feel like

22
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.330
the young people today don't
appreciate how much amazing software

23
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.860
was created before they were
born. And it seems like

24
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.370
a lot of that software
is disappearing. Like we won't

25
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.830
be able to run these
things ever again. Yeah. You

26
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.610
know, the thing with software
is that it both functions

27
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.760
and powers, everything that we
live with in every single

28
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.660
way, but it's also not
really been regarded on its

29
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.500
own as a piece of
artwork or social artifact that

30
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.290
we would preserve. Like we
might preserve an old painting

31
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.140
or even an old menu.
And I think some of

32
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.630
the world is coming around
to that now. But in

33
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.170
the meantime we've had, you
know, honestly over 50 years

34
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.020
of software going on and
over 30 years of what

35
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.340
we would think of as
the home computer or the

36
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.110
personal computer. And so, yeah,
there's a lot of history

37
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.260
down there of something people
don't think of his history.

38
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.870
Yeah. In the past, you
know, people will use to

39
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.420
respect the URL or the
URI. We used to have

40
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.430
the phrase cool URS don't
change. And then the Wayback

41
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.090
machine came along and people
take that for granted the

42
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.250
idea that like, Oh, well,
if that URL is gone,

43
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.540
I'll just to archive.org and
they'll have a copy or

44
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.970
I'll go to the Google
cache and they'll have a

45
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.560
copy. But with software, there's
quite a bit of setup

46
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.580
to even to, to emulate
a system. And also a

47
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.380
lot of thankless work being
done on the part of

48
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.630
the, by the writers of
the emulators themselves. Yeah. You

49
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.190
know, when people think of
software there's stuff that maybe

50
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.560
they don't think of software
at all, like the stuff

51
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.530
that drives their elevators or
stuff that makes traffic lights

52
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.530
go. But then there's like
the very obvious software, like

53
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.320
a paint program or a
sound program that you used,

54
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.390
or an app that you're
using right now that is

55
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.570
some sort of a game
or, or maybe it just

56
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.330
keeps track of something for
you on your phone. And

57
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.140
all of those items all
are depending on an environment

58
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.540
that itself is completely shifting
and is running on hardware

59
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.260
that will be considered obsolete
and anything from two years

60
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.780
ago to 10 years from
now. And that software is

61
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.990
something that as time goes
on, has to depend on

62
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.290
technologies like emulation to keep
running and emulation for like

63
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.990
a lot of things in
the world doesn't just happen.

64
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.650
You know, it doesn't just
make itself work. And so

65
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.730
there are people who going
back over the past 20

66
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.030
years to be honestly, I've
tried their best to be

67
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.160
able to recreate older computers
and computer environments and game

68
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.660
environments and electronic environments in
your computer, your modern computer,

69
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.780
and keep it maintained and
accurate. And this is a

70
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.320
Sisyphean task in every single
way. Indeed. My first kind

71
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.960
of foray was a selfish
one. And I think that

72
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.470
we'll speak about motivations in
a minute, but selfishly, I

73
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.470
wanted to use, you know,
maim, the multi arcade machine

74
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.800
emulator to play games that
so I didn't have to

75
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.620
go to the arcade. That's
an extremely selfish thing. I

76
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.990
wonder what the motivations are
on the part of the

77
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.900
main people. Are they historians
and archivists or do they

78
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.660
just want to play games
too? So there's a whole

79
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.350
bunch of people who have
worked on the main project

80
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.220
over the years and they
seem to have had a

81
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.320
range of things. I've definitely
seen people who had a

82
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.310
very specific game, maybe they
even own that game. And

83
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.280
they've wanted to ensure that
that game lives on forever.

84
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.900
But the fact is is
that over time, the system

85
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.630
could emulate old arcades and
old computers, you know, relatively

86
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.570
well. And so what they
started to focus on was

87
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.070
finding similarities between all of
these machines so that they

88
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.850
would only have to emulate
one aspect of machines once

89
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.770
and then keep going. And
as a result, it quickly

90
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.560
moved away from a developer.
Who's doing it for kicks

91
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.530
and developers that are trying
focus on a longterm comprehensive

92
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.290
emulation of literally the computer
human experience. And so it's

93
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.410
actually been rather inspiring to
watch them over the course

94
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.390
of the last five years
of this project. I've been

95
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.160
working on to see how
they themselves think of machines.

96
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.430
And I always stress, you
know, if you search for

97
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.200
my name in the code
of Maine, you will not

98
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.110
find it. I am not
a developer. I'm just somebody

99
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.100
who works with people towards
goals. And as we'll I'm

100
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.240
sure go into my big
goal was I wanted emulators

101
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.050
to run inside of a
browser in a way that

102
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.030
enabled you to one click
access old software. And to

103
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.310
do that, I went with
the biggest game in town,

104
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.580
literally, which is Mame because
their emulator covers thousands and

105
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.870
thousands of arcade games and
thousands of computer platforms. And

106
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.000
I knew that if we
got that running in the

107
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.210
browser, all of these other
machines would come to life.

108
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.740
Yeah. Maine has become almost
like an emulator of emulators.

109
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.500
It's like, there's a driver
that like it, it has

110
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.870
the structure around the emulator
and it allows people to

111
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.930
then add on different CPS
and different systems. Doesn't it,

112
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.300
it's not one of the
things that really fascinates me

113
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.560
about watching a mature project
like Maine and Maine has

114
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.580
basically routes well into the
nineties and has all these

115
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.820
different philosophies that have been
kind of caked into it

116
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.900
over the years. And one
of them is that machines

117
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:36.920
are basically collections of parts,
which sounds obvious, but what

118
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.740
they would do is they
would emulate a chip as

119
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.100
well as they can. And
they would emulate different kinds

120
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.490
of machinery as well as
they can. And then they

121
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.000
would say, well, here's a
machine. What is it? Well,

122
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.490
it's a set of this
chip and this chip, and

123
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.370
then this small custom part.
And so they would be

124
00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.140
able to build new machines
relatively quickly. And so that

125
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.410
philosophy means that every time
they would do a new

126
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.120
version, they might add a
pile of new hardware because

127
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.510
that new hardware quote unquote
is using off the shelf

128
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.650
parts and they would pull
those off the shelf parts

129
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.950
from within maim already. And
then just work on the

130
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.070
small amount. That's different. It's
been kind of rather inspiring

131
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.260
to watch as I'll see
them emulate a machine that

132
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.440
I've never heard of in
a million years and suddenly

133
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:34.250
it's working. And they constantly
consistently prefer to have the

134
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.300
board, which is also interesting,
like what I've seen when

135
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.500
somebody says, Hey, we'd like
to emulate this. They say,

136
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.880
show us the board, like,
please take a large picture

137
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.510
of the board of the
circuit so that we can

138
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.390
look at the circuit because
the circuit is the documentation

139
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.980
of how it was really
built, as opposed to say

140
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.930
some manual that implies that
it's built this way, exactly

141
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.010
Board and its existence as
the expression of its intent

142
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.770
and the only documentation it
is, the fact it works

143
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.290
like this. Whether someone wrote
down that they thought it

144
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.060
might work like this, or
it was intended to work

145
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.000
like this, the fact is
it's shipped this way and

146
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.050
we will emulate it as
it was shipped. Yeah. So

147
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.030
that to me has been,
it's been kind of amazing

148
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.840
to watch them in, in,
in, in progress and everything

149
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.900
else. I mean, every day
that group of developers is

150
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.260
doing anywhere between, I've seen
as many as a hundred

151
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.490
and as small as 30
new changes where they've made

152
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.870
changes every day for years
on end to improve things,

153
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.110
to fix bugs, to, to
make things more flexible. It's

154
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.910
been really, I mean, quite
inspiring to watch. I have

155
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.240
a, a main machine behind
me that I've built like

156
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.720
a full sized RK that
I built from scratch. And

157
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.430
what is the relationship though,
between the Mame kind of

158
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.980
CNC plus plus app that
we've been running for many,

159
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.040
many years. And how did
that jump into the browser?

160
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.200
Like how did they compile
it to JavaScript? And then

161
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.730
is that another project? Is
it downstream of main? Sure.

162
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.090
So what happened is that
of course, Mame, like I

163
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.990
said, was really mature years
and years ago, they made

164
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.290
a very specific set of
design decisions. It's very flexible.

165
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.150
You can always find a
faster emulator of some platform

166
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.000
or set of platforms that's
being hand maintained by one

167
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.770
or two people, but you
won't have that universal access.

168
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.060
So maim sacrifices, a little
bit of speed, although too,

169
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.350
obviously, most machines today that
wouldn't matter at all in

170
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.880
the name of accuracy and
university Allity. So that system

171
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.360
has been in place for
quite some time. And when

172
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.510
we decided we wanted to
work on the idea of

173
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.460
putting maim into a browser,
I looked around at what

174
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.340
possibilities there were, and we
have a number of ways

175
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.070
to execute code in a
browser. You know, things like

176
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.550
Java people would know about
Java or perhaps some sort

177
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.390
of specialized plugin that goes
into Chrome or Firefox or

178
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.540
another browser that kind of
brings up executable code in

179
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.210
a small encapsulated piece. But
what I fell on to

180
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.560
was the fact that quietly,
without anybody really jumping into

181
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.270
it or anything JavaScript had
matured to the point that

182
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.510
it was in pretty much
every browser had an enormous

183
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.900
amount of flexibility and an
inability to do everything from

184
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.040
control keyboards and, and run
video and sound to networking

185
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:45.080
even. And it wasn't under
control of one person or

186
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.160
one entity, a thing like
Java, as we saw with

187
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.000
something as simple as the
Google quote son in print

188
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.460
in quotes, a lawsuit was
that there were still commercial

189
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:03.850
entities that thought of the
Java world as somebody, but

190
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:09.310
nobody really owned Java, just
like nobody really owned HTML.

191
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.520
You don't get a cease
and desist for using an,

192
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.680
a anchor from HTML and
you don't get a cease

193
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.300
and desist by using Java
script. And so the JavaScript

194
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.040
language has had a couple
of advancements over the years.

195
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.520
And one of them was
that there were a couple

196
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.180
companies who had written bridging
applications to go from C

197
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:37.180
plus plus to Java script.
So you could literally compile

198
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.280
JavaScript as the target of
a C plus plus file.

199
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.940
Now this technology was relatively
new. There were a couple

200
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.210
people who were selling a
compiler, but there was also

201
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.150
an open source version and
it was called M scripting.

202
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.750
And it was being run
by the Mozilla foundation. And

203
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.720
there's a fellow there Alonza
Kai, he's been the day

204
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.650
to day maintainer of that
code for years now. And

205
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.680
when we first set out
on the project, a number

206
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.310
of people came forward. I
asked for volunteers and one

207
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.550
of them was a dope
fish, Justin, who had been

208
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.700
working on the main project
for years. And he was

209
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.990
fascinated by this. And there's,
there's, vectorial Malano and there's

210
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.330
James Baton cow. And there's
a bunch of people who

211
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.320
have been kind of, kind
of drifting into the project

212
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.760
and then working endless nights.
And they were all fascinated

213
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.750
at this project idea because
the outcome would be theoretically

214
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.800
miraculous. And so when we
first started using him script

215
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.020
and give you an idea,
I mean, you've seen this

216
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.380
in many projects, I'm sure
it took us. It took

217
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.790
us, I think something on
the order of nine months

218
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.380
to make a collegial vision
run at 5% speed inside

219
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:59.050
of a browser. And then
within a month we had

220
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:04.180
10 machines running at 50%.
And then within two months

221
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.320
we had 50 machines running
at anywhere from 50 to

222
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.770
a hundred percent. Oh my.
And so it was, it

223
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.070
kind of iterated up very
quickly and people would come

224
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.890
in and we would get
people who looked at it

225
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.030
and said, you know, you're
setting this and that's kind

226
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.610
of weird. Or we would
hand it back to the

227
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:29.140
subscription team or the Firefox
team. I mean, over time,

228
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.560
I mean, to have a
project is low. I mean

229
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.540
the whole point of something
like an am script and

230
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.960
was, Oh, you wrote a
calculator or you wrote a

231
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.130
database application, or you wrote
this small program, Hey, now

232
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.910
it's JavaScript. Isn't that great
everything's wine and roses. And

233
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:52.670
here we were throwing this
decade plus old massive project

234
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.690
that was meant to do
this incredibly complicated thing into

235
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.060
a browser and through them
script. And, and so the

236
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.230
first time I think we
did it, it produced 75

237
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.690
megabytes of JavaScript code and
it made Firefox crash and

238
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.610
Chrome thought it was broken
and we caused code changes

239
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.690
to Firefox, to Chrome, to
IM script in and to

240
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:23.750
maim because everybody had things
they never expected would be

241
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.440
important. Like there was code
in Firefox, for example, that

242
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.860
would do a quick check
of a JavaScript program to

243
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.430
make sure that it was
functional. And we had more

244
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.890
than a hundred thousand lines
of code that was in

245
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.640
JavaScript and it would crash
Firefox. So Firefox added a

246
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.370
thing that said, if it's
that big, don't just, just

247
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.910
let it go. And Chrome
had a few things where

248
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.250
it made calls and it
turned out it wasn't compatible

249
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.440
and they fixed it and
so on. And then Mame

250
00:15:55.010 --> 00:16:00.200
itself had a number of
approaches that needed a special

251
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.470
kind of sound device to
work with the web and

252
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.560
so on. But when it
was all said and done,

253
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.770
at one point we had
it that it was down

254
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.850
to, I want to say
about eight or nine megabytes

255
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.990
of JavaScript code to do
a specific machine emulation. And

256
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.160
then under the way that
JavaScript works, it actually compresses

257
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.920
down to like less than
a Mac. So for less

258
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.250
than a mag, you would
have a working Apple to,

259
00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.830
or a working asteroids machine.
So we ended up with

260
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:40.520
this environment and what ended
up happening was when I

261
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.520
first started it, there was
great skepticism among the main

262
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.070
team that this was even
a good idea. There was

263
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.920
skepticism in many areas that
this was a, in any

264
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.140
way, a good use of
resources or time or a

265
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:55.850
solution. And what ended up
happening was that last year

266
00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:04.040
and into this year, maim
actually absorbed our entire project.

267
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:09.740
So there is now direct
support for compiling, with JavaScript

268
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:14.060
as a target in Maine,
which means that technically the

269
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.410
project that I worked on
has been 100% obsoleted. That

270
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.860
is to say, we don't
have to write any code

271
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.980
to make meme, compile cleanly
into JavaScript because now maim

272
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.300
recognizes JavaScript as one of
its official outputs, along with

273
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.430
Macintosh and, and OSX and,
and, and you know, windows

274
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.500
and everywhere else. So that,
you know, that was a

275
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.980
huge step. And one of
the side effects of that

276
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:48.350
of course, is that compiling
out to the newest version

277
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.280
of meme. Cause a new
version of meme comes out

278
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.130
every month. This episode of
Hansel minutes is brought to

279
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.850
you by brain tree payments.
Why make payment integration more

280
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.300
difficult than it has to
be? Braintree's powerful, full stack

281
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.390
payment platform allows you to
accept nearly any type of

282
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.230
payment from any device. With
one integration, it's flexible to

283
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.590
your system's needs, supports most
programming languages. So whether you're

284
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.250
using Java, Ruby, or Python,
you'll always have a range

285
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:20.390
of service side and client
side SDKs available. Braintree makes

286
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.510
payments and your job a
whole lot easier. You can

287
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:37.130
learn more@braintreepayments.com slash Hanselman. That's
Braintree payments.com/hanselman. The internet archive,

288
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.590
where I work and where
we have this running can

289
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:45.170
have the newest changes to
maim in our web version

290
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.800
within the day of there
being improvements. And if somebody

291
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.800
makes an improvement immediately to
fix a major bug, we

292
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.340
can just turn around and
have that copy. Whereas previously

293
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.090
it was a very, you
know, bespoke and bunch of

294
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.990
people working together and then
dropping hints to each other.

295
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.710
And we would slowly produce
the new version. Now it's

296
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:12.950
pretty much automated. And so
that's great to, to describe

297
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.200
to a greater extent what
we're talking about here as

298
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.830
a philosophy. My goal always
had been, I mean, the

299
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.800
reason why I spent a
few years, you know, hurting

300
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.530
people into this and talking
about it was because I

301
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.610
realized that with a lot
of the history, the software

302
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.900
history, yeah. I can sit
here and I do and

303
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:39.050
make images of CD ROMs
or image floppies or image

304
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.230
cassette tapes with data on
them. And then we would

305
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.570
end up with a big
pile of data that would

306
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.410
have meaning to a vanishingly,
small number of people who

307
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.490
they might say, okay, I
want this, I will download

308
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.350
it. I will make it
work in an emulator. I

309
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.370
will analyze it and everything
else, but that that's not

310
00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.240
how people work. And that's
not how value is recognized

311
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.090
in this history. You know,
if somebody said to you,

312
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.940
trust me, there's, there's lots
of paintings and they're in

313
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.030
the warehouse and we have
them in boxes and don't

314
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.470
worry. They're good. People would
be like, Oh, okay. How

315
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.070
do I see the paintings?
Oh, by appointment with a

316
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:23.000
month warning that, you know,
people wouldn't give money to

317
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.930
museums because they'd say, well,
where's the stuff. And what

318
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.250
they do is they put
the stuff up on the

319
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.830
wall. They make sure it's
maintained and everything else. And

320
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.280
with movies and old radio
shows and old texts, if

321
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.890
a person can go to
a website and in one

322
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.090
click read an old newspaper
or read an old magazine,

323
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.330
they recognize both the contributions
that magazine. And they're able

324
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.220
to reference it and use
it in their work. They

325
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.050
say, Hey, look at this,
this was noted in this

326
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.130
magazine, here's a link. Or
Hey, somebody made something that

327
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.980
feels much like an analog
to what we're dealing with

328
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.060
today 50 years ago. Here's
what it looked like. You

329
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.750
know, we just become richer
as a society. And as

330
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.350
a group of people who
are working on anything that

331
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.170
touches a historical basis. And
so I wanted that for

332
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.350
software. And so in the
same way that you don't

333
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.510
even think about the fact
that somebody links you to

334
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.870
a YouTube video or a
Vimeo or, or something else,

335
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.510
and you just watch it,
I wanted it to be

336
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.860
so transparent and seamless that
a person would say, huh,

337
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.870
somebody made something like this
app for the Apple two.

338
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.110
Here's what it looked like.
And then just linking you

339
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.020
and beep, and there's an
Apple two running in your

340
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.970
browser and what it was
like, and you try it.

341
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.470
And, you know, in terms
of how people in the

342
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.140
world regard it, I mean,
I can tell you that,

343
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.310
you know, thousands and thousands
of people are using this

344
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.880
software emulator in the browser
now in a way ranging

345
00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.140
from just enjoying old entertainment
that they used to play

346
00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.030
as a kid, you know,
in other words, a personal

347
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:09.310
narrative, or they're using it
to reference things in classes

348
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.370
or their writings, or to
use as a jumping off

349
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:17.200
point for their own work.
And so the fact that

350
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.220
it's becoming transparent and that
the hard work underneath it

351
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.090
is not necessarily at the
forefront of people's minds is

352
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.630
actually to me an incredible
sign of success because you

353
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.680
don't wake up. I mean,
you know, there are dozens

354
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.180
of tests that the YouTube
player does to your browser,

355
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.820
to your system when you
run it to make sure

356
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.130
it gives you the smoothest
experience, it figures out where

357
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.040
you are and how your
machine runs to give you

358
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.040
video. That is as smooth
as possible and working as

359
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.170
well as it can with
your network. But you don't,

360
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.780
you don't, you know, boot
up a new Brittany Spears video

361
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.380
and think, Oh, these brave
engineers they're working so hard.

362
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.560
Oh my God, can you
imagine how they're able to

363
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.260
keep this high definition thing
going? Even though I'm downloading

364
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.230
this in the background, that's
amazing. Like you don't eat.

365
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.290
I understand that just like
you don't drive over a

366
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.650
bridge and thank the 500
people that make that bridge

367
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.760
not fall down. And the
fact that you're not taken

368
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.710
out of the experience and
that it boots up and

369
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.080
that you're looking at a
computer or an old arcade

370
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.030
game or an old computer
in the browser is just

371
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.800
great to me. So, so
it's nice because in the

372
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.980
last couple of years, we've
really had a success in

373
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.420
that area. And so it's,
it's, it's not perfect. And

374
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.210
we certainly can whip out
tests that show you how

375
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:48.410
imperfect it is, but when
it works, it's just in

376
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.310
the background. The most prominent
one right now is the

377
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.740
number one item that people
go to, to the internet

378
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.580
archive for, for the software
reason. And I buy often

379
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.800
go, I mean, every eight
seconds, a new one boots

380
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.120
up is Oregon trail for
dos. And it's used by

381
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.380
schools classic. Yeah, it's an
absolute classic it's timeless. It's,

382
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.190
it's just, it's literally as
timeless as Washington crossing the

383
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.870
Delaware or a Beethoven symphony
in terms of how beautifully

384
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:22.580
it brings all of these
historical aspects of the Oregon

385
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:29.000
trail and the, the difficulty
of using, you know, oxen

386
00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.600
and a big pile of
wood, dragging it across a

387
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:39.200
state, combined with lessons in
economics and resource management and

388
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.170
history. I mean, you know,
it's, it's this brilliant piece

389
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.200
of work and it's still
in use, like people are

390
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.650
booting it up from schools
in, in browsers. And having

391
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.420
people play these games because
it's really, really functional. I

392
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.240
mean, yeah, people will boot
up a Pac-Man clone or

393
00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.250
an arcade machine clone and
so on. But yeah, educational

394
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.150
software in some ways is
very evergreen. Like we, we

395
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.350
haven't changed how we understand
how fractions work. So an

396
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.900
educational program that was written
by experts and is of

397
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.330
good quality and time has
shown to be good. Quality

398
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.720
still works, you know, plunk
a kid in front of

399
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.030
it and they're going to
learn. And the fact that

400
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.280
it just functions that way
is to me, just really

401
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.600
amazing. And, and so it's,
it's become interwoven into a

402
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.090
certain amount of the fabric
of life. At this point,

403
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.060
You, you said in 2011,
when you kicked off this

404
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.940
idea, when you said, I
want to help port MES

405
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.350
and maim to JavaScript that
you had, basically, we're moving

406
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:46.420
from dealing with artifacts, to
dealing with experiences like you've

407
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.790
collected all these text files
and collected all these artifacts

408
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.730
and these graphics and all
these things, but they are,

409
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.070
they are artifacts, as opposed
to saying, here is an

410
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.930
experience and you have this
great sentence here where you

411
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.870
say, you want to take
someone from, I wonder what

412
00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.540
it was like to play
shoplifter to, wow, I'm playing

413
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.470
shoplifter. And five years later
that has happened. It's exactly

414
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.800
that I give, I show
my kids the game, I

415
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.840
give them the URL, they
go to it. And it's

416
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.430
not that they're watching a
video. It's not that they're

417
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.750
looking at screenshots. They are
experiencing it. And you're even

418
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:21.670
going so far to make
it look the way it

419
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.940
was. I'm looking at a
demo here of CRT effects.

420
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.050
Sure. What's going on here?
Okay. So one of the,

421
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.580
one of the great things
about mankind is like Douglas Adams

422
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.730
said, you know, we quickly
go from, you know, how

423
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:40.030
do I eat to what
is eating to where do

424
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.590
we eat? And, and, and
the fact is, is people

425
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.520
go, Hey, this is, this
is working in my browser.

426
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.240
What an amazing thing to,
well, I remember it a

427
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.470
little differently and I don't
think this is, this is

428
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.290
exactly how it was. You
should really fix that. You

429
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.590
know, like it's a bug
and in the same way

430
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.280
that you might, you know,
play an old movie and

431
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.480
you will have it cropped
or time stretched or the

432
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.640
sound, isn't what you remember.
We quickly run into the

433
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.900
greatest problem that every preservation
project has, which is bringing

434
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.470
back, not just the fact
of a thing and enough

435
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.200
of its attributes for you
to go, yes, that's true.

436
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.590
The woman in the painting
has one head. There is

437
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.650
a, there was a dog
in the painting too. What

438
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.830
is it like to stand
in a gallery with this

439
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.400
painting? And how can I
reproduce that experience? Because that's

440
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.100
part of what the painting's
purpose was, was to wow.

441
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.330
You and with computers and
video games. If you look

442
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:50.340
back at that experience, it's
both digital, you know, digital

443
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.730
data, but there's actually a
lot of analog experience as

444
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:59.040
well. We end up with
things like, you know, putting

445
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.430
a disc into a disc,
drive, hearing the grind of

446
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.370
a disc as it would
boot up different parts of

447
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.210
the floppy during the game,
people would tell me, you

448
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.990
know, they, they would play
an old game on an

449
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.190
old computer with a floppy
disc in the machine, and

450
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.930
they would move down a
dungeon. And at one point

451
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:25.020
they turn a corner and
they would hear the disc

452
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.420
drive light turn on and
grind, and they would reach

453
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.620
over reflexively and pop the
door open because they knew

454
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:39.090
it was about to write
a death. And so they

455
00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.370
knew that they could do
this. They could avoid a

456
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:48.090
death by stopping the machine
from writing anything floppy. And

457
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:53.610
that experience is not vital.
I mean, for some people

458
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.390
just knowing that there was
a game that had Dungeons

459
00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.820
and death and, and it
was on a computer is

460
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.120
sufficient. But for people who
then try to compare it

461
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.260
to how it really was
things like sound and video

462
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:14.070
and performance need ironically much
more work to emulate the

463
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:18.660
flaws and strangeness of the
past. And so one of

464
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.720
those projects that was started
by some people involved with

465
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.510
Mayme was to start emulating
the way that monitors really

466
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:34.410
worked pre LCD screen pre
flat screen. You know, when

467
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.340
tubes were the order of
the day inside of a

468
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.820
monitor, and it was this
beam that magnets were manipulating

469
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:47.020
to make phosphorous glow on
a screen so that a

470
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.860
beam aimed at your eye
was being stopped by this

471
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:59.460
painted curved glass that would
glow and sometimes had a

472
00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:04.290
beam that would be different
colors or actually color on

473
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.730
the glass to be able
to make vector games, right.

474
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:15.000
Vector games and RCA televisions
actually. And they would bring

475
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.050
out color, but at a
cost of fidelity and Norris,

476
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.410
I mean, you know, we
start out with something as

477
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:28.020
simple as, you know, UHF
and VHF signals. And then

478
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.370
we started moving to conversion
that would kind of send

479
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.440
a, an earth hats signal
to a television. You would

480
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.560
have to actually, you know,
screw in wires in the

481
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.460
back to make your video
game, use the television, to

482
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.060
changes, to format with things
like S video, which is

483
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.070
now on its way while
not even just on its

484
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.110
way out, it's out the
door, it's down the street

485
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.680
it's gone. And then what
we now have with HTMI

486
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.900
and, and other formats and
the fidelity of how they

487
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.340
put these things together was
calculated into the software. Most

488
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.910
the, the most classic example.
And he's more than happy

489
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.000
to tell you about this
is David Crane, who did pitfall

490
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.540
and a hundred other games
for Activision and many other

491
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.500
companies. When he was working
on video games in the

492
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:22.290
early eighties, his characters on
the screen calculated a certain

493
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.190
amount of fuzziness built into
the beam so that he

494
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.580
would leave a black Mark
or a black line with

495
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.400
no light on it, because
he knew the line above

496
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:36.600
and below would blend in
that small gap. And when

497
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.970
he went to quote unquote
hard line, he would use

498
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.930
between two or three black
lines to ensure that the

499
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.410
beam didn't overflow, but he
was trying for a very

500
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:52.410
smooth and soft experience fast
forward. And now people are

501
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:56.310
playing these old games and
they look like Lego bricks,

502
00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:00.330
because we don't have that
anymore. I mean, everybody wants

503
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.580
super fidelity. You want to
be able to have a,

504
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:08.490
you know, 75 dots per
inch monitor. And again, you

505
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.710
know, dialing it back, having
pitfall in your window in

506
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:17.610
a second after you click
a URL is miraculous and

507
00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:23.760
now commonplace, but there are
going to be iterative improvements

508
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.250
to say, okay, yes, we
did it. Everyone gets a

509
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.090
cake, but wait a minute,
we actually had this attribute.

510
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.450
We would have slightly fuzzy
screens. We would have screens

511
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:38.190
that bled color. When the
beam stopped running the phosphorus,

512
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:42.260
doesn't just shut off in
two seconds. It would do

513
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.650
a small afterglow and it
would actually be possible to

514
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.470
burn in if you left
the thing on for too

515
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.790
long and to emulate all
of that is now where

516
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:56.390
we're headed. And it's much
more processor intensive. It's much

517
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.290
more involved, certainly on certain
machines. The example that we

518
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.330
put up, we took an
old, I took an old

519
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.790
bootleg, or it wasn't so
much a bootleg is kind

520
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.460
of an alternate version of
donkey Kong called crazy Kong.

521
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.510
And it has its own
interesting story. And we put

522
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.490
up a version of it
on the internet archive, just

523
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:17.090
to enable you to kind
of experience a kind of

524
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:25.220
subtle, weird video artifacting of
CRTs in 1982, which meme

525
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.610
does. And again, if you
have a slower machine, it

526
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.950
runs much slower now, because
now it's doing a whole

527
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:35.570
layer of calculation and, and
I've, I've, I've run tests

528
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.170
with people. Not everyone sees
it, which may be the

529
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.360
greatest success of all right.
But, but for some people

530
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.390
they're like, you know, what,
what, what, yeah. Like it's

531
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.600
just not in their head.
Yeah, no, the way, same

532
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.670
way an audio file might
say, I can hear the

533
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.210
difference between this is a
vinyl record and this is

534
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.650
a cassette off of the
master tape in the same

535
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:02.630
way. You can have people
whose eyes just kind of

536
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.810
bring in like, yup, that's
an old video game and

537
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.780
people who go, wow, how
is it ghosting the character

538
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.470
he's fading as he runs
by suddenly that's amazing. And,

539
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.640
and they'll see it. So,
so that's, you know, that's

540
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.830
one piece of it. And
like I made a reference

541
00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.190
to maim is now working
very hard to emulate the

542
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:25.640
sounds of a floppy drive
that will become a slider.

543
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.480
I'll, I'll be sure to
add that when it's mature

544
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:35.150
enough, but basically there's been
work to literally sample a

545
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:41.510
disc drive engine and read
process, so that an accurate

546
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:44.930
portrayal of what that this
drive sounded like next to

547
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:49.670
your machine can be included
optionally. And that's the kind

548
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.770
of, that's the kind of
work that like, you know,

549
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.470
I mean, I've been told
there's like six people who

550
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:59.600
do silk painting restoring in
the world and everybody who

551
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.870
apprentices under them has to
apprentice for 15 or 20

552
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.660
years before they get their
own shot at it. And

553
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:09.590
there is a very small
amount of people and I

554
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.200
support and care about them
very much who are focused

555
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:18.080
on this kind of level,
because this is work. That

556
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.490
is, I would say relatively
thankless, not, not in a

557
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:27.680
bad way, just relatively thankless.
Yeah. Yeah. So as we

558
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.930
reached the end of our
time here, let me ask

559
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.930
you this. Sure. The call
to action to the audience,

560
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:37.100
isn't just go and experience,
but it's also to appreciate,

561
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.720
and let me ask you
this, how do we support

562
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.910
you? How do we support
textiles? How do we support

563
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.840
archive.org? Is this isn't run
by the government, right? How

564
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.220
do you all get money
and how can we give

565
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.850
you money? So the internet
archive is a nonprofit library

566
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.040
that people know of as
the way back machine and

567
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.860
more and more people know
about for the software and

568
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.020
obviously the books and movies
and music and all the

569
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.530
other things that it hosts.
And it's at archive.org, and

570
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.150
there's an archive.org/donate. And that's
fine. I would love for

571
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:10.470
people to contribute in ways
that help financially with such

572
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:14.670
a nonprofit. But beyond that,
if you have a audience

573
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:18.810
who have technical expertise or
who have influence in the

574
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:23.310
realm of understanding, you know,
our computer history or presenting

575
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.120
it, I would say, you
know, a project like Maine

576
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:33.630
and there's other ones really
are depending on really technically

577
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:39.330
skilled people who are also
working basically for free and

578
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.440
who are constantly on the
move to try to make

579
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.670
sure that some record of
old software and old hardware

580
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.770
persists. And they have like
any large scale project, you

581
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.080
know, rules for adding code.
So if you're a coder,

582
00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:00.000
if you're doing work in
meme and you're helping, it's

583
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.970
going to be reflected in
code that thousands and thousands

584
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.700
of people will use around
the world. So, so there's

585
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.870
a reward there and contributing
your expertise would not just

586
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.540
be, you're helping some nerd
play an old Atari game.

587
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:16.590
I mean, you are literally
affecting computer history and online

588
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:21.840
and digital history by doing
this. But beyond that, people

589
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.350
who have old hardware, old
materials who are wondering about

590
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:34.430
like, does anyone care? We
care and, and I'm not

591
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.710
afraid to give my email
out. J Scott J a

592
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:40.190
C O T t@archive.org. I
love hearing from people who

593
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.850
are like the, my favorite
letters are, I don't know

594
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:47.240
if this is of interest,
but because almost always is

595
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.510
of interest, you know? And,
and, and, and people saying,

596
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.340
I don't even know where
to begin with this. I

597
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:58.280
have stuff maybe it's useful.
Maybe it's not. And just

598
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:02.330
that mental jump from, like,
if you went up into

599
00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.660
your attic and there were
10 old paintings there and

600
00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.930
they looked really old and
they were wrapped really nicely,

601
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.630
you wouldn't be like, Oh
no, what do you think?

602
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.220
Can I throw this out?
Do I keep, like, you

603
00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.970
would say, man, I better
call local museum. And if

604
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:19.940
you've got a relative or
yourself, and you've got some

605
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.480
old software, you may be
the last person to have

606
00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.680
that software or any record
of that old software and

607
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.730
contacting us to say, look,
I've got some stuff I,

608
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:37.390
you know, would wonderful that,
that, you know, finance always

609
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.290
helpful. We do fundraising fundraising
drives and, and meme has

610
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.350
fundraising drives to help acquire
rare equipment when it needs

611
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:49.300
to be purchased. But, but
you know, a technical expertise

612
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.340
and an emotional and supportive
expertise. That's, that's where we

613
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.360
really, really, I think this
thing needs, love. People need

614
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.000
to know, and people need
to help it. And people

615
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.240
need to encourage it in
just a, this is a

616
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:09.400
valid, wonderful thing that needs
to be done culturally for

617
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.650
the way the world has
been for the last half

618
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:16.180
century, as important as making
sure that an old film

619
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.510
is still playable and making
sure that an old car

620
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:24.850
still runs, this is still
really vital and, and needs

621
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:29.050
to be there for future
generations. Well, I think definitely

622
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.090
the work that you're doing
is absolutely vital. And I

623
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.270
am in awe of the,
the, the Corpus of information

624
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.250
that has been collected since
you were, since you were

625
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.820
nine years old. And I
think I speak on behalf

626
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.640
of the audience that we
appreciate you. We appreciate text

627
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.400
files and we appreciate archive.org.
And thanks so much for

628
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.120
chatting with me today. Hey,
thank you. This has been

629
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.550
another episode of Hansel minutes
and we'll see you again

630
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:59.220
next week. <inaudible>.
