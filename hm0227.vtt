web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

Scott talks about expression, super

7
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.840
preview with developer Mike Calvo.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman,

8
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.120
and this is another episode
of Hansel minutes. Today. I'm

9
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.150
sitting down with Mike <inaudible>
a senior development lead at

10
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.120
Microsoft working on super preview
and actually Mike and I

11
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.610
have a couple of things
in common. One of which

12
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.640
is that we're both remote.
So you're not in Redmond

13
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.040
area. No, I'm in Saint
Paul, Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota,

14
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.670
the hotbed of Microsoft development.
That's right. That's right. We've

15
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.910
got a twin cities development
center about 30 developers out

16
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.730
here and in Minnesota. And
we're a we're building products

17
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.390
for the expression brand of
Microsoft products Idea that we

18
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.570
had people in Minnesota. Are
you affected by the Microsoft

19
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.370
reality distortion field that is
hovering over Redmond? Or We

20
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.310
try, we try not to,
but occasionally it creeps in,

21
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.520
but, but it's exciting to
have a chance to work

22
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.610
for Microsoft and not necessarily
have to relocate across the

23
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.910
country. Definitely. I love it.
Down here in Portland, do

24
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.310
you do communicator calls or
do you have like a

25
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.970
telepresence wall of some kind,
A lot of the communicator

26
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.880
calls we do a lot
of round table use a

27
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.640
lot of round table technology,
which has been great. And,

28
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.790
but yeah, I probably spend
a good four or five

29
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.360
hours out of my day
on communicator. Yeah. I actually

30
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.490
have got a machine set
up over here with a

31
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.670
kind of a persistent portal
rather than keeping calls up

32
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.100
and down all day. We
just actually made a special

33
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.310
account and we just keep
it on eight hours a

34
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.350
day. And that way someone
can stop by the office

35
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.110
and say, Oh, there, there
Scott. And I said, yeah,

36
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.000
I have to heat. Try
that one out myself. If

37
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.860
you got the bandwidth to
blow, right. Just keep it

38
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.450
on all the time and
then somebody can pop in.

39
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.840
So then the trick is
to go to Costco and

40
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.830
get somebody to sell you
a 42 inch monitor by

41
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.230
a big HDTV, right? Then
you plug a little laptop

42
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.360
into it at HTMI and
you have a giant portal

43
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.400
into Minnesota. Perfect idea. So
I'm thinking about, so you're

44
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.100
working on super preview. Now
this is part of expression.

45
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.570
Now, most of the people
who listen to the show

46
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.290
are devs. They might use
expression blend, but I think

47
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.020
that expression kind of tapers
off the developer side and

48
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.560
into the designer stuff pretty
quickly. Right? So there's products

49
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.970
they don't think about. Sure.
So expression web or super

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.280
is actually a product that
was originally came out as

51
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.670
a companion product to expression
web, which is our HTML

52
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.570
offering tool. And what super
preview does is it helps

53
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.680
you to debug cross-browser problems.
So it lets you look

54
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.190
at your pages as they
would render in the various

55
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.440
popular browsers that are out
there in the wild today.

56
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.210
And there's seems to be
two versions, right? I can

57
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.660
get a free one that
will give me a six,

58
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.800
seven and eight all at
the same time. Right. That's

59
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.050
right. That's right. We call
that the super preview for

60
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.110
IIE. And as you stated
that, that lets you take

61
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.090
a look at your page
as it would look in

62
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.300
all of the current versions
of it that are out

63
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.920
in the world today. So
I <inaudible>, that's a free

64
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.540
offering that you can download
from the expression website. The

65
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.200
full version of super preview
is comes as part of

66
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.940
the expression studio or the
expression web product that gives

67
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.830
you the addition of Firefox
browsers as well as just

68
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.890
recently released as part of
a expression studio four. We

69
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.840
now support a maximum, sorry.
Okay. So I've got MSDN

70
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.260
license, right? So the MSDN
people get this too. That's

71
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.230
right. That's right. With an
MSDN license, you can download

72
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.870
and install the full expression
studio, which would, as you

73
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.470
mentioned, come with blend, but
also comes with expression web

74
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.250
and includes super preview. Okay.
So I'm, I'm old, I've

75
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.150
opened up super preview here
and I put in hanselman.com.

76
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.300
I've got I E eight
on the right hand side

77
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.490
of this basic, my screen
is split into two panes

78
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.540
and this is kind of
nice cause I've got a

79
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.090
30 inch monitor. So I've
actually got the entire page

80
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.100
being shown there. It looks,
looks like the bigger, the

81
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.100
monitor, the better was a
preview. And interestingly, the whole

82
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.850
screen on the edges is
rulers, big pixel rulers that

83
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.780
go around all three of
the four edges around and

84
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.430
I'm going to click <inaudible>
and then really quickly, like

85
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.980
not maybe I think it
was like two seconds, three

86
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.460
seconds. I'm looking at a
slightly different rendering of my,

87
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.830
of my site on the
left. And it's subtly, it's

88
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.680
somehow crappier because it's ice
six. And I use this

89
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.750
just a couple of days
ago to figure out that

90
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.160
I had some PNG transparency
problems actually with the <inaudible>

91
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.440
and as I hover over
these, Oh wow, I've got

92
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.100
another problem now. So this
is interesting. It looks like

93
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.680
I've got a, an issue
where my right rail of

94
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.890
my blog is being pushed
out of the way. And

95
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.920
as I hover around on
the different elements, they, they

96
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.940
highlight. This is really interesting.
So for example, if I

97
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.890
hover over the title on
the left side, I've got

98
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.800
<inaudible> and highlights. And then
it shows me where that

99
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.860
highlight would be on the
other side. But if I

100
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.160
roll over on the browser,
it shows me where it

101
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.780
would be on the other
ones. So it really is

102
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.640
tracking somehow live between the
two instances what's what's going

103
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.570
on here. That's right. We
understood that, that the way

104
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.790
people debug cross-browser problems is
to basically look at elements

105
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.940
and look at debug things
kind of top to bottom.

106
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.850
So once you kind of
discover where things had started

107
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.000
to go awry, you, you
typically can, can begin that

108
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.050
debugging process. And so what
we do is actually pull

109
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.900
the Dom information out of
the browser so that we

110
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.900
understand what's the information that
the browser is using to

111
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.000
render the page. And then
what we, what we do

112
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.430
is allot, try to align
the Dom elements to the

113
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.700
core between the browsers so
that we can help somebody

114
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.870
diagnose where that problem can
begin. So, as you mentioned,

115
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.690
when you, when you click
on an element in one

116
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.390
of the renderings, it will
highlight it. And then what

117
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.960
it'll do is attempt to
find the same element in

118
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.000
the other Dom basically by
using its position in the

119
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.450
hierarchy and highlight that element
in addition, and it will

120
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.440
show you an outline of,
of the same region that

121
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.170
is on your, on the
left side, it'll show you

122
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.420
that highlighted so that you
can see the difference between

123
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.150
where the actual element is
and where it is and

124
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.980
the other browser. So it
really, it really gives you

125
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.560
a, a nice way to
see the differences between the

126
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.940
two browsers on an element
by element basis. Yeah. When

127
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.980
I, when I had my
PNG problem, my, it turns

128
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.610
out that my header was
a PNG that was transparent,

129
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.820
and I had no idea
that on <inaudible> it was

130
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.490
coming out kind of like
gray, the transparency wasn't working.

131
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.800
And I wasn't sure if
it was in the background

132
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.830
element in, in the image
itself, if it was the

133
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.580
background image on the, the
header. So I hovered around

134
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.830
until I found out that
it was in fact the

135
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.440
main image, and then I
put it in the <inaudible>

136
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.730
PNG transparency fixed, and then
just went into preview and

137
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.160
then hit refresh all and
then it, and then it

138
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.960
looked fine. And I knew
that I looked okay and,

139
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.990
and I six. So for
stuff like that, I mean,

140
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.710
for fixing six problems, it
was, it was, it's really

141
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.220
the only game in town
for me. But I was

142
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.660
thinking there's a couple of
different ways I could have

143
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.920
done this. Cause I'm using
windows seven. I could have

144
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.210
like maybe brought up a
VM cause I've got windows,

145
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.450
XP mode. I mean, there's
really three things that you

146
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.780
could do, right? You could
use a screenshot service, like

147
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.560
online browser shots or whatever
go online. And they would

148
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.740
give me a picture of
how it looks, I could

149
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.190
use a virtual machine or
I could use something like

150
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.500
super preview. So why wouldn't
I want to just fire

151
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.070
up virtual machines with copies
of XP, with <inaudible> and

152
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.260
then I don't have to
pay for super preview. Well,

153
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.260
that's right. And, and certainly
using VMs is something that

154
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.600
we all do, you know,
almost on a daily basis

155
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.870
to figure out those, those
different version problems. So that,

156
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.090
that you can certainly do.
I think what what super

157
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.830
preview provides is, is what
you saw and talked about

158
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.820
in terms of being able
to highlight the elements B

159
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.570
being able to see the,
the SA the browser images

160
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.970
side by side, and to
be able to actually compare

161
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.750
at a pixel perfect positioning
where each element exists. It's

162
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.720
something that, and, and, and
in addition, the, the responsiveness

163
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.790
that you talked about, how
quickly we're able to render

164
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.970
the images and show you
that response, you know, when

165
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.190
you're debugging something, the ability
to make a change and

166
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.950
quickly see how that change
has impacted your, your web

167
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.550
design is really important. And
so this is, these are,

168
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.770
these are the values that
super preview brings is that

169
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.280
you can go quickly make
a change, refresh, super preview

170
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.550
and see instantly how that
changes reflected both in your

171
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.940
original browser, whether it be
<inaudible>. And then in the

172
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.180
comparison browser, I six in
this case. So it's, it's

173
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.570
really about improving performance and
being able to more quickly

174
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.800
identify and then fix cross-browser
problems that, that really makes

175
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.430
it an advantage over the
VM model or the snapshot

176
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.970
services, which typically don't provide
you that Dom analysis and

177
00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.100
the pixel level positioning of
the elements. Yeah. I noticed

178
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.500
that I can pull just
like in Photoshop, I can

179
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.260
pull away from the ruler
and I can pull out

180
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.660
left and right. Guides and
they'll actually track both browsers.

181
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.670
So I'm changing, I'm pulling
out a guide for one

182
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.070
browser and there's an identical
mirror guide on the other

183
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.070
side. That's right. That's right.
And that's a, that's a

184
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.980
tool that is familiar to
a lot of folks that

185
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.620
do a web design and
development. Yeah. Well, actually in

186
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.600
speaking of design, one of
the things that was surprising

187
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.090
to me was I, if
I close the left side

188
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.150
here and I have a
choice, I says I six,

189
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.020
seven, eight, and compatibility mode,
eight regular Firefox, and I

190
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.230
have 3.6 0.8, it says
Safari Mac. And then at

191
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:44.360
the bottom here, it says
open Photoshop document or image

192
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.220
That's right. So, so again,
many folks will start off

193
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.410
with a design that was,
or a comp that was

194
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.450
created by a peer design
person in Photoshop. And a

195
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.840
lot of times they're trying
to make their website match

196
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.260
as closely as possible to
that cop. And so being

197
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.260
able to open the comp
and being able to compare

198
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.890
that comp side by side
with the actual rendered webpage

199
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.500
in the browser again, is
a, is a really handy

200
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.860
thing for people that are
using CRE creating real world

201
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.400
read websites that started off
by somebody in the design

202
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.880
world that would use a
tool like Photoshop. In addition,

203
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.120
you can also open up
any, any standard type of

204
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.980
image to compare the webpage
rendering to an image. How

205
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.870
important do you think the
pixel perfect is? Because, and

206
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.740
I remember hating designers in
that room in the late

207
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.440
nineties, who would tell me
that, you know, everything was

208
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.590
fine except the shopping cart
icons and, you know, pixel

209
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.990
too far to the left.
Is that what we want

210
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.910
to do? We really want
to get people thinking about

211
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.030
things in terms of pixel.
Perfect. I, I do think

212
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.430
it's, it's a slippery slope
and I, what, what a

213
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.580
tool like super preview is,
is most valuable for our,

214
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.690
for the pages that have
some, you know, really serious

215
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.670
rendering difference where, where it
actually makes information not be

216
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.580
readable on a page. And
so a lot of times

217
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.940
that might just be a
simple tweak to a, an

218
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.690
outer container element or some,
some part of the structural

219
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.940
layout that, that a tool
like super preview can really

220
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.380
help you find quickly. And,
you know, and, and, you

221
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.140
know, really get that problem
resolved, you know, w without

222
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.300
too much effort, because you
can, you know, most of

223
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.930
the problem is around identifying
the root of the root

224
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.470
cause of the, of the
layout issue. But I, I

225
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.200
agree with you, you know,
it, it can, it can

226
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.330
be a slippery slope to,
to start trying to get

227
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.300
pixel perfect accuracy on these
designs. And I, I don't

228
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.310
think that's the real high
value for super preview. I

229
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.520
really think it's to make
sure that the website or

230
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.110
the web design is readable
and all the information is

231
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.880
presentable so that, you know,
you don't, you don't miss

232
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.940
a huge part of your
target audience because they happened

233
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.010
to be running a high
six. Hi, this is Scott.

234
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.490
I just want to remind
you guys that there is

235
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.860
no show without a sponsor.
Somebody has got to pay

236
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.560
for all this bandwidth and
the more popular the show

237
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.170
becomes, the more important it
is that we thank our

238
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.400
sponsors folks. Like Tellerik, I
wanna let you guys know

239
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.040
that Tellerik has got a
pretty cool deal going between

240
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:27.480
June 1st, 2010 and August 31st, 2010, any interested
listener, just send an email

241
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:36.330
to podcast@telleriktlerik.com mentioned Hansel minutes,
and they will reply, and

242
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.080
they'll give you a special
$50 off coupon code. So

243
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.910
just remember podcast at <inaudible>
dot com mentioned Hansel minutes,

244
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:50.940
$50 off. It goes until
August 31st, 2010, and big thanks again

245
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.490
for the folks at Tellerik
for believing in our show

246
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.860
and for continuing to help
pay for our expenses. So

247
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.200
it looks like I'm hovering
over a one of my

248
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.560
images here. It turns out
that recently, I think yesterday

249
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.600
I posted something where my,
one of my images was

250
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.410
too wide and it shoved
my, my right rail all

251
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.360
the way down. So I
figured out what my <inaudible>

252
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.200
issue is while you were
talking, I'm going to close

253
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.840
IAE, and then I'm going
to pick Safari, and it

254
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.540
says remote browser beta. And
then it has a little

255
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.110
kind of icon indicating something's
going to happen far away.

256
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.860
Yup. Yeah, that's a new
feature that we're really excited

257
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.460
about the way, the way
the IE browsers and the

258
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.790
Firefox browser works in super
preview is we actually communicate

259
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.850
with the real browser on
your machine to produce an

260
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.060
image, get the Dom and
display that in super preview,

261
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.280
obviously, to get a rendering
on Safari, we, we could

262
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.110
have, we could have done
the same thing with Safari

263
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.160
on a PC, but what
we found is that most

264
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.220
people were interested in how
does my website look on

265
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.730
a Mac? And so to,
to implement that, what we

266
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.580
did was actually, we created
a server farm with a

267
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.410
bunch of Mac servers up
in the cloud. And those

268
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.970
servers respond to requests from
super preview. And we'll render,

269
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.690
we'll render either a public
URI, like you're trying to

270
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.980
hanselman.com, or if you're developing
a page locally, it will

271
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.710
actually bundle up all of
the files required for, to

272
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.980
render that page, send that
up to the server, the

273
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.430
Mac or Mac servers, and
the farm will render it

274
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.720
using Safari for, and we'll
send back the domino and

275
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.220
the picture. And you can,
you can view that in

276
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.710
super preview side by side,
with any of the IES

277
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.630
or Firefox browsers that you've
got locally. Okay. So you're

278
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.110
saying I can actually go
local host 80, 80, and

279
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.540
hit refresh. And it's just
going to be as if

280
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.710
it's, it's just not seamless.
I'm not going to know

281
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.060
any, No on local files.
You will need to actually

282
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.440
use the file colon slash
slash URL to that. That'll,

283
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.830
that'll tell the super preview
to, to go ahead and

284
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.900
bundle up all those, all
those related files and send

285
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.840
it up. If you give
it any sort of HTTP

286
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.600
URL, it will, it will
actually go in and just

287
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.490
send that URL to the
server and that will get

288
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.370
rendered. So if it's a,
if it's a local file,

289
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.200
you want to preview, you
need to, you need to

290
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.100
open it within super preview
with the file URL. Okay.

291
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.660
Yeah. That would be a
cool feature though. If I

292
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.210
could do that, if you
could bring it down, That

293
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.770
would be, that would be
that that's something we should

294
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.550
definitely get added to our,
to our product studio list

295
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.820
for, for next release or,
or service packs. So I'm

296
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.330
looking at this and it's,
it's, it's creepy. Cause it

297
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.240
looks like a Mac it's
got like my inline scroll

298
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.150
bars have the little Mac
Chrome, sorry. I know it's

299
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.000
a Mac. I can see
places where I had eye

300
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.990
frames and different things where
it's, this is unquestionably Mac

301
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.930
and it has that Mac
font style. And I can,

302
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.360
it looks like I can
zoom in. Yeah. It's definitely

303
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.450
a Mac I can tell
by the fonts and it's

304
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.940
just ever so subtle. It
actually looks okay. So it

305
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.850
looks like I look all
right on the Mac. Now

306
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.210
I was, I was poking
around and by poking around,

307
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.770
I was trying to take
those apart and figure out

308
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.900
how it works. So I
hope you don't mind. I

309
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.560
noticed that if you go
to the help menu and

310
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.580
you say feedback, you say,
create feedback or send feedback,

311
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.880
and then you say, create
attachment. You make a zip

312
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.150
file and you stick it
somewhere. And it says the

313
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.480
expression web team wants customer
feedback. Okay. And then you

314
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.550
have a path to the
zip file. So I actually

315
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:38.200
opened that zip file up,
cause this is the file

316
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.620
you're about to send to
the team. And I started

317
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.970
poking around in here, and
this is really interesting, cause

318
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.250
this is kind of where,
where it all happens. I'm

319
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.910
looking in this zip file
and it says browser <inaudible>

320
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.500
browser, IAA, remote browser. And
within them is this Dom

321
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.320
XML and then an image
and then a bunch of

322
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.420
settings. So you have a
serialized version of the Dom

323
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:09.240
and you're actually putting X,
Y coordinates, basically saying, this

324
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.200
element is here on this
browser. That's right. How are

325
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.500
you, how are you talking
to each browser? Cause every

326
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.510
browser has a different way
for you to potentially get

327
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.160
this information. That's right. That's
right. So, so what we

328
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.460
do is we, we use
the publicly available APIs for

329
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:30.920
the browsers. So for example,
I, he exposes numerous comm

330
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.190
API APIs that allow us
to ask the browser to

331
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.890
do things for us, like
render an image of a

332
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.760
or to navigate to our
URI. We can also say,

333
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.850
okay, once you've navigated doing
it, URI gives me access

334
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.210
to the documents and basically
go through each node and

335
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.720
the document and ask it
for interesting information that would

336
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.130
help you to provide information
that would help debug rendering

337
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.010
problems. So, so in the,
in the, in the examples

338
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.610
that we have now, whether
it be Firefox IE or

339
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.640
Safari, we are using the
API APIs into those browsers

340
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.670
that give us the ability
to ask it, you know,

341
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.860
tell us, give us the
top level dominoed and then

342
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.210
we just basically iterate through
all the children and stuff

343
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.240
into an XML document and
send it back, send it

344
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.350
back to the desktop. So
when I click on Firefox

345
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.840
here and I've got Firefox
and Safari side by side,

346
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.320
you're communicating with my local
version of Firefox. Am I

347
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.640
going to see Firefox? I
opened the task manager. You

348
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.550
will not see Firefox when
you open the task manager.

349
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.840
We, we actually, when you,
with Firefox, we actually launch

350
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.980
a separate process that allows
us to go ahead and

351
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.510
engage with the Firefox API
APIs. And we only have

352
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.930
that running for the period
of the time that you

353
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.790
are actually rendering. So if
you, if you were to

354
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.980
start up your task manager
and you happen to catch

355
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.140
it just in the right
spot, you might see something

356
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.100
that's called a pips pips
study XC, right? It's a

357
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.040
pipe server. And so we,
we, we start up the

358
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.740
server that actually do the
rendering. So we can allow

359
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.800
the UI to continue to
be responsive while the browser

360
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.320
is rendering in the background
or in a separate process.

361
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.570
And we send it a
command, tell it to render

362
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.410
this page or render this
file. And, and then when

363
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.620
it completes it, shuts it
down, sends back the information

364
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.860
through the pipe and, and
then we display it in

365
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.810
the UI. So like I
said, if you, if you

366
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.690
want to see the, the
thing that's actually talking to

367
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.180
the, the Firefox libraries, it
would be that, that pipe

368
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.070
server that we, that we
start up and shut down

369
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.850
after the, after the renderings.
So what I'm doing, because

370
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.910
I just built a new
computer is I've added everything.

371
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.060
So I've got one, two,
three, four, five, six different,

372
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:51.850
I've got Firefox. <inaudible> Safari
for, I ate in compatibility

373
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.380
mode. I hit refresh and
I see expression web preview

374
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.890
pipe server one, two, three,
four, five, and then super

375
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.210
preview. And this is why
it's so fast. I'm realizing

376
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.000
on my machine. Cause I've
got a six processor machine.

377
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.790
A lot of people have
quads and you're firing off

378
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.780
different, different processes. So this
is a nice use of

379
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.390
a multiprocessor you're getting for
free because you're using out

380
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:17.550
a process for this, for
this work. That's right. That's

381
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.670
pretty slick. Okay. So that's
how you're talking to Firefox

382
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.680
and Safari and using public
APIs. I use Chrome a

383
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.260
lot where's Chrome. And if
I were going to plug

384
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.810
in what I just you'll
have to create a pipe

385
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.300
server that will talk to
Chrome and then use publicly

386
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.650
available APIs to pull that
information out of Chrome. That's

387
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.480
right. That's right. So Chrome
is one thing that we

388
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.870
currently don't support. And the
reason for that at the

389
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.380
moment is, is Chrome. Unlike
Firefox and unlike IAE. And

390
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:51.510
unlike Safari does not have
a public API from which

391
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.970
you can control or get
information out of the browser.

392
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:59.580
Now it is based on
the same rendering engine as

393
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.420
a Safari, but again, they
don't, they don't provide the

394
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.630
external API APIs to actually
drive the browser and get

395
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.210
Dom information out of it.
So we're currently in the

396
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.440
process of figuring out a
different way to, to provide

397
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.070
the rendering support for Chrome.
And once we do, we

398
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.740
we're sure to, to make
that available to super preview

399
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.160
and, and make a leverage
of the, the current cloud

400
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.040
environment that we've created for
the Safari data generator to

401
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.870
get that out as soon
as we can to our

402
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.540
customers. Oh, okay. So you're
going to be able to

403
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.130
get newer brows now that
you've got the remote infrastructure,

404
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.530
you could put browsers out
and I wouldn't need to

405
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.560
even install them. That's right.
That's right. So that, that

406
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.770
was, that was why the
adding the Safari support was

407
00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.200
a big step for us
because that basically opened, it

408
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.950
opened up the portal to
allow us to now in

409
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.210
between releases of expression studio,
we can have the flexibility

410
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.150
and the ability to, to
add new browser support in

411
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.820
the cloud before we have
a chance to actually update

412
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.000
the client. So, so for
people that are currently using

413
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.370
super preview or interested in
using super preview, but we

414
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.130
don't currently have the browser
that you're looking for, stay

415
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.380
tuned because we're going to
continue to work on that

416
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.830
and, and, and, and increase
our, our, our offering of

417
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.990
browsers in the cloud. Am
I going to see those

418
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.910
browsers just kind of pop
in like one day I'll

419
00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.700
open, super preview and there'll
be another browser there. That's

420
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.830
right. We have a, what
we call the discovery service,

421
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.760
which allows the super preview
client to make a web

422
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.870
service call to a service
that's running in Azure Microsoft's

423
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:35.760
cloud computing environment. And that
will return back to the

424
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.180
desktop, all of the available
endpoints, which are the active

425
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.390
browsers that we currently support.
So as they come online,

426
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.680
you'll see them in that
remote browser section of this

427
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.470
super preview application. That's really
interesting because that implies then

428
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.000
that super previews brains, that
the thing that I think

429
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.330
of as super preview the
desktop application, which is all

430
00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.570
kind of pretty and has
that nice black designer turtleneck

431
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.790
kind of a thing that
designed is really just a

432
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.920
shell and the smarts are
in, could be in the

433
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.910
cloud. That's right. That's right.
So, so we, we have

434
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:17.440
support for your local browsers,
but, but we've, we've built

435
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.320
in the infrastructure to basically
allow us to expand that

436
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.530
set as new browsers come
online, whether they be Microsoft

437
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.460
browsers or Mozilla browsers or
Apple browsers or Google browsers,

438
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.790
we can, we can add
to those that collection as,

439
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.240
and, and release updates to
that in a, in a

440
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.790
much more web style. As,
as, as these things come

441
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.920
available, we can, we can
ship them and make them

442
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.240
an increase, actually increase the
functionality of a desktop app

443
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.580
by, by continuing to support
more and more browsers. W

444
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.290
will you, do you support
multiple versions of Firefox? I

445
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.390
mean, how, how detailed can
you get? Because one of

446
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.490
the things that these online
services that send you a

447
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.430
screenshot will do is they'll
just give you just an

448
00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.850
obscene number of browsers. You
know, you want to see

449
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.860
what your site looks like
on links. We'll send you

450
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.410
a screenshot, you know, it's,
it's simplistic, but they make

451
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.930
up for it in volume.
Right. Do you think, are

452
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.910
you guys going towards the
volume play? Are you going

453
00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.550
to go for the top
90% of browsers or the

454
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.890
95%? Yeah. Our, our goal
has really been to, to

455
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.290
stay relevant and to basically
keep tabs on the market

456
00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.380
and provide access to the
most commonly used browsers. And

457
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.970
if you look at most
browser studies, the, in terms

458
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.180
of, in terms of desktop
browsers, they basically all, they

459
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.140
basically a collection of, let's
say five to eight of

460
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.160
them that represent, you know,
somewhere around 90% of the

461
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.880
market. And so our, our
goal was to really keep

462
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.240
up to, up to date
on the most broadly used

463
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.240
browsers and make sure that
we've got those covered and

464
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.970
make sure that we've got,
you know, advanced techniques like

465
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.940
the Dom highlighting to make
sure that within the browsers

466
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.630
that are most commonly used
around the world, that we've

467
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.260
got great support for those.
So one of the things

468
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.840
that super preview doesn't seem
to have is, is interactivity.

469
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.570
I can't navigate click around.
JavaScript's not firing in the

470
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.660
sense of like hovers and
things like that. Is that

471
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.660
something that people that, that
you think you'd add? Cause

472
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.700
I've noticed a couple of
things from some JavaScript and

473
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.700
some jQuery animations that I
expected to run didn't because

474
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.150
I'm looking at a screenshot.
Right, right. And that's, that's

475
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.090
definitely something that's on our
radar. We, we realized that

476
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.530
most pages today are not
just static pages and most

477
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:36.790
pages today either we'll have
animations that happen on load

478
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.640
or on some sort of
inner user interaction. And so

479
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.430
we're, we're now in the
phases of planning our next

480
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.140
release and thinking about where
we need to go to,

481
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.620
to really, you know, continue
to, to provide value and

482
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.530
to continue to help people
give them the experience they

483
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.050
need to debug the situations
that they most encounter. And,

484
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.660
and those are the obvious
next directions for us. So

485
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.480
we're, we're, we're, we're right
in the process of discussing

486
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.120
those things. And those are,
those are things that we're,

487
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.060
we're, we're taking a good
look at it and trying

488
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.850
to figure out the way
of best supporting them to,

489
00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.250
to make, to make the
application, to continue to make

490
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.550
the application helpful and usable.
Cause they're, they're, they're not,

491
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.250
they're not trivial things to
think about. So we want

492
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.100
to make sure that we
allow people to do those

493
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.440
sorts of debugging techniques and
in a, in a way

494
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.350
that is easy to use
and, and helps them to,

495
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.960
to debug quickly, like the
candidate was super preview on

496
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:34.370
stuff. Yeah. Well, once you
open the flood Gates and

497
00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.070
allow someone to do, you
know, a mouse over, then

498
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.390
they're going to want this
and they wouldn't want that.

499
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.610
I mean, I'm going to
want, are you going to

500
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.920
give me like a complete
Mac in the sky? And

501
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.290
it's going to be all
dynamic and stuff. It could

502
00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.660
potentially, if you did it
wrong, you could make people

503
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.280
more angry than you then
than happy. That's right. And

504
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.170
in addition to completely overload
our servers with, you know,

505
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.020
lots of, lots of stuff
that, you know, would, would

506
00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.540
cause things to come crashing
down. So yeah, you've got

507
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.330
to be, be careful to
sort of approach it smartly

508
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.160
and to, to really try
to figure out what are

509
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.220
the, what are the scenarios
that most people are, are,

510
00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.310
are in need of, and,
and really, you know, try

511
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.290
to try to hit those
big, those big ticket items.

512
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.850
It looks like we've got,
I'm just looking here. Microsoft

513
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:21.830
has internet Explorer, compatibility VMs,
which are basically free versions

514
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.400
of XP. And they basically
refresh it every six months.

515
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.910
So here, they've got versions
of six, seven, and eight

516
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.270
that you can download, but
they expire on October. Presumably

517
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.480
then you can come back
later and you know, every

518
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.570
90 days you go and
get a fresh VM. So

519
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.950
they're doing the work of
that for you. So for

520
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.010
some kind of interactions you
can use use virtual machines.

521
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.640
Sure. Yep. That's right. What,
what did you write super

522
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.730
preview in? It's extremely fast
and it looks a lot

523
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.640
like blend. It's got that.
Like I said, that turtleneck

524
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.610
kind of black thing that
we know about as blend

525
00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:03.380
UI, We, we, we definitely
wanted to fit in with

526
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.600
the look and the feel
of all the expression tools.

527
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.420
And so, so expression, super
preview was written using managed

528
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.680
code. C-sharp WPF to do
the UI, to do the

529
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.750
remote pieces. We use WCF
and we, we approach things

530
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.580
using a rest rest style
web services. When we actually

531
00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.340
have to talk to the
browsers, we do have to

532
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.560
do some native code. So
for example, that the API

533
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.630
is that the Firefox application
exposes are things that we

534
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.440
need to talk to using
C plus, plus the Safari

535
00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:42.580
talking to max Afari. We,
we to write that layer

536
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.670
using objective C and that
runs natively on the Mac,

537
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.750
but, but the bulk of
the, the UI and the,

538
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.650
and the application that you
interact with, that's, that's all

539
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:57.900
using a managed code. That's.
And even though I'm a

540
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.900
manager, I'm a managed code
guy. You'll forgive me. If

541
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:06.150
I'm a little surprised it's,
it's extremely fast and, you

542
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.900
know, manage code gets a
kind of a rap sometimes

543
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.750
for being slow. Particularly the
UI side, this is in

544
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.840
WPF. Cause it's really, all
the fonts are clear. There's

545
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.220
no blurriness, I'm doing resizing
and moving stuff around and

546
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.070
I'm clicking around really fast
and the toolbar and it

547
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.290
sucks. It's extremely quick. Did
you have to do anything

548
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.130
special to make that a
story? Nope. Just, just use

549
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.930
the good, good WPF standard
WPF set programming techniques and,

550
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.650
and that's it. In fact,
the direction for all the

551
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:42.600
expression products is that BPS
and C-sharp. So if you've

552
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.010
used blend before, or you've
used expression web before those

553
00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:51.060
are all using managed code
using C-sharp. So all of

554
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.820
it all, I mean, everything
we all the entire suppression

555
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:58.890
suite is in managed code.
The exception of there's there's

556
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.410
parts of the core of
web, which is, which is

557
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.020
actually a fairly old product
that dates back to the

558
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:10.200
front page days. But, but
encoder blend, super preview, and

559
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.200
then parts of web are
all written in C sharp.

560
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.360
Do you, do you end
Janet? Do you do a

561
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.480
native generation after installation to
make it faster or does

562
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.570
it, do you just let
it chit by itself? It's

563
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.190
just straight up, straight up
strips, you know, I know

564
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.950
I'm like, I'm like what
really? And you're like, yeah,

565
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.860
it's really not a big
deal. No, I mean, I

566
00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.930
mean, I'm being totally straight.
I mean, I've sometimes you'll

567
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.030
use an application and they'll
throw a splash screen up

568
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.710
or they'll do something. And
in the background you can

569
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.980
see engine struggling to keep
up, but that's really impressive

570
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.730
that this is in WPF.
Yeah. Yeah. We're, we're, we're

571
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.810
definitely eating our own dog
food within the expression product

572
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.020
development group. Oh, that's cool.
That's cool. You guys should

573
00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.030
spread the word about some
of the techniques. If there's,

574
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.720
if there's specific techniques you're
doing to make things faster

575
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.540
or different libraries for a
tech, do you know if

576
00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.300
there's something that's not completely
obvious? We should, we should

577
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.630
spread the word because it's
nice to see that you

578
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.480
can make a good looking
application that really looks like

579
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.530
any other app and it's
written in WPF. That's cool.

580
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.080
Yup. Yup. That's a, that's
a great idea. We should

581
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:21.260
definitely help spread the word
about C-sharp and WPS and

582
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.330
I can make great looking
performance, desktop apps for them.

583
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.850
Well, maybe we'll do a
followup show and we'll talk

584
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.820
specifically about WPF. Maybe we'll
get Pete Brown on and

585
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.060
talk about some of the
things that you've enjoyed and

586
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.390
not enjoy about the DPF
itself. That's a great idea.

587
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.470
All right. Well, fantastic. Thanks
so much for coming on

588
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.430
and talking about The expression
Supreme. Appreciate it. God, thanks

589
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.400
for your time. This has
been another episode of Hansel

590
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.350
minutes and we'll see you
again next week.
