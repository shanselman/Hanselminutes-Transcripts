From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
a weekly discussion with web

2
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.110
developer and technologist and Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.080
show number two 20 recorded
live Thursday, July 1st, 2010. Support for

4
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.320
Hansel minutes is provided by
teller at rad controls. The

5
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.980
most comprehensive suite of components
for windows forms and asp.net

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.950
web applications online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this
episode, Scott talks with Pete

7
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.420
Brown, Larry Larson, Jeff Kirkham, and
Chris Kirk about creating the

8
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.240
ultimate developer machine. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman and this

9
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.270
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And on this week,

10
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.180
we are trying to build
the greatest computer in the

11
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.240
history of mankind. In fact,
we want to build God's

12
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.430
own computer, the good Lord's
own computer with all due

13
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.330
respect, specifically a computer that
is going to be a

14
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.780
great developer machine. We have
a limited budget, a little

15
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.330
bit more than the average
computer. Our budget is $3,000,

16
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.980
but we want this machine
to hit 7.9 on the

17
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.310
windows experience index. So I've
got some experts from all

18
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.290
over Microsoft to help us
do this. Got Larry Larson hardware

19
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.510
experts from channel nine. How's
it going? Larry. Larry has

20
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.210
the flu. So if you
hear anyone hacking up along

21
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.010
in the background, that's Larry,
Larry, Larry from the PDC

22
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.670
laptop. He helped work on
that. We have got Pete

23
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.800
Brown hardware enthusiast who started
overclocking Commodore 64 when he

24
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.500
was six months old. Hey
Scott. And then we have

25
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.310
Jeff Kirkham who is here
from the Windset team. He's

26
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.330
a developer who actually works
on this, this index. He

27
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.370
actually knows about how to
measure these things. How are

28
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.910
you, Jeff? I'm doing fine.
Glad to be here, Scott.

29
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.580
So we've got a pretty
broad group of enthusiasts here.

30
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.430
We've got our, our, our
people from deep inside of

31
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.950
Microsoft are gonna help us
make this happen. Why don't

32
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.220
we start by finding out
what is the windows experience

33
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.350
index. Larry, can you, can
you explain kind of like,

34
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.520
what's the point of this
number that measures how fast

35
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:37.130
your overall system assessment to
figure out if your hardware

36
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.990
runs a series of tests
on your computer and then

37
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.050
out of the sub scores,
the lowest score will be

38
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.770
your score is only as
fast as its weakest link.

39
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.150
So running the soul Will
give you an overview of

40
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.730
how fast your system is.
It was introduced in Vista

41
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.110
and it went up to
5.9 and in windows seven,

42
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.150
they raised the score up
a little bit. So it

43
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.800
goes up to 7.9. Okay.
And, but this is an

44
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.250
arbitrary number. This is not
megahertz. It's not anything. It's

45
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.730
just like my number, my
machines is six, six, one.

46
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.050
It's just a six. Yeah.
And it's not really an

47
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.990
arbitrary number because you will
get a, you know, the

48
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.470
same score, basically every time
you run it and it

49
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.300
goes, it goes up a
little bit and it goes

50
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.340
down a little bit, depending
on the efficiency of your

51
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.850
drivers as well. Okay. So
I'm looking at my machine

52
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.850
here. I'm just going to
the start menu, right? Clicking

53
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.000
on computer and hitting properties.
Another way you can do

54
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.840
this, I think is you
can hit window break. And

55
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.470
it says here rating 5.9.
And I click on that

56
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.860
and my machine has a
7.1 processor, 7.1 memory, 6.7

57
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.460
graphics, and a 5.9 hard
drive. What does this tell

58
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.490
me about my computer, Larry?
Well, it tells you that

59
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.680
you're a weakest link. There
is your hard drive and

60
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.620
that's usually the case from
what I've seen on the

61
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.810
different machines. So you could
upgrade your, your hard drive

62
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.880
and bump your score up
a little bit. They'll bring

63
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.210
your entire system score up
a degree depending on what

64
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.880
kind of hard drives you
put in it. Hmm. And

65
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.170
how is, how do I
know if this is a

66
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.660
good number? I mean, is
this printed on software? Do

67
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.820
I go and buy a
copy of world of Warcraft?

68
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.350
And it says, if you
don't have a five, nine

69
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.960
year old loser or what,
what good is this number

70
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.430
other than telling my friends?
Well, there's a couple of

71
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.030
things that you can glean
from it. I mean, first

72
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.830
of all, you have to
have a three or higher

73
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.850
to have Aero glass. Of
course, it depends on what

74
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.160
you're doing with your machine.
If it's a business machines

75
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.110
and you know, a lot
of people will say three

76
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.620
is okay, probably the person
that's doing purchasing for your

77
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.090
hardware and your department. And
I would say probably a

78
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.520
five or a six is
a little bit better, a

79
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.100
five, if it's a laptop,
you know, six or a

80
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.560
seven, if it's a desktop.
But of course, all of

81
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.470
us wants the absolute highest
score that we can get.

82
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.870
One of the things that
we did in DPE is

83
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.710
we had a coding for
fun projects called we share,

84
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.150
and you can get to
it@wpishare.net. And this will allow

85
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.540
you to run your windows
experience index, and then submit

86
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.460
your scores up to the
cloud. And it goes up

87
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.890
to an Azure site. And
then we can use that

88
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.400
to try to see what
different scores various machines get.

89
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.110
So you can go up
there and get an idea

90
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.320
of some of the faster
machines and what kinds of

91
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.820
scores they get. I would
say if you're at a

92
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.610
six, a 6.5 or a
seven, you you've probably got

93
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.480
a pretty good machine at
least, you know, for entry

94
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.930
level gaming. So I suppose
that if I, if I

95
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.900
look at this and I
have like a four, and

96
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.850
then I look at my
numbers and it's like six,

97
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.460
six, seven, six, four, that's
a obvious example where I

98
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.160
should look at that one
low component and potentially update

99
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.880
it. That's a pretty weak,
weak link. Okay, interesting. So

100
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.990
then real quick, please. This
is Jeff, just to clarify

101
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.750
on how these scores are,
are done. You need to

102
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.900
think of the digits on
the left as a class

103
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.990
of the machine and the
digit on the right as

104
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.520
a linear number within that
class. So going from a

105
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.300
6.8 to say a 6.9
is not the same as

106
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.680
going from a 7.8 to
a 7.9. That, that line,

107
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.140
once you get to a
given class has a different

108
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.920
slope to that line. Interesting.
Is this kind of like

109
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.560
the, the Richter scale in
the sense that of a

110
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.620
six is 10 times faster
than a fine? No, it

111
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.290
isn't. I wish it was
simple to explain like that,

112
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.320
but it's not just important
to understand that we're dealing

113
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.370
with classes of numbers rather
than one long scale that

114
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.950
goes from zero to 7.9.
So, So that wouldn't be

115
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.630
that much better than a
six, nine. Yeah. You would

116
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.340
be stepped up right there.
Cool. Interesting. So that's very

117
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.800
interesting. So I've got these
seven process and I've got

118
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.050
a hard drive. That's just
working it's a little bit

119
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.100
off at 5.95. If I
updated that to some, a

120
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.200
better hard drive, then it
would take my machine to

121
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.540
a whole other class and
potentially make things a lot

122
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.050
easier. Yeah. I actually think
even in that case, you

123
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.390
would notice it and clearly
if you put an SSD

124
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.620
in there, you're going to
notice it. All right. So

125
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.870
Pete Brown, what is our
goal? What is our goal

126
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.840
in this machine? We've both
gotten permission from our respective

127
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:48.310
bosses specifically to build these
machines. I've allocated some of

128
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.600
the funds at this point,
And there was sufficient eye-rolling

129
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.870
as part of that, There's
a, there's a, another name

130
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.230
for that boss. It's a
common name. It's called she

131
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:05.760
who must be obeyed. Right.
It's pretty much So, so

132
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.300
there were a couple of
goals for what we're trying

133
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.040
to do here. You know,
the first is just to

134
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.950
build a really awesome machine,
right. And you can build

135
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.680
a really awesome machine. That's
a seven class, just like

136
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.680
we learned here and maybe
it's a seven, five, and

137
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.810
I'm using my machine and
it's worlds better than what

138
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.570
I'm doing now. So I'm
pretty happy with that. But

139
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.210
then there's this whole kind
of, you know, I want

140
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.880
to hit seven, nine just
because it's a number that

141
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.820
can be obtained. You know?
So when I was in

142
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.820
high school, I took my
mother's car down a very

143
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.150
steep Hill, along a long
ways just to, to max

144
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.220
out the speedometer, but it
wasn't because I was in

145
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.230
a hurry it's because there
was a number at the

146
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.760
end of that speedometer. And
I wanted to see if

147
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.520
I could hit it. So,
I mean, there's definitely some

148
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.110
just because aspect to this
and truthfully getting to a

149
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.340
seven, nine is going to
mean you're going to have

150
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.460
a really, really good machine.
Right. Plus Scott, you have

151
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.750
a 30 display and a
bunch of displays. Right, right.

152
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.450
Yeah. And I've got the
same things, 30 inch, I've

153
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.580
got a couple other monitors.
So we're also looking at

154
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.730
something that needs to be
pretty, you know, pretty heavy

155
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.430
on the graphics department to
push all those pixels. So

156
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.200
I know I've read some
of the comments on the

157
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.910
blog and stuff that said,
you know, why are we

158
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.880
building kind of the world's
best gaming machine here when

159
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.220
we're not, you know, huge
PC gamers, we have Xboxes.

160
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.110
And that's what we do
most of our gaming on,

161
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.350
but it's not just about,
you know, gaming graphics. It's

162
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.980
about pushing more pixels, being
more efficient in visual studio,

163
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.010
opening more applications at the
same time. So, you know,

164
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.270
more cores is better having,
you know, more instances of

165
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.750
visual studio open and compiling
doing things like a video

166
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.310
and coding, which is a
big task we do on

167
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.770
our team. A lot that
we use as many cores

168
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.920
and as possible and as
fast as possible. So there

169
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.750
are a whole bunch of
different things here that pile

170
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.350
into, you know, the use
of this in addition to

171
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.700
just the fact that we
want to hit a seven,

172
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.310
nine. Well, doesn't that mean
though, that you're optimizing for

173
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.380
a moment in time. That's
not very common. I mean,

174
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.320
there have been times on
my little five, nine machine

175
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.820
here, which by the way,
was the ultimate machine three

176
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.620
years ago when I built
it, when I built this

177
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.040
machine for Vista, this was
the greatest machine. And at

178
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.530
this point it's not, but
there have been times when

179
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.720
I've had two or three
versions of visual studio, open

180
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:20.180
outlook, you know, 20 browser
tabs. I've been literally capturing

181
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.480
video from a video camera,
squishing video. I mean, I've

182
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.560
had those moments. Am I
optimizing for that, that moment

183
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.020
where like twice a month,
I'm using the machine to

184
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.680
its, to its fullest. Maybe
there's a bit of that.

185
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.960
Right. So it depends on
how much that time is

186
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.630
worth to you. Right. You
know, if you're doing the

187
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.330
video and coding, and it's
a difference between sitting down

188
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.230
for an hour or sitting
down for 20 minutes, that

189
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.450
can be a big deal
on that particular day. Right.

190
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.370
And it also just, it
leads to a sense of

191
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.000
satisfaction if you're using your
computer and you look at

192
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.830
this process that you know,
is going to take everybody

193
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.600
else two hours and it
only takes 20 minutes for

194
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.460
you to run. It just
makes you feel good about

195
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.980
what's sitting in front of
you, you know, plus, you

196
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.530
know, we're, we're people that
have built our PCs for

197
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.470
pretty much every PC since
way back when, you know,

198
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.330
the last PC that I
actually bought was a two

199
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.670
86. And so there's something
to be said about a

200
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.730
machine well-built that kind of
maxes things out as much

201
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.790
as possible. Okay. So we
know the goal people may

202
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.770
or may not agree with
the goal, but there's some

203
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.710
interesting questions on Twitter here.
Like what percentage of the

204
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.080
cost are we estimating is
going to be used to

205
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.050
go from like seven, eight
to seven nine? Because it

206
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.680
seems to me from the
discussion on the blogs on

207
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.670
our, you and I, he
blogged about this, that it's

208
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.460
pretty easy to go and
just spend a lot of

209
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.830
money and get a seven
five, seven, six, seven, seven.

210
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.460
It really is requires very
little skill or effort. Are

211
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.080
we going to spend a
lot of effort trying to

212
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.560
get an extra point or
two and two to Jeff's

213
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:55.210
point we've already got, we've
already got Class seven machine.

214
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.260
Right. And I don't know
how, you know, some of

215
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.110
those things are the price
of the various components. Like

216
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.010
the, I was looking at
processor prices. And so like

217
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.410
the, you know, the top
of the line I seven,

218
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.310
six score is a thousand
dollars. And then the step

219
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.070
down from that as a
four core, and it's like

220
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.060
five or $600 somewhere around
there. And if you go

221
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.760
a couple of steps down
and still stay within the

222
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.120
three gigahertz range, you're still
looking at around 500, right?

223
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.120
So that's about a, you're
paying about two X to

224
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.150
get a super fast processor
with extra threads, if you're

225
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.790
interested in that. But I
think the biggest cost here,

226
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.560
and you guys correct me
if I'm wrong, but I

227
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.830
think it's gotta be the
drives, the SSDs we were

228
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.890
looking at, you know, what
it takes to be able

229
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.800
to get a seven, nine
on the SSD drives. And

230
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.800
it looks like it might
actually be a pretty intense

231
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.300
process, like having multiple SSDs
using like a raid zero

232
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.330
striping or something, which in
itself is kind of scary,

233
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.770
but it will get you
that performance unless you want

234
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.450
to go and spend, you
know, I was looking at

235
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.210
the new ag earlier today
and I saw the 10

236
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:08.490
grand OCC SSD that just
came out. It's a five,

237
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.430
12 gig does like 1400
megabytes per second or something

238
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.110
crazy like that. But that
might be out of budget.

239
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.870
All right, well, let's, let's
do this. Let's talk about

240
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.920
what is the subsystem in
inside of windows that is

241
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.840
doing this measurement and kind
of how that works. And

242
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.460
then we'll talk about parts
that we're going to build.

243
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.620
Okay. The, the program that,
that actually runs underneath the

244
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.520
UI is Windset exe. W
I N S a T

245
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.300
it's in a windows system,
32, you can run it

246
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.910
from the command line. If
you run it from the

247
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.700
command line and give us
just the word formal as

248
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.750
your parameter, that's exactly equivalent
to what the UI is

249
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.830
doing. So if somebody is
out there may be overclocking

250
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.900
with some of the newer
tools to let you over

251
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.250
clock. While you're in windows,
you could have a command

252
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.670
window open, you'd have to
be with administrator rights, front

253
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.330
Windset exe formal, and your
you'll be able to get

254
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.210
your scores right there on
the command window and see

255
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.310
what they are. So you
don't have to keep going

256
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.680
back to this UI to
run the system if you

257
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:16.050
want. Okay. Now I remember
runs when I've installed windows.

258
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.960
Like I install windows. I
went through the setup the

259
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.940
very, very first time, and
it runs right away, windows

260
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.460
care so bad that it
would run this immediately upon

261
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.220
boot that's really because the
DWM is dependent on that.

262
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.800
The windows manager to determine
whether you get arrow class

263
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.350
or not. They depend on
the numbers that we come

264
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.500
up with in our scoring
system. So that's why I

265
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.090
run then. And then every
week on Sunday night, it

266
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.690
pops up again and runs
to determine if you've changed

267
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.920
any of your critical hardware.
So if changed any of

268
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.670
that hardware, it can re
evaluate your scores and update

269
00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:02.410
your scores. Okay? And this,
this has used anywhere else.

270
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.500
Is it only used to
update that number and then

271
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.010
to help There's a couple
of other places, particularly now

272
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.290
that we've got the SSD
drives, we want to make

273
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.530
sure that if, if we
detect there's an SSD, there,

274
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.100
we shut down the disc
defrag. There's no point in

275
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.170
running that it's just going
to wear out the drive.

276
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.520
A super fetch is another
one where we basically just

277
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.980
disabled, super fetch. If we
find that the drive is

278
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.610
fast enough to handle the
requests during boot, that we

279
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.790
don't need a super fetch.
So we do have a

280
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.820
couple of features in windows
that are dependent on us.

281
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.740
Okay. So more and more
people are becoming dependent on

282
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.840
knowing about this score so
that they can make decisions

283
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.720
about whether or not they
want to run a certain

284
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.390
thing. Can, can I query
this? Can my application ask

285
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.060
questions of the, of the
windows experience index and make

286
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.690
decisions based on that? Sure.
There either is on MSDN,

287
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.960
there's full documentation for an
API that where you can

288
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.960
get the scores, you can
also do an X path

289
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.690
query into the XML that
we've stored all the data

290
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.130
in, and then there's actually
a WMI provider that you

291
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.070
could use. Also, that's pretty
fast. If you happen to

292
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.350
be good with PowerShell or
something, you can pop that

293
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.950
open and gets the scores
really fast that way. Oh,

294
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.140
I didn't realize that was
an XML that was really

295
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.560
easily accessible. I think that
Pete and I just got

296
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.020
an interesting little bit of
code. We can right there

297
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.130
then to check that out.
There's actually that XML has

298
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.890
got a lot of data
in their, a system configuration

299
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.620
data. It's kind of interesting
to look at. I would

300
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.810
hope people wouldn't mess around
with it when they're in

301
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.320
there, but it is interesting
to look at, Oh, people

302
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.000
will mess around with it.
Now that we know about

303
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.740
it. One thing to keep
in mind too, is we

304
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.930
share as open source. So
if you want something to

305
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.560
start with, you can certainly
try that. Cool. So all

306
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.330
the code that does, what
we need to do is

307
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.480
in the WEEI share.net code.
And is that a code

308
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:06.100
flex.com/w I share? Yes. Correct.
Okay, cool. Okay. So the

309
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.990
machine we're going to build,
let's start at the processor

310
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.450
guys. What's it going to
take to get a seven,

311
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.350
nine processor today? So from
looking at what was uploaded

312
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:17.440
to we share, it looks
like you need to be

313
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.950
overclocking at like four gigahertz
plus with at least a

314
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:27.250
quad core that's out about
right. I think that's the

315
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.040
stuff that we, that we
came up with. I think

316
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.140
a person might be able
to get by with a

317
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.830
lower speed if they had
more cores. Cause we do

318
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.200
take that into account and
measuring and the more cores

319
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.120
will help boost that The
score is not a requirement

320
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.350
for, for getting a 79
on processor. Christmas. If I

321
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.340
stepped in on this one.
Yeah. Chris. Okay. Hang On.

322
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.800
I just had someone show
up here who wasn't introduced

323
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.300
at the beginning of the
show. Who's on the phone

324
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.070
now. I'm also one of
the engineers on Winnie AI.

325
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.750
Awesome. Hi, Chris. Kirk, thanks
for joining the call. So

326
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.440
the thing about the CPU
score is that we combine

327
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.910
your single core performance as
well as your multi-core performance,

328
00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:15.350
since not all applications use
one or the other. So

329
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.380
having more course will definitely
help out, but there's a

330
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.830
certain limit. You must be
at least so fast on

331
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.730
a single, Okay. So I'm
hearing, when I look around

332
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.160
on the blogs that 77
78 is pretty easy to

333
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.800
get. Are we just at
a moment in time right

334
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.370
now where 79 is not
easily bought off the, off

335
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.830
the shelf? Or do I
just need to go out

336
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.350
and buy two quads and
a dual process, like two

337
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.140
products, two separate quads and
build an eight quad machine

338
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:48.320
to get you seven, nine
A little bit future-proof so

339
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.880
it's something that's reachable today,
if you overclock, but given

340
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.710
tomorrow's hardware will be a
lot easier. This is the

341
00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.350
part of the show where
I mock you while actually

342
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.700
Tellerik mock says your applications
that you're testing dependent on

343
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.880
external systems over which you
have no control. Maybe you're

344
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.240
being slowed down by those
systems or lack of availability.

345
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.300
Responsiveness. Do you want to
do TDD? Right? Our friends

346
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.580
at Telerx help you solve
some of those problems with

347
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.210
their newest mocking tool, just
mock to let you do

348
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.140
fast, simple controlled unit tests,
independent of external resources like

349
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:29.210
databases, web services, proprietary code,
unlike some mocking tools, just

350
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:34.250
mock works with non-virtual methods,
seal classes, static methods, giving

351
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.740
you a complete control of
your code. You can get

352
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:42.110
more details. You can download
just mock at telerik.com/just mock.

353
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.540
And don't forget to thank
Tellerik for supporting Hansel minutes

354
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:51.440
on their Facebook fan page,
facebook.com/tellerik. Thanks a lot. Would

355
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.810
you guys say as a
collective that for the ultimate

356
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.700
developer machine that we need
to go and get one

357
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.660
of the new six processor
machine, the hexachord or should

358
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.700
we just go with a
quad today, Trouble with overclocking

359
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.680
you can do it with
a quad core and use

360
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.100
the extra money to put
into the district. Okay. So

361
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.110
this is we've already jumping
ahead because we're assuming it

362
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.690
disagree. So that's very interesting.
My only thing is that

363
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.520
I think Pete and I
have both had the conversation

364
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.040
that if we bought a
quad, we might just be

365
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.920
sad because in a year
or two, you know, you're

366
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.820
going to be able to
pick up a hexachord machine,

367
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.200
a six processor, one for
like nine bucks at the

368
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.440
local gas station. So we're
just kind of wondering, like,

369
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.520
I already have a quad
Build six core just cause

370
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:40.760
I want one but Pride.
Okay. But aren't they aren't,

371
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.890
they harder to overclock The
nine 80 X is designed

372
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.060
to be overclocked so, ah,
okay. So nine 80 X.

373
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.740
So that's then that's the
one that keeps coming up.

374
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.970
This is an <inaudible>. We
had a couple people on

375
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.670
the blog say we should
do an AMD, but more

376
00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.650
and more people are saying
that this nine 80 X

377
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.520
just as meant for overclocking.
What I've usually heard is

378
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.570
they, AMD is, is good,
like price performance. But if

379
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.130
you want kind of top
of the line, the nine

380
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:12.390
80 X right now is,
you know, it's, it's 3.3

381
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.640
gigahertz, I think. And it's
using the, you know, the

382
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.080
32 nanometer process and it's
just optimized for overclocking and

383
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.810
folks are getting this thing
way up over four on

384
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.200
some, doing some stuff short
term on air cooling, but

385
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.470
mostly on liquid. And what's
the price on something like

386
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.380
that then? Yeah. So that's
a grand, that's sort of

387
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.320
the hard part about it.
Wow. So that's the thing,

388
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.000
it's a third of our
puts a third of our

389
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.790
budget and you know, people
that are saying, well, you

390
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.010
know, you could get us
basically the same one for

391
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.010
half the price and just
get a, you know, why

392
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.450
do you want to work
so hard to get that

393
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:51.720
last, that 0.9, you know,
500 we could hit maybe

394
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.160
seven, six 77, something like
that. It's close to the

395
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.250
600. And I think you
can, overclock it quite a

396
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.060
bit. And, or maybe not
have to overclock it as

397
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.250
much as some of the
previous generations, but overclock it

398
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.710
enough to be able to
get the seven nine, if

399
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.500
you want to. So like
for a pure seven, nine

400
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.480
stuff, I personally think you
can do it on a

401
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.350
cheaper processor, but I look
at five 69, which is

402
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.140
what I see the prices
versus nine 99. I'm thinking,

403
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.160
you know, what the price
for my happiness is $400

404
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.910
worth my happiness. Yeah. That's
a lot of lattes. You

405
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.680
could buy $400. You know,
the other thing is that,

406
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.370
you know, at this point
in remembering Vista, the WPI

407
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.340
score was max at five,
nine it's max at seven,

408
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.430
nine currently in windows seven.
I don't know when I

409
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.700
hit seven, nine, if there's
really, if I'm, if I'm

410
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.740
an eight or if I'm
in some theoretical number that

411
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.950
I can't see yet, but
if I buy a $600

412
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.040
processor and then push it
up to seven, nine, I

413
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.490
feel like maybe I'm like
wearing lifts in my shoes

414
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.310
and I'll always know I'm
not really that tall. So

415
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.040
then whenever the numbers do
go up in the future,

416
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.950
we'll, we'll find out that
really I've been walking on

417
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.890
my tiptoes all this time.
And Larry points out here

418
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.320
on the chat that there's
a core to quad. That's

419
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.460
getting a 7.9. That was
a $300 processor. So I

420
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.550
think that with overclocking, it
sounds like that we have

421
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.180
actual proof from the WVI
share website that you can

422
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.570
take a Quan Q 96
50 and take it up

423
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.840
to two seven, nine. It
really standing on your tip

424
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.370
toes, but you can do
it for 300 bucks. So

425
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.500
that's really going to be
a tough decision for pinata

426
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.050
to make I think. And
that one, when I looked

427
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.230
at the data that guys
or that person has that,

428
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.950
I think those are normally
like a three gigahertz processor.

429
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.130
It's got to go in
at 4.3. So I'm pretty

430
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.160
sure they're, they've got a
pretty high tech setup. The,

431
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.150
the, the four We need
to get to the four

432
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.730
gigahertz speed. It looks like
in order to even think

433
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:55.370
about seven point. Yeah. Yeah.
It's pretty compelling. Yeah. Okay.

434
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.360
Okay. So four gigahertz. We're
going to have to, I

435
00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.350
don't know if we're gonna
make it, maybe we'll be

436
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.970
able to make that decision
here, but I think I'm

437
00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.130
going to want to lean
towards spending a little bit

438
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.080
more money. I mean, it's
not every day that I

439
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.780
get permission to spend money
and I think I'm leaning

440
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.300
towards a little bit more
expensive processor, just a future

441
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.370
proof myself. And I really
liked the idea of a

442
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.850
six product, but it sounds
like the processor is definitely

443
00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.390
to be the challenge. Now
memory, usually when I put

444
00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.600
together machines, the memory is
always the same score as

445
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.300
the processor for me, I
know that it changes on

446
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.700
lower machines, but is it
really going to be very

447
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.580
hard for the memory to,
to get a high score

448
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.620
as well? Again, for the
memory, you will do that.

449
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.800
There is A connection between
the CPU score and the

450
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.990
memory score. They kind of
depend on each other a

451
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.800
little, A little bit, but
if you're going to build

452
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:50.560
a 64 bit machine and
you get enough memory On

453
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.530
there, then your memory score
will be independent, The CPU.

454
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.640
Okay. So do we think
that this is, I mean,

455
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.340
I've got eight right now
and it's, it's fine. Unless

456
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.890
I'm running a couple of
VMs and outlook and you

457
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.990
know, how does do I
want to go 12? Or

458
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.390
do we want to go
16? Here is 16 little

459
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:12.070
crazy thoughts, all that. Go
ahead, Chris, do you know,

460
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.450
It really comes down to
what sort of applications you're

461
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.240
planning Since this was going
to be a developer machine.

462
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.230
You're going to be building
a lot of code for

463
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.910
not a whole lot more
money. You can switch to

464
00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.270
16. So why not? Okay.
Is that enough memory? Do

465
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:32.050
you think that that what
is enough memory now And

466
00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:39.310
stuff? I do 12 gigs,
But tomorrow who knows? Please?

467
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.790
Sure. So if we're looking
at triple channel memory, then

468
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.580
you're looking at getting three
sticks at a time, like

469
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.580
to, you know, in match
sentence. Right? So that means

470
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:53.260
you're probably looking at either
12 or 24. Wow. Can

471
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:59.850
we fit 24 in our
budget? Wow. I haven't priced

472
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.830
my memory every time I
price memory out, it's like

473
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.410
a hundred percent different. Well,
see, this is the thing

474
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.420
about memory is that, you
know, they're like, like Larry

475
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.000
says that there's, there's seven
nines that have six gigs

476
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.640
of memory, but I mean,
no one here would propose

477
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.340
that six gigs would be
enough for the ultimate machine.

478
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.810
I mean, I definitely, I
mean, I, I have so

479
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.390
many tabs open in my
browser. I've got outlook, I've

480
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.690
got tweet deck. I've got
Metro Twitter. I've got all

481
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.760
this different crap running 12,
I think is my minimum.

482
00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.570
If I could get 24,
that'd be awesome. But I

483
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.450
just want to see the
pricing on that. We'll triple

484
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:39.070
check That has six, six
slots you're looking at, you

485
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.720
know, you can get 12
now if you get like

486
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.650
three by four, and then
if you want the other

487
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.810
24, you can slip it
in under another project. Right.

488
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.070
Or the other 12. Okay.
And what am I going

489
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.420
to do with the motherboard
level to make sure I

490
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.480
could do 24? You need
to make sure the board

491
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.300
has enough enough slots that
you're 24. And I think

492
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.760
the most of them will
these days at least do

493
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:04.400
it, but it's worth double
checking. Okay. All right. I

494
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.010
personally think I'm going to
start with 12. You're gonna

495
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.990
start with 12. You're not
going to even think about

496
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.730
more than that. And there's
no way to get to

497
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:14.330
like 16 or something like
that. There is, but you

498
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.390
start losing some of the
advantages of, of triple channel.

499
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.180
And don't ask me what
those advantages are. I just

500
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.960
know that match sets with,
you know, the, the three,

501
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.080
the three sticks is a
good thing for performance, but

502
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.740
I haven't done any actual
measurement. Okay. Is it feels

503
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.360
like back in the day
and we were doing two

504
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.310
86 and three 86 is,
and you had to have

505
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.470
memory in a certain order
and had to have a

506
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.440
certain amount number of sticks.
And we went back to

507
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.440
that again. Well kind of,
you know, they're selling these

508
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.710
things as, as match sets
where they're all time the

509
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.960
same, and they're all the
same quality to kind of

510
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.480
make sure that you don't
get, you know, one stick

511
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.220
that's a lower quality than
all the other ones. And

512
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.550
have it bring down the
rest of your system. Tricky,

513
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.540
tricky. Okay. Now, interestingly with
the WPI, with the windows

514
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.150
experience index, you've got processor
and memory, those are separate

515
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:07.100
scores and then there's hard
drive, but then graphics and

516
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:12.020
gaming graphics are separate things.
So desktop performance and 3d

517
00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.630
performance are two different things.
It was apparent, which always

518
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.150
implied to me that some
video cards are really greater

519
00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.270
at moving transparent windows around
and somebody who cards or

520
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:24.350
creative pushing polygons around. But
in my experience, it's always

521
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.140
been the same score for
my video cards. Are those,

522
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.850
are those really so important
that they need to be

523
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.530
separate? So Jeff or Chris?
I think that, that I

524
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.970
would kind of say that
they probably aren't that important

525
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.960
to be separate things, but
again, we wanted, we needed

526
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.400
a test for the desktop
windows manager and we did

527
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.650
want to get a good
3d test in there too.

528
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.900
So I think that's how
it kind of evolved into

529
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.160
two separate scores, one, particularly
for gamers and then one

530
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.720
just a general desktop video
Score. Yeah. So I have

531
00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.710
a question on this because
the awesome machine that Scott

532
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.380
had sent to me when
I first joined does a

533
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.550
five, five on gaming graphics,
but a four on arrow.

534
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.940
So I'm trying to figure
out what kind of, what

535
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.980
kind of scenarios are there
and, you know, what are

536
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.980
we looking at where the
business machine here is better

537
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.910
at gaming graphics than it
is at arrow? Now there's

538
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:23.060
an interesting question. Cause I
find that that more monitors

539
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.430
that I have, I feel
like my machine is slower.

540
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.800
I've got four monitors and
one of them's a 30

541
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.000
and I'm running it Nvidia
two 75. And when I

542
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.820
added that 30 inch monitor,
things just felt slow. But

543
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.970
my graphic scores is six
seven, which is pretty, pretty

544
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.880
respectable. I would think at
least for pushing two-dimensional windows

545
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:46.720
around any thoughts on that
guys? Well, of course it

546
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.540
could always be a driver
issue, but certainly the more

547
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.820
real estate you have, the
more windows that you have

548
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.600
open, the more that the,
the graphics on the system

549
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.120
is going to get stressed
are moving arrow windows around.

550
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.040
I mean, it really, any
video card will do one

551
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.110
thing these days. I mean,
when I think about video

552
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.420
card performance, I don't, this
is a developer machine. I

553
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.220
don't want to optimize for
three D graphics. I want

554
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.190
to optimize for a minimizing
time. You know, I want

555
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.030
to optimize for, for not
ever having visual tearing, has

556
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.760
I drag a window or
resize a big window? So

557
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.020
I want to point out
that I want to optimize

558
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:29.170
for today, not 3d from,
for myself. I have to

559
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.280
agree with Jeff on this
one, that with the modern

560
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.250
operating system, there's more and
more three D graphics, even

561
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:42.400
just in opening up internet
Explorer, wandering around, moving between

562
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:47.170
things like the start menu
tab option. And you need

563
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.740
a little bit of both.
This is tricky. So should

564
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.800
we only use one monitor
when I am running the

565
00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:58.030
Windset test? It shouldn't matter.
No, I don't think that's

566
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.610
gonna matter. Okay. Well, that's
good to know. I always

567
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.800
wondered if I should just
switch to 1,024 and run

568
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.220
the test to get myself
a better score. The, the

569
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.820
graphics is rendered off screen.
So the actual resolution on

570
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.880
your monitor shouldn't have any
impact at all. This is

571
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.550
a good, good insight then.
So people are saying that

572
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:20.500
the Nvidia video cards in
video four 80, I think

573
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.590
is the model number is
a really good one. And

574
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:28.690
if you look at WPI,
share X 11 support, and

575
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:33.730
they've got a 7.9, it's
the GTX four 80, except

576
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.030
apparently it runs really hot.
We're already talking about water,

577
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.860
cooling the process. Are we
going to have to water

578
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.580
cool the video card? That
sounds like more hassle than

579
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.490
it's worth. There's a good
chance. You're going to want

580
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.270
a water. Cool. The video
card. We can't say for

581
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.840
sure, whether you need to
over clock depending on which

582
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.390
video card you get. I
don't think you're going to

583
00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:00.070
need to do much a
7.8 7.7. Graphics card is

584
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.640
pretty easy to hit 7.9
might be a little tricky.

585
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.630
It's really about kind of
heat and noise at this

586
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:10.050
point, I would assume. Right?
So Scott, I'm guessing you're

587
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:13.800
going to need two cards
for all the monitors. So

588
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.130
that's a fair bit of
heat inside that case. Right?

589
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.950
And I was reading a
little bit about how to,

590
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.100
how to a water cool,
those, and even recommended that

591
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.320
you put them on a
separate loop from the process,

592
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.560
or if you're doing serious
overclocking so you're talking about

593
00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.310
two water cooling units. Remember
it, remember to the point

594
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.630
of the people on the
blogs. We want to build

595
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.550
the ultimate developer machine. I
want to make sure that

596
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.010
we don't accidentally start hooking
up blue tubes, a crazy

597
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.300
liquid flowing around without remembering
that the goal here is

598
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.730
to compile code, not to
play Counterstrike. So there's some

599
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.250
other video cards that it
looks like on the, we

600
00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.190
share stuff are not that
four 80, but they're a

601
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.790
little bit lower and they're
still doing pretty well. Right?

602
00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.010
So I think there were
like a 200 something series.

603
00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.500
And so those might be
a better choice. Okay. Well,

604
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.670
so when, when we're talking
about the developer machine, the

605
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.250
compiler is still single threaded.
At least the one that

606
00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:11.980
we're using. So clock speeds
important multithreading and like having

607
00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.140
like a hexachord machine is
important. Cause we're going to

608
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.540
have, we're going to have
outlook and Twitter and compiling

609
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.600
all open at the same
time. Memory's important because we

610
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.540
might have virtual machines. We're
going to have piles of

611
00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.220
things, but we don't want
any memory pressure at all.

612
00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.660
So 12, 16, 24, somewhere
in there because we're looking

613
00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.180
at <inaudible> coming and that's
going to have 3d inside

614
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.530
it. We ain't going to
want to have our three

615
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.540
D graphics a little higher
than maybe it sounds like

616
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.470
I expected, but compiling hits
the heart, hits the hard

617
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:43.420
drive. That's the thing Scott
goo Scott Guthrie has consistently said

618
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.120
that if you want to
make visual studio faster or

619
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.220
the perception of speed, at
least get a fast, hard

620
00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.370
drive. Everyone knows that we
need an SSD. Right? We

621
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.590
all agree that SSD is
the way to go. Right?

622
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:58.900
What, what SSDs can we
afford given that we may

623
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.800
be spending a thousand dollars
on a processor? Well, I

624
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.990
mean the SSD you're gonna,
you're gonna pay for it.

625
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.210
Particularly if you try to
do the raid set up,

626
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:11.110
do we have anybody on
the site so far who's

627
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.750
been able to hit 7.9
without going to the raid

628
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.080
array. It's hard to say
because the numbers there don't

629
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.780
really tell you if it's
raid. But if you look

630
00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.610
at the size of the
drives, you can kind of

631
00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.550
infer that there might be
one or two or more

632
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:29.560
SSDs involved. Right? So I'm
concerned about the rate of

633
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.260
rape because I understand that
doesn't support trim, and that,

634
00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.050
that bothers me. So what
is trim and why do

635
00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.950
I care? So trim is
really a way to clear

636
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.530
blocks of memory on that
SSD so that it can

637
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.530
be used. You're going to
end up really slowing down

638
00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.910
your performance. If you don't
have trim support, that drives

639
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:51.820
going to degrade in time.
Okay. So I haven't seen

640
00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.630
an SSD yet. That's within
our budget. That'll do the

641
00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.320
seven nine. So is this
something that it would be

642
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.660
dumb to actually get the
seven, nine and we'll, you

643
00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.460
know, we'd be better off
by just going with like

644
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.850
a seven, seven or something.
Yeah. I mean the, the

645
00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:10.120
is that Intel, M 25
is a beautiful machine, a

646
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.940
little beautiful little box and
it does great. And it's,

647
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.780
you can probably get 7.7,
something like that out of

648
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.870
it. Yeah. I do have
to admit, I'm pretty nervous

649
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:24.850
about, you know, striping to
a SSDs, you know, even

650
00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.280
with the trim stuff aside,
it just seems like I'm

651
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.530
really asking for my whole
machine to not boot the

652
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:33.640
next day. And that is
the thing about SSTs though.

653
00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.760
Isn't it? That when they
die, they don't die in

654
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.440
a way they just simply
don't work anymore. Right. It's

655
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.990
not like, Oh, a sector's
bad. I'll not worry about

656
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.900
that sector. That's a feature
I wasn't aware of. Thanks

657
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.010
for scaring me. Well, I
mean, it's memory, right? It's

658
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.780
just this big old Papa.
A and I know there's

659
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.510
errors all the time on
hard drives there's errors all

660
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.510
the time on SSTs. But
as I'm understanding, you know,

661
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.340
with a hard drive, at
least when the thing is

662
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.340
spinning the rust around, if
you hear a couple of

663
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.970
clicks, it's like, okay, it's
time. It's time to think

664
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.980
about maybe getting another hard
drive in the next 24

665
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.260
hours, but with an SSD,
it's just sorry, it doesn't

666
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.190
work anymore. So we assume
that as good developers and

667
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.880
good people, we all have
backup plans. But if you

668
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.690
put a striped array together,
you really are saying that,

669
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.940
you know, let's just double
the chances of something going

670
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.340
wrong and let's tie the
two drive success to each

671
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.350
other. Right. So I trust
Intel, but I know that

672
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.410
people are getting 7.9 on
a crucial, but I don't,

673
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.240
I mean, crucial makes good
memory, but I don't know

674
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.430
them from an SSD perspective.
I think I'd feel more

675
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:42.900
comfortable going with an Intel
drive with trim support. And

676
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.540
I just don't know. I
trust Intel, is that, is

677
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.760
that a logical? I mean,
that's how I chose mine.

678
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.410
I knew that was just
a nice, a nice box

679
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.140
and got good reviews. And
I decided that was the

680
00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.970
one I wanted and I
didn't want to trust anybody

681
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:04.190
else, But I think, you
know, of all the things

682
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.950
that we're looking at here,
SSD seemed to be the

683
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:10.520
technology that's moving the fastest
in terms of performance and,

684
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.920
and kind of new approaches
and everything. And so it

685
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.100
seems to be the, the
least sane place to dump

686
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.920
a boatload of cash. Yeah.
That's a good point. I

687
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.630
mean, we know that they're
good. We know what's ones

688
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.650
are good, a non tech
and Tom's hardware. The data

689
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:28.460
around SSDs is, is pretty
much well understood. And we

690
00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.770
could, that is a part
we could potentially update in

691
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.590
a year or two, assuming
that it'll get even faster.

692
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.980
It sounds like though, that
there really isn't an off

693
00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.200
the shelf, single SSD, that's
going to guarantee us a

694
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.880
seven, nine, and I don't
really feel comfortable striping SSDs.

695
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.820
Although if I Stripe my
SSTs, will that literally get

696
00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.910
me like, not a seven,
nine, but like a 15.8.

697
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.850
Is that, is it going
to be that much faster?

698
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.660
No, I don't think so.
It's not twice as fast.

699
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.690
Don't forget Scott, if you
have the coin, it's only

700
00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.900
10 grand for 1400 megs
per second. I know that

701
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.260
you want the OCC, the
$10,000 SSD, but I guess

702
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.420
my question is with the
raid, I'm going to have

703
00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.060
to start thinking about, am
I using on, on board

704
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.810
rate? Am I buying a
rate card? And at this

705
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.910
point I'm effectively just talking
to a Ram disk. I,

706
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.540
I assume with a, with
a two I've had like

707
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.290
two Intel's in a, in
a Stripe. Yeah. If you

708
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.770
use well, onboard rate is,
is a whole separate discussion

709
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:31.370
from, I think from the,
the dedicated raid cards, but

710
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:34.400
a good raid card with
onboard processing and onboard cash

711
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.300
will also you back. Like,
I think there are anywhere

712
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.690
between five and a thousand
and you know, the onboard

713
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.000
stuff is, you know, good
enough for most folks, but

714
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.720
it uses system resources. It
uses system memory. It's kind

715
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.400
of like a, remember when
printers came out and the

716
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.180
printers used to actually have
smart before then. Well, these

717
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.470
are sort of the same
thing. Okay. All right. So

718
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:56.880
it sounds like if I'm
going to get an a

719
00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.140
7.9, we're going to need
a, a quad or six

720
00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:05.820
core processor. That's overclocked into
four gigahertz range. I think

721
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:11.340
it'll probably be that, that
I seven that we talked

722
00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.160
about before, we might have
to overclock that a little

723
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.920
bit and do a little
water cooling, but certainly not

724
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.020
required. I mean, I could
just probably get a seven,

725
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.870
seven or seven, six, just
fine running that without water

726
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:27.240
cooling, we'll probably get an
SSD, the Intel X 25,

727
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.220
maybe the extreme edition, if
we can afford it, right.

728
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.230
Run that as our primary
drive and then get a,

729
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.680
a couple of data drives
that we can make some

730
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.080
spinning rust. Maybe we could
do that in a raid

731
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.850
for our, for our data
drives some new Nvidia video

732
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.270
card, probably the four 80.
And since they do run

733
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.640
a little bit hot, I
know that there's a whole

734
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.540
religious argument between ATI and
Nvidia, but ATI lost me

735
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:54.000
six years ago with bad
drivers. And I just haven't

736
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.790
come back yet. I'd be
interested in from the listeners

737
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.360
what they think about the
video card, but if we

738
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.760
can get that into the
water cooling loop, Same thing

739
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.860
here, it was the bad
drivers about six years ago.

740
00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.660
Yeah. It was just too
many blue screens. It was

741
00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.450
like 99% of my blue
screens were, were video driver

742
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.670
based. And I've never had
a blue screen on an

743
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:16.230
Nvidia in the windows seven
timeframe. And then I think

744
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:19.050
at least 12 gigs of
Ram, the one thing that

745
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.670
I always feel like I
don't have enough of is,

746
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.830
is Ram. And then actually
one of the things about

747
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:26.130
the SSD, we've got to
have a 256 gigs C

748
00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:28.410
drive. I mean, getting, trying
to get everything I need

749
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:31.320
running in 128 gigs is,
is going to be just

750
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.830
too, too difficult. So let's,
let's price that up heat.

751
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.930
And we'll put that on
the show notes and might

752
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.480
another blog post with our,
our final list of what

753
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.890
we're gonna, what we're going
to buy. And we'll get

754
00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:45.570
more criticism from the, from
the group. One last question

755
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:46.710
I want to leave you
guys with, so you can,

756
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.840
maybe each of you can
answer it separately is that

757
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.110
we're developers. We're not, we're
not a non from a

758
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.320
non tech or Tom from
Tom's hardware. One of the

759
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.440
greatest comments that I got
on the blog post was

760
00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.140
that this seems like a
bunch of sequel guys trying

761
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.060
to build a user interface.
You know, it's like, they're

762
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.560
probably going to get it
done, but it's hard to

763
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:09.240
really watch them do it.
Did we make a mistake

764
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.640
by not just talking to
someone who can speak to

765
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.930
this at the, at the
really, really detailed level? Or

766
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.690
is it okay for a
developer, maybe a listener who's

767
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:20.760
who's not a big hardware
guy to put together a

768
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.690
machine like this without expertise,
deep, deep expertise in hardware.

769
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.200
This is Jeff. Can I
answer that first, please? Jeff,

770
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.340
I'm not an expertise in
hardware, but I absolutely love

771
00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:38.690
to put together own machines.
And if I just went

772
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.860
out and asked somebody, tell
me what to build. There's

773
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.350
no, there's no interest, no
excitement, nothing. I might as

774
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:46.730
well just ask him to
build it and give them

775
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:52.040
a couple hundred dollars extra.
I really enjoy doing it.

776
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.890
I've got to say pretty
much the same thing you

777
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.590
learn by doing. And you
can do some research. You

778
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.020
can figure out how it's
put together. It's a fun

779
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.200
and interesting experience. And the
computer will just mean more

780
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.670
to you because you built
it with your own two

781
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:15.220
hands. Definitely. You know, I've
built every machine that I've

782
00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.380
had since a two 86
and it's, I get a

783
00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.990
lot of enjoyment out of
actually building them. So I

784
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.050
think it's at least as
enjoyable to learn something new,

785
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.000
which is why I want
to do water cooling this

786
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.190
time. I've never done that
before as it is to,

787
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.370
you know, just go in
and buy something and have

788
00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:32.800
it run really well. So
I'm really interested in building

789
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:39.100
this myself. Okay. Larry Larson. Yeah.
I I've always built my

790
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.880
own machine. I've never had
a desktop. I've never had

791
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.560
a store bought a machine.
So I, I look at

792
00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.690
it like, you know, like
a Jedi not building his

793
00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:53.290
own lightsaber. It's something that
if you're you have to

794
00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:58.480
do it. So it's always,
You have to build your

795
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.630
own lightsaber. There you go.
My friends, that's the, that's

796
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.240
the quote of the show
right there is that you

797
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.130
may not be a good
Jetta. You may be one

798
00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:14.200
of the slightly less competent
lightsaber. My friends. Thanks so

799
00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.760
much for coming on the
show and talking about the

800
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.120
ultimate development. We may not
know what we're doing here

801
00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.950
on the Hansel minutes, but
we're having fun doing it.

802
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.700
I really appreciate everyone's time.
It's been my pleasure. Thanks.

803
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.770
Alright. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

804
00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:30.940
see you again next week.
