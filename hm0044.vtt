00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.580
this episode, Scott and Carl
discuss pro audio basics. Hi,

11
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.030
this is Carl Franklin. You're listening
to Hansel minutes. I'm here

12
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.760
with Scott Hanselman again. Hi
Scott. How are you, sir?

13
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.020
And you're in Africa right
now, Tanzania. You're not really,

14
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.180
we're recording this at a
time, but by the time

15
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.730
the listeners listening, you'll be
in Africa. I will. So

16
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.060
for all intents and purposes,
future Scott is in Tanzania.

17
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.150
All right. Well, this is
an interesting show that you

18
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.750
propose to me that we
do one on audio basics.

19
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.720
Yeah, I mean, I know
the basics of audio, so

20
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.260
maybe this would be audio
intermediate because when we first

21
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.490
started talking about doing the
show, you had made a

22
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.780
couple suggestions about me getting
certain bits of equipment. And

23
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.360
I was like, Oh, well,
Hey, I've got this, this

24
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.960
$20 USB microphone from logic
tech. I'll just use that.

25
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.740
Right. And then you said,
Oh, Scott, you patted me

26
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.250
on my head condescendingly. There's
so little that you know

27
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.210
about sound. And I said,
well, shoot, we've done 43

28
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.690
44 shows now. And I
still don't quite understand how

29
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.180
you do it. So let's
talk about audio. Well, first

30
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.400
of all, let me just
say that audio is like

31
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.370
a movie, you know, and
it's like video it's everywhere

32
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.050
and it sounds good. And
therefore people think easy. I

33
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.630
thought, I mean, I thought
so when you go to,

34
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.940
when you just listen to
the radio, it all sounds

35
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.410
good. Every little thing they
do sounds good. And so,

36
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.660
you know, you, you kind
of, since it's so pervasive,

37
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.960
you kind of get the
misleading feeling that, that it's

38
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.650
easy to do. And it's
a natural thing for people

39
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.990
just write off, Oh, well
you get a microphone. Oh,

40
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.360
you get some stuff, you
put it together. It's easy.

41
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.790
And you know, I think
you were one of the

42
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.270
first critics of the quality
of podcasts out there. Yeah.

43
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.370
Initially I heard a lot
of podcasts and it sounded

44
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.370
like someone when somebody was
sitting in the front seat

45
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.030
of their car at a
movie theater with a Sony

46
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.150
portable microphone recording on a
micro tape or micro cassette,

47
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.400
I just sounded like someone
was phoning it in. And

48
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.660
literally some of the are
phoned In, right. I think

49
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.870
that the dotnet rocks were,
you know, really sounded great.

50
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.150
I think more and more
people are learning how to

51
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.090
make stuff sound better. And
I think it's starting to

52
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.850
show, but yeah, it's difficult
to do a podcast out

53
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.620
of your garage. It absolutely
is. So, you know, what

54
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.960
I'm going to hopefully do
here is just a, you

55
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.690
know, dispel a few myths
and, you know, tell you

56
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.100
a few things that you
need to know. And we're

57
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.060
going to start Scott with
line level versus Mike level

58
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.620
signals. There are two actually
voltages that, that are used

59
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.260
when you're plugging in something
to a computer or to

60
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.740
a mixer or to any
kind of audio device. And

61
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.510
you really need to know
the difference between two, have

62
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.700
you ever had this happen?
You plug something into your

63
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.990
computer and record on it
and your recording sounds completely

64
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.770
hosing distortion. Yeah. Way, way,
way louder than it is

65
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.020
supposed to Way louder than
it's supposed to. And that's

66
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.900
because what you've done is
you've taken a line level

67
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.980
output, which is hot, hot,
hot, hot, and you've plugged

68
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.550
it into a mic input,
which is low, low, low,

69
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.400
low, low, and expecting very
low signal. Does it have

70
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.700
anything to do with when
I plug my iPod into,

71
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.090
into my, into my tape
deck adapter, I have to

72
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.120
adjust the volume on my
iPod, Right? Because your tape

73
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.360
deck adapter expects a microphone,
which is putting out very

74
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.040
low signal. And so the
hack is you have figured

75
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.490
out is to turn the
record volume way down. But

76
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.730
when you do that, you're
not utilizing the amplifier, the

77
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.900
recording amplifier to its full
potential. Ah, so, and that

78
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.180
brings me to another thing,
which is the difference between

79
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.690
an amplifier and a resistor.
Whenever you had any kind

80
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.600
of fader, you know, like
a fader, a button, a

81
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.750
dial and knob, a turn
up a turn down. It

82
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.140
can either be a resistor,
which means that at full

83
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.970
volume, there's, it's the completely
normal, natural, full signal, sweet

84
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.050
and light and crude and
all that. No problem. When

85
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.310
you pull it down, it's
actually resisting. It's actually reducing

86
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.200
the input. Whereas an amplifier,
you start in the middle

87
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.920
somewhere and you pull it,
pull it up to amplify

88
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.530
the signal. So those are
two different things that you

89
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.550
can think of as ways
to control audio. Okay. There's

90
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.660
a really good explanation of
line level versus Mike level

91
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.910
at shrinks.com/katie. I, and there's
a layman's explanation. You know

92
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.330
what plugs go where, and
then there's also a more

93
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.840
detailed explanation for geeks like
us. Hmm, cool. Basically microphones

94
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.030
that are dynamic microphones. Well,
all microphones that are good

95
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.040
are low impedance. There might
level impedance impedance, as it

96
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.710
sounds is a resistance it's
impedance of the signal. And

97
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.990
so it's kind of backwards.
Low impedance is a lower

98
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.210
signal and high impedance is
a hotter signal. Okay. So

99
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.980
I want it, you said
I want a low impedance

100
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.130
Mark. Well, yeah. Microphones that
you plug in with XLR

101
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.990
connectors are low impedance. They're
balanced audio, and there's a

102
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.730
really discussion, a really good
discussion of balanced versus unbalanced

103
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.170
audio@shrinks.com. K D H a
N. So let me ask

104
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.260
you this. If I take
a regular microphone, like back

105
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.850
in the day, we used
to do radio. When we

106
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.070
all did radio shows as
a kid, right? You take

107
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.200
a tape player, you will
get a written, you'll get

108
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.070
this classic little black plastic
radio shack microphone. When I

109
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.840
plugged that one eighth inch
plug into the little tape

110
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.780
deck, what kind of microphone
is that? And what kind

111
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.750
of signal is happening over
that? That's a high impedance.

112
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.110
Yeah. I'd say high end
Putin's microphone is that high

113
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:56.650
impedance because it's an inexpensive
Balanced basically. And unbalanced, unbalanced

114
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.320
connectors are used primarily for
instruments and for short cables.

115
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.470
And because the wires are
typically not well, they, they

116
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.460
are shielded, you know, like
shielded cable, but they, since

117
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.980
they're, they're just two wires,
there's a positive and a

118
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.450
negative, right. A balanced line
has a positive, a negative

119
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.530
and another wire. And basically
it does a differential between

120
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.990
the, it sends the signal
down on two wires plus

121
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.570
the ground and does a
differential between them. So it

122
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.170
balances it out. It's like
a nice, complete circuit. And

123
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.390
if you're going to have
a long cable and long

124
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.380
instrument, cable, long quarter inch
cable, whatever it is, especially

125
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.250
at line level signals, you
need to have a balanced,

126
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.700
a balanced systems. And not
only does it mean and

127
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.610
balance cables, you can think
of as stereo cables, like

128
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.060
a stereo quarter inch has
the two bands around it

129
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.960
and an XLR cables, also
three prongs and it's balanced.

130
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.840
So, okay. Well that I'm
talking on has, has two,

131
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.020
two wires inside, but it's
not recording me in stereo

132
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:07.720
it's tip ring, that's it?
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mano and

133
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.520
also unbalanced. So a lot
of armchair audio enthusiasts who

134
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.090
like to do use mixers
and stuff are probably using

135
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.440
unbalanced connections for everything, just
because you have short cables,

136
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.270
there doesn't seem to be
a problem, but one of

137
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:27.910
the manifestations of unbalanced systems
is hum. So if you

138
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.500
have a lot of, you
know, patch, cables and connections

139
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.020
going to a lot of
different places and you have

140
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.360
a lot of electrical system,
you know, a lot of

141
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.750
electrical devices that are all
plugging into the same circuits,

142
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.150
you can have ground loops
and you can have hum

143
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.780
that goes through those connectors.
So I found when I

144
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.390
was hooking up my home
stereo, a and this may

145
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.250
seem obvious to you and
our listeners, but it was

146
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.130
not obvious to me immediately
that when I ran my

147
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.320
very speaker wire over the
power adapter, the power brick,

148
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.040
it sounded really bad. Yeah,
exactly. Cycle hum. Okay. Yep.

149
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.970
So they have hum eliminators,
but it's best to just

150
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.530
use BA to use balanced
cables and balanced inputs. And

151
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.250
it typically means if you
have a balanced input or

152
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.920
output on a mixer or
something like that, you're going

153
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.350
to be sending data at
a hotter level plus four,

154
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.250
it's called. Okay. So if
I know if I talk

155
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.930
to me about equipment, I
mean, when I go to

156
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.300
the audio store, I assume
I would go to the,

157
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.780
the music store to buy
this stuff. Well, actually, So

158
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.750
you'd go online there, you
can go to a music

159
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.440
store, but typically they stock
things that are more for

160
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.710
musicians, that kind of stuff.
And if not, a lot

161
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.410
of music stores have studio
gear, of course, you know,

162
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.920
the big ones like Sam
Ash and Sweetwater sound and

163
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.920
even Crusoe music here in
new London does a lot

164
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.160
of mail order. But, but
there are good places online.

165
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.330
And I'm going to bring
you to some of those

166
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.400
links where you can see
some of this stuff. Okay,

167
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.730
fantastic. Also, I really want
to mention one of my

168
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.740
mentors in life, Ethan Weiner,
who not only started Crescent

169
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:12.350
software back before visual basic
and in a.net way before.net.

170
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.720
And, but he also is
a serious, serious audio file.

171
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.520
He built studio, he built
studios and synthesizers in the

172
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.020
seventies, mixing desks and things
like that for fun. And

173
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:34.580
you can check out his
website, Ethan weiner.com, check out

174
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:41.090
shrinks.com/k D for, for his
sort of index to all

175
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.970
of his audio articles. And
he's written a lot of

176
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:49.850
great stuff, including if you
go to shrinks to.com/katie five,

177
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.210
it's called dispelling audio myths,
dispelling popular audio myths. And

178
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.930
this guy really knows what
he's talking about. And unfortunately

179
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.480
some of his myths include
stuff like, you know, this

180
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.230
product is no good. This
product is, you know, not

181
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.860
necessary. This kind of stuff
is not necessary. And, and

182
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.070
he doesn't get a lot
of mainstream publication that way,

183
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.470
you know, because the sponsors,
the sponsors that in the

184
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.830
advertisers, in those magazines are
the basically he's writing articles

185
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.760
saying, don't buy them. You
don't need them. So, you

186
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.650
know, you can agree or
disagree with him, but he

187
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.570
does have, he does have
a lot of experience to

188
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.420
back up his claim. So
here's one, even though people

189
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.840
cannot hear frequencies above 20
K, it is important that

190
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.930
audio equipment be able to
reproduce higher frequencies to maintain

191
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.490
clarity. That's a myth. So
most people don't hear above

192
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:52.910
20 K 20 kilohertz, 20
kilohertz. Right? So in the,

193
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.280
he has demonstrations, he has
some really cool demonstrations to

194
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.820
demonstrate this. If I could
say that. So you were

195
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.190
saying that we should or
should not include the sound

196
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.130
above those areas. Well, I
mean, you certainly can, but

197
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.010
it really doesn't. Isn't going
to do a lot for

198
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.900
you Now. I know a
lot of people say that

199
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.990
they don't like to buy
MP3s. They don't like to

200
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:19.050
buy music like AACS off
of iTunes with lossy compression

201
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.610
because that's what they're buying
broken. Well, that's different compression

202
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.570
schemes do degrade sound. And
if you really want to

203
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.590
talk about digital versus analog,
you gotta talk raw wave.

204
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.310
You know, what happens in
a, in an analog signal

205
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.150
is that this magnetic storage
media stores, the sound waves,

206
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.130
which actually re get reproduced
electronically through the, you know,

207
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.610
analog tape device or, or
records, or, you know, records,

208
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.840
use grooves, et cetera. But
it's the same analog thing

209
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.640
with digital. It all depends
on analog to digital converters

210
00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.320
and digital to analog converters
and the analog to digital

211
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.370
converters of the day and
going both ways, you know,

212
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.600
when digital audio first came
out and mass, weren't that

213
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.620
good, the very first CD
players, you know, they cut

214
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.180
corners on the, and you
know, the, the Ady CS

215
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.970
and DACs so that they
could get them out at

216
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.910
a decent price. And so
they really weren't good. So

217
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.650
the first ones to hit
the stores were the ones

218
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.110
that people were viewing. And
there was this, you know,

219
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.730
they don't sound good. Well,
a lot of it was

220
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.270
because they were crappy converters.
The first aid dat, which

221
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:38.670
is an Elisa's eight track
digital audio recorder that uses

222
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.270
video tapes. It was revolutionary
for studios cause they had

223
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.180
these, they could do away
with their big Studer eight

224
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.350
track machines and just get
this digital tape. But these

225
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.410
aid that's the very first
ones had absolute crap for

226
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.390
audio, digital converters, analog to
digital and digital analog. And

227
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.210
they didn't sound good if
you started mixing a lot

228
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.490
of high frequencies, it had
just turned to mush. It

229
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.050
just go. And so there
began the sentiment out there

230
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:12.680
that, you know, digital sounds
crappy. And since then the,

231
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.660
the digital to analog and
analog, digital converters, you get

232
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.780
in a soundblaster now that
come actually on a motherboard

233
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.960
are like a hundred times
better than those first ones

234
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.960
that everybody formed their opinions
on. So it's a nonissue,

235
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.870
it's a nonissue. So here's
another one of his myths.

236
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.270
He says, digital audio sounds
worse than analog. And the

237
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.900
lack of digital's fidelity is
revealed as a sterile and

238
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.010
harsh sound that lacks, warmth,
depth, imaging, clarity, and any

239
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.730
number of other vague and
elusive descriptions. The fact he

240
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.660
says is that analog tape
compresses dynamics and adds distortion,

241
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.780
which can be a pleasing
effect for many people, including

242
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.300
me, but for pure faithfulness,
the original sound modern pro

243
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.080
quality digital wins hands down
every time. It is true

244
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.210
that when digital audio is
recorded at too low, a

245
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.800
level, the result can sound
grainy. This distortion is, is

246
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.640
in addition to hiss that
an analog recording also has,

247
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.550
and it is caused by
using an insufficient number of

248
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.030
bits that is recording it
too low. A level on

249
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.790
a 16 bit system is
similar to recording at a

250
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.330
normal level on an eight
bit system. So that's a

251
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.330
lot of information, put it
into concrete things for, for

252
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.210
our listeners in the context
of things like CDs and

253
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.440
things that we understand like
MP3s. Sure. So, so CDs

254
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.530
are not compressed. They're pure
16 bit digital reproductions, the

255
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.170
analog to digital converters that
get used to create those

256
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:43.180
CDs are pro quality. If
you play those back on

257
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.850
any CD player of the
day, it sounds as good

258
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.760
as good can be. I
mean, it's a, So why

259
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.470
were there a lot of,
I mean, I remember back

260
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.750
in the day when CDs
players came out, you could

261
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.510
buy like a $200 CD
player and then a thousand

262
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.550
dollars CD player. And even
today you can still do

263
00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.760
that. Yeah. The thousand dollar
ones basically have, there were

264
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:06.310
some features called over sampling
that was supposed to, you

265
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.680
know, sort of fill in
the cracks between the bits,

266
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.930
if you will, if you
think of a wave, an

267
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.580
analog sine wave, right. It's
pure it's it's calculus. It's

268
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.300
just smooth. It's there, there
are no steps to it.

269
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.150
But when you digitize, what
you're doing is you're taking

270
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.980
a sample of audio 44
point 1000 times per second,

271
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.770
A snapshot in a moment
in time Shot at a

272
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.320
moment in time, which is
a number it's a number

273
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.410
of amplitude, it's a volume.
And when you look at

274
00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.280
that volume in, you start
zooming in on that wave,

275
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.330
you begin to see steps.
And if those steps are

276
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.420
to, you know, what am
I trying to say? I

277
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.110
feel resolution is too low.
The resolution is too low.

278
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.890
Then, you know, you can
almost hear a zipper effect

279
00:16:54.190 --> 00:17:00.310
going from step to step.
Ah, right. But the modern

280
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.700
digital, the analog converters just
don't have this problem. So

281
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.540
a $20, a CD player
from Walmart will do just

282
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.510
fine This day and age.
Absolutely. Anything that you can

283
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.620
possibly pick up and buy.
It's going to be great.

284
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.690
So that's on the playback
side and, but on the

285
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.030
recording side, what are we
recording on right now? Like

286
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.550
what am I looking at
that I'm recording on? Cause

287
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.060
I'm an Oregon here. Yeah.
What we're recording is pure

288
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:32.590
44.1 mano signals. Now what
we're using is a microphone.

289
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:37.930
The microphone I'm using is
a audio Technica 40 40.

290
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.940
You can read about that@stringsstir.com
K DB. It's about 300

291
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:50.100
bucks and it's a condenser
microphone, condenser microphones, large condenser

292
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.450
microphones require power because they're
so delicate in they're so

293
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.460
sensitive. They, they require power
in order to get the

294
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:05.040
signal amplified enough so that
it becomes microphone level. And

295
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:11.190
so when that microphone is
introduced through the Phantom power,

296
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.090
then it goes into a
preamp which amplifies it. And

297
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.840
that preempt turns it into
a line level signal. What

298
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.200
is a preamp? I know
that they're always trying to

299
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.350
sell me a preamp when
I go to Magnolia, Hi-Fi

300
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.140
sure what is a preamp
and why would I audio

301
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.150
file one a preamp and
not just a receiver with

302
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.640
all that stuff built in.
There's two different things. We're

303
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.980
talking about. Preamps color, the
sound a preamp gives you

304
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.040
the characteristics of the sound.
It's the first thing in

305
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.700
the signal chain that actually
amplifies and therefore colors the

306
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.650
sound. So it comes out
of equal. It comes into

307
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.980
the microphone and directly into
the preempt. The microphone is

308
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.690
Mike level preamp turns it
into line level. Ah, so,

309
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.520
and when you amplify, you
introduce noise and therefore pre-amps

310
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.970
must be clean. And you
know, some of them have

311
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.200
a nice warming effect. If
you use a tube pre-amp,

312
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.630
you know, preempt with a
tube in it, you get

313
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:13.490
that nice tube distortion that
John Lennon revolution sound to

314
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.970
the voice. That's a, that
comes up a little natural

315
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.390
distortion. Sounds good. But to
tell you the truth, any

316
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.600
preamp that you can get
on any Mackie mixer these

317
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.230
days is going to be
more than adequate, especially for

318
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.190
just spoken voice for podcasts.
Okay. But even so the

319
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.430
preempt business is a boutique
business and there are companies

320
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.080
out there that sell hand
crafted German, engineered preamps, you

321
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.090
know, for $4,000 for a
single channel. And it's beyond

322
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.210
me. Why, you know, why
you'd need this? I mean,

323
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.270
there granted, I don't go
around listening to them in

324
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.380
a being them. But I
got a feeling that if

325
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.470
you put, you know, even
a decent preamp, like a

326
00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.760
PreSonus digit max, which is
what we're using against a,

327
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:06.920
you know, a $4,001 preamp,
all other things being equal.

328
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.590
I'm not so sure that
your average smoke could tell

329
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.230
the difference. Well, I'm your
average Schmoe and what am

330
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.780
I talking on here? This
is a Behringer microphone. What

331
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.550
kind of microphone is this?
I've got, yeah, You have

332
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.940
a Berenger <inaudible> okay. That
was about a hundred bucks.

333
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.280
Wasn't it? A hundred bucks.
And the a hundred dollar

334
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.760
version of the 80, 40,
40 is the 80, 2020,

335
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.200
which you can get@ktcshrinksto.com KTC.
Okay. I've got a very

336
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.770
nice looking, a hundred dollar
microphone, big thick cable. It

337
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.830
goes into a Miranda solid
state recorder. Tell me about

338
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.940
this. The Moran solid state
recorder you can find@shrinksor.com slash

339
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.500
K D a and you're
using, this is how we

340
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.010
do the podcast. By the
way, if don't know, Scott

341
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.430
is in Oregon, he's in
Portland and he's talking on

342
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.940
a phone, you have a
headset, Right? I've got a

343
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.550
phone in my left ear
here. And actually another phone

344
00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.400
just rang. Yep. I've got
a headset. So you're an

345
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.490
artist actually communicating over the
Right. We're communicating over the

346
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.830
phone, but the phones not
It's being recorded, it's just

347
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.760
there to talk. Right? You're
also talking into a microphone

348
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.710
which is being recorded on
this digital audio recorder. Exactly.

349
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.590
That turns into a wave
file, which then you're going

350
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.950
to send to me via
FTP when we're done and

351
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.220
more on that in a
second, because that brings up

352
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.780
flack. And I'm talking into
a microphone in a sound

353
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.750
booth here, and that microphone
is going into a PreSonus

354
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.350
digit max preamp unit, which
is just a nice preamp

355
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.300
that is going into a
audio interface, which in our

356
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.470
studio here is a Mark
of the unicorn 24 IO,

357
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:44.040
which you can see at
KDD. We like this because

358
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.400
it has 24 inputs and
24 outputs and a FireWire

359
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.130
cable to your PC and
boom, you've got a little,

360
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.170
A lot of IO. So
I'm one of the inputs

361
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.690
and you're one of the
inputs. Well, not yet. Now

362
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.540
what we do is we
have two of those inputs

363
00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.120
going out to two different
phone lines and how we

364
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.910
do that is through a
telephone interface called the telos

365
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.420
one, which you can look
at it, shrinks to.com. Katie

366
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.830
K Telus one is we
actually have a one plus

367
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.950
one, which is two of
these things together. So you

368
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.250
can have two people on
the phone with no crosstalk.

369
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.270
And that's basically what it's
job is to separate the

370
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.060
caller on the other end
of the phone, from whatever

371
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:28.410
signal you're sending. When you
talk on the phone.net Rocks

372
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.990
does an interview and you're
talking to someone, their phone

373
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.420
channel is coming into that
system and then becomes one

374
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.610
of the channels, Right? And
then we can record it

375
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.550
like a channel and we
don't get any of the

376
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.000
signal that we're sending. Like
my microphone is being sent

377
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.820
down this same phone line,
but it's not coming through

378
00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.490
on the track. Okay. That
makes sense. Now we've tried

379
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:51.600
a lot of other ones,
particularly the JK audio, digital

380
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.000
hybrids, and they just didn't
sound good. You can hear

381
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.580
them in the early days
of.net rocks. You can, every

382
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.220
once in a while, you'll
hear two people talk over

383
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.220
each other and you'll hear
this buzzing Rover drivers sound.

384
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.250
And that's basically because we
couldn't, you know, we had

385
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.620
two people on the same
phone line. We had to

386
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.750
put the schmutz in there.
It's a good way for

387
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:15.750
a garage podcast or to
record phone conversations. Isn't any

388
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.810
better way than using the
Telus one. And what I

389
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:23.250
mean by that is there
are other digital hybrids, but

390
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.520
they're going to sound like
ass. What about voiceover IP

391
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.240
solutions? So this is a
good question of voiceover IP,

392
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.770
like Skype, I think is
really good for, you know,

393
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.290
taking the place of telephones.
When you want to call

394
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.790
a mom or you want
to call someone or have

395
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.260
a casual conversation, but if
we're counting on quality and

396
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.570
we're counting on, you know,
nothing, no noises in the

397
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.330
middle of your talking, you
really can't count on it

398
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.420
because you're using the public
internet. And when you're using

399
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.990
the public internet, you know,
somebody starts downloading the Superbowl,

400
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.010
your neighbor or something. You,
you know, you might have

401
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.100
a timeout or something like
that. And it ends up

402
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.730
sounding like this, Right? So
speaking of sound quality, your

403
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.190
sound almost always sounds better
than mine because you're in

404
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.920
a booth, you've got a
better mic, better equipment. I'm

405
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.460
here with this, Mirant's recording
onto a compact flash, but

406
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.310
I'm in a square shaped
room with a, an air

407
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:24.190
conditioner going That's right. So
you have two things going

408
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.290
bad for you. You're in
a square shaped room with

409
00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.800
no sound absorption material, right?
And that means that if

410
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.460
your walls are parallel, the
sound bounces back and forth

411
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.310
until it degrades. And so
you get an echo in

412
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.620
your sound like you're in
your bathroom. Even if you're

413
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.900
in a large room, if
you have parallel walls, you're

414
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.050
going to have that reflection
problem. Okay. That's why when

415
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.690
you go into a stone
church with parallel walls and

416
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.530
you clap, you hear forever
because that stone just reflects,

417
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:54.260
reflects, reflects, and it just
bounces back and forth. And

418
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.010
that's where reverb comes from
basically. Now, how do you

419
00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:59.380
remove these background sounds that
are going on here as

420
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.020
the people in the next
office, move a chair and,

421
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.260
and the, the, and the
kind of ongoing low hum

422
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.250
of the air conditioning. It's
not, it is, it's very

423
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:15.370
easy to remove any kind
of low, steady, consistent noise

424
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.280
with noise reduction techniques, which
I'll talk about in a

425
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.690
minute, but what's more difficult.
Is transience anything that's like

426
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.770
somebody says, Whoa, Jorge or
dog bark, or you know,

427
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:31.840
something that isn't continuous. Okay.
Those things you just have

428
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.140
to pretty much live with.
And that's why we have

429
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.050
booths here because we're in
a noisy city and you

430
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:43.750
know, cars honk and people
play music and you know,

431
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:48.340
all sorts of things happen.
So Completing the cycle here,

432
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:53.680
my, my Berenger microphone goes
through this fancy cable, into

433
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.160
my Moran solid state recorder
at 44.1 kilohertz onto a

434
00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.830
flash disc. I put the
flash disc. Well, not so

435
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.530
fast, not so fast. There's
more, yeah. You, when you

436
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.410
plug your microphone in, since
it's a condenser microphone, you

437
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:10.990
need Phantom power and Phantom
power is a power that's

438
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.050
there when it's required for
microphones and not there when

439
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.330
it's not required. And that's
why it's called Phantom. Now

440
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:21.280
Why my, my, my Mirant's
drains battery so quickly, Right?

441
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.890
If you didn't need that
48 volts of power, you

442
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.220
were using a dynamic microphone,
like a sure. SM 58

443
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.370
or something like that, then
you wouldn't be taking up

444
00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.040
quite so much. Cause I
can drain for double A's

445
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.740
in this thing in and
out. Yep. It sucks power.

446
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:40.090
So that Phantom power of
boosts the signal for the

447
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.830
microphone at the microphone. And
then it goes into your

448
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:48.270
pre-amp and you turn up
the volume. Here's something. When

449
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.360
you're setting volume levels, this
is perhaps the most important

450
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.080
thing in the old days
of analog. You wanted to

451
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.340
just set it so that
it goes just a little

452
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.320
bit into the red. You
remember your old tape decks.

453
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.870
When you're recording from an
album, you would set up

454
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.910
against the red. So it
bounces up against the red

455
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.460
will in the digital world.
That's bad. You don't want

456
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.020
to be anywhere near clipping
because analog distortion sounds nice

457
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:15.300
and warm and fuzzy digital
distortion sounds like. So you

458
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.170
really don't want any. So
as soon as you overdrive,

459
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.150
that's what that's called over.
Yeah. So if you overdrive,

460
00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.310
you're done for now. No,
I had done that when

461
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.140
I did some interviews at
tech ed, I went into

462
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.570
a noisy bar that's right.
Brought him back. And you

463
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.540
said, I can't use this
audio because the it's just,

464
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.260
it's just a loud, loud,
Too bad. Yeah. Now the

465
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.770
software that we use, Adobe
audition, which you can see

466
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:41.930
it shrinks to that calm
KDF. This software has tool

467
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:45.140
rest, you know, audio restoration
stuff, built into it. And

468
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.450
I'll explain what it does.
One of them is clip

469
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:52.760
restoration. So if you actually
do spike up above zero

470
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.390
and you clip, you can
tell it to reduce the

471
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.960
Val the volume and restore
the, the wave. And what

472
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.500
it does is it looks
at the curve of you

473
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.280
gotta think of an arc,
right. A parabola. Ah, I

474
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.720
see, I get where you're
going. I know you're going

475
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.120
with this. It goes up,
hits, hits the level and

476
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.640
then flattens out, flattens out,
pulls the whole curve down

477
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.970
and extrapolates it exactly How
many points are up there

478
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.510
and then use Bezier transforms
to, to sort of reconstruct

479
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.900
them. And it is amazing
if you don't have, if

480
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.380
you're clipping, isn't too bad,
it's amazing. In your case,

481
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:31.370
you over drove the preamp
at the source. So the

482
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:35.120
preamp is analog right before
it got digitized. It was,

483
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.150
it was hosed. And that's
why we couldn't Restore the

484
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.300
source. That's the source source
was bad. Now it was

485
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.090
just, there was no information
to recover. Yeah. Sometimes we've

486
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.790
been able to do that.
If we in it, there's

487
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.590
a little trick that we
figured out. Jeff and I

488
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:53.690
figured this out that if
you boost the input above

489
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.080
zero, the clipped input above
zero Sercos way above zero,

490
00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.010
and then try to do
clip restoration. The restoration will

491
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.700
actually sometimes figure it out,
but it's not perfect. And

492
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.430
sometimes you'll get a pop
or a big gash of

493
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.400
noise and it's not perfect.
But we have used that

494
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.850
on occasion when the source
audio has been Flipped. So

495
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.100
let's talk, we'll talk about
software in a second, but

496
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.310
I take this wave file
and I flack it. Yeah.

497
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.560
Why is flacking so important
for what we do? I

498
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.430
do. Flack is free lossless
audio codec. And you can

499
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:29.120
think of it like zip
for wave files. Lossless meaning

500
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.650
it doesn't compress like MP3s
do it, but it does

501
00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:38.240
compress the data. It's just
that when you unflag, it

502
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.750
will decompress it into its
exact replica. So It's, so

503
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.400
it's a much superior way
of zipping up wave files

504
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.310
without losing any of the
actual sound. It's a lossless

505
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.230
wave compression. Yeah. And Microsoft
now has their own lossless

506
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:57.270
windows, media, audio loss was
Kodak, but what's good. What's

507
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.730
bad about it is that
you only get about 50%

508
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:02.190
compression just about as much
as you would, if you

509
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.860
took a zip, you know,
and put it in, WinZip

510
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.400
a wave file and put
it in Windsor. So probably

511
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.370
probably more than that, but
Well, if you guys had

512
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:15.690
120 Meg wave file from
another show and it turned

513
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:19.230
into 63 megs just about
exactly. Half. Yeah. So what's

514
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.260
good about that is a,
you can then send that

515
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.010
up to, you know, FTP
that somewhere and it takes

516
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.010
half the time as the
wave would take and there's

517
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.710
no degree degradation. Why would
I use this over zip?

518
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.690
If you said that zip
gets you about 50%, as

519
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:36.450
well as zip code Two
50% for eight bit files

520
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:39.360
for 16 bit files, it's
much less. I see. So

521
00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.510
it's better than zip. Okay.
But, but then you send

522
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:46.230
it to me and then
I'm recording your phone track

523
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.800
through the telos. And I'm
also recording my microphone track

524
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.250
on the two different tracks.
I take your audio wave

525
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.680
file. And I line that
up to you on the

526
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.620
phone track, just visually. I
mean, I can zoom in

527
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.110
at a sample level and
I can lock it in.

528
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.320
So when I play them
together, I hear one voice.

529
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.850
And then I just mute
out the, ah, mute out

530
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.030
the phone track and do
a little panning. Of course,

531
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.580
you know, what we do
here is we do a

532
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.590
process on our audio files,
which starts with maximizing the

533
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:23.070
volume. So we do a
hard limit to bring up

534
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.800
the peaks and slam the
peek, slam the big peaks

535
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.540
down a little bit, but
bring it up so that

536
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.950
most of it fits within
the full spectrum. So is

537
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.440
that taking advantage of, is
that taking advantage of, is

538
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.720
that making it, so, you
know, I held my mic

539
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.030
this distance away, you held
your mic that distance away.

540
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.180
And we sound like we're
at different volumes. Yes. Normalizing

541
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.790
the volume. Exactly. We're normalizing
the volume and not only

542
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:49.050
that, but we're making it
so that it's analogous to

543
00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.810
saturating the tape. I mean,
we're getting the signal hot,

544
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.330
Trying to get as much
information on that as you

545
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.060
can. Yeah. And getting the
signal hot is important, especially

546
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.520
for the final mix. Cause
a lot of people listen

547
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.210
to these things on iPods
with crappy headphone amplifiers. And

548
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.430
so if you're listening in
a loud environment and you've

549
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.700
got a very soft podcast,
then you're turning, you're cranking

550
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.080
up and hearing more noise
from your, from your iPod

551
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.050
or whatever your stereo system
is With all due respect

552
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.930
to our listeners with crappy
headphones. Yeah. Or if you're

553
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.820
listening at home on a
stereo, you know, and it's

554
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.800
very low, what do you
do? You turn the volume

555
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.150
up on your stereo and
you hear more in the

556
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.850
background. It sounds like, you
know, you know what? Huh.

557
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.660
So what about free software
that Adobe software sounds pretty

558
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.940
expensive? Well, let me get
back to the process here.

559
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.920
The next thing we do
is we do noise reduction,

560
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.730
which is a great, you
can think of it like

561
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.240
a multi band noise gate,
if you know what that

562
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.050
means. Nope. But a with
thousands and thousands of bands,

563
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.240
what is a multi-band noise
gate? Well, I don't want

564
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.260
to go into that, but
basically what it does is

565
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.450
it effectively removes background noise
while maintaining the signal that

566
00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.970
isn't noise. So the first
thing you do is you

567
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.780
find the quietest passage you
can, when you only have

568
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.930
the background ambient sound. And
that's why we take, you

569
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.850
know, a second, a few
seconds at the beginning of

570
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.480
the show to take a
noise profile, we were quiet

571
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.150
for five seconds or so
what we do is then

572
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.430
we go back in there,
we select it and we

573
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.120
tell the software, this is
noise. And then, you know,

574
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.670
we've set a few magic
settings, which is the key

575
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.920
to making this stuff work
that we've tweaked over the

576
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.460
years. And we select the
entire file and say, now

577
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.150
remove it. So we'd actually
know that that's a part

578
00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.310
of the software. You can
actually say this chunk here

579
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.700
from zero seconds to five
seconds. That was, that was

580
00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.710
quiet. That's what we think
is quiet. This is the

581
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.380
background, ambient noise that I
now want you to remove

582
00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.300
from the rest of the
file and keep everything else.

583
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.630
And it does it. And
you know, I say tweaking

584
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.660
because if you have too
low a number you're going

585
00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:57.040
to have artifacting. And if
you have artifacting meaning like

586
00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:01.150
bad sounding MP3s, they sound
phased and flanged and all

587
00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:04.300
that kind of thing Artifact
in, in MP3 world is

588
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.200
just like an artifact in
JPEG. It's an undesirable side

589
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.070
effects, exactly Undesirable side effect.
Perfect. So, but if you

590
00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.170
have too high, a number,
you won't get enough noise

591
00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.850
reduction. So, so it's an
delicate balance thing. We, we

592
00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:21.310
think we have, you know,
the magic numbers that we

593
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.890
come up with to make
it good. And we sometimes

594
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:25.900
will go through a second
time with a different number,

595
00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.750
depending on how noisy the
stuff is. So that's how

596
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.660
we take out your room,
air conditioner and things like

597
00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.380
that. Then once we have
those two things done, we,

598
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.680
you know, pan them and
we go through second by

599
00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.430
second and listened to it.
And we take out, you

600
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:46.660
know, while you're listening, you
went or something like that,

601
00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.450
we'll go and take that
out. And I hope, I

602
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.120
hope Lawrence is listening to
the show. It doesn't actually

603
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.220
take that out and actually
take out that sniff. So

604
00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.680
this is what I call
removing the ums. When people

605
00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.750
say, well, where's all the
work. And it's like, well,

606
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.550
it's not only all of
the cleaning of the sound,

607
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:06.580
but it's also removing a
ridiculous pauses. Thanks. Exactly. Exactly.

608
00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.970
So the other, the last
thing I want to end

609
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:14.620
on here is, is 24
bit recording really better. If

610
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.820
you go to shrinks to.com/
<inaudible>, Ethan Weiner talks about

611
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.360
24 bit versus 16 bit.
This is the sample size,

612
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.630
right? This is the sample,
the size of the sample

613
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.390
that you're pulling out and
saying for every sample I'm

614
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.790
reading, this is how many
bits it's got. Well, I

615
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.700
remember when I switched from
16 bit color on my

616
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.170
monitor to 24 bit and
then to 32 bit, the

617
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:41.330
it got better. So isn't
more bits, Not necessarily. I

618
00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.210
mean, it all depends on,
see, our eyes are more,

619
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.630
are different, have different sensitivity
number-wise than our ears do.

620
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.480
And this is what it's
all about. The bit rate

621
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:55.070
in colors is how many
colors you can see. And

622
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.160
our eyes are absolutely wicked
sensitive when it comes to

623
00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.630
shades of colors. Okay. Hang
on. Sorry. Somebody just like

624
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.130
flush the toilet. So there
was, what do you call,

625
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:07.070
what do you call that?
An outlier? Yeah. Heavy load

626
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.700
Laurence. Leave that in. So
you can hear what, what

627
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.610
that would sound like if
you didn't remove it. Okay.

628
00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:15.950
So you're saying that our
eyes are much more sensitive,

629
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.350
so it's more important within,
within the, with the air.

630
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:22.010
Well, and in terms of
number of colors, right. You

631
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:25.970
know, the, the number of
colors doesn't really, doesn't equate

632
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:30.590
to number of samples per
second, and you hear, you

633
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.800
know, it's, it's similar in
that they're both resolution, but

634
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:40.850
the numbers aren't necessarily one-to-one.
So 24 bit systems, basically

635
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:45.140
Ethan's manifesto is that, you
know, once we perfected the

636
00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.920
16 bit digital, the audio
converter and vice versa, the

637
00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.340
music industry is pretty much
done because you know, it's

638
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:56.720
perfect. And now you can
see them inventing things that,

639
00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.130
you know, inventing markets for
themselves to sort of carve

640
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.080
out a niche and buy
our stuff because this is

641
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.330
better. Oh, 24. And you've
just brought up a very

642
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.390
profound thing. I mean, we
know technology is getting faster.

643
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:11.660
Computers are getting faster, monitors
getting bigger, more dots per

644
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:16.310
inch. You said that you're
saying basically that audio has

645
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:19.100
pretty much got it. Right.
And that, you know, you

646
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.230
could go in and get
a super audio CD or

647
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:26.270
DVD audio, but only the
most niche sensitive individuals will

648
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:29.180
be able to really appreciate
that. Yeah. And he's saying

649
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.540
that nobody can appreciate it,
that it's humanly impossible, unless

650
00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.720
you're some kind of freak
of nature that you have,

651
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.370
you know, here's above the
24 bit is the state

652
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.210
of the art in terms
of, you know, resolution in

653
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:48.680
terms of sample size and
96 <inaudible> is what they're

654
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.350
saying. People should be recording
at now for ultimate. So

655
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.020
it's 96 kilohertz as opposed
to 44.1, right. Instead of

656
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.670
44 point 1000 samples per
second, we want to take

657
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:08.360
96,000 samples. Anything more would
be superfluous, right? So Ethan

658
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.130
has a bunch of tests
up here. He's got a

659
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.510
first of all, he's got
this myths thing at KT,

660
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.820
five shrinks to that con
Katie five has shrinks to

661
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.880
that con Katie six, he's
sort of a for skeptic

662
00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.050
magazine wrote this article called
audio Foolery, which is interesting

663
00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.650
as well. And the one
other thing is he's got

664
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.800
it shrinks to that comm
slash Katy seven, a test

665
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.980
where you can actually listen
to the same recording that

666
00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.760
has been encoded with different
bit rates to see if

667
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.430
you can tell the difference.
And I'm going to check

668
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.710
this out and that's cool.
So that's the shrinks to

669
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:45.340
that. Calm Katie seven. Now
here's something about 96 K

670
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.130
Roger Nichols, who was the, who
is steely Dan's engineer. All

671
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:54.510
right. He's the God of
audio Steely. Dan is the

672
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.840
God of audio. Steely. Dan
is a band. Of course,

673
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:04.740
that is well known in
all recording as producing pristine,

674
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:09.870
perfect CDs and records even
before CDs like the album

675
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.930
Asia sounds so good as
the best sounding vinyl I've

676
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.770
had. I have. Okay. And
it's used as reference, you

677
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.110
know, these, these albums are
used as reference albums in

678
00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:24.060
studios everywhere. So Roger Nichols is
no slouch. Okay. Okay. So

679
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:28.920
he wrote, he has a
blog, which, and he wrote

680
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.740
this post that was going
on 96. K is it

681
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:36.480
better and strengthened a comm
slash K D eight. And

682
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.810
here's what he says. The
two against nature CD was

683
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:44.220
mixed 24 bit 44.1 K
to a master link through

684
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:49.020
Apogee PSX. 100, the PSX
was feeding other units besides

685
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.530
the master link for backup.
We did 90. We did

686
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:56.790
24 bit 96 K, but
we couldn't hear any difference.

687
00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.690
Okay. Scott Hall mastered it from
the 24 bit 4,400 hundred

688
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.990
files in Sonic solutions. Wow.
So, so they did a

689
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.070
simultaneous mix in 96 K
and in 40 41 and

690
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:14.310
nobody in the studio, not
even Roger Nichols could tell the

691
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.630
difference between the two. Wow.
So it really begs the

692
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:23.190
question, is this necessary? Or
is this, you know, the,

693
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.080
the audio companies that are
suddenly like, Hey, it fits

694
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.530
perfect. Why, why are we
here? You know? Well, that's

695
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.170
a very good, quick, and
what's, what's next? What's next

696
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:35.790
a hundred years from now.
Will it be the same?

697
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.300
Right. So I'm not saying,
I believe all this stuff

698
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:41.460
in terms of Kind of
like a fan boy, you

699
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.040
liked this guy. Yeah. I
mean, I like it when

700
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.320
people come out and make
these kinds of claims. And

701
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.020
when guys like Roger Nichols say
that kind of stuff, because

702
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.410
it just makes you think
about, you know, is monster

703
00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.200
cable really necessary, this kind
of stuff. You know, there's

704
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.500
a question if in the
interest of not wasting our

705
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.200
listeners times, which has always
the theme of Hanselman, it's

706
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.240
we always try to give
them at least one bit

707
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.400
of information that they can
use that day, because the

708
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.650
assumption is you're listening to
this while you're driving to

709
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.020
work. And people may say,
wow, this is all very

710
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.660
interesting. I learned about audio
things. I don't know, but

711
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.320
should I really buy a
hundred dollar monster cable? Well,

712
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.410
the answer is, you know,
if there aren't any other

713
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:24.630
really good quality cables in
the store. Yes. But, but

714
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.360
the fact is, is that
the same quality cable can

715
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.010
be found, you know, at
a radio shack for, you

716
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.670
know, about a, of the
price. So I don't need

717
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:39.950
24 karat gold coated, super
thick audio cables. No, no.

718
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.580
And that's one of the
myths that Ethan dispels in

719
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.950
his, in his article, it's
even better with optical, right?

720
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.680
One optical cable is no
different than another optical. Absolutely.

721
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.460
It's frigging light. You know,
we move light better. Does

722
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:58.220
the light move? Yes. Okay.
And digital cables even better

723
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:05.120
DVI, right? Digital monitor cables,
gold plated. Y you either

724
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.370
get the bit, or you
don't get the bet. Right.

725
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.420
It's tough. People swear by
them though. You never know,

726
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.400
right? Yeah. It looks better.
It looks better. That bit

727
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.770
looks more one than the
other bit better because I

728
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:17.870
paid more for it. Well,
I think that this has

729
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.690
been very, very interesting. This
is interesting to me because

730
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:22.790
I don't have to know
this stuff. I know more

731
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:25.130
now than I did before
we started, but I'm glad

732
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.250
that you're running the sound,
audio quality and not, and

733
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.290
not me on Hansel minutes.
Well, you know, I didn't

734
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.540
want to sound like it's
an ad for pop productions

735
00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.180
because you know, we're obviously
trying to convince people that

736
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.080
it's worth it to do
things right. But you know,

737
00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.740
it is a lot of
information that anybody who's doing,

738
00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.140
any kind of audio can
use. And I hope, I

739
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.500
hope you learned a lot
from it too. I appreciate

740
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.000
it. And I think because
you did most of the

741
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.760
talking on this show, it's
my turn to say that

742
00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.800
we thank you for listening
and we'll see you next

743
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.030
week on Hansel minutes.
