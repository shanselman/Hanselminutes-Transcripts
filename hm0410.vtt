00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.380
this episode, Scott talks to
Katherine Moss of line software tech

9
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.530
about how she uses her
computer and her phone. Hi,

10
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.630
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

11
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.380
minutes, and I'm chatting with
Catherine Moss. She's an it professional.

12
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.530
And you also happen to
be blind, is that correct?

13
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.650
Yes, that's right. Are you,
are you totally blind or

14
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.430
is that an okay question
to ask? It's totally fine.

15
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.020
I'm actually, I'm blind, like
totally blind. As far as

16
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.780
being able to read print
goes, I can't, I have

17
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.440
to rely completely on, you
know, screen reading software to

18
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.040
access any sort of, you
know, computer system or anything

19
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.830
like that. But I do
have, you know, some color

20
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.390
recognition, some, you know, shape
recognition, and I can also

21
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.080
detect light and darkness as
well. So you can go

22
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.790
into a room and you
can say, Oh, lights are

23
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.670
out. Absolutely. And I can
also see if there's a

24
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.320
bunch of people in the
room usually too. Cause I

25
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.860
can, I can, like I
said, I know, I know

26
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.350
most shapes like, like, so
for instance, like with people

27
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.990
I can see people's shapes,
but I would never be

28
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.170
able to see their facial
expressions. I see. And if

29
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.940
I gave you like a
coupon, could you tell me

30
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.640
when it was expiring? Unless
not, unless I scanned it

31
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.610
into a computer and was
able to read it using

32
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.090
text to speech software? Unfortunately.
No. Okay. I was, I

33
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.380
don't, I haven't talked about
it a whole lot, but

34
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.740
I had LASIK surgery and
before I had my eyes

35
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.470
zapped, I was negative 11
diopters, which was 20 1600.

36
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.530
So I had big thick
glasses, big, big, big, like

37
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.790
big 1980s glass glasses, not
before we had plastic and

38
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.220
polymer lenses and stuff. So
I've hit this bump in

39
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.670
my nose from wearing glasses
for 20 years. And I,

40
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.210
so I had, I couldn't
walk without my glasses. Like

41
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.030
I could see colors, but
I would, I would trip

42
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.780
over stuff. I couldn't see
my feet in the, in

43
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.020
the shower. And so I
had a little bit of

44
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.930
a, of a background in
like I was the most

45
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.120
blind kid in school. And
then when I got, when

46
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.790
I got LASIK, of course,
I got to put all

47
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.660
that behind me, but I
still tried to think about

48
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.210
accessibility. And when I went
to work in banking, I,

49
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.790
I, my job was one
of my jobs was to

50
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.490
think about this five Oh
eight accessibility and trying to

51
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.150
make sure that our websites
were accessible with screen readers.

52
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.230
And you use a screen
reader. Yes, I do. W

53
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.290
which one do you use
is jaws? I use quite

54
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.160
a few of them. I
use jaws. I actually have,

55
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.270
I have actually have NBDA
non-visual desktop access loaded right

56
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.480
now, which is an open
source Python screenwriter, which is

57
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.690
pretty, pretty cool. It works
with Skype natively. It doesn't

58
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.320
need any, any scripts or
add ons or anything, which

59
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.980
is very rare because Skype
is one of those, one

60
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.710
of those applications that a
lot of screenwriters need a

61
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.520
lot of modifications to work
with, which is interesting. And

62
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.640
I also use window eyes,
which is wonderful because it

63
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.380
allows you to create scripts
and add ons in any

64
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.310
language. And I don't have
that loaded on my computer

65
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.180
at the moment. I need
to get it. And I

66
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.710
also use system access, which
is great for a lot

67
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.030
of things. In fact, they
actually touch a lot of

68
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.790
applications that a lot of
the other screenwriters don't even

69
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.450
bother with like a lot
of the more enterprise and

70
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.440
corporate level applications that the
other simply just don't care

71
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.700
about, which is fantastic. So
you're saying that there's no

72
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.450
like canonical screen reader, like
there's not like the ultimate

73
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.240
screen reader, like you're, you're
always exploring and experimenting and

74
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.620
if a new one comes
out, you'll try that and

75
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.310
see if Yes. Yes. I
always have to. And sometimes

76
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.610
I have to switch screen
readers multiple times within an

77
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.300
application, depending on like what's
going on and depending on

78
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.790
whether it's behaving itself, because
sometimes it just decides, Oh,

79
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.980
I'm not going to behave
today. So I'm just going

80
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.230
to give you a hard
time. And like, that was

81
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.660
happening to me earlier with
a Firefox, I was trying

82
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.210
to load a website and
I was using, or I

83
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.960
was on a web webpage
and I switched from NBDA

84
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.280
to jaws and jaws got
all confused. And for whatever

85
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.590
reason, jaws was only reading
the links. It wouldn't allow

86
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.500
me to see the text
between the links and to

87
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.470
navigate between the headings and
things. So I had to

88
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.370
switch back because jaws was
just being a pain at

89
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.160
that point, which it does
sometimes. And it seems like

90
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.280
it's okay to say, see,
and look at this and

91
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.850
stuff like that. There's just,
you're using, I mean, you're

92
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.010
seeing it, you're seeing it
in your ways, Right? Absolutely.

93
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.400
Yeah. Does, this is the
resolution of the screen matter

94
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.380
to you because even though
you can't see it, I

95
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.350
assume that screen real estate
is still significant. Like if

96
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.230
the webpage was at 800
by 600, you wouldn't be

97
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.910
able to see the text
off to the right of

98
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.430
the, can the reader tell
The screen reader doesn't care,

99
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.870
but with the amount of
vision that I have, I

100
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.090
could definitely tell because I
was actually doing that the

101
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.670
other day I was playing
with my resolution because I

102
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.600
was bored and I have
a 1366 by seven 68

103
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.610
display. So I moved it
down to 800 times, 600

104
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.830
just to be, you know,
just to be goofy. Cause

105
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.980
I was, I was bored
and it, it looked so

106
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.950
weird. I was like, Oh
my gosh, I have to

107
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.190
change this back Because it
looks weird from a screen

108
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.730
reader perspective. No, from the
perspective of the amount of

109
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.250
vision that I have, it
looked, it looked really weird.

110
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.900
Like for instance, I opened
the Microsoft office 2013. I

111
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.440
opened up Microsoft word 2013,
no matter how much I

112
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.180
maximize the thing, I could
not get that document to

113
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.180
cover the entire page. Yeah.
Yeah. 800 by 600 is

114
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.730
unacceptable. I don't think any
app works at that anymore.

115
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.270
Nope. Yeah. We'll find, we'll
find ourselves in situations. We,

116
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.710
the, the, the, the sighted
we'll find ourself in situations

117
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.260
at low resolutions where we'll
bring a dialog box up

118
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.450
and then like, okay. And
cancel is off the bottom

119
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.190
of the screen. And there's
just simply no way to

120
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.100
push the button because it's
just not, not, it's not

121
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.490
on the screen anymore. Yeah.
The cool thing about Skinner

122
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.790
does is they can somehow
get past that. Like they

123
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.220
do it different, you know,
some of them actually have

124
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.890
a video drivers like jaws
and window wise actually have

125
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.810
a video driver. So actually
the screen resolution and the

126
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.650
display and stuff, in some
instances that actually does matter.

127
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.740
It really depends on the
way the screen reader gets

128
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.760
the information, whether it uses
an offscreen model, which jaws

129
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:42.070
uses or whether I'm not
exactly sure how, when do

130
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.900
I does it, but I
know that windows has a

131
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.370
display driver and yeah, that
can actually cause interesting results

132
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.310
when installing that the display
driver. Cause if it's not

133
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:56.530
installed correctly, you can actually
make a system with window

134
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.220
eyes on it. Get a
nice blue screen of death.

135
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.500
That startup, that acts What
happens when a blue screen

136
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.180
of death happens. Do you
know that it's happened? You

137
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.470
have to everything. I mean,
you said you have some

138
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.660
color recognition. So there's things
that things go blue and

139
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.760
you know, you're screwed. They
do. I can usually see

140
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.490
it. And I know, wait,
hold on. I think I

141
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.880
have to restart this. And
usually when it happens, usually,

142
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.130
usually it'll happen right in
the middle of when my

143
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.130
screener is starting, trying to
say something. So what happens

144
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.680
is it gets stuck on
what it was trying to

145
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.730
say, like never complete. So
the minute my screwdriver starts

146
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.930
doing that, I know, Oh,
darn I should take care

147
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.260
of this blue screen of
death. So you have, if

148
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.760
you're sitting in front of
your monitor and I'm trying

149
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.160
to visualize this, I'm seeing
in front of my monitor

150
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.100
right now. And the, the
background is orange. Cause that's,

151
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.350
that's the color that I've
got up today. I assume

152
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.090
that you could have the
sense. You can see the

153
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.060
orange penis in a jet
in a general. I use

154
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.090
my desktop backgrounds all the
time, But I've also got

155
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.230
this Skype window up in
the middle of the screen

156
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.300
with your name on it,
you would not be able

157
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.710
to see your name. You
might, would you be able

158
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.730
to see the window? Oh
yes. And I could tell

159
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.030
because I can, I can
tell like, because I can

160
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.360
see the color, the color
patterns of the window and

161
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.360
the looks of the window,
but you're right. I, I

162
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.070
wouldn't be able to read
any of the texts in

163
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.200
the window, but the cool
thing is that's where screener

164
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.130
just come into play. Cause
they, they read the text

165
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.890
for you. So you don't
have to worry about it,

166
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.370
which is awesome. Now, when
sometimes when a sighted person

167
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.710
bumps into like windows, narrator
or something like that, that's

168
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.550
their really their only experience
with a screen reader. And

169
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.840
it's, it's all very like
a Skype window forefront. It's

170
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.450
very slow and kind of
very marching. But when I've

171
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.850
seen a re blind people
who are really good at

172
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.160
running their computers, I can't
even tell what the screen

173
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.330
are saying. It's a screen.
Exactly. Because we tend to

174
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.790
have it up pretty fast.
It's it's quite funny. I

175
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.220
get that all the time.
I get it. It's like,

176
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.130
people are like, wow, what
was that saying? I'm like,

177
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.260
Oh, I'm probably going to
have to slow this down

178
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.330
for you guys. Aren't I
like that happened to me

179
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.800
back in December when I
had a, a, a presentation

180
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.510
about screenwriters where I did
a few demos for the

181
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:15.560
Boston network users group, and
everybody was really appreciative of

182
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.540
it, which I thought was,
I thought it was wonderful.

183
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.030
But at first I was,
I kind of forgot to

184
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.370
slow it down. And everybody's
like, and everyone's like, yeah,

185
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.510
can you slow it down
a little bit? I was

186
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.480
like, Oh, I forgot to
do that. Didn't I, That

187
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.990
was interesting. They couldn't see
it Right. They couldn't really

188
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.440
understand what, what it was
saying. But the cool thing

189
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.400
is I had my computer
connected to the projector because

190
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.530
a lot of the things
I was showing was a

191
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.800
lot of times when a
screen reader is reading something

192
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.220
that may not be actually
what's showing on, on the

193
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.040
screen to, to the site
of person who's looking at

194
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.480
it. Hence when sighted, hence
when the sighted or helping

195
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.480
the blind, it's often easier
just to disable the screen

196
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.930
reader because it can get
in the sighted person's way.

197
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.890
If the right settings aren't
set to on which a

198
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.210
lot of times we don't
usually turn them on by

199
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.850
default, especially. Well, it depends
like with NBDA I have

200
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.980
it turned on like, does
this thing called mouse tracking,

201
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.090
which essentially means that the,
that is cursor, that it,

202
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:23.210
it uses to visualize the
screen is following the cursor

203
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.090
that we see. Okay. So
let me see if I

204
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.260
understand this correctly from a,
from a sighted person's perspective,

205
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.860
there's basically two focal points
on, on a, on a

206
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.070
computer. There's the there's well,
there's where the mouse is

207
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.790
moving right now. And then
there's the window that has

208
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.910
focus. And then possibly within
that window, the text box

209
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.880
that has focused, or there's
a keyboard focal point and

210
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.310
a mouse focal point. You're
saying that the screen reader

211
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.850
also has a focal point.
Yes. And a lot of

212
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.870
times, like I said, depending
on which setting is enabled,

213
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.950
sometimes the screener just focal
point does not match the

214
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.060
mouse focal points. So therefore
a sighted person, you know,

215
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.610
a blind person saying, Hey,
Oh, can you tell me

216
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.250
what this says? Because for
whatever reason, my screener is

217
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.840
not reading it. You might
get a response. Wait, where

218
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.470
are you? I can't see
it. And that's because the,

219
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.840
and that's because it's not
like the two of them

220
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.710
that they're not following each
other Right now. I've got

221
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.980
Skype in the front, on
my machine and then behind

222
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.430
it. But slightly obscured is
a call burner that I

223
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.090
use to record my shows
you, because you're exploring the

224
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.220
visual tree of the wind.
And when we call the

225
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.980
visual tree, it's like the,
the buttons and the windows

226
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.530
and the tabs you can
wander around and look at

227
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.430
coal burner, even though it's
visually covered the structure's there.

228
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.980
So your screen reader could
be exploring that interface, even

229
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.220
though it's not necessarily visible
to me, it could be.

230
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:59.400
Yep. Ah, interesting Happens. That
happens a lot. When windows

231
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.590
get in your way, like
you're doing something and you're,

232
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.990
you're in the, in the
zone and then something pops

233
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.350
up and takes focus away.
Can it, Does that happen

234
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.550
sometimes? And it can actually
be very annoying, but depending

235
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.940
on how important it is,
I can usually just either,

236
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.280
you know, use all Alta
four to dismiss it. Or

237
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.890
if it's something important, you
know, I'll, I'll acknowledge it

238
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.350
obviously, but it kind of
depends on, you know, what's

239
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.950
going on, but that does
happen. There's a joke amongst

240
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.670
most technical windows users that
you'll be doing something like

241
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.970
in word or notepad, you're
typing some pros. And then

242
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.130
just as your hand is
about to come down to

243
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:40.680
press enter the windows update,
restart thing pops up and

244
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.260
it's too late. It's too
late, right. Your hand is

245
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.320
going down, it's going to
push enter. I assume that

246
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.150
that kind of stuff can
happen to you. Or windows

247
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.010
is like, we're restarting right
now. And you have no

248
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.300
choice Me all the time.
Yeah. And usually I'm like,

249
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.850
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.
And do you see it

250
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.490
coming? Or is it, is
it like this a screen

251
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.530
reader notice? Or what happened?
You just, you just reboot.

252
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.570
And you're like, I don't
know what happened there. No,

253
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.180
it usually, I mean, you
know, it'll, it'll, it'll tell

254
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.700
me, like, it'll usually give
me the option to, you

255
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.240
know, postpone or, you know,
or restart. And depending on

256
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.940
what I'm doing, I usually
leave myself enough time to

257
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.180
like, save my file. And
then, you know, I'm very

258
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.250
careful cause I try, I
try not to be like,

259
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.130
I try not to be,
you know, click happy and

260
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.200
click on the wrong thing.
And then, and then, you

261
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.120
know, lose stuff. But some
occasionally that happens How often,

262
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.430
and I appreciate you doing
this by the way, this

263
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.230
is like, this is like
a Reddit AMA it's like

264
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.360
ask me anything. This is
very fascinating. I think to

265
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.200
me, how often do you
get, how often do you

266
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.650
get stuck where, you know,
the, the, the, the system

267
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.650
is in a state where
there's, and this happens to

268
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.120
all of us. This happens
to the best of us.

269
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.340
I cited or not. I
was in a state yesterday

270
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.970
where there was some in
the front and I don't,

271
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.830
I don't know. I couldn't
quite get to it or

272
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.380
couldn't see it, or was
invisible, but, you know, keyboard

273
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.690
focus was stuck and I
don't know what state the

274
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.240
machines in. And I'm just
no mind, no, no amount

275
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.670
of Elta flooring or all
tabbing is going to get

276
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.170
me out of that. And
I couldn't get the task

277
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.630
manager up. So it was
hard reboot. How often does

278
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.310
that happen? Well, Lilly, since
I installed a bunch of

279
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.340
stuff on this windows seven
laptop, it's been happening to

280
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.410
me every time I click
the wrong thing in the

281
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.020
TA, every time I click
on a certain thing in

282
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.830
the, in the task bar.
Cause what happens is, but

283
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.920
yeah, it does happen like
this morning. For instance, I

284
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.710
went up here to check
email. I essentially had to

285
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.950
hard restart every, you know,
right when I got in

286
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.260
here because all of a
sudden, all I could, the

287
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.040
only feedback I get from
my screen reader was desktop

288
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.130
window. So like that's the
only window I could see,

289
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.890
but like, yeah, I couldn't
get to my task bar.

290
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.040
I couldn't get task manager
up. I couldn't get anything

291
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.950
up. I'm like, I'm like,
you're kidding me. And I

292
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.960
have no idea like, like
what even caused. But yeah,

293
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.020
that, that, that happens to
me quite a bit. Funnily

294
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.840
enough, it didn't happen as
much when I had windows

295
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.080
age. So Do you think
that that's, and this is

296
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.580
just from a user's perspective,
do you think as a

297
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.680
user that this is the
operating system's fault or do

298
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.080
you know, as you obviously
are someone who installs crazy

299
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.330
stuff to try it out,
that you may be installed

300
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.350
some piece of software that's
not blind friendly. Yeah. I

301
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.260
think it has to do
with this one because it

302
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.010
happens particularly when I click
on this, this one icon

303
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.870
in the task bar, which
I need to, I need

304
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.330
to get rid of it
anyway, because it was actually

305
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.790
the wrong tool for the
job when I originally installed

306
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.970
it. But I think so
I think for mainly for

307
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:37.030
me, it's caused by one
particular application that, that when

308
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.000
you like, so for instance,
to get to the task

309
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.360
bar notifications, like I can,
I can hit the extended

310
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.140
insert key and F 11
at the same time and

311
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.040
it'll bring up a list
of those notifications and then

312
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.310
it'll let me press enter
on them to effectively right.

313
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:59.950
Click on them. I can
also, yeah, it's not going

314
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:05.320
to work unless you have
either jaws system access or

315
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.310
when, or I'm sorry. And
NBDA window wise is a

316
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.340
different one. When do I
use this extended insert S

317
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.680
to perform the same thing.
Okay. So you have hot

318
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.470
keys too. Like I can
get down into the, from

319
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.420
a keyboard perspective, I can
get down into the task

320
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.620
bar and the system tray
tab and stuff, but I

321
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.090
don't have a hot key
to get down there and

322
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:27.820
you do No. Yeah, yeah,
we do. That's the one

323
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.730
thing. And also on the
internet, we have hot keys.

324
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.360
Like we can hit H
to navigate between headings or

325
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.160
to navigate between like list
items and, or we can

326
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.550
do extended insert key or
a capsule key F seven

327
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.280
to bring up either a
list of links or a

328
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.610
list of different elements. Like
NBDA and window eyes are

329
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.470
really in that respect where
they have, like, you can

330
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.120
bring up a list of
like all the elements on

331
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.170
the page and then you
can, That's really interesting. What

332
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.360
kind of pages do you
click them? What kind of

333
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.290
pages do you dislike? Like,
we, we hate Buzzfeed right

334
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.930
now because they'll take something
like a list, like, you

335
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.750
know, top 10 things you
need to know about protein.

336
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.240
And then instead of just
putting it in a list,

337
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.540
the page is just filled
with ads and they'll split

338
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.430
those top 10 things across
10 pages. Ugh, good. Golly.

339
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.200
I hate it. When people
do that, like you gotta,

340
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.990
you gotta click all around
there and then, Oh. And

341
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.070
then half the time, the
link isn't labeled properly in

342
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.680
order for the screen reader
to figure it out. So

343
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:36.110
it'll just say like link
or it'll say like, or

344
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:40.850
it'll say like either the
image or even worse as

345
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.890
is the case for the
asp.net content management system, DNN,

346
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:53.150
it will say the base
64 encoding. Oh my God.

347
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.220
And it reads it and
it's like, you gotta be

348
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.800
kidding me. It's so it's
like, you have to know

349
00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.380
which string of numbers am
I supposed to click on.

350
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.320
And hopefully, hopefully the DNN
folks are going to try

351
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.000
to fix that because my
S because I'm actually going

352
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.580
to be creating a website
based off of that pretty

353
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:16.220
soon, hopefully, and yeah, totally
issues aside with it. But

354
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.040
those are the pages that
I can't stand. I don't

355
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.080
essentially what I don't. Oh.
And another thing is I

356
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:27.620
don't like pure JavaScript. That
was my next question. That

357
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.260
was my next question. Do
you like the Gmail sites

358
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.210
and these kinds of single
page application sites that are

359
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:37.490
largely JavaScript drives me crazy,
but that's the future, right?

360
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.490
These single page apps. So
what are we doing wrong

361
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:46.640
with? Those Things are not
being labeled properly. That's the

362
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:52.880
main issue. And also certain
events also there's certain, well,

363
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.760
you guys are lucky because
you don't really have to

364
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.550
worry about it, but it's
these other companies, like I

365
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.420
said, you know, like, like
Google, like, you know, like

366
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.830
DNN, they have issues where
done a nuke, right. Where

367
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:11.720
they have a lot of
stuff on the page, and

368
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.360
then you go to click
on it, but it's not

369
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.100
like it's not labeled where
you can easily get to

370
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.060
it. And another problem. So,
yeah. So like, if you

371
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.670
actually, I can think of
an issue where I, I

372
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.910
actually helped these guys fix
this. You've heard of the

373
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.320
blog engine called blog engine.net,
right? Sure. That's Matt's Christianson's

374
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:39.200
system. He works with us.
I love, I love that

375
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.590
blog. And especially when I
move it well, because my

376
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.620
website used to be using
blogging. And, but the problem

377
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.980
is there was too much
other stuff with it that

378
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.300
I had to get rid
of the whole front. And

379
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.560
besides that whole framework is
dead anyway. But the, but

380
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.010
the blog engine, I had
to have them fix something

381
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.500
because I would go to,
I forget what it was

382
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.100
like. It was a settings
dialogue, like where you could

383
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.240
go to edit, say like
a post that you made.

384
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.700
Like if you realize you
made a mistake, go back

385
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.150
and edit it. Well, I
would use the enter key

386
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.500
as, as a double click,
or I can also simulate

387
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.080
a real double click using
a screen using one of

388
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.480
my screener to commands. Well,
because like for jaws caps

389
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:32.080
lock key, plus the number
eight, or there's also a

390
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.730
way to do it on
the number pad, but I

391
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.650
don't remember what it is.
I'd have to look it

392
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.160
up that would usually simulate
a double click on the,

393
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.120
on the link. Well, with
blog engine that wasn't working

394
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.840
and it was actually determined.
And that, again, that's the

395
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.680
same with DotNetNuke as well.
There, it was actually determined

396
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:56.640
that carelessly implemented JavaScript was
at fault. So how important

397
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.500
is it for us to,
and what should we, as

398
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.930
sighted people do to like,
fix this? Like I know

399
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.420
that I always try to
fill out the alt tags

400
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.340
on my, on my images.
Yes. That's super important. Yes.

401
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.530
That's super important. And you
also have to make sure

402
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.510
that when you're programming, you
know, either websites or frameworks

403
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:21.750
that all of the key
press events are implemented in,

404
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:27.810
that's what actually, that's what
they forgot in blog engine.

405
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.770
They didn't, I think, you
know, you're, you're a done

406
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.020
on framework guy. So, so
remind me if the sacker,

407
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.200
cause I haven't really, I
haven't really picked at coding

408
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.210
in ages. I'd love to
go back to it. But

409
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.000
one of the things that
I learned, I think it

410
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.480
was like, the method is
like on key. Like I

411
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.580
think it's called like on
key press or on key

412
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.500
something yeah. Was on key
down on key up things

413
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.700
like that. Yeah. Right. Those
methods were not being implemented

414
00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.110
in that particular thing. And
they had to fix it.

415
00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.950
Although I don't really understand
how JavaScript comes into asp.net

416
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.410
and what that really had
to do with it. But

417
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.790
whatever it was, it was
definitely, it was JavaScript's fault.

418
00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.410
Which again, doesn't really make
a lot of sense to

419
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.050
me. I think I'm what
I'm hearing you say though.

420
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.320
And I'm putting in the
context of, of, of touch

421
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.860
where I know that I'll
visit a site and I'll

422
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.450
be able to click on
it or I can use

423
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.420
tab and hit enter and
that's the same thing, but

424
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.970
then I might, I might
try using my touchscreen and

425
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.940
touching it and it doesn't
work. And what I'm hearing

426
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.990
you say is that screen
reader input is yet another

427
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.440
way that we need to
be testing. And sometimes the

428
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.620
way the screen reader presses
the button isn't working. Yes.

429
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:45.710
So, so essentially what happens
is on these websites pressing

430
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.770
enter and a double left
click are not considered the

431
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.090
same. Hmm. Pressing enter in
a double click or not

432
00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.340
the same thing. And this
is just likely due to

433
00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.930
just not testing. It sounds
Right. Yes. So people just

434
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.920
not very familiar with it.
Should we hire blind testers

435
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.900
or, I mean, what can
we do? I don't think

436
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.350
just goofing around. Oh my
gosh. Yes. That would be

437
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.430
a fantastic thing to do.
And especially because you have

438
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.960
a lot of applications in
the enterprise world, you know,

439
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.380
I'm sorry to say, but
just, aren't really up to

440
00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:27.280
accessibility part, like for instance,
system center, configuration, you know,

441
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.030
system center, what is it?
2012 or two now? Yeah.

442
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.270
2012. R two is one
of them. And I don't

443
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.750
remember you might've. I think
I mentioned that on Twitter

444
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.860
where there was a blind
guy and somebody actually posted

445
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.550
on a message board, you
know, on behalf of this

446
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:50.110
gentleman and then he linked
to the regular post and

447
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.510
the, to the post on,
I think it was tech

448
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:57.130
net. And essentially this gentlemen
essentially said, you know, quote

449
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.660
unquote, thank you, Microsoft for
making my job impossible. Because

450
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:07.690
system center like 2007 was
really good, but 2012 I've

451
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:14.200
heard is just really, really,
really bad person's perspective. Yes.

452
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.430
Like there's not a lot
of feedback presented by screeners.

453
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.690
In fact, you'll see, I
did a beta it's on

454
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.170
my YouTube channel. I did
a beta of team foundation

455
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:31.030
server. Well, it was team
foundation server 2011 when it

456
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:36.970
was in beta, but, and
there was some huge issues

457
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.580
with that. Like for instance,
I was trying to set

458
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.290
it up just to try
to like to try to

459
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.840
demo it. And when it
happened is a lot of

460
00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.980
the radio buttons, like typically
I'm hearing your computer talking

461
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.500
in the background, what's it
what's going on in my

462
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.510
iPhone. Oh, your iPhone is
talking. So you got a

463
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.420
text message. No, it was
actually, it was a Facebook

464
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.820
alert. That's awesome. I want
to, I want to come

465
00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.470
back to that cause you're
cause you have an iPhone,

466
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.670
which is touchscreen, which is
awesome. Yeah. So yeah, so

467
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.180
essentially what was happening is
I was trying to set

468
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.120
up, you know, TFS, I
think it was on my,

469
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.860
yeah, it was on my
older computer. And for whatever

470
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.560
reason, I would try to
click, you know, check the

471
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.170
various radio buttons and typically,
you know, up and down

472
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.960
arrow and then you can
hit space to select the

473
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.360
different radio buttons. Like if
you want it checked what's

474
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.880
happening is I would use
the down arrow to try

475
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.920
to see, like there was
one radio button that would

476
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.050
read and then I would
use the down arrow to

477
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:36.520
see what the other radio
button was. And then sure

478
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.080
enough, I got thrown down
into an unlabeled edit field.

479
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.290
I didn't know where I
was at. I'm lying. Wow.

480
00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.030
That's Really interesting. And unlabeled
edit field. So I did

481
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.300
this blog post recently about
dark UX patterns. And this

482
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.550
is like, when you go
to like download.com and you

483
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.950
download some utility that you
really need, even though, you

484
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.440
know, you shouldn't be doing
it. And then the next

485
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.330
thing you know, their installation
system has installed toolbars and

486
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.600
spyware, looking at that post
the other day, I put

487
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.520
notes by the way. And
all of the all tags.

488
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.880
I don't know if you
saw them. Yeah. I see

489
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.170
those. And, and, and I
really appreciate that because Yes,

490
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.520
I will. I will leave
you as I'll leave you

491
00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:22.850
a secret message in one
soon for 30 or 40

492
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.860
blind people who visit my
site will be like, Oh,

493
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:29.090
Hanselman. And, and I was
thinking about that. Like, that

494
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.460
must be like, it's frustrating
if, I mean, if my

495
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.200
sighted mom, can't not install
evil toolbars, you could find

496
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.180
yourself in a really nasty
situation. If you missed a

497
00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:43.430
single checkbox, I have I've
done it. Like I installed

498
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.450
something. Oh, it was, it
was a send space download.

499
00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.550
I was trying to download
an MP three file from

500
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.490
this website that I go
to, it's called blind mice

501
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.870
Mart. And they have a
movie vault where they, where

502
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.220
they extract the audio from
descriptive videos and they let

503
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.920
you download them for free.
I mean, I re I

504
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.350
really wish they had like
a paid subscription where you

505
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.810
could get the visuals, but
anyway, that's not really important.

506
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.550
So I went to download
this file and, you know,

507
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.880
sun space, if you don't
check the box, it'll say

508
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.750
all these extra offers. And
then sure enough, I, I

509
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.760
finished downloading the movie and
then sure enough, I turned

510
00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.030
my computer on and I
had all these things popping

511
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.980
up at me. I'm like,
what is this? And then

512
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.770
I was like, and then
I was like, Oh, darn

513
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.370
I didn't uncheck that box.
Did I? And then, and

514
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.540
then you have to go
just like we do and

515
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.540
just dig, dig it out,
right? Yes. Well, I think,

516
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.490
I think I used Malwarebytes
to get most of it

517
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.550
because I was a lazy
button. I didn't feel like

518
00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.670
digging it out myself, what
a mess. And I know

519
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.400
really Let's, let's, let's end
by talking about your, your

520
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.410
iPhone. It's the iPhone, as,
as a nondescript black slate

521
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.920
seems to be like the
least aligned, friendly thing. I

522
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.410
mean, as an ignorant sighted
person, I'm thinking, Oh, she's

523
00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.570
got a Blackberry, you know,
I don't know, I'm an

524
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.120
idiot, but I'm hearing from
everyone that that's just a

525
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.960
fantastic, fantastic device for the,
for the blind. Oh, it's

526
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.650
awesome. And I really wish,
you know, and I, and

527
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.520
I really wish I could
say the same for the

528
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.050
Nokia Lumia, but unfortunately, due
to windows, phone eight, not

529
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.290
having the ability to load
like sooner is like jaws

530
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.230
and stuff. You know, that's
not. So the built in

531
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:25.640
screen reader that is on
this voiceover on the iPhone

532
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.650
is great. Oh, it's wonderful.
It's essentially, it's almost as

533
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:36.380
powerful as like jaws or
one of the, or one

534
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.160
of the windows. Hmm. And
what's great about it. Is

535
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.650
it just because it lets
you see everything? Oh yes.

536
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:48.540
It typically, I mean, occasionally
you get an inaccessible application

537
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.880
and again, you know, the
same rules apply. Like if

538
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.390
the, I mean there may
be accessibility in a certain

539
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.120
framework, but if it's not
brought to the forefront, then

540
00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.490
it's not, it's not going
to be acknowledged. And that's

541
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.580
the problem with a lot
of stuff is it's not

542
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.690
going to be acknowledged. Do
you use the iPhone kind

543
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:11.400
of ha without looking at
it? Oh yes. Well, I

544
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.860
mean, I believe in her,
I always have the display

545
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.970
on because if I, you
know, never had any light

546
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.820
or anything, you know, my
eyes wouldn't be stimulated. So

547
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.370
I a lot, see a
lot of blind people use

548
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.890
the screen curtain and they
turn it off so that

549
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.620
people can't look at their
display and stuff. I don't,

550
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.950
I don't bother with that.
Well, because I mean, number

551
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.580
one, I don't really care
if somebody sees me because

552
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.850
you know, like, like here's
people, You don't usually, I

553
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.650
mean, sighted people don't usually
get close enough to other

554
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.240
side of people to be
creeping around looking at their

555
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.340
phones. I presume that they
don't give that to you

556
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.730
either. No, no. And that's
what I'm saying. Like some

557
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.730
friends of mine are very
picky about that. They think

558
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.880
that sighted people will do
that. And so they use

559
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.580
the screen curtain, but I
mean the screen curtain I'll

560
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.430
use it like to save
battery, but that's more why

561
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.140
I use it. Cause it
does shut the display off

562
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.500
Curtain is a feature of
voiceover. That just basically he

563
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.270
does exactly that it makes
it black and you can't

564
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.300
say it makes it black.
Right. Okay. And then I

565
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.610
understood that there's also haptic
feedback. So you can basically

566
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.220
hold your finger on the
screen and then kind of

567
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.370
move your thumb around and
it'll tell you what you're

568
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.100
looking at as you move
your thoughts. Can you do

569
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.110
that? Would you mind holding
the phone up to your,

570
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.350
to your mic and just
kind of exploring the home

571
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:29.940
screen? Oh, let me get
it six minutes ago. Hold

572
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:36.600
on. Let's unblock my phone
here. Hold on. Stupid iOS

573
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.810
seven thing where it always
asks you, if you want

574
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.930
to trust this computer every
single time. It's crazy. It's

575
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:48.270
plugged into your computer. Yeah.
So we have the calendar

576
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.700
now. Now of course you
can, you can also click

577
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.970
and you can also like,
so if you saw, I'm

578
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.850
gonna, I'm going to double
tap this and hold this

579
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.190
and then you can Moving
calendar, but it went really

580
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:07.950
fast. Oops. Oh shoot. Yeah.
So I was in another,

581
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:17.040
I did that. That yeah.
No it wasn't you. It

582
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.110
was, it was me not
really paying attention to where

583
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.740
my finger was. So that's
essentially how that works. So,

584
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.680
so it'll tell you, like,
if you're dragging things around

585
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.050
to move them, like if
you're making folders, it will

586
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.980
tell you like, you know,
which, which app you're on

587
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:39.620
like that. And then, and
then I can move pages.

588
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.020
It will. So like I
just moved it from page

589
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.570
one to page two and
then you can just swipe

590
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:51.560
up on the, the, the,
the pages toddler thing, and

591
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:58.580
then whoops. No that, Oh,
that's because I'm not in

592
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.890
the right place. So there's,
so there's a bunch of

593
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.030
stuff that I have in
here, a game and or

594
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:09.290
why it's going so fast.
It is. And unfortunately I

595
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.700
cannot remember how to slow.
Well, that's okay. That's okay.

596
00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.410
This is fascinating though. And
I think the thing that

597
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.990
I'm taking away though, is
that it is simply the

598
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.950
will to make this accessible.
That is, that is preventing

599
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:23.590
people from doing it. I
mean, there's just no excuse

600
00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.020
other than just to do
it. And if you put

601
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.910
an application out there, whether
it be a full blown

602
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:31.000
windows app or whether it
be a webpage and you

603
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.240
do nothing, you've got about
a 50 50 chance that

604
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.510
it's going to suck. Exactly.
And may I tell you

605
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.250
that sometimes, you know, I
really wonder, like I upgraded

606
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.190
part of my main reason
for upgrading to windows eight

607
00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.270
and 8.1 and 8.1 did
an interesting thing with my

608
00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.690
screen reduce, but we can,
I can either tell you

609
00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.060
about that some other time,
but I don't know. It

610
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.970
was interesting because I had
said to myself, Oh my

611
00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.950
gosh, you know, I'm going
to have a lot of

612
00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.350
fun. I'm going to get
into this whole, you know,

613
00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.820
modern app type thing. And
now I'm sitting here mincing

614
00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.670
my words instead of like
having a good time and

615
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:13.120
accepting everything as an app,
I'm sitting here, mincing my

616
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.010
words, lecturing, you know, mincing
words, lecturing people on the

617
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.280
difference between app and application,
which I still think there

618
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.620
truly is. Like, I don't
call it for instance, I

619
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:28.320
don't call Microsoft word 2013
an app personally. But then,

620
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.150
but again, that could be,
Yeah, well that that's, that's,

621
00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.890
that's semantic though, but it
is what is it about

622
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:34.930
windows eight? That is a
step back from, from a

623
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:42.880
blind perspective Because the new
modern interface, nobody except for,

624
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.540
you know, except for Microsoft,
the only, the only modern

625
00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:50.350
apps that I can really
use in windows eight are

626
00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.950
the Microsoft ones. Like for
instance, the sky app. Yeah.

627
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:59.710
I absolutely love it. It's
absolutely beautiful Skype. I would

628
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.770
love it if all the
buttons were labeled properly, although

629
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.130
I've heard a rumor that
they actually made that accessible,

630
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.810
Full screen Skype app. Yeah.
Well, well, well from a

631
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.360
sighted perspective, the SkyDrive app
and Skype app, they look

632
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.750
pretty much the same. They
just didn't go that extra

633
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.030
mile. They didn't label, they
didn't label buttons. So you're

634
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.980
sitting on a button with
no idea what it is.

635
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.550
Right. Exactly. Okay. See, this
is, we're going to make

636
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.650
sure that people who are,
who work on those things,

637
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.070
hear this and are appropriately
shamed into fixing it. And

638
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:34.270
the other thing too is,
you know, and the other

639
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:36.970
thing about the, the whole,
the whole modern interface thing

640
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.080
is it seems like there's
not a lot of, like,

641
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.620
it seems like programs can't
be as involved as their,

642
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:48.390
their desktop counterparts. Like for
instance, I don't ever see

643
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:55.380
a modernized version of the
Microsoft SQL server management studio.

644
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.960
Oh. And that's another one
that doesn't work too well

645
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.680
a hundred years, by the
way. I think that, I

646
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.570
think that, that the people
that are making these, the

647
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.340
people that are making these
apps are, are putting them

648
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.040
out without ever, ever putting
it in the hands of

649
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.610
a blind person to even
consider that it might not

650
00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.130
work. And then when I
go to the connect site

651
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.680
to report these issues, half
the time what ends up

652
00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.190
happening is they're like, Oh,
I'm sorry, but I don't

653
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:25.460
really know. We don't know
what you're talking about. Or

654
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.220
I'll never forget when I
tried to report an issue

655
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.970
with the installation of SQL
server, I believe it was.

656
00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.890
And in fact, that's still
an issue. Well, we all

657
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:38.210
think that sucks actually. That's
Yeah. The, the installation of

658
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.460
it. Cause half of it's
not read properly. It's like,

659
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.080
I just use the command
line because it's so much

660
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:46.460
easier. And so, and they're
like, Oh yeah, no, that,

661
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:51.350
that bug was fixed since
2008. I'm like, I'm sorry,

662
00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.580
it's still there. So it's,
you've got your blog. You

663
00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:00.260
said you also had a
YouTube channel on Yes, I,

664
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.650
my YouTube channel is currently
up. My website at the

665
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:08.210
moment is not up at
the moment because it's being

666
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:14.210
rebuilt under what's under DNN,
but what is your YouTube

667
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:23.360
channel? Oh, my YouTube channel
is youtube.com/user/the Chrome Buster. C

668
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.050
H R O M E
B U S T E

669
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.740
R. I will put these
in, I will put all

670
00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.320
of these in the show
notes. I'll that'd be wonderful.

671
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.170
Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, this has
been just a joy. Thank

672
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.570
you so much for, for
sharing all of this with,

673
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.780
with us. I think that
it's, it's a world that

674
00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:46.220
we don't usually see no
pun intended. And as such

675
00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.240
though, we forget that when
people are on the internet

676
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.050
and they, they may be
blind or deaf, or they

677
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.330
may not, they may have,
they have and any number

678
00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.030
of different, the things that
make them unique. And if

679
00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.960
you don't address those, those
things with real basic stuff,

680
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.390
I mean, marking your all
tags, making sure that that

681
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:10.700
anchors are labeled, you're locking
the internet off to them.

682
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.760
Aren't you you're making it.
So they simply can't participate.

683
00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.840
That's very true. Yeah. That's
about a, that's about as

684
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.930
accurate as you can get.
So I, I'm going to

685
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:22.850
continue to think about you
when I write my blog

686
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.800
posts, when I write my
applications and I hope that

687
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.050
other people do and thanks
again for chatting with us

688
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.140
today. Oh, no problem. This
has been another episode of

689
00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:39.290
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week. <inaudible>.
