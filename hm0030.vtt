00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.420
In this episode, Scott talks
with Carl about taming Outlook.

11
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.300
Hi, this is Carl Franklin and
you're listening to Hanselman and

12
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.700
some here once again with
Scott Hanselman. And today we're

13
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.340
talking about outlook specifically taming
outlook, right? Scott? Yeah, we've

14
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.440
talked a little bit about
outlook in the past. When

15
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.100
we talked about getting things
done, right? That's the David Allen.

16
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.760
Company's a technique for managing
your life and all that

17
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.730
kind of crap that comes
in, but more and more,

18
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.030
I'm noticing that if there's
one thing in my life

19
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.820
that causes a great deal
of psychic weight, you know,

20
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820
that sense of things pressing
down on you. It's the

21
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.030
it's when a folder and
outlook turns black and has

22
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.400
a number next to it,
like 5,000 to tell me

23
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.520
that there's all this stuff
sitting there waiting for me

24
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.370
to get done. And that's
your inbox. Yeah, well, yeah,

25
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.560
that's an inbox. Yeah, it's
a problem. I mean a

26
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.320
thousands. I mean, I know,
you know, people like this,

27
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.660
there are guys at work
that have upwards of 10,000

28
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.850
items. They have no folders.
They have just the inbox.

29
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.430
Now I can respect a
guy. Who's got one folder

30
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.250
and uses a search tool.
But if you just have

31
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.440
the inbox and you're pretty
sure that you have a

32
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.660
handle on your life and
you've got 10,000 items there,

33
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.060
you know, how are you
productive? Now? Most of our

34
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.290
listeners are programmers or technical
in some way. So we

35
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.790
all realize that when we
become manual filers, right, just

36
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.250
folks who move stuff around,
you know, those days where

37
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.920
you get to work and
you spend, spend nothing all

38
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.870
day, you know, no time,
all day long, doing anything

39
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.960
but filing stuff. What a
monkey like job that is,

40
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.060
I never do that. You
never do that. You are

41
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.610
you one of the big
folder people. I am. I

42
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.590
use MSN desktop search to
find email. I've completely abandoned

43
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.750
folders in outlook. It's complete
waste of time for me.

44
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.410
You have supplemented it though,
with a search tool. Yes.

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.180
And that puts you in
like the top 1% of

46
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.460
users at that point. Right?
It's so much easier. I

47
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.340
don't understand why everybody doesn't
do that so much easier.

48
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.110
So there's a, there's a
very interesting discussion going on.

49
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.690
And I actually, the guy
who wrote a tool named

50
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.760
speed filer guy named itsy,
and he's got a, an

51
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.140
article called the grand unified
theory of everything search versus

52
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.980
filing versus tagging, right? What
is the best way for

53
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.840
us to manage our lives?
Is it search? Is it

54
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.610
filing? Is it tagging? Is
it a little of all

55
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.030
of that? That's at shrink
stir slash H M, Z.

56
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.940
And he has a tool
which is one of three

57
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.310
tools that I want to
talk about specifically today. Each

58
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.820
of these tools is an
add in to outlook. That

59
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.850
adds functionality to outlook in
some way, in some fundamental

60
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.000
way. That is, that is
different than the way outlook

61
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.600
ordinarily use ordinarily works. These
are all very inexpensive tools.

62
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.230
You know, you're talking about
20 bucks, 30 bucks kind

63
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.290
of, kind of a thing.
I wanna go through each

64
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.320
of those tools. So we'll
start with, with Etsy tool.

65
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.070
So his first tool is
called speed filer. It's from

66
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.500
a company called Clara tattooed,
like clarity and attitude, clarity.

67
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.860
It's shrink stir slash H
M w. Now this, this

68
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.850
tool is, is really interesting
because rather than kind of

69
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.850
getting in your face and
saying, all right, here's how

70
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.430
we're setting up outlook, right?
That kind of announcement. When

71
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.140
you start up outlook, like
here's how it's going to

72
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.800
go down after you've installed
it. It's, it's actually very

73
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.670
kind of passive. It's just
there. When you are about

74
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.300
to send a message or
if you choose to let

75
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.460
it, let it get in
your face. When messages arrive

76
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.520
the, the times that I
really use speed filer, and

77
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.440
this is assuming you do
have a folder structure, right?

78
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.820
Even a basic folder structure.
This adds a dialog box.

79
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.020
As you press send that
says, where do you want

80
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.770
this to go? Right? So
you hit send, and then

81
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.490
a dialog box pops up
with the focus cursor with

82
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.060
the, the eye bar cursor,
right on a, on a

83
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.140
text box. And you just
start typing Allah Quicken, you

84
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.530
know, how you get that
auto complete and type in

85
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.660
the beginnings of the name
or something in the middle

86
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.550
of the name of the
folder you want. And then

87
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.730
you hit enter. So if
you've already go control an

88
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.690
address, address, address Ault S
to send you already do

89
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.420
that. This adds a step
after all, as that pops

90
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.710
up the dialogue and says,
where do you want it

91
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.260
to go? So then your
flow would be new message

92
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.020
type type type alt S
couple of letters of the

93
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.710
folder enter, and then things
just get filed. And then

94
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.230
it keeps in the tool
bar kind of a quick

95
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.440
filer. That is the list
of folders that have you

96
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.560
have most recently filed things
too. So then you can

97
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.830
very, very quickly select items
within your inbox and say,

98
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.920
put these over there. So
it's a complete replacement for

99
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.880
the move to folder or
file and folder functionality built

100
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.630
into outlook. It's goal is
a minimal number of mouse

101
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.570
clicks and minimal number of
keyboard actions. Okay. It files

102
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.000
the outgoing messages as you
send them. And it also

103
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.400
makes it easier for you
to find things within folders.

104
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.940
So rather than kind of
futsing around in the, that

105
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.800
folder bar on the left,
right? Cause that's like the

106
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.290
possible way to get somewhere.
Yeah. You know, the little

107
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.190
hierarchy of trees, whether it's
windows, Explorer, outlook, there's just

108
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.240
no slower way to get
somewhere. It has, it adds

109
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.090
up in the toolbar, a
GoTo folder and then a

110
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.920
text box and you just
start typing the name of

111
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.410
the folder and hit enter.
So if you've got a,

112
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.200
like, I haven't, I'm in
banking. If I there's a

113
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.230
folder called Fred's bank, I
type in fr space enter.

114
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.880
And then I'm at Fred's
bank and it takes me

115
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.480
there. So if you've got
a couple of folders, or

116
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.850
if you have a huge
hunt, I've got like 600

117
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.470
folders from, from historical stuff
in, in my outlook, it

118
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.390
will get you those, get
you to those folders and

119
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.520
get you to file things
into those folders. Very, very,

120
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.610
very quickly. That's an outlook
add in. And it is

121
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.400
a, I think it's 20
bucks. If you buy more

122
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.660
than if you buy, if
you have like a small

123
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.210
company, you buy like five,
it's like 15 bucks. And

124
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.640
once you get up into
buying it for a lot

125
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.760
of people that gets really,
really cheap, Still seems like

126
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.040
more work, keeping things in
folders. When you could just

127
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.250
search for the things that
you want on whatever criteria

128
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.370
you want and see a
list which resembles a folder

129
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.540
full of things. Well, yeah,
that's a good point. So

130
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.600
it depends on how good
you are at searching. Right?

131
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.180
Cause searching itself is, is
an art, right. You know,

132
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.250
do you ever have that
friend? Who's the one who

133
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.500
seems to be able to
find stuff on Google, you

134
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.110
spend hours searching for something
and he knows just the

135
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.050
right thing. That pretty much
that person is may Scott.

136
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.710
Yeah. I'm that person. Yeah.
And for me, I'm that

137
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.920
person, right? You have search
for a fridge for Fu

138
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.670
and not bar, but Somebody
can tell me, I searched

139
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.800
all day on Google and
found nothing and I'll find

140
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.920
it in first two seconds.
Okay. Probably most of our

141
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.220
listeners are those people I
imagine. So there are a

142
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.010
large number of people who
I think still think in

143
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.120
terms of folders and, you
know, with the search tool

144
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.190
combined with a tool like
speed filer, you can still

145
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.260
search for things within a
certain folder or search for

146
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.080
the folder name. So the
folder in that case acts

147
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.170
like a tag, right? Yeah.
Right. It seems like a

148
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:02.260
good intermediary step between folders
and searching. Yeah, definitely. A

149
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.420
couple of other things that
speed filer does, that's pretty

150
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.410
slick is you can do
an alternate send items folder.

151
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.330
So if you're a person
that's got like an exchange

152
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.940
server, but it's very limited
in storage, you might want

153
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.370
to have an alternate folder
for your sent items like

154
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.520
a, like an offline PST
to save space. A lot

155
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.160
of people spend a lot
of time fighting with some

156
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.920
ridiculous limit, like a hundred
megs that their exchange server

157
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.680
has. So they keep a
PST. A speed file is

158
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.750
a really, really easy way
to help them, you know,

159
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.440
provide a bridge between your
exchange server and, and the

160
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.130
oppressive draconian methods that your
it department might have. And

161
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.410
the offline PST file that
you've been forced to start,

162
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.290
start filling. Right. So speaking
of tags and using folders

163
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.870
as tags, there is a
new guy on the block

164
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.080
within the Microsoft outlook add
in kind of world. This

165
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.870
has just released a couple
of what I want to

166
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.430
say a couple of weeks
ago. What is this? This

167
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.480
is the middle of the
week of the 20th. So

168
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.090
about 10, 15 days ago,
this was released. It's called

169
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.340
tag loss. Okay. And this
is really interesting. It integrates

170
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.710
in outlook in a, in
a little bit more obtrusive

171
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.540
way, but it, I wouldn't
even say obtrusive it's it

172
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.810
changes outlook kind of fundamentally
right now it's just for

173
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.020
outlook 2003, but there should
be an outlook 2007 version

174
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.330
out within a couple of
weeks. And this is a,

175
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.710
a content tagger for outlook.
You can see that you

176
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.870
can see this, you actually,
this might be something you

177
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.600
would like, So you put,
so let me guess you

178
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.090
put metadata on the items
and then you can search

179
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.370
on that metadata sort of
like a poor man's when

180
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:39.830
Fs, Well, a poor man's
in that it's inexpensive. And

181
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.350
in that, in that we
don't have any Winterfest. Yeah,

182
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.490
yeah, totally. Yeah. That's a
good point. This is at

183
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.840
shrinks stir slash H M
Y. And this is really,

184
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.920
really interesting. It'll it'll it
adds tag clouds, right. You

185
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.020
know what a tag cloud
is, right. I know what

186
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.900
tags are. What's a tag
cloud. So with tag cloud

187
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.710
is a way of visualizing
tags, such that the tags

188
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.300
that have more underlying things
with that tag, the larger

189
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:14.240
that word becomes. So imagine
a paragraph that says prop

190
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.900
Hansel minutes, dotnet rocks, Microsoft,
Phoebe C-sharp, and you have

191
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.170
a whole lot of things
underneath the C-sharp folder. Then

192
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.510
the word C sharp would
be very large. I see.

193
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.620
So it's a cloud, a
paragraph, a blurt of all

194
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.410
of these different tags with
different colors. You can apply

195
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.500
whatever color you want to
the tag, and then bigger

196
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.310
and smaller tags based on
how much information is behind

197
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.860
that tag. That's a good
visual cue for some instant

198
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.580
feedback. Yeah. Yeah. Adding an
additional dimension it's using both

199
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.950
the color and the size.
That's cool. As a way

200
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:51.110
to express more information. Yeah,
it's cool. So it appears

201
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.980
in outlook just at the
bottom of the, the list

202
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.830
of messages. So you've got
your folders, you got your

203
00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.690
messages and then just at
the bottom, you have like

204
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.680
a docked built in window.
It's it's not very obtrusive

205
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.120
because it can take up
as much space as you

206
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.890
want. And it has a
splitter bar. And then the

207
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.140
tags appear in that. And
as you click on your

208
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.020
messages, you can click on
the tags. And then as

209
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.930
you select a message, the
tags that are currently selected

210
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.570
for that message will appear.
So as you scroll up

211
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.390
and down, it's updating itself,
but it's also active in

212
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.270
that you can tag things
directly from there. What's cool.

213
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.490
Is that in outlook, on
the preview bar, on the

214
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.040
right hand side there, where
you've got your subject and

215
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.930
your name, the tags actually
appear within that. And when

216
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.720
you send an email as,
as a person who uses,

217
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.400
<inaudible> the person who receives
it will get those tags

218
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.700
to he's actually bearing them
somewhere in the metadata of

219
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.760
the underlying message there in
the headers of the mail

220
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.030
message. So even people who
don't have Tagalog, he will

221
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.400
still see some of that
information when the mail gets

222
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.760
sent. Now, it has a
really, really interesting setup process.

223
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.730
That is a, it's a
wizard that lets you say,

224
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.820
look at this folder. And
I will glean information about

225
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.390
it, do some artificial intelligence
and say, wow, there's a

226
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.340
lot of things called DAS
blog here. I think that

227
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.280
DAS blog is a reasonable
tag for this. So next

228
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.680
time I see a message
like this I'll automatically tag

229
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.830
it for you. So the
auto tag feature is really,

230
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.650
really interesting. And it's got
a trigger threshold that you

231
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.850
can ratchet up and ratchet
down. You can select different

232
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.350
algorithms for, for doing that.
You can do auto tagging.

233
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.780
You can do also a
tag bar. So a bar

234
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.970
that appears at the top
of outlook that lets you

235
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.180
select it's a little bit
like flags and it kind

236
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.110
of piggybacks in some ways
on the flags, except you

237
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.960
can change the colors, change
the captions. You can have

238
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.340
the auto tagging. There's also
the notion of a traveling

239
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.010
tag. Do you want to
allow a tag to leave

240
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.020
your system? Like we were
talking about how you can

241
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.060
send a message and the
tag will go along with

242
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.000
it. Alright. You can say,
you can say, well, I,

243
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.930
I, this is a personal
tag. I don't want that

244
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.920
one to go along with
this email message. Public tags.

245
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.700
Yeah. Then you can have
tag actions. And this is

246
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.460
kind of like the rules
stuff that's built into outlook,

247
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.400
except you're saying that if
you combine the notion of

248
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.060
tags with the auto detection,
the kind of the basion

249
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.090
filtering to say, this looks
like a message about DAS

250
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.570
blog. I could then create
a task automatically or send

251
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.670
a mail or create a
meeting or move it to

252
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.550
a folder. Or if, if
it comes in with this

253
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:33.070
tag, unset, this other tag.
Hmm. Right. So, and then

254
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.170
also during the setup process,
it's kind of cool. It'll

255
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.140
actually log into your delicious
account. Remember delicious is the

256
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.950
social online tagging system. And
it will use tags from

257
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.640
delicious. You can actually say,
well, I want to import

258
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.770
tags from other places. You
can pull them in from,

259
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.640
from delicious. You can have
it trained on existing folders.

260
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.310
You can take your outlook
categories and turn them into

261
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.430
tags. And then, then there's
a series of common bundles.

262
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.560
And then this is the
cool part. Okay. So you

263
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.820
can do all that, right.
You can do the quick

264
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.640
tag and the auto tagging,
you can do filtering. So

265
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.590
you can say, just take
this folder. Like you have

266
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.480
a giant folder. You could
say, just show me these

267
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.930
things in the folder with
this filter, but then it

268
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.410
uses windows, desktop search. If
you have it installed as

269
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.700
the underlying engine for these
searches. So there's a, there's

270
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.590
a kind of an advanced
search by tag and then

271
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.440
a slider bar for, for
how, you know, for kind

272
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.070
of threshold with, with an
integrated preview window, all using

273
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.210
windows, desktop search underlying it.
Wow. That is a pretty

274
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.680
interesting, pretty interesting addition. And
I like to use these

275
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.170
altogether now, right now there's
a little bit of a

276
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.490
slowdown. If you have both
speed filer and taglines already

277
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.790
installed, cause they're both listening
for the same event. So

278
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.780
there's a little bit of
a slow down if you

279
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.440
have both of them installed,
but by themselves, both speed

280
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.860
filer, Glossier very, very fast.
So, but definitely worth checking

281
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.150
out. All of these of
course include trial software, but

282
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.820
a tagline for the purposes
of our listeners in this

283
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.540
show have included a 25%
off. Great. So I'll give

284
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.520
you that coupon ID. It's
a little hard to remember.

285
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.830
So we'll also put it
on the website. Okay. But

286
00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:18.520
it is a Zen Zen,
the word Zen (464) 701-5965. And

287
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.020
we're going to put that
up on the website as

288
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.880
well. That's going to be
good until the end of

289
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.030
September. It's $10 off of
the, the tool. So it

290
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.240
takes it down to like
29. Wow. That's great. Thanks

291
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.050
Scott. Yeah, it's pretty. Yeah,
no problem. No problem. Very

292
00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.420
much worth seeing, take a
look at their website. It's

293
00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.360
got a screencast and demos
and things. That's a trickster

294
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.430
slash H M Y and
then outlook 2007. Beta support

295
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.610
is happening right now, kind
of in their internal lab.

296
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.540
And that should be out
very, very soon. So speed

297
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.070
filer, tagline city, another one
that is getting a lot

298
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.550
of press. And I would
say kind of as the,

299
00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:01.000
the media darling is clear
context. I've heard about this.

300
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.500
Yeah. This is the one
that is kind of the

301
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.390
media darling right now. It's
getting a lot of talk

302
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.820
on the blogs. My buddy,
Omar told me about it.

303
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.640
A guy from work named
Dave is his, one of

304
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.740
his buddies is one of
the guys who works on

305
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.940
the team. This is more
than just kind of a

306
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.000
filing method. This is actually
kind of an, an information

307
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.990
management system. They like to
call it. It's different views

308
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:29.050
for outlook. So it's custom
views, custom kind of tags

309
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.290
have their own custom filtering.
So ordinarily, when you go

310
00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.750
into outlook, you've got the
option to like short by

311
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.500
date sort by conversation, things
like that. And you can

312
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.160
sort by flag and sometimes
people will create views. You

313
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.000
know, if you go under
the view menu under arranged

314
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.090
by in outlook right now,
it's like buried. You go

315
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.720
view arranged by current view,
customized current view, and you

316
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.030
can go and define your
own views. No one ever

317
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.450
does this sitting right now
in your outlook. Probably right

318
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.120
now, I think it's in
the advanced toolbar. If you

319
00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.670
right click and outlook in
the toolbar and say advanced,

320
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.400
it's a pulldown it usually
just says messages and it

321
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.140
just sits there and you
can pull it down right

322
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.290
now. And it says messages
with auto preview or show

323
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.370
me the last seven days
in my experience. Very rarely

324
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.490
do people use this. Now
what these guys do is

325
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.460
they basically just take that
views section and just put

326
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:26.320
it on steroids. They add
the notion of context. So

327
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.260
they say, show me a
context sensitive view. They will

328
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.020
determine by looking at your
system, by doing a big

329
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.950
analysis of all of your
mail, what's important and what's

330
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.000
not important. And they will
sort your folders based on

331
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.910
all that context and say
important. Stuff's going to get

332
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.120
turned red and we'll sort
it at the top. So

333
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.700
you won't necessarily see things
by date anymore. You will

334
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.770
really see by order of
importance, then you can apply

335
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.960
topics to things like tags,
like, like categories. And they'll

336
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.440
automatically look at your contacts,
your existing emails, and they'll

337
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.920
figure out what's significant. What's
not. If they notice a

338
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.860
lot of useless email, that's
going to get colored differently

339
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.950
and it's going to short,
farther down, they've got two

340
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.130
versions, they've got a free
personal edition that you can

341
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.890
get. And then they've got
their larger, what they call

342
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.250
IMS pro. This is the
full featured application. The big

343
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:25.470
one, this will work on
office 2000, 2003. This one's

344
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.310
70 bucks, but try the
free trial, the personal edition,

345
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.040
if you don't, if you
don't want to commit to

346
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.590
something so expensive, this is
the most expensive of the

347
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.580
three, but it arguably does
the most stuff, the free

348
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.690
stuff. We'll do the email
prioritization, some topic assignment and

349
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.210
the, the customizable views. When
you get to them, the

350
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.660
pro stuff, that's when you
can start doing task assignment,

351
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:54.030
delegating and differing tasks from
place to place, there's what

352
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.490
they call the action view,
which is I think pretty

353
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.690
interesting. This is like what
the home view wanted to

354
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.340
be an outlook. You know
how an outlook, you can

355
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.160
click at the top of
your, your mailbox and you

356
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.310
get that kind of sad
HTML view that tries to

357
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.580
be a dashboard, right? So
they've got this action view

358
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.940
basically on steroids. I keep
using that as an, as

359
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.580
an example is no other
good way to express that.

360
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.540
So Yeah, you've mentioned that
there's a slow down when

361
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.010
you use tag loss city
and speed filer together. Is

362
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.060
there, is there any issue
in running clear contacts with

363
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.930
tag loss city or with
speed filer or, you know,

364
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.540
is there any need to
run all three? Do they

365
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.960
have similar features? And if
they don't, would you pick

366
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.410
one over all three of
these in terms of, you

367
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.290
know, features today and the
possibility of the other features

368
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.870
in the future? See, that's,
that's a really good question.

369
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.320
That's tough because they kind
of ratchet up. I mean,

370
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.010
you've got speed filer at
about 20 bucks that does,

371
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.190
you know, kind of unobtrusive
quick filing and adding some

372
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.650
toolbars and allows you to
get stuff out of your

373
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.130
inbox quickly. Right? Remember our
initial goal here was to

374
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.950
inbox is stuff that you
need to process, get stuff

375
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.440
out of it. Clear context
does that too. Doesn't it

376
00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.800
Sure it does that, but
it does. It does prioritization

377
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.620
of, of does a different
mix. So it knows, it

378
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.890
knows who's in, who's important.
It looks at an email

379
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.080
and says, well, based on
how often I talked to

380
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.170
this guy, how important I
think this topic is, it

381
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.530
provides a series of scores.
So it's much more kind

382
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.760
of artificial intelligence, right? It
looks at, do I know

383
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.120
this guy? Is it a
no address priority? How, how

384
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.120
in check this out? How
active am I in the

385
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.700
thread? Cause there's a difference
between getting a crap load

386
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.330
of email where I'm not
involved versus one where I'm

387
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.760
talking to people a lot.
That's weird. Does it watch

388
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.230
you? You read them too,
because you know, sometimes you

389
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.920
want to read, but you
don't want to reply. Yeah.

390
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.620
So what it's doing is
it's when it says participation,

391
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.710
it's talking about, am I
someone who is replying to

392
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.830
and deeply involved in an
ongoing thread? Or am I

393
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.740
just someone who's collecting the
information? Well, yeah, it'd be

394
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.680
nice if it knew, if
it timed you as you're

395
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.450
reading, you know, you pull
up an email and read

396
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.940
it. It's a good idea
because you email, you know,

397
00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.230
there's a lot of stuff
that you might read, but

398
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.930
you might never reply to,
but you want to keep

399
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.680
reading it Feed demon as
an unrelated point, feed demon.

400
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.490
My favorite RSS reader actually
keeps track of how, how

401
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.740
often you're looking at different
feeds and keeps a list

402
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.840
of feeds you ignore and
feeds you're really into and

403
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.330
then ranks them. Cool. That
would be really cool to

404
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.430
add something like that to,
to clear context would be

405
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.450
this, this action view that
it adds is basically a

406
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.050
dashboard that says, show me
stuff I need to get

407
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.930
done today. You know, show
me the most urgent stuff.

408
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.440
So if you're into the
whole Stephen Covey urgent versus

409
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.860
important kind of world, or
if you're having trouble with

410
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.670
getting things done system, and
you want to help prioritizing,

411
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.320
like what is the very
next thing I need to

412
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.590
work on? You know, clear
context can answer those kinds

413
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.470
of questions with their algorithms.
What is the next action

414
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:07.200
item? Yeah, exactly. The very
next thing to do now,

415
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.240
clear context is a little
more expensive. They've got their

416
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.840
basic one, but it's the,
the full application. The $70

417
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.510
one is really, really full
featured. And I think tagline

418
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.480
city picks that nice middle
place. And then with the,

419
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.630
with the coupon, for our
listeners at 30 bucks, it

420
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.410
gives you about that nice
middle amount personally, as with

421
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.900
all things I say, try
them each, I would try

422
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.830
them. Not necessarily together. No,
I'd start at the low

423
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.500
end. Start with speed filer,
try it, see if you

424
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.630
like it, do the, do
the one week trial or

425
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.080
whatever, and then move your
way up. The, the chain,

426
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.780
I haven't had too much
trouble with them all installed,

427
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.940
except for the little bit
of slowdown that I've noticed

428
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.820
when I had just speed
filer and Paylocity install. I

429
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.250
believe that this is because
all of these add ins

430
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:55.020
are trying to get information
from outlook simultaneously. Right, right

431
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.590
there. So they're basically fighting.
I hooked those two guys

432
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.510
up together and I'm sure
they'll have it fixed. It's

433
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.850
not, it's not a huge
deal. It's not like it

434
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:07.650
locks up your system or
anything. Okay. Both clear context

435
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.870
and Tagalog also add information
to your contacts. So you

436
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.170
can actually take a contact
and tag them with information.

437
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.480
So when you open up
the contact, you'll see at

438
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.410
the bottom of the contact
form and additional location to

439
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.580
type in tags for a
contact, which, you know, gives

440
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.340
you that little, extra bit
of context that can be

441
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.080
attached to something while clear.
Well, clear context has the

442
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.640
notion of topics. It knows
about ongoing threads that you're

443
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.630
working on. It knows about
it adds a great deal

444
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.180
of views. So when you
go into the clear context

445
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.710
and you say, well, I
want to see everything prioritized

446
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.890
by day. So you could
say, I still care about

447
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.350
the time aspect of things,
but I want to know,

448
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.990
show me the, in the
emails that are prioritized for

449
00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.240
today for tomorrow, et cetera.
Okay. All right. Very good.

450
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.980
Now I know that you
do a lot of work

451
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.100
with getting things done. You've
got a few resources here

452
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.830
that as they relate to
outlook with the GTD system,

453
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.430
Right? So, you know, GTD
by, by David Allen's company.

454
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.650
And if you just searched
for GTD, the first thing

455
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.470
on Google will be David Allen
stuff. He has an official

456
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.770
getting things done add in
that has been made by

457
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.010
a company called net centrics
and you can get it.

458
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.080
You can see it. It's
a trickster slash H M

459
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.250
U. But interestingly, I think
it's the lousiest of the,

460
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.860
of the, the app. Isn't
that ironic it's written in

461
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.970
VB six or something. It
doesn't, they have no interest

462
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.810
really in supporting outlook 2007,
until it's released while the

463
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.290
guys that are working on
Tagalog city, working on speed

464
00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.110
filer and working on clear
conduct, clearly know that they're

465
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.800
the people who are interested
in getting more organized, spending,

466
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.680
less time filing, and more
time coding are going to

467
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.590
be running this beta software.
While I think the average

468
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.450
Joe who's into getting things
done might just be a

469
00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.770
sales person, but there are
other ways to, Is anything

470
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.520
wrong with being a salesperson?
Not that there's anything wrong

471
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.980
with that, but they're not
listening to this show so

472
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.730
we can talk bad about
them. So I don't want

473
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.120
to get an email from
a guy who's a sales

474
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.770
guy. I'm a coder and
a sales guy. Yeah. So

475
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.270
if you want to use
getting things done or the

476
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.110
techniques in getting things done
and just an outlook 2007,

477
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:27.520
without any additional software, Omar
Shaheen has got a great

478
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.120
writeup at shrink stir slash
HMO on using the built

479
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.050
in features, the new, the
new categories and flags in

480
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:40.030
outlook, 2007, Simon guest also
has a writeup at shrinks

481
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.610
slash H M P. And
then I think I mentioned

482
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.710
this once before on our
original getting things done show,

483
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.950
but it's so, it's so
freakishly weird. It's worth mentioning.

484
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.220
Simon actually does most of
his work with getting things

485
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.340
done at a command line.
He created a getting things

486
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:59.380
done specific command line that
basically automates outlook at shrink

487
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.880
stir slash H M V
not something I've quite gotten

488
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.900
into yet, but pretty darn
interesting. He, he maintains all

489
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.320
of his tasks and stuff
at the command line and

490
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.330
he's got, he's got up
at code gallery. You can

491
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.730
check that out. If the,
if you like that kind

492
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.630
of text-based thing, it uses
text coloring. So it kind

493
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.390
of has an ANSI art
vibe to it. And then

494
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.850
Larry O'Brien has got an interesting
thing where he does getting

495
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.900
things done in one note
and one note 12. Yeah.

496
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.140
At strength slash H M
S one note is a

497
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.600
really great application. I wonder
why they don't just take

498
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.960
the notes section of outlook
and merge it with one

499
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.390
note. You know, why do
we have to have these,

500
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.640
these sections of outlook that
just aren't even used like

501
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.530
journal, right. I never used
tasks in outlook. I don't

502
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.640
know why the notes section
exists probably because of a

503
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.360
backward compatibility with old Palm
pilots, maybe. Hmm. But take

504
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.020
a look at that at
shrinker slash HMS. Now one

505
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:02.250
very interesting and slightly odd
time manager is a tool

506
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.740
called Cyrell consistency. S C
I R a L it's

507
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:12.360
shrink stir slash HMR. This
is very, very strange application.

508
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.420
This is not I'm in
the same league as an,

509
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.340
a full on outlook time
manager. This is a gosh,

510
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.570
I don't even how to
explain it. You kind of

511
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.000
have to see it. It
fills a space. They like

512
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.860
to say on their site,
that it fits in that

513
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.480
niche between calendar and to
do list. Basically it is

514
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.980
if you have a series
of repeatable, but not particularly

515
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.460
time sensitive tasks that need
to get done, but they

516
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.070
do need to get done
within a certain range, like

517
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:46.350
mow the lawn. This is
a really interesting grid, a

518
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.290
matrix basically, where you've got
your tasks along the Y

519
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.620
axis. You've got your dates
along the X. And then

520
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.230
as you get closer and
closer to your date that

521
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.820
you need to have something
done. And then as you

522
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.700
start getting overdue, the little
boxes that represent the intersection

523
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.310
between your task and your
date change color, they start

524
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.210
to go green, yellow, red,
and then you click to

525
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.850
indicate that you did that
task on that days. Like

526
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.370
my exercise this day, or
I did vacuuming and then

527
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.310
the colors reset. So then
you can just glance at

528
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.530
this matrix and you can
see whether or not you

529
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:23.430
are getting something done consistently.
Are you working out consistently?

530
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.290
Are you taking out the
trash on a regular basis?

531
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:29.100
Are you backing up your
hard drive? Really, really interesting.

532
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.740
Is this a standalone application
or is this work with

533
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.890
outlook? Nope. It's just a
tiny little application on its

534
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.310
own and it also has
a Mac version. It's a

535
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.700
little applet. That's cool. Yeah.
I suppose it'd be conceivable

536
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.880
to do it in something
like Excel, but it's such

537
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.190
a small little application that
you, you might just download

538
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.280
it and try it. The
really it fits if you

539
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.630
get the right kind of
task, right. Kind of occasionally

540
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:59.100
occurring or regularly occurring, but
not incredibly time sensitive things

541
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.500
that happen. You know, things
that happen over a period

542
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.640
of multiple days, that's a
trickster slash H M are

543
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:08.880
interesting. And just like when
we talked about the getting

544
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.730
things done show, this is
really about making the decision

545
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.520
to change a habit, right.
If you've got some bad

546
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.610
habit and I personally think
that having 10,000 items in

547
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.710
your inbox kind of allows
you habit, unless you've declared

548
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:23.080
that your inbox is also
the folder called storage. Like

549
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.400
you have, for me, I'd
rather have the clean inbox.

550
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.070
I don't mind having one
folder called storage. That's full

551
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.660
of stuff, as long as
I can get to it.

552
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.780
But if you have to
open up a folder sort

553
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.590
by name and then start
painfully scrolling through thousands of

554
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.260
emails to find something, I
think it was here somewhere.

555
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.450
Either get a search tool
or think about changing some

556
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.550
of those bad habits into
good habits. Right. It's just

557
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.120
about the will, isn't it
about making the decision to

558
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.270
change and, you know, try
one of these three tools.

559
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.240
We've got clear context. It
shrinks your slash H M

560
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.110
T we've got speed filer
at shrink stir slash H

561
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.410
M w. And then we've
got tag loss, city shrinks

562
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.180
your slash H M Y.
And then, like I said

563
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:09.040
before today, we've got a
coupon for tagline city, Z

564
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.520
N four six four seven
Oh one five nine, six,

565
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.680
five. That's good. Until the
end of September, I'm going

566
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.930
to put that up on
the blog. And then if

567
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.900
I do hear from the
other companies from speed filer

568
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.300
or from clear context and
get a coupon, I'll post

569
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.550
those on the blog at
the same location that this

570
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.280
show is posted on. So
you hear from those guys.

571
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.820
That's great. Scott, you to
man, I'm trying to meet

572
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.610
a man. Alright. And we'll
see you next week. I'm

573
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:34.390
Hansel minutes.
