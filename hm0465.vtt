8
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.410
One more thing. Let me
tell you about a new

9
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.640
sponsor Regan. If you're wanting
to detect and diagnose errors

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.340
and crashes in your software,
even find problems that you

11
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.030
didn't know existed to improve
your software and Reagan might

12
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.040
be perfect for you. He
had a few lines of

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.860
code your application, and in
minutes, you'll get real time

14
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.440
error reports with all the
information that you need to

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.200
fix bugs fast, you can
even hook it up to

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.910
your team chat, bug tracking
development, workflow tools, Reagan covers

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.530
all major web and mobile
programming languages, including.net, the full

18
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.340
Xamarin stack JavaScript, and many
more. Go check out Reagan

19
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.950
today@reagan.io. I used this myself
on my little startup and

20
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.280
I really, really recommend this
product. It is a great,

21
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:41.850
great product. Check it out.
Ray gun@reagan.io. <inaudible> from hanselminutes.com.

22
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.020
It's Hansel minutes, a weekly
discussion with web developer and

23
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.700
technologist Scott Hanselman. This is
Lawrence Ryan announcing show number four

24
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
69. In this episode, Scott
talks with Ryanne Lewis about

25
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.590
the state of Bitcoin. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

26
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.380
is another episode of Hansel
minutes and we're on with

27
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.860
Rianne Lewis, who is the
co-creator of count my crypto.

28
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.970
And also you have a
group in London, don't you

29
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.740
about cryptography? Ah, yes. Hi
Scott. I'm really, really happy

30
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.880
to be on the show.
The group that I cohost

31
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.490
in London is London women
in Bitcoin. Obviously there's a

32
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.200
gender imbalance in Bitcoin, as
there sometimes tends to be

33
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.500
throughout the tech community. And
my group has just aimed

34
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.160
at making women feel very
welcome within the Bitcoin community

35
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.380
and educating people about this
technology. And you have a

36
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.620
bachelor of science in economics,
and you've always been interested

37
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.630
in financial systems. And then
your day job is as

38
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.060
a software engineer. So you've
got a you're coming at

39
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.080
it from multiple. Yes, that's
right. I mean, if you

40
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.070
like to see it this
way, Bitcoin and the technology

41
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.810
surrounding it, it's a natural
focus for me with a

42
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.860
kind of recreational interest in
economics and also a day

43
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.520
job as an engineer. So
I'm kind of interested in

44
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.760
all aspects of it, as
well as the community focused

45
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.000
aspects. It seems like when
I talked to the technical,

46
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.390
but not crypto technical. So
like, you know, the average

47
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.850
software engineer, like those that
might be listening to this

48
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.760
show right now, they will
just say, well, you know,

49
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.460
Bitcoin is a, it's a
bubble, right? It's all just

50
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.640
nonsense. It's it's it's and
they laugh about it. But

51
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.230
when I speak to them,
I find that they don't

52
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.600
have any Bitcoin. They don't
really understand it at all.

53
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.390
So it seems like something
that's easy on its surface

54
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.600
to poke at, but do
you think that that's unwarranted?

55
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.270
I think that's absolutely true.
I think people within the

56
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.220
tech community, they are obviously
aware of what goes on

57
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.940
with kind of technology to
a greater degree than the

58
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.850
average person in the street.
But, and they're likely to

59
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.700
have heard the word or
to have had heard other

60
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.220
people dismiss it, maybe, but
maybe not thought a lot

61
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.430
about it. I've actually been
quite surprised meeting people, obviously

62
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.300
in my day job and
Bitcoin, whatever, you know, not,

63
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.500
not particularly interested in it.
Everyone's kind of got some

64
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.810
kind of opinion on it,
but it's not necessarily an

65
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.870
informed opinion, but often people
are very interested when you

66
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.440
start talking about it. And
occasionally you do come across

67
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.110
people who actually do know
quite a lot about it,

68
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.930
but just haven't talked about
it at worker. I did

69
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.800
a contract recently where I
was working with one guy

70
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.140
and, you know, we used
to chat and it was

71
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.390
only towards the end of
my contract that it actually

72
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.960
turns out he had his
own cryptocurrency startup. We laughed

73
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.320
about that and we've actually
been in touch since, but

74
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.570
it was just quite funny
cause we'd both kind of,

75
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.270
not really chatted about it
that much. So maybe there

76
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.670
are people doing things who
don't talk about it. Maybe

77
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.520
there are people who know
a little and are dismissive

78
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.230
and then you get the
group of people who may

79
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.930
be mined a little about
it. Mine's a little lost

80
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.600
interest and haven't, don't really
participate in kind of Bitcoin

81
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.510
events or talks or whatever.
Do you think that you

82
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.620
have to be an engineer
to be in cryptocurrency? Absolutely

83
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.620
not. But I do think
you have to have an

84
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.420
interest in the technology. I
think the critical thing for

85
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.410
me is if, if you
think of it in terms

86
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.020
of as fit money, I
E typical country based currencies

87
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.180
like the dollar or the
pound, you don't need to

88
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.120
know anything about economics to
pull out your credit card

89
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.920
or pull out a dollar
or pull out a pound

90
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.290
and spend it in the
same way. You don't need

91
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.070
to know about technology to
use Bitcoin, but I don't

92
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.910
really agree with dumbing down
what it is because handing

93
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.610
somebody a Bitcoin wallets and
saying, or helping them set

94
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.890
it up and saying, now
go out and buy Bitcoin

95
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.550
without explaining the risks, the
technology it's like pulling the

96
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.410
pin out of a hand
grenade and handing it to

97
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:14.330
somebody. If you don't explain
how to operate proper security,

98
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.390
for example, or the fact
that there's nobody to go

99
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.320
to in the case of
you losing your private key

100
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.410
or something like that, I
think it can be very

101
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.050
dangerous to give people the,
the impression that it's kind

102
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.320
of risk-free and that you
can give them like a

103
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.170
nice phone wallets with a
groovy interface and that they

104
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.230
can keep unlimited amounts of
Bitcoin on it. I think

105
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.440
people do need to understand
a little about the technology

106
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.790
behind it. Now, when I
have a, a country backed

107
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.220
currency, a, a standard piece
of currency, I either have

108
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.760
it in my hand or
I have someone hold onto

109
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.710
it for me. And then
it's backed up by, you

110
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.710
know, the gold standard or
whatever. But I don't really

111
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.410
think about losing my money.
I suppose, as a computer

112
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.930
person, I might be, I
should be afraid that some

113
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.000
row in a database somewhere
is going to cost me

114
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.580
money when my credit union
or my, my building society

115
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.790
loses my losing my loses
my money. But I'm always

116
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.450
hearing about cryptography and cryptocurrency
as it relates to losing

117
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.360
this money. Why, why do
I not think about misplacing

118
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.720
dollars? But I think about
misplacing cryptocurrency, I think a

119
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.790
lot of it depends on
where you happen to be

120
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.750
in the world. I mean,
I'm in the United States and

121
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.950
in the UK, we haven't
had recent events where there

122
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.400
have been a run on
the banks, for example. But

123
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.110
in fact, in the UK,
in 2008, there was a

124
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.090
run on one bank, Northern
rock, which was then bought

125
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.840
by another bank and helped
out by the government. But

126
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.740
the government stepped in to
prevent disaster. But in many

127
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.320
ways, people are quite complacent
about other currencies, world currencies,

128
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.840
as it were like the
dollar and the pounds or

129
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.930
the ruble or whatever, but
recent events in Russia have

130
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:10.390
shown that, you know, perhaps
normal in quotes, currencies, aren't

131
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.450
quite as safe as people
think. And it's fascinating that

132
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.510
certainly people I've met there
seems to be in a

133
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.200
greater number of people who
are interested and aware of

134
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.580
Bitcoin from countries where there's
been financial instability, because maybe

135
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.800
they tend to see it
as less of a risk

136
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.090
than perhaps their own currency.
It's all about perception. Really.

137
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.580
It is all about perception.
And of course you, if

138
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.380
you hold Bitcoin, you hold
it yourself. You're not giving

139
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.840
it to somebody else. A
lot of people don't realize

140
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.450
that their money in the
bank is not in fact

141
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.910
their own money. They are
a creditor of the bank,

142
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.720
so that if anything happens
to the bank, it's not

143
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.060
your money that you're retrieving
the bank chooses whether to

144
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.430
pay it back to you.
And of course there are

145
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.450
guarantees I'm not kind of
scaremongering or anything like that.

146
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.750
I never scare monger. I'm
just saying that Bitcoin is

147
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.460
perhaps a more viable alternative
than a lot of people

148
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.480
realize when it comes to
taking responsibility for money. But

149
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.970
of course at the moment
it's a technology that's in

150
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:24.240
its infancy. It's very volatile.
So you obviously wouldn't, I

151
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.380
make sure that I don't
recommend to people who, you

152
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.090
know, Oh, go out and
buy a whole load of

153
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.880
Bitcoin because we've all seen
what happens to the price.

154
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.970
And it would be very
unfair of me to recommend

155
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.110
that people invest large sums
of money in Bitcoin when

156
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:45.570
it could be, well, I
mean, it's a $238 this

157
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.600
morning, and obviously it's been
up at over a thousand

158
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.540
dollars. It's volatiles. So for
me, a lot of the,

159
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.070
a lot of the importance
of Bitcoin is in transacting,

160
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.160
small amounts of money. I
mean, it has its value

161
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.300
as an investment, a place
where you can store money,

162
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.120
but it also has a
huge amount of value as

163
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.660
a transaction tool for smaller
amounts, especially for people who

164
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.510
might not have access to
traditional banks. The, the, the

165
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.760
point that you made just
a few moments ago about,

166
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.370
you know, the bank is
really holding my money, but

167
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.230
I am a credit to
the bank. That was an

168
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.240
interesting reminder. It's one of
those things that I think

169
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.640
we all intellectualize, but we
don't think about a whole

170
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.130
lot. Like if I have
more in the U S

171
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.490
more than $300,000 in the
bank, only 250,000 of that

172
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.510
is guaranteed. And that's guaranteed
simply by the government. So

173
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.030
there's a chain of trust
that goes all the way

174
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.760
up to, you know, do
we trust this country? And

175
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.920
to your point, depending on
the country, you live at

176
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.430
a, you may not trust
that country at all. Where

177
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.860
am I placing my trust?
If I am holding Bitcoin,

178
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.600
where is the, where is
the value? What is the

179
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.700
backing of that, that court?
Well, the, the point about

180
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.260
Bitcoin is that you don't
have to trust anyone because

181
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.850
it's the Bitcoin protocol. It's
well, it's a peer to

182
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.990
peer ledger. So nobody holds
the central ledger that you're

183
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:19.070
dependent on. The ledger is
decentralized and distributed among thousands

184
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:25.640
of notes. So in, in
less technical terms, this just

185
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:31.190
means that because a copy
of the ledger is held

186
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.810
in so many places, if
somebody tries in some way

187
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.880
to gain the system, the
blockchain, which is the underlying

188
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.660
technology that underpins Bitcoin corrects
itself. So for example, when

189
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.230
you send Bitcoin from one
Bitcoin address to another, that

190
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:58.150
requires multiple confirmations before the
transaction is deemed to have

191
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.000
thoroughly occurred. So you're, you're
not dependent on a bank,

192
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.390
on somebody in a bank
saying this money exists, and

193
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.690
I'm going to transfer it
here. You're not dependent on

194
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.070
a bank security systems. For
example, the power of Bitcoin

195
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.280
lies in its network. That's
the strength, the network effect.

196
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.470
Why is it so volatile
though? Why was it a

197
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.420
thousand? And why is it
two 50 now? Is that

198
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.840
this volatility in a currency?
Isn't that typically based on

199
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.450
the trust we put in
the backers of that currency.

200
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.840
So if I feel the
dollar is dropping, then that

201
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.480
means that general trust towards
the U S is less,

202
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.090
what are we not trusting
that is causing Bitcoin to

203
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.470
be so volatile? It's perhaps
not that simple. Although what

204
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.260
you say is, is true.
We've we certainly see it

205
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.560
with different world's currencies, but
it's not the whole picture

206
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:57.210
to one. One issue with
Bitcoin has been that because

207
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.110
the price started just so
low when it was first

208
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.220
mined, there's a fair amount
of concentration in the hands

209
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:10.170
of quite a few people.
And if people, as people,

210
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.680
as us people will understand
the principles of economics are

211
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.240
determined by supply and demand.
So if a whole load

212
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.180
of Bitcoin is suddenly released
onto the market, that will

213
00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.470
cause the value to fall.
And maybe the demands might

214
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.380
not be that, pick it
up. The other thing is

215
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:34.860
that, but coin at the
moment, it's the majority of

216
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.180
the transactions that occur are
trade transactions. So it's people

217
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.900
speculating on the price and
people, and obviously the price

218
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.380
of Bitcoin will rise and
fall more. That there'll be

219
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.900
Wilder swings. If there are
a lot of people speculating

220
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.630
on the price. Whereas if
it was just purely in

221
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.700
demands as a transactional currency,
we'd see less volatility. But

222
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.300
what's very interesting is that
recently we've seen a lot

223
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.200
of large corporations announcing that
they will accept Bitcoin. For

224
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:11.520
example, Microsoft has, and you
know, companies like Virgin PayPal

225
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.510
for some purchases and you
would Dell, Dell's another famous

226
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.690
one. And you just assume
that when a company makes

227
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.080
this kind of announcement, intuitively
you'd think that this would

228
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.870
cause the price to rise.
In fact, we've seen the

229
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.580
reverse, which is counterintuitive, but
all this means is that

230
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:35.730
when say Microsoft decides to
accept coin people, who've got

231
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.100
Bitcoin will get all excited
about it, you know, wow,

232
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.800
that's so cool. I can
buy something with Bitcoin. So

233
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.700
they, they go off, they
buy something and then the

234
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.720
corporation will cash out the
Bitcoin. So for, for dollars.

235
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.620
So that will cause the
price to fall. That's one

236
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.400
theory. But of course the
other thing that you have

237
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.810
to remember is that cryptocurrency,
isn't all about Bitcoin. It's

238
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.330
the major part of the
story, but it's not the

239
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.310
whole story, Which is a,
actually two things that you

240
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.050
brought up there. I want
to get to the, the

241
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.990
other part of the story,
but also the disparity, there

242
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.580
was an article that's rather
a bit old, but it

243
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.130
implied that somewhere around a
thousand people own about half

244
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.440
the Bitcoins. It's a few
years old, this article, but

245
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.370
this idea that the long
tail is really, really long.

246
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.530
You know, a whole lot
of people own a Bitcoin

247
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.790
or two, but the early
adopters have, you know, many,

248
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.190
many, many tens of millions
of dollars to put it

249
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.850
into different terms. That disparity
can be a little bit

250
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.740
concerning. And we have no
way of knowing who those

251
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.600
people are. It could be
you for all we know

252
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.720
who has tens of millions
of dollars in Bitcoin. Is

253
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.910
that a, is that a
feature that, that there's such

254
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:47.050
a wealth disparity in this
new currency? I think it's

255
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.280
an interesting anomaly that over
time we'll probably level out,

256
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.610
but of course the anonymous
nature of the Bitcoin network

257
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.540
means that we will never
know exactly who owns what.

258
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.970
And that of course is
why Satoshi Nakamoto has, has

259
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.430
chosen to be anonymous. Well,
they've probably chosen to be

260
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.910
anonymous for a variety of
reasons, but people would theorize

261
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.890
that. That could be one
of the reasons we will

262
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.300
never know. I want to
take a moment to thank

263
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.380
our sponsors, sync, fusion, sync
fusions, mobile web, and desktop

272
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.750
point about alternate currencies, Bitcoin
is, is the, the, the

273
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.780
name that we, the UN
the uninitiated like myself, you

274
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.890
know, used to refer to,
you know, cryptocurrency generally, just

275
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.260
like you might say, Hoover
for vacuum or Kleenex for

276
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.520
tissue. Bitcoin is becoming another
cryptocurrency general general now, but

277
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.730
there are alternate currencies, right?
They call them alt coins.

278
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:23.650
Yes, that's right. Alternate currencies
and alternate uses for the

279
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.650
blockchain, which I guess we
could chat about a bit

280
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:33.520
later because people sometimes say
that maybe Bitcoin, isn't the

281
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.870
killer app for the blockchain.
It's one application of blockchain

282
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.110
technology, but financial transactions, aren't
the end of the story.

283
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.690
I mean, we can come
to that later, but yes,

284
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.530
there are, I believe there
have now been more than

285
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:54.690
700 different cryptocurrencies, which is
a huge number on count.

286
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.020
My crypto, we carry just
over 500 because I pruned

287
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.110
from time to time to
get rid of some of

288
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:06.780
the kind of non-existent anymore
or pointless coins. But it's

289
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.620
interesting to see how the
whole thing's evolved certainly in

290
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:16.500
the year, since we've been
going it's you get different

291
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.440
types of currencies? The thing
is people in the Bitcoin

292
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.400
community are deeply skeptical as
a whole about the other

293
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.280
old coins, because they say
a lot of energies going

294
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.620
into alts that should probably
be going into Bitcoin and

295
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.190
focusing people on mainstream adoption.
But my view is that

296
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.580
it's kind of like this
amazing kind of melting pot

297
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:44.070
of creativity and experimentation. And
people are able to do

298
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.800
things with different salts points
that they wouldn't be able

299
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.800
to do with Bitcoin because
of where Bitcoin is. There's

300
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.180
a lot of inventive going
on and you have different

301
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.290
coins for different purposes. Like
one of the ones I'm

302
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.380
most interested in is folding
coin, which is actually a

303
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.480
medical research coin where people
in the network are using

304
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.100
their computational power to run
research into Alzheimer's disease, and

305
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.670
then exchange they're rewarded with
tokens for the amount of

306
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.450
effort they put in. So
instead of kind of using

307
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:23.700
up energy, Bitcoin mining, the
computation energy is going towards

308
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.110
something useful. So you have
ideas like that. You have

309
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.900
networks like MaidSafe, which is
basically an infrastructure network with

310
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.890
tokens, as well as all
the kind of community focused

311
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.830
coins. Like I guess almost
as many people have probably

312
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.500
heard of doge coin now,
as they've heard of Bitcoin,

313
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.860
and that's, it's just a
lovely community. They raise a

314
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.500
lot of money for charity.
There's a lot of tipping

315
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.310
that goes on because in
terms of microtransactions, cryptocurrencies are

316
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.360
just awesome for tipping people
and so on. There's a

317
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.030
lot of fun in the
altcoin community. There's a, that

318
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.690
there's a fair amount of
trading and speculation, and there's

319
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.010
genuine kind of economic endeavor
going on. As people push

320
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.100
the boundaries of what's possible.
They're all the anonymous type

321
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.660
coins like dark point black
coin. It's, it's interesting times

322
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.860
for adults. Of course, the
capital value of the adults

323
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.590
is a lot less than
Bitcoin, but in a way

324
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.860
that makes us a much
more risk-free environment for people

325
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.380
to experiment. You don't know
what's going to come out

326
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.350
of it. And also my
view is that if you

327
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.520
look at software and the
principles of iterative developments, I

328
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.160
don't know why we would
assume that Bitcoin, which was

329
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.960
first is the, is going
to always be the best

330
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.860
final product. It's, it's only
surely by people iterating over

331
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.490
these ideas and maybe possibly
coming up with something even

332
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.580
better that we might find
something out there that we

333
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.190
don't know about. The whole
point is everything's evolving so

334
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.950
quickly. We just don't know
what things are going to

335
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.470
look like in a years
time, let alone five or

336
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.390
10. It does bring up
an interesting question though. How

337
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.860
does one version occurrancy, this
is really all new ways

338
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.550
of thinking about, about value.
A D D does versioning

339
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.550
of currency mean it, one
dies and another one rises

340
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:24.270
and then, then we jump
from currency to currency. Well,

341
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.580
it's interesting. It's a, I
mean, for example, people are

342
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:34.980
already talking about Bitcoin 2.0
technology. So I guess, although

343
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.130
that's not, yeah, I guess
that's not really in, in

344
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.650
terms of a new version
of the currency, that's more

345
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:47.130
talking about the companies that
are revolving building probably nonfinancial

346
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:52.320
applications on the blockchain. There's
a new white boy. I

347
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.960
say new, there was a
white paper, came out recently

348
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.950
on the use of site
chains, which is worth the

349
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:04.440
read the w without going
too deeply into the technology

350
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.430
behind site chains. The point
is that people are making

351
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.450
the assumption that because blockchain
technology is so useful for

352
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.080
things other than just financial
transactions, it's going to be

353
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.130
used as a ledger system
for all kinds of things

354
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.400
in the future. And one
issue with this potentially is

355
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:30.510
bloat because you can't just
squeeze an infinite number of

356
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.490
transactions, infinite amounts of data
into the blockchain, even with

357
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:40.320
all the amazingly clever solutions
that Satoshi Nakamoto came up

358
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.880
with, like pruning and so
on. So the idea would

359
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:49.200
be to have kind of
block chain type chains that

360
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.200
run in parallel with the
main chain and then reentered

361
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.600
it at various points to
record kind of edited versions

362
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.760
of what happens in the
site chain so that they

363
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.040
would be attached to the
main blockchain, but they would

364
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.470
function as sort of separate
entities. I think that's a

365
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.930
really interesting thing. And that's
the big debate at the

366
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.850
moment is the value of
side chains against as opposed

367
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.610
to completely different blockchains. So
applying my own ignorance to

368
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:21.090
this, which is where I
can provide value, as you're

369
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.490
explaining this, I'm trying to
find parallels for the things

370
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.950
in my brain that I
do understand. So for example,

371
00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.730
IPV four, we're running out
of IP addresses. So IPV

372
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.560
six comes along. It's a,
you know, and then they

373
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.930
say, we'll never run out,
but of course, surely we

374
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.470
will, at some point with,
with blockchain technology and a

375
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.980
lot of tiny, tiny microtransactions,
are you saying that it

376
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.320
is theoretically possible that we
could really kind of clutter

377
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.160
the ledger and side chains
are a way to get

378
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.770
around that? Yes, that's exactly
it. I mean, I think

379
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:56.590
people, there's, there's a lot
of, kind of unnecessary panic

380
00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:02.150
around the idea of a
blockchain bloat, but I think

381
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.250
because there, there are kind
of ways to get around

382
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:10.780
it. For example, the transactions
that are the blocks that

383
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:16.960
were created way back are
now completely stable. I read

384
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.470
a really good analogy once
talking about blocks and the

385
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:25.000
blockchain has geological layers where
the I, which I think

386
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.640
has a really amazing visual
representation of it, where the

387
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.790
blocks at the bottom that
have had huge, huge numbers

388
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.930
of confirmations are completely static
and staple. The ones above

389
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.190
are still shifting slightly as
their composition changes and more,

390
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.610
more confirmations come in. And
the ones at the top

391
00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:47.680
say when I've just, if
I just send you a

392
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.280
fraction of a Bitcoin, now
that would be a block

393
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.940
that would be changing for
some time. So the idea

394
00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.430
would be the idea is
that the blocks at the

395
00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.180
bottom get trimmed back because
you don't need that layer

396
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.570
of detail. And thus you
can reduce the size of

397
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.240
the blockchain, but with people
talking about using it for

398
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.230
quite trivial things, as well
as kind of legitimate uses,

399
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.680
yes, there has to be
some concern about blockchain, bloats

400
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.960
and side chains are a
way of getting around this.

401
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.260
It also makes me think
of, I was working on

402
00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.960
a project today and I
realized that my get commit

403
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.010
log became quite quite nasty.
So I squashed about 15

404
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.490
commits into a smaller commit
just because it was just,

405
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.550
it was untidy. Yeah. Yeah.
That's, that's, that's a great

406
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.730
analogy. That's a great analogy.
And the technology exists to

407
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:42.340
do that. It's just side
chains, I think are interesting

408
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:47.350
and creative solution for the
types of application that might

409
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.160
be, might use the blockchain
in the future. For example,

410
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.600
people are talking about there's
been, there was an article

411
00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.490
recently in Forbes, a guy
in London came up with

412
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:06.070
the idea of using the
blockchain as an ID ID

413
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.720
verification mechanism, because it's an
immutable ledger. So the idea

414
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.300
of identity on the blockchain
and also smart contracts, there's

415
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.980
a startup called Ethereum who
are doing some really interesting

416
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:27.190
things. The idea of using
the blockchain for contractual transactions

417
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:31.780
rather than financial transactions. It's
and it's surprising. I think

418
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.790
a lot of people I
speak to who think of

419
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.720
that kind of blockchain technologies
as a very fringe thing,

420
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.930
would be quite surprised if
they realize the level of

421
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:46.830
interest among traditional financial. I've
been to events where there

422
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:51.630
have been very senior people
from large retail banks looking

423
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:56.130
at blockchain technology because they
see it as a very

424
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:01.950
resilient low-cost transaction mechanism. It's
certainly not something that is

425
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.880
out there in terms of
being a very, very fringe

426
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.740
thing. I mean, it's, I
think it would be a

427
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.600
shame though, if these technologies
just became co-opted into existing

428
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.390
structures, because one of the
amazing things about, about the

429
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.680
coin and blockchain technology in
general is opening up this

430
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.460
ability to transact among people
who just don't have that

431
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.640
ability at the moment. And
it's no surprise really that

432
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.350
there are so many startups
targeting the developing world because

433
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.340
you have all these people
that it's not profitable for

434
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.520
the banks to deal with.
So they ended up being

435
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:49.560
abandoned and not able to
transact outside their smaller communities,

436
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.600
or they dependence on remittance
companies that charge large fees

437
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.350
or the various mobile phone
networks like in Pasa, in

438
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.590
Kenya, which again, people are
used to using their phones

439
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.750
for transmitting money in many
countries, but they get charged

440
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.780
for it. Whereas the transaction
fees with Bitcoin are incredibly

441
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.530
small. So you'd, you'd have
to see it as a

442
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.950
useful tool for people who
don't have access to traditional

443
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.540
banking. It's interesting, you've mentioned
that a number of times,

444
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.170
and I would think that
as, as software engineers, you

445
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.690
and I are certainly, you
know, in the, you know,

446
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.060
they always say the 1%,
maybe not the 1% per

447
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.600
easily, the 3%, you know,
we are, we are, we

448
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.110
have access, we have knowledge,
we have education, but you

449
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.450
have mentioned a number of
times that Bitcoin, which is

450
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.610
something that I would think
of as only the most

451
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.880
advanced software engineers having understanding
of, and you are saying

452
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:49.070
it is the, the, the
most, the most disadvantaged amongst

453
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.440
us that will benefit the
most from Bitcoin. If we

454
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.010
do this right, I believe
this, I believe this. I

455
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.190
mean, the worst thing of
all possible worlds with Bitcoin's

456
00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:03.140
volatility would be people going
out and encouraging people who

457
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:08.060
didn't have very much money
to invest in, in something

458
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.210
that they didn't understand where
the price could drop. But

459
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.940
I do believe that the
price will stabilize over time.

460
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.780
And I also believe that
for transferring small amounts of

461
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.970
money and the, with the
current wave of phone wallets

462
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.660
and so on, it's just
incredibly easy. I mean, that,

463
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.030
that's, that's, that's the appeal
of it really. You don't,

464
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.910
as we sat right at
the beginning of our chat,

465
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.600
you don't need to be
technical in order to use

466
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.550
Bitcoin in the same way
that you don't need to

467
00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:40.820
be technical in order to
use a credit card, you

468
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.890
can pull out your phone,
wallets, scan a QR code

469
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.180
on someone else's phone, send
the money. It's, it's incredibly

470
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.350
easy. And I use it
myself, just almost without thinking

471
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.380
about it. If, if I
want to buy something from

472
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.530
someone in the States, I'll
always ask if they have

473
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.640
a Bitcoin option, because it's
just really, really easy. So

474
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.010
it's, it's just so much
easier than using PayPal or

475
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.760
a bank or whatever you
get quite kind of lazy

476
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.360
about. You know, if, if
I then have to buy

477
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.970
something online with a credit
card, I'm like what I've

478
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.710
got to type in all
these numbers, I've got to

479
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.740
remember passwords, whatever. I can't
just scan this code and

480
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.310
go, you know, it's, it's
very, very user friendly technology.

481
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.850
One of the things that
I think is interesting that

482
00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:31.290
I kind of want to
close on is that there's

483
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.900
a lot of concern again
from perhaps the uninitiated and

484
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.810
the uneducated. And I am
doing my very best to

485
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.950
learn about this myself is
that the misconception that Bitcoin

486
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:44.970
is completely an anonymous medium
of exchange. Therefore the bad

487
00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.820
guys will do all of
their business with Bitcoin. Like

488
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.950
the terrorists are going to
win and it's because of

489
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.430
Bitcoin. But even though it's
like, if there's a kind

490
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.100
of anonymity, the ledger is
public, is it not? I

491
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.740
mean, it is. Then there
are ways to eventually get

492
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.260
down to the location of
a person. And they actually

493
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:06.300
used the Bitcoin public ledger
during the conviction of Russell

494
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.250
bricks and the silk road.
Absolutely. I mean, people, although

495
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:16.710
you can go to great
lengths to anonymize yourself, there

496
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.910
are much more efficient ways
than Bitcoin to be anonymous.

497
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.460
And I think the media
just loves to seize on

498
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.150
the idea of Bitcoin as
being this kind of thing

499
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.750
that the bad guys use
because it's anonymous in quotes.

500
00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:36.780
Whereas in fact, I think
your average terrorist or criminal

501
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.530
is much more likely to
go and buy something with

502
00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:44.070
dollars because that is a
lot more anonymous than Bitcoin.

503
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.150
I, I just, I just
think it's the hysteria over

504
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:51.750
it is a real shame
because it's clouding the genuine

505
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:57.840
opportunities for good, that is
offered at people, terrorists and

506
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.200
criminals make great headlines. What
else can I say? Yeah,

507
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.240
indeed it does. It seems
like simply taking a whole

508
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.220
lot of money and putting
it in a sack and

509
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.350
maybe wearing gloves when you
use, when you use your

510
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.050
money as a much more
anonymous way to do bad

511
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:15.150
things. Absolutely. It would be
really great to hear you

512
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.780
took this, although I'm a
software engineer and I've got

513
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:22.170
my alt coin of site
I'm, I'm not in any

514
00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.080
way a Bitcoin engineer. It
would be great to hear

515
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.690
you talking to one of
the Bitcoin core developers sometime

516
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.690
because, you know, I must
emphasize I'm an interested lay

517
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:35.040
person, not a Bitcoin scientist
Indeed. And I appreciate you

518
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.590
saying that maybe you could
help make an introduction to

519
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.460
me and we'll have them
on the show sometime. Cool.

520
00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:43.430
Cool, fantastic. Well, I really
appreciate you taking the time

521
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:47.270
Ryanne Lewis. She is a
cryptocurrency trader. She's a co-developer

522
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.750
of the website. Count my
crypto and also hosts co-hosts

523
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.300
the London Bitcoin women. Thanks
so much for chatting with

524
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.720
me today. Thank you so
much for having me. This

525
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.060
has been another episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

526
00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.900
again next week.
