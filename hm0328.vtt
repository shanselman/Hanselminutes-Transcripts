this episode, Scott talks with
John O bacon about the

10
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.910
art of community. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

11
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.710
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'm here at Oz

12
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.410
con in Portland, Oregon. The
O'Reilly open source conference, and

13
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.180
I've got the pleasure of
sitting down with Jono bacon,

14
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.290
who is the community manager
for wound too. And also

15
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.810
the author of the very
lovely art of community book,

16
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.790
which I have in front
of me from O'Reilly as

17
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.710
well. We'll have links to
that. That's a great, that's

18
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.480
a great book. I feel
a little embarrassed too, because

19
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.730
I've got the, the book
here and it's all like

20
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.160
marked up. It's good to
say that with like, it

21
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.300
looks like somebody read it
finally at last well, it's

22
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.040
been, been very well received.
So from one community manager

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.590
to another, that's kind of
a tough word. I mean,

24
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.420
I like community. We all
love that word. Community is

25
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.720
a great word, but then
manager implies, you know, you're

26
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.420
hurting, you're controlling, right? What
is it? Community managers is

27
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.570
manager the right word we
should be using. This has

28
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.400
been, I think, an often
debated topic because I think

29
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.220
some people do perceive that
the word manager means almost

30
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.040
like a controlling entity, but
handler exactly, but I've never

31
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.020
really been somebody who really
gets into these kinds of

32
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.420
semantic debates. I think a
lot of it is really

33
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.430
the intention of the, of
the person who's doing the

34
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.370
work. So if you have
a, you could have a

35
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.690
fantastic person who coordinates and
enthuses and empowers the community

36
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.330
and you could call them
a community manager and you

37
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.210
could have someone who's terrible
and they force and, and

38
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.120
dominate and push people forward
and call them a community

39
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.470
manager as well. I think
it really depends on the

40
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.320
intention. I think if, if
some people, if some people

41
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.470
who, some people feel uncomfortable
by the concept of the

42
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.630
word we manager, I think
it's sometimes reflective of the

43
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.580
fact that they've maybe had
bad managers in the past.

44
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.640
Like for me, the word
manager doesn't necessarily mean controlling.

45
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.520
It just means somebody who
helps to coordinate and, and

46
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.350
move things forward. And that
to me, is that the

47
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.170
primary goal of the community
manager, but different communities work

48
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.350
in different ways. You know,
the, the semantics and sometimes

49
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.000
not right for certain people
in right. For other people.

50
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.430
But I think it's more
important to assess the, the

51
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.190
work that someone's doing as
opposed to the description or

52
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.980
the label. Why does a
community need a manager at

53
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.170
all? Why don't we just
self-organize around our interests? It

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.410
that's another good question. Cause
I think that some communities

55
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.310
do, I mean, you have
different types of governance essentially.

56
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.310
So for example, you have,
you know, some, some communities

57
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.880
are lead-less, you know, and
a good example of that

58
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.540
is KTA in the open
source world. They effectively have

59
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.920
no leader, but they have
a set of people who

60
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.980
are, who are inspirational leaders.
Then you have, of course,

61
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.520
you know, dictators like with
Linux. I mean, let us

62
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.360
evolve is a dictator or
benevolent dictators for life such

63
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.540
as with, with Ubuntu. I
think again, every community is

64
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.430
different, but one of the
things that I've noticed is

65
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.390
that the skills that are
required to help motivate and

66
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.470
empower people are relatively rare,
you know, and, and having

67
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.220
somebody who's in a position
to help herd the cats

68
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.650
in the right direction, essentially,
which is not, you know,

69
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.200
brainwashing people to move in
a particular direction, but helping

70
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.110
to empower people is a
really valuable function. So I

71
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.740
think communities can exist without
community managers or leaders, but

72
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.710
you can often squeeze much
more out of a community

73
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.020
if you do have somebody
who's helping to do that

74
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.030
in the same way that
if you have a great

75
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.720
conventional manager in an engineering
team or elsewhere a great

76
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.670
manager with the trust of
the team, the trust of

77
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.480
the stakeholders can just do
incredible things. Doesn't it seem

78
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.570
like the back and forth
between let's all have at

79
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.520
a merit, we have to
be a meritocracy and we'll

80
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.190
all work together versus let's
have a hierarchy of managers

81
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.890
and moderators and super users,
and then regular people in

82
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.180
Nubes. You've got GitHub, which
is famously announcing, you know,

83
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.160
we, we have no managers,
we have no plan. We

84
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.680
have, we just have awesome
ideas and you pick something

85
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.780
and you just be awesome.
And if you get enough

86
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.780
people that are awesome than
Austin, things will happen. Right.

87
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.130
Right. And then, you know,
even in a community like

88
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.310
yours, you still got, you
know, lieutenants and a bit

89
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.990
of a structure. I wouldn't
say a deep structure, but

90
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.150
there are, there are moderators
and people that if you're

91
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.400
not around, they're making sure
that things are moving forward

92
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.900
as well. Yeah. Even, you
know, when you find groupings,

93
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.510
whether it's a company or
a project or a community,

94
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.980
whatever it might be. And
they say that we don't

95
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.960
have management or leadership, I
think they're lying. Every group

96
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.020
of people has management or
leadership in some capacity. It

97
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.110
just might not necessarily be
as formalized in the same

98
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.330
way that even with my
example earlier on of a

99
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.380
essentially lead-less community like Haiti,
there are leaders in that

100
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.840
community, but there are more
inspirational leaders. You know, there

101
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.320
are people who propose ideas
and those ideas get traction

102
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.940
because of the work that
they've done, which is why

103
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.240
I think meritocracy is the
best way to is to,

104
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.340
to run a community essentially.
But you know, the way

105
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.570
in which we identify our
leaders does vary tremendously. And

106
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.940
one of the things that
we've done in Ubuntu is,

107
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.820
is to, is to try
and scale out our leadership.

108
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.080
So it's reflective of the
scale of the community. So,

109
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.110
you know, back in the
early days, you know, we'd

110
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.090
have a community council and
a technical board and they,

111
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.520
that's all we really needed
in terms of technical and

112
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.760
community policy. But these days
as the communities grow and

113
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.660
we need, we need more
leadership defined. And I think

114
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.480
there is a big difference
between governance and leadership, our

115
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.600
governing bows in Ubuntu, don't
really lead per se. What

116
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.190
they do is they help
to govern and help to

117
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.650
make sure that things are
on track and that the

118
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.860
community's happy and that the
policies are fair representative, but

119
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.590
there's actually very few leaders,
I think in most communities

120
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.050
who actually have that natural
thing in the back of

121
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.660
their heads that help them
to help other people be

122
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.430
successful. And that to me
is the true definition of

123
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.450
leadership is helping other people
to be successful. What does

124
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.610
that mean governance to you?
Because the first time I

125
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.820
ever heard the term governance,
even though I, you know,

126
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.120
the obvious roots in government
and to govern, I mean,

127
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.430
I get that. And I
learned all that in social

128
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.500
studies, but the word governance,
the first time I came

129
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.340
upon that was doing W3C
work and it always meant

130
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.760
endless meetings and the people
who were the most interested

131
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.810
in parsing all the words,
I think there's a lot

132
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.950
of truth to that. I,
one of the things that

133
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.050
concerns me about some approaches
to community management and leadership

134
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.320
is that there is a
tendency to, to suggest that

135
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.830
we need governance and we
need process to be quote

136
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.890
unquote, professional. That we're not
real unless we have these

137
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.280
P these pieces. I'm very,
I'm very much of an

138
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.310
anti bureaucracy kind of person.
I don't like paperwork. I

139
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.950
don't like unnecessary processes and
all the rest of it.

140
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.180
And so I think you
should only apply it when

141
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.390
it's absolutely necessary. To me,
the best kind of governance

142
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.960
that you have is pretty,
is pretty thin. And it's

143
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.140
often hidden to most people.
And I see it primarily

144
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.830
as the value of that
governance is really one part

145
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.780
escalation path because it gives
the community a means in

146
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.960
which they can, in which
they can take concerns with

147
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.850
a wider structure of the
community, particularly if there's a

148
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.590
commercial stakeholder to an objective
base. But secondly, it's really

149
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.240
to, to keep things honest
and by and large, most

150
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.930
of the governance that I've
seen, the, the meetings are

151
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.070
often pretty straightforward. It's almost
wrote and, and, and the

152
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.390
way that people go through
and it's like, we have

153
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.340
a set of topics. We
talk it through, we maybe

154
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.230
do a vote or whatever,
whatever it means. It's actually

155
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.040
relatively straightforward and simple and
usually fairly, fairly efficient and

156
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.040
effective. I suspect in government,
it's not quite the same.

157
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.550
I don't know, but, but
I think a focus on

158
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.560
that simplicity is, is really
important. The problem with what

159
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.930
governance is, is really loaded.
And it, it, it, it

160
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.430
conjures up ideas of reams
and reams of manuals and

161
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.590
codifications and all that kind
of stuff. And to me,

162
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.250
that's an enemy of community,
any unnecessary paperwork and fluff

163
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.920
like that is, is, is
going to do harm. How

164
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.240
much do you get involved
with that? I mean, how

165
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.670
much, how much would a
community manager be involved? Like,

166
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.450
you know, I'm kind of
part of the asp.net community.

167
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.360
And now that we are
open source, should I be

168
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.270
poking around and check ins
and media, you know, moderating

169
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.050
and mediating conflicts between the
T team and Redmond and

170
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.940
people who are trying to
get their patches submitted, or

171
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.570
I be an advocate for
Microsoft, or should I be

172
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.010
an advocate for The community?
I did some quite a

173
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.770
bit of thinking about this
some years ago, Mark shuttle,

174
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:08.840
with the founder of Ubuntu,
he, he, he didn't ask

175
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.730
me to join the UNT
community council, but he basically

176
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.680
said, you know, if you
were interested in joining it,

177
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.080
I, I, I would definitely
support that motion. He basically

178
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.460
said, you know, if you
want to join it, you

179
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.460
know, you've got my vote.
And I think that if

180
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.380
I applied to be in
the community council, I'd probably

181
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.620
get on it. But I
deliberately, I did some thinking

182
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.910
about this and it kind
of shook me up for

183
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.070
a few days because I
was thinking a one on

184
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.530
one hand, it's a great
service to the UNT community.

185
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.290
And my goal here is
to serve my community. But

186
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.050
on the other hand, I
think there's a valuable function

187
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.880
in me not being on
that board for two reasons.

188
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.820
One is selfish and lazy,
which is it's more work,

189
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.790
boring meetings. And, and I'm
not really into like those

190
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.130
kinds of alone meetings. But
the second thing more importantly,

191
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.190
is if people have reservations
about something to do with

192
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.500
the community council or peop
or members of the community

193
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.150
council, they will often come
to me. So I kind

194
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.750
of float in between all
of these governance bodies. And

195
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.180
I think that provides a
useful function. Sometimes I'll go

196
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.940
into meetings and if there's
conflicts, I'll go in there

197
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.940
and I'll represent a third
party almost, but a third

198
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.850
party that's seen as leadership
in the community. So my

199
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.700
inclination is if you're in
a more formalized position, like

200
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.670
a community management position in
a community, I think it's

201
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.010
healthy not to be in
the governance. The other thing

202
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.780
is I'd prefer that seat
that I will be on

203
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.970
to be just open to
another community member. He's probably

204
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.110
going to do a better
job of it than I

205
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.050
would in here. Right. But
you do like me, you

206
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.970
do draw a paycheck, right?
I mean, you are an

207
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.330
employee, you're not a contractor.
That's right. Right. So you

208
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.680
are an employee of the
Ubuntu of canonical of canonical.

209
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.340
Yep. Okay. And I'm an
employee of Microsoft, and I

210
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.050
assume that the same thing
happens to you. That happens

211
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.290
to me, which is you
say something publicly, your blog

212
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.590
or Twitter or whatever that
is genuinely and truly in

213
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.590
your heart of hearts, your
opinion. Yes. And someone takes

214
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.790
it as, Oh yeah. He's,
he's on the corporate goal.

215
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.700
He's throwing the, the, the
corporate line out there. Yeah.

216
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.060
Yeah. Officially I'm not allowed
to have opinions on effectively

217
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.580
anything, you know what I
mean? Like, you know, I've

218
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.100
got an iPhone, I use
Google plus I'm not allowed

219
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.050
to have opinions of any
of that stuff. If I

220
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.230
say anything about PHP, everyone's
going to clearly say that

221
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.440
I value my job over
my right. And I'm always

222
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.660
saying to myself, you know,
one of these days, I'm

223
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.080
just going to quit just
to make a point that

224
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.120
I am really truly unbiased.
Right. I mean, are you

225
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.200
unbiased? Can you be unbiased?
I think so. When I

226
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.320
joined a canonical, six years
ago, I wrote this blog

227
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.980
entry called on trust. And
it was essentially a declaration

228
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.770
that I was making to
the community, essentially saying that

229
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.830
I see myself as in
a fairly unique position where

230
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.210
I see my, I think
some people see my responsibility

231
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.710
is to keep canonical honest.
I've, I've heard a bunch

232
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.290
of people say this, but
I think I wants abilities

233
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.860
to also keep the community
honest as well. The relationship

234
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.450
people often just, you know,
distinguished between, you know, this

235
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.370
person either works for canonical
or they're a member of

236
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.470
the community. And that kind
of rubs me the wrong

237
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.570
way. You can't be both.
Right. Because, well, the thing

238
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.970
is in my mind is
that you're a community member.

239
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.740
You might be working for
a company that pays you

240
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.610
to work on community related
content like Ubuntu, but you're

241
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.230
still a part of the
community canonical or a member

242
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.080
of the community, as much
as anybody else. Of course,

243
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.000
we have a lot more
influence in many ways because

244
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.060
of the, the historical nature
of the investment in Ubuntu.

245
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.630
So it doesn't surprise me
that some people kind of,

246
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.470
some people will, will, will
sometimes think that I'm maybe

247
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.410
spinning a line. But I
think a lot of that

248
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.420
is, is, is building that
trust in the community. And

249
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.130
a lot of that I
think is about showing that

250
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.310
you are an individual. And
one thing I've made very,

251
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.940
very clear to, to our
community and, you know, people

252
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.190
economical, nervous as well, is
that if I ever felt

253
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.670
like canonical was going in
the wrong direction, that we

254
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.860
were compromising on the values
of Ubuntu that we said,

255
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.800
I'll be gone. I consider
maintaining my values and my

256
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.770
integrity more important than maintaining
that paycheck that's coming in.

257
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.390
Cause I know I can
leave canonical and get another

258
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.430
job. I'll just do something
myself. If the worst comes

259
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.040
to the worst. Right. But
I consider my integrity to

260
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.150
be the number one thing.
But, but the good thing

261
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.220
about canonical is that, and
again, this probably sounds like

262
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.800
a line to some people
is that canonical has never

263
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.110
put me in a position
where I have to challenge

264
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.010
my integrity because genuinely from
the top down of the

265
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:32.790
company from Mark Shuttleworth and
Jane, the, the values of

266
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.720
Ubuntu have been protected like
very strongly from day one.

267
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.030
And the challenges that sometimes
people don't see that because

268
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.980
the company's grown and all
the rest of it. Right.

269
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.780
But I think defining that
trust is critical, critical for

270
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.090
community managers. And I'll never
forget the very first ability

271
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:54.180
developer summit that I attended
in 2006, I gave my

272
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.580
first presentation in front of
the community and I came

273
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.000
out of left field. I
wasn't really an active contributing

274
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.140
member of Ubuntu. I wrote
a book about it with

275
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.750
some other people. And I
did my first presentation where

276
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:08.160
a death meditation, and the
reason why I did that

277
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.110
was because I was wanting
to make it clear that

278
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.360
I am my own person
as well. I, you know,

279
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.510
I'm people know that I
listen to music. I listen

280
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.580
to heavy music and, you
know, I have a stupid

281
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.740
bed and all the rest
of it, and that's not

282
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.520
changing and spending some time
with the community to try

283
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.610
and, you know, define that,
you know, I'm somebody who

284
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.850
you can trust. And I
will, I will be held

285
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.440
accountable for my own actions
and I will hold the

286
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.870
canonical accountable for their actions
if they step in the

287
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.720
wrong direction. But also I
think it's important to hold

288
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.150
your community accountable. Cause it's
not like it's a one

289
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.050
way relationship. Sometimes community members
can be really unrealistic and

290
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.440
disrespectful towards, towards companies. I'm
sure you've seen this within

291
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.720
your own world where people
are critical in ways that

292
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.970
they shouldn't be, there's an
anti company culture in a

293
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.930
lot of open source. Right.
And I think it's important

294
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.150
to not only confront companies
when they're being reasonable to,

295
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.600
but to confront communities as
well. One of the things

296
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.630
that I'm feeling the most
helpless about is that my

297
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:06.550
organization is like, it's an
onion, right? So there's like,

298
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.130
there's the 15 folks that
I work with on a

299
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.980
regular basis, like work on
asp.net. And there's like the

300
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.140
hundred that work on the
parts of the cloud that

301
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.500
I'm interested in the 600
that are around that. And

302
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.890
that those 600 people are
kind of like my tribe,

303
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.040
right? It's a medium sized
company. And if you look

304
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.160
back at the last 20
years of my career, I've

305
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.950
worked for companies of sizes
ranging from a hundred to

306
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.400
600 people. It's a very
comfortable place, but Microsoft is

307
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.960
80,000 people and they'll do
stuff that has nothing to

308
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.570
do with anything that I
have. You know what I'm

309
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.200
saying? And then I was
like, Oh man, your stuff

310
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.110
sucks. You know, there was
some stupid sexist thing that

311
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.750
happened in Norway a couple
of weeks ago. Right. And

312
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:54.820
it was like one rogue
Norwegian marketing guy makes everyone

313
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.220
look bad right now that
canonical is getting bigger and

314
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.100
bigger. Aren't there things that
they could potentially do that

315
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.190
don't really affect you, but
it could make you look

316
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.040
bad. And then you have
to say, well, this I'm

317
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.040
not going to quit just
because, you know, windows does

318
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.520
something bad. Cause I don't
work on windows. Right. To

319
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.170
me, clinical is going to
spin out in lots of

320
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.910
different and has done. I
mean, you know, when I

321
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.660
joined, we, there was about
45 of us. I think

322
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.640
it was, there was a
nice size, you know, there

323
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.370
wasn't many of us and
now we're over 550 and

324
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.980
wow. So that's right about
the size where you just

325
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.280
can't know everybody. Yeah, definitely.
And that's, that's been, that's

326
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.470
been unsettling as time's gone
on because I used to

327
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.900
know everyone in the company,
but I mean is diversifying

328
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.910
and going off in different
ways. And of course, you

329
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.490
know, nothing's ever perfect. I
mean, there have been decisions

330
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.440
made in the company that
I haven't been particularly supportive,

331
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.420
but usually when I'm not
supportive of those decisions, it's,

332
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.900
it's not because I feel
like it's questioning our values

333
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.090
as a company and our
values with, in our relationship

334
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.640
with the balloons here, to
me, you know, there's been

335
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.410
some technical decisions that would
be made that I just

336
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.520
thought that's just stupid. I
mean, it's just stupid and

337
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.540
I'd never go out there
and support that in terms

338
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.250
of saying, yeah, this is
the, this is a brilliant

339
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.250
idea. I wouldn't lie a
lie about it by any

340
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.080
stretch. This is where you're
making the point that you're

341
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.530
not a press release. Right?
No, exactly. But I'm also

342
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.680
conscious of the fact that,
you know, just because there's

343
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.750
a mentality in some people
that if they don't like

344
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.670
something that they have to
throw it under the bus

345
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.740
and if they do like
something, they have to, you

346
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.040
know, draw it in lights.
They're very extreme personality. And

347
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.070
my view is I will
always try and strive to

348
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.440
maintain a level of professionalism
around things that I don't

349
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.410
support. So I'll be supportive
primarily in trying to solve

350
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.180
that problem. And if I
like something, then it's just

351
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.790
the way my personality is.
If I like stuff, I'll

352
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.280
just go on about it
to people until people say

353
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.310
shut up, I care about
what you can write. Yeah.

354
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.560
I think we're similar in
that respect. Exactly. And it's

355
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.280
so essentially what I'm saying
is I would never go

356
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.010
out there and, and an
advocate for something that I

357
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.020
didn't agree with, but what
I won't do is I

358
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.270
won't throw it under the
bus as well, and clinical

359
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.610
is going to diversify. But
if the, if, if I

360
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.610
felt like my values in
terms of the project or

361
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.640
the values of Ubuntu is
compromised, that's where I would

362
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.080
find I would become unstuck.
But there was, I had

363
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.570
a session at the community
leadership summit this weekend about

364
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.110
the structural integrity of a
community and the importance of

365
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.410
defining that. And just a
recent experience. I've been thinking

366
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.350
about this a lot recently.
And I think everyone judges

367
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.080
their communities on the structural
integrity, the people and the

368
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.290
mission and the ethos and
what has kept me economical.

369
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.570
And what's kept me excited
about Bluetooth is that I

370
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.260
feel like in all these
years, the structural integrity of

371
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.170
the project hasn't been compromised.
I trust Marshall with, I

372
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.720
trust our CEO. I trust
my boss. I trust my

373
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.930
team. I trust the community.
So that gives me the

374
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.650
confidence that we can, we
can essentially traverse over all

375
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.290
obstacles because the structural integrity
is sound. If I felt

376
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.230
like Mark, as an example
was taken us in the

377
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.980
wrong direction was, was going
against our values. Then I'd

378
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.110
feel like the structural integrity
was compromised. And I feel

379
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.390
like we couldn't solve those
problems kind of the way

380
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.720
I did 10 minutes Really
interesting. And you've mentioned Mark

381
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.870
a number of times, because
I think that I have

382
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.210
noticed this in community managers
that I've spoken to and

383
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.230
people like myself as well,
where for me, Scott, Guthrie's

384
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.440
got goo, is this the
guy that runs Azure, I've

385
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.380
worked for him effectively in
three different orgs as we've

386
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.480
moved around. And each time
he moves, I ended up

387
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.930
moving as well. Right. Because
you know, and it's just

388
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.420
uncomfortable a bit of like,
you know, he's my friend,

389
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.590
he's my boss, but I
also follow him to the

390
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.950
ends of the earth. Right.
And we always, we always

391
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.470
joke internally about, we serve
at the pleasure of the

392
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:45.230
goo when, when, when, when
Azure, our cloud came out

393
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.080
originally, I was silent about
it because I didn't agree.

394
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.840
Right. I didn't write any
skating blog posts. I didn't

395
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.000
go out and be controversial.
I simply said nothing, because

396
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.280
if you can't say anything
nice, you just don't say

397
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.320
anything. Right. Right. So I
think that we share that.

398
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.010
Right. And then if it
all came down to trust

399
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.510
in his technical vision right.
In his integrity and well,

400
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.480
I don't think Microsoft is
the kind of evil we

401
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.030
may have been in the
nineties. I know for a

402
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.390
fact, because I know Scott
that he's not evil, so

403
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:15.860
I can like look at
the org chart and I

404
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.350
can say, okay, from here
down, I am totally 100%

405
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.100
confident that they trust in
the integrity of the community.

406
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.180
I know it has value.
Yeah, exactly. Cool. That's yeah.

407
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.810
It's, it's very, very similar
for me as well. So

408
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.490
I, you know, I've known
Mark Shuttleworth for years now

409
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.950
and, and he's a friend.
I consider him to be

410
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:38.120
a friend and he's obviously
a colleague and a big

411
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.980
chunk of this is that
I, I trust him as

412
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.010
a human being. So it's
very similar kind of relationship

413
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.710
in the sense of don't
get me wrong. He can

414
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.150
be difficult and he can
be, it can be obnoxious

415
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.770
at times and it can
be a pain to work

416
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.890
with. But in, in, in
all honesty, those cases have

417
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.560
been very rare and I'm
sure that I've been difficult

418
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.120
and obnoxious and a pain
to work with just as

419
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.810
much. Yeah. Isn't it, the
thing though with brilliant people

420
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.810
is that they're, they're obnoxious
and they're frustrating and they

421
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.450
insist, and then months later
you're like, God, they were

422
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.060
right as well. Yeah. You
think they're always right? Yeah.

423
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.630
That's the thing. Yeah. But
the thing that, th the

424
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.930
thing that I wouldn't say
upsets me, that that frustrates

425
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.910
me at times is, you
know, Mark's a very visible

426
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.680
person. So he everyone's got
an opinion about him in,

427
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.680
in their source world. And
some people, I think their

428
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.160
opinions are unfair because as
the company's grown and as

429
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.580
he's, you know, busy himself
in grown Ubuntu and grown

430
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.150
canonical, his visibility is, has
dropped off a little bit

431
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.670
in terms of the community.
He still actively attends community

432
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.950
council meetings and he responds
to email and stuff like

433
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.200
that. But I think some
people would perceive that as

434
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.360
he doesn't really care about
the ethos of the community,

435
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.970
as much as they used
to See in the, the

436
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.300
parallels are uncanny, the same
thing happened, Scott gurus disappeared

437
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.320
while he's busy being manager.
Yeah. And that's one of

438
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.180
the thing that I've learned
about community management is that

439
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.450
if you don't have that
visibility, as much than people

440
00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.970
perceive the fact that you're
not doing anything and I've

441
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.590
had to wrestle with over
the years at times when

442
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.470
I've had a busy release
cycle focused on canonical stuff

443
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.120
at a little bit more,
cause we've been growing and

444
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.930
trying to onboard people. But
the thing that I see

445
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.880
sometimes internally that wouldn't be
appropriate to talk about publicly

446
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.470
is, I mean, I've seen
Mark like chastise a manager

447
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.290
in front of a group
of people because that manager

448
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.820
is questioned as suggested that
we may maybe compromise on

449
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.730
the, on the ethos of
Ubuntu. You know, that Michael

450
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.890
said, that's not why I
started this. I started this

451
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.080
because I have a clear
vision about free software and,

452
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.860
and delivering a strong, free
software based platform. And I

453
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:43.500
find those situations reassuring because
of course, you know, I

454
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.690
was, I was kind of
expecting like many people that

455
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.810
at some point it'll change,
it'll get bored and move

456
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.630
on, Expect that there's the
public face and an internally

457
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.020
there's some little face of
evil that will show itself.

458
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.900
And then when you're talking
about in internal meetings yep.

459
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.000
Would that no one would
ever hear about no one

460
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.850
would ever talk about the
value is Still there. Well,

461
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.730
that's the thing. I mean,
I saw this quite recently,

462
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.530
actually I was in Vienna
for a set of meetings

463
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:11.160
and, and Mark was, you
know, I mean, he wasn't

464
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.130
rude or disrespectful, but he
was, he has this look

465
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.430
of I'm being deadly serious.
I'm sure it's the same

466
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.610
with, with, with Scott Guthrie is
just like, I'm being deadly

467
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.760
serious. Right. This is a
non negotiable topic. Yeah. We

468
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.610
are going to maintain the
values. And so, you know,

469
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.380
people don't see that all
the time from it. They

470
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.620
see the charismatic guy on
the stage talking about cadence

471
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.030
and quality and all this
kind of stuff. They don't

472
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.710
necessarily see him talking about
that. Cause I think from

473
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.510
his perspective, it's just like,
well, that's just the way

474
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.930
it is. That's presumed, it's
electricity and it's water. It's

475
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.080
always going to be there.
But you know, it's sometimes

476
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.560
difficult because you know, when
I talk very positively Mark,

477
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.090
I know that some people
are thinking, Oh, he's just

478
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.860
saying that. Cause he just
wants to impress his boss.

479
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.420
It's like, I have absolutely
no qualms and tell him,

480
00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.550
Mark, Shuttleworth what I think
about anything because he's got,

481
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.650
cause you know, I, you
know, I know that he

482
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.110
will, he won't find me
because I disagree with him.

483
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.010
Well, and that, that brings
up a little question about,

484
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.590
we talked about the, the
term community manager. What do

485
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.810
you think about the word
advocate? Because sometimes I feel

486
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.570
like most of the work
that I'm doing is making

487
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:15.280
sure that the little guy
isn't, isn't forgotten, I know

488
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.260
Scott's plugged in, but he
counts on me to be

489
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.780
more plugged in. Right. I
assume the same thing is

490
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.040
with you and Mark. I
mean, he can go to

491
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.530
you and say, what's the
word on the street? And

492
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.810
you really know that. Yeah,
he does that a lot.

493
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.750
I mean, the thing is
The thing that I like

494
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.220
about him is that he
he's very, I've never really

495
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.310
been a big fan of
people who are not transparent

496
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.280
in their intentions or the
thinking. There's certain people who

497
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.060
I've met in the past.
And some of these people

498
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.560
I've worked with who, when
you're speaking to them, you

499
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.800
can see kind of that
they're holding their cards close

500
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.160
to their chest. You don't
have that with Mark. Shuttleworth

501
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.300
certainly I haven't experienced that
internally. He is what he

502
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.220
is. And he'll tell you
what he's thinking. And he

503
00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.420
will tell you if he's
happy, he'll tell if he's

504
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.000
not happy when he's happy,
his eyes light up like

505
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.950
a five year old kid
on Christmas morning. That's one

506
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.570
of the, that's one of
the most motivated elements of

507
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.940
it. If he's not happy,
you will hear about it

508
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.830
from, you know, 40 feet
above you. But he does

509
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.200
look too. He's got that
kind of, and I'm sure

510
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.700
this is not unique to
him and show this is

511
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.500
the same with many founders,
but he basically, he holds

512
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.460
loyalty very, very strongly. So
if he trusts you and

513
00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.160
you demonstrate trust, you're doing
good stuff. Not necessarily talking

514
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.990
or being academic about stuff.
If you trust that you're

515
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.260
doing good work. You won't,
you won't hear from him

516
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.360
all that often, but he'll
check in and say, so

517
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.250
how are things going? And
what do you think about

518
00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.930
this? And I'll trust your
judgment about it. You wouldn't

519
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.900
necessarily agree with you, but
it will trust your judgment.

520
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.140
And I liked that about
him. And it's not certainly

521
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.980
not just with me. I
think he's very happy, right?

522
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.130
Particularly right now with the
way Ubuntu is managed in

523
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.840
terms of when to engineering.
I mean, there's lots of

524
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.330
different pieces of canonical, but
traditionally been to engineering. Engineering's

525
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.600
always been pretty straightforward. We've
generally had our stuff together

526
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.390
and delivered the release every
six months on time. We've

527
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.730
never been late. Well, one
time we moved out a

528
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:06.100
little bit, cause the first
LTS, I don't think Mark

529
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.460
trusts that kind of predictability
because the whole predictability cadence

530
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.560
quality thing, he doesn't just
say those words because they

531
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.050
sound cool ideas. It's kind
of how he lives. His

532
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.930
life. It's become a value
of a boon too. I

533
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.410
mean, I know that I
wake up every six months

534
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.900
and you know, update the
boon too, just to see

535
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.170
what's changed. It's Hey, April
and October, we can count

536
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.030
on it. You know what
I mean? Yeah. And it's,

537
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.700
but it's, you know, we
talk a lot about Mark

538
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.470
Shuttleworth, but it's, and it's
not just him. I mean,

539
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.020
it's the same with, with
various other people. There's like

540
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:39.220
a company culture of like
very honesty and frankness, which

541
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.050
is what I cherish. Well,
I wanted to ask about

542
00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.680
transparency because I'm hearing that,
that, do you think that

543
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.750
to manage a community effectively
that you've got to be

544
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.670
transparent or do you think
that you have to hold

545
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.550
your cards close sometimes and
not tell the community something

546
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.770
I'm leaning towards transparency of
all above all things? My

547
00:26:54.770 --> 00:27:00.170
inclination is, is also transparency.
I think there's, there's kind

548
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.080
of, one of the things
I most enjoy about working

549
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.710
in community management is I'm
really passionate about, about the

550
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.770
profession. I love the idea
of the whip. I keep

551
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.350
referring to it with people
as the Renaissance of community

552
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.200
management, because, you know, I
think when I got involved

553
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.720
in this, I was essentially
just soaking up things that

554
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.730
other people were doing and
trying to implement them in

555
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.970
my own world. And now
with writing things down and

556
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.740
we have in the community
leadership summit, we're doing various

557
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.680
other things. So we're learning
about these different ways. And

558
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.870
I think the original ethos
was everything has to be

559
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.000
completely open and transparent. And
that's the only way if

560
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.550
you don't do that, then
it's terrible. I think we're

561
00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.980
now learning as time goes
on that there are nuances

562
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.410
in that. And there are
times when I think transparent

563
00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.360
by default is generally a
good, a good way to

564
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.750
go. But there are times
when strategically you can, you

565
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.480
can, you can build, you
can build an empower things

566
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.130
better by just being a
little bit more careful in

567
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.390
how you do it. So
I'll give you an example.

568
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.200
We changed the branding in
Ubuntu some years ago. And

569
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.880
instead of just going out
there and saying, this is

570
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.620
the way it's going to
be, you know, instead of

571
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.970
essentially been just keeping the
transparency in terms of like,

572
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.440
okay, this is what we're
working on. This is where

573
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.840
we're going. Everybody knows about
it. The first thing that

574
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.270
we did is we clued
our governance boards in and

575
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.980
said, look, we're going to
be talking about this in

576
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.620
a few weeks. And it
wasn't really secret for new

577
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.150
river. The reason, the fact
that just a group of

578
00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:19.550
people had already been working
on it. But we said

579
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.350
to our governance boards, you
know, this is, this is

580
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.650
where we're going. What's your
input? What blah, blah, blah,

581
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.420
blah. And the impact of
that was that the governing

582
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.350
boards felt, they felt good
that they were included in

583
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.410
this. So it wasn't a
hundred percent transparent. It wasn't

584
00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.780
a hundred percent closed, but
they felt good that they

585
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.600
were part of this. And
that strengthened our relationship with

586
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.690
our governing boards. I think
if we'd had just come

587
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.230
out and said, okay, congratulations,
here's the branding. I think

588
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.630
that wouldn't have been as
good of an experience. And

589
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.730
if we'd have done everything
in a completely, you know,

590
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.530
let's all work together on
the branding, it would have

591
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.380
taken months to get through
anything, right? So there are

592
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.830
nuances, but transparency by default,
I think transparency is a

593
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.930
good baseline that we should
always go for it. Yeah.

594
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.940
We really struggle with that
as well. We have a

595
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.000
group of a council of,
we call them insiders and

596
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.480
they're different from our MVPs.
Mbps are the ones that

597
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.250
are like, you know, they're
really helpful and they're always

598
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.410
answering questions. So you kind
of night them for a

599
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.500
year to say great job
being a community member. You're

600
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.230
awesome. Yeah. And then our
insiders are kind of are

601
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.830
our trusted circle. It's like
the, the council where we

602
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.810
can, we can literally show
them stuff that we don't

603
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.840
even know if this is
garbage or not. Right. And

604
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.790
we kind of go, we
kind of say, well, if

605
00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.820
we showed that publicly all
the time, people would think

606
00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.770
that we're nuts. Cause some
of these ideas. Yeah. Yeah.

607
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.740
We struggle a little bit
because sometimes we'll do something

608
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.770
even for a couple of
months, we release it and

609
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.360
go, wow, You've been working
on this for a month,

610
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.460
six weeks. You've been hiding
stuff for us. Yeah, yeah.

611
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.870
Yeah. But at the same
time, if you're completely transparent

612
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:52.450
with all the spikes and
crazy ideas, like I'm sure

613
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.510
that you had rebranding stuff
that would have caused a

614
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.180
revolt, had you shown it
in its early form. Yeah.

615
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.880
And the thing is as
well, the thing has changed

616
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.610
in my career as I,
as I've, I think evolved

617
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.740
with my own approach to
community management is that when

618
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.510
I started out, I always
thought that the way you

619
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.430
did a community manager was
really there to make sure

620
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.500
that all the infrastructure and
documentation, all that kind of

621
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.630
stuff was in place. And
then the community was ready

622
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.790
to go and use it.
So essentially what you were

623
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.370
doing is you were making
sure that the stage was

624
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.380
set for the community members
to do great work. And

625
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.250
now the, I think the
real challenge of community management

626
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.100
is, is helping to grow
leaders. Like we have lots

627
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.050
of people who want to
help. I call them shovels.

628
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.180
It's kind of how I
affectionately refer to people is

629
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.770
you give them something to
do and they will do

630
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.230
an awesome job, but they
need something to do. They

631
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.530
need to be given something
to do. I'm finding natural

632
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:44.410
leadership and grow in and
harness in empowering natural leadership

633
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.290
is the real challenge in
community management. And a lot

634
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.450
of that is a one
on one personal thing. So

635
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.420
for example, every week I
have five to 10 calls

636
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.830
with individual members of our
community, who I just hopped

637
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.090
on the phone with half
an hour a week. And

638
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.700
it's almost, it's not really
mentoring. It's not like I'm

639
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.860
spewing forth how it should
be done. It's more of

640
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.500
a, I'm here to try
and support your growth as

641
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.200
a leader in our community
because that's how you build

642
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.050
the next generation, but that's
a new thing and that's

643
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.630
changing and we're still learning
about this, but I think

644
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.280
that's where a lot of
the focus really should be

645
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.430
in how you scale it
up. Very cool. Well, thanks

646
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.620
so much for chatting with
me today. I appreciate it.

647
00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.930
Yeah. We'll put a link
in the show notes, but

648
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.910
folks really should check out
the book, the art of

649
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.730
community by Jonno and it's,
it's a fantastic book. I've

650
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.640
got shedding here all marked
up. This has been another

651
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.860
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.

652
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:37.020
