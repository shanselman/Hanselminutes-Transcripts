12
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.820
E N connected.com freelance journalist.
You'll also have seen travels

13
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.290
his work on gotta be
mobile. How are you? I'm

14
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.590
good. You I'm pretty good.
I wanted to talk to

15
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.610
you about phones because you
are an known expert on

16
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.460
mobile stuff. Cause you love
everything mobile. And you've been

17
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.140
a hardcore windows phone person
for a long time, Around

18
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.130
three years now, since 2000
since before. Well that's a

19
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.200
long time, then that's the
full life of that product.

20
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.540
And I I've always had
this kind of, I wouldn't

21
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.940
say love, hate relationship. It's
more of like an uncomfortable

22
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.580
kind of, I keep coming
back to a relationship where,

23
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.490
you know, I got an
iPhone when I first started

24
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.940
out in, in smartphones. That
was kinda my first smartphone

25
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.750
because there was no windows
phone. And I just kind

26
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.450
of went at and T
and upgraded and upgraded and

27
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.620
upgraded. And then I've been
trying windows phones consistently and

28
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.990
blogging about it. I had
a Lumia 800. I had

29
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.360
a Samsung, what was the
original Samsung called? Oh man.

30
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.350
It's been awhile before they
renamed everything to the ative

31
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.240
the Samsung flat, no Focus,
focus. That's exactly right. I

32
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.130
had a focus. I hadn't
then I had a Nokia

33
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.830
800 and then a nine
20 and then a 10

34
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.120
20 most recently. What, what
windows phones have you used?

35
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.230
So I've used, let's see,
my first one was the

36
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.000
HTC HD seven, then a
after that was the, the

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.920
HTC Titan, the Delvin new
pro the HTC eight X.

38
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.880
And now I've got a
Lumia nine 20. I've had

39
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.440
some hands on time with
some of the other ones

40
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.360
like the Lumion nine 25,
but I haven't used them

41
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.020
day to day. But I
understand recently you had kind

42
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.360
of a publicized breakup in
the sense that you just,

43
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.610
your main phone now is
an iPhone. Is that true?

44
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.270
Yeah, so it wasn't really
a breakup as much as

45
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.180
it was just a realization
of where, where Microsoft's mobile

46
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.520
efforts stand now versus where
they were when I got,

47
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.410
got a windows phone. And
I think, you know, a

48
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.160
lot of people who read
the, who read about publicized

49
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.960
breakout with windows phone interpreted
as, you know, windows, my

50
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.810
relationship with windows phone, not
being so healthy, but actually

51
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.780
it's my decision to do
this is more about Microsoft's

52
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.040
other efforts actually moving into
great direction to the point

53
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.200
where I didn't necessarily need
a windows phone to get

54
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.890
a lot of the great
services that they provide. Well,

55
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.380
that's interesting. So you're saying
that you're still kind of

56
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.370
like quote unquote team Microsoft
or as Jimmy and Joe

57
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.090
and Jimmy Fallon would say
hashtag team Microsoft. Well, that's

58
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.370
exactly correct. I think a
lot of people interpreted my

59
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.280
initial article as a, you
know, Microsoft's failed in mobile

60
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.680
when actually the problem for
when this phone, in my

61
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.310
opinion is really that the
rest of Microsoft has gotten

62
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.220
so much better. Right? So
back in the day, Microsoft

63
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.230
would release a feature that's
specific to windows for, like

64
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.400
for example, zoon would be
specific to windows, Zune music,

65
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.350
the unlimited streaming music service.
Exactly. So you would, you

66
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.940
would get a product like
that and you'd have to

67
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.370
use a Microsoft. You'd have
to use windows phone in

68
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.780
order to get it. And
now that's just not the

69
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.070
case. The rest of Microsoft
has really embraced mobile platforms

70
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.590
in a way that we
haven't seen before Google does

71
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.320
this a lot with its
products. But until very recently,

72
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.190
Microsoft didn't do such a
good job of it. Yeah.

73
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.290
You know, I see on
the, I have an iPhone

74
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.180
sitting on the desk here
and I have a little

75
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.450
folder on it called office
and in it are native

76
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.680
iPhone apps. I've got one
note, I've got outlook, which

77
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.860
is freaking me out. Okay,
it's called OWA outlook, web

78
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.040
access, but it's outlook. It's
really amazing. It's actually weird

79
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.870
to be using Metro type
styling on a iPhone. I've

80
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.470
got link, which is freaking
amazing, like link the link

81
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.720
mobile strategy. We should talk
about that because if you've

82
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.780
ever used it, it's across
every device and you get

83
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.420
screen sharing. It's amazing. I've
got Skype, I've got SkyDrive

84
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.550
and now I've got office
mobile. So I've got tiny

85
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.330
Excel and tiny word and
tiny PowerPoint on my iPhone,

86
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.290
on my iPad. Yeah. I
mean, it's just the, company's

87
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.520
done a really good job
of embracing. Clearly the company

88
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.180
has become better about embracing
other people's mobiles mobile platforms.

89
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.980
And that's great. That's great
for everyone. That's great for

90
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.100
when his phone users that's
great for our Microsoft users.

91
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.520
That's great for iPhone users.
I've got SkyDrive, you know,

92
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.100
like I've got being on
my iPhone, I've got all

93
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.560
of these products that, you
know, just if it was

94
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.710
just two years ago with
windows phone, 7.5, you know,

95
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.480
I would have never left
if I would've never left

96
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.330
it. Those applications weren't available.
Yeah. And so the, now

97
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.480
what was, it was something
not working that you would

98
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.250
move off? Cause I know
that people who love windows

99
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.400
phone are fervent, and this
is the thing about phone

100
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.730
people. They like their, this
religiously. They love their phone.

101
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.590
Like if you argue with
an Android person, they will

102
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.530
beat you down. If you
disrespect Android and you know,

103
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.870
everyone loves their team For
me for windows phone. I

104
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.900
think the tipping point was
actually, I spend some time

105
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:21.040
with the HTC one Early
in the summer and Unlike

106
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.000
iPhone and unlike Android absolutely
hated the entire Android experience.

107
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.340
So I went back to
my windows phone and I

108
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.640
kind of missed it. Wasn't
the application selection that bothered

109
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.920
me as much as it
was the breadth of the

110
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.590
applications that were actually there.
Right? When this phone has

111
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.260
done a great job, in
my opinion of getting big

112
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.960
name apps. But even when
those big name apps appear,

113
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.410
sometimes they aren't as feature
rich as our iOS and

114
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.070
Android counterpart. What's an example
of that. An example of

115
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.130
that, let me see off
the top of my Cause

116
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.770
the Facebook app is pretty
good. The Facebook app has

117
00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.970
gotten amazing, especially since they've
been releasing betas. The reason

118
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.950
I'm pushing back on me,
I'm pushing back on that

119
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.740
a little bit, because I
want to make, cause you,

120
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.880
you made a broad statement
there where you said that,

121
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.600
you know, somethings, sometimes things
aren't always feature rich. Yeah.

122
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.960
So for example, I can't,
I can't remember exactly what

123
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.560
application it was. I know
a group me was, has

124
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.620
a big problem with that.
And it's recently been updated

125
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.410
Features that aren't on the
group, me app for windows

126
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.790
phone that are on the
iPhone app is what you're

127
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.460
saying. Yeah, I see. Or
the Android app too. I

128
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.490
mean it works both ways.
Another big problem for me

129
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.390
was just that windows phone
has a great developer community,

130
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.980
but those applications applications may
specifically for windows phone, don't

131
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.040
usually have iOS and Android
counterparts. And part of my

132
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.470
job most of the time
is to cover iPhone or

133
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.730
excuse me, usually Android forgotten
mobile.com too. And I just

134
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.580
couldn't go back and forth
in between different applications. You

135
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.610
know, that, that is an
interesting point. So I I've

136
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.150
always proposed, you know, and
again, I work for Microsoft,

137
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.070
although I work in the
web on the cloud, so

138
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.400
I don't speak for the
company, but I've always proposed

139
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.340
that people have lots of
different devices in their lives.

140
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.610
And that it's unrealistic to
assume that a household is

141
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.760
gonna be all team Android
or a household is going

142
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.830
to be, yes, I've got
a surface and my wife

143
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.360
has a windows phone and
I have a windows phone

144
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.010
and we use it to
talk to our Xbox. You

145
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.150
know, the reality is folks
are mixed and people have

146
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.270
mixed stuff. So I might
have a Android tablet that

147
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.950
I love and a windows
phone that I use and

148
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.630
a Mac because that's reality.
You're implying that when you

149
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.540
have an app, that's an
exclusive on what one platform

150
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.850
and then you move to
another and you can't bring

151
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.840
your app with you. That
hurts. Exactly. So I love

152
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.260
I adore. We've made bus
less games from this phone.

153
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.470
I absolutely adore. I love,
I love everything about it.

154
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.840
I love how they've matured
that app over the last

155
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.950
few years is excellent to
use, but there isn't a

156
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:01.950
counterpart on Android or iOS
and that Celeste games doesn't

157
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.560
you can't, you can import
feeds from feely if I

158
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.560
remember correctly, but they're, they're
very adamant about we've being

159
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.500
a replacement for Feedly. It's
not something that you add

160
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.710
on to Feedly, which is
a backend RSS service that

161
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.750
replaced Google's Google reader. They're
very adamant about it being

162
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.480
an alternative. Now that's great.
If you have a windows

163
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.810
phone, should you go anywhere
outside of that? That's a

164
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.180
big, Yeah. And you know,
we've is on windows, windows

165
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.280
eight as well when there's
eight and 8.1 and works

166
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.310
great. But you're, you're right
in that. This is the

167
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.180
thing though, about mobile phones.
Everyone wants that exclusive. I

168
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.420
mean, every platform pushes that
like initially there was like

169
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.330
Google now on your Android
phone now of course it's

170
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.070
everywhere. And on, on iPhones,
there's always an exclusively on

171
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.630
iPhone section of the store.
Is that something that consumers

172
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.060
are gonna like, it's gonna
resonate with them? Like I

173
00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.590
can only get this on
that phone. It's always been,

174
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.070
I think people who are
big fans of Instagram would

175
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.430
argue I'm wrong, but I've
never felt like that was

176
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.840
a big draw for, I've
never felt like that was

177
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.540
a big draw for mobile
users. I think it was

178
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.450
more about the platform first
or the device first and

179
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.170
the platform then maybe the
application, it only comes. It's

180
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.750
only a problem. I think
when big name applications aren't

181
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.450
there, which is, you know,
the Instagram prompt for windows

182
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.110
phone, But then when a
third party app comes out

183
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.050
and there's several Instagram, third
party apps, the most prominent

184
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.670
of one being called six
tag, which is arguably as

185
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.480
good or better than the
Instagram client itself on iPhone.

186
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.940
Like what do you do
with that? Like do you

187
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.640
wait for Instagram to buy
them? Like, remember the whole

188
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.960
Foursquare thing? Right. Fourth and
Mayer was the Foursquare app

189
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.580
on windows phone for what
almost two years. And then

190
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.120
the Foursquare app came out
and arguably fourth and are

191
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.900
still better. Should they have
just bought that guy? I

192
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.360
mean, they should Instagram just
by the third party client

193
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.580
or is it just not
okay for the average Joe

194
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.490
to go and get a
third party client? I think

195
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.630
it's really, I think that's
really tough. A really tough

196
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.550
call for a lot of
people. So for example, I

197
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.640
use six to tag. I
adore again, a Rudy human

198
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.760
is one of those guys
I adore. Yeah. Amazing developer.

199
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.460
Actually I actually six, eight,
so good. When I went

200
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.000
to the about box saw
that it was Rudy and

201
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.580
I said, Oh, I'm just
going to download everything Rudy's

202
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.430
ever done because now I'm
like a fan. I wish

203
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.400
I could like follow developers
on a platform. Like I

204
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.020
don't care what the app
is. Just give me whatever

205
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.010
that dev did. Oh yeah.
That guy's amazing. So I

206
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.790
use six tag on my
windows phone. I actually use

207
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.280
his vine application as well
though. It's name escapes me

208
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:52.130
for some Oh six seconds.
Yeah. And I use this

209
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.890
news application. I don't like
to use third party clients.

210
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.950
And the reason why I
don't is because of windows

211
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.880
phone, I had some very
bad experiences with Twitter applications

212
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.990
just suddenly stop working on
windows. Right. Well that was

213
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.020
Twitter twin. That Twitter's fault
though. I mean, Twitter changed

214
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.660
their API point. Yeah. So
that's exactly my point. I

215
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.490
think the PR you don't,
these companies don't need to

216
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.640
buy these individual app developers
or their apps, but they

217
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.660
do need to be more
comfortable with opening up. Not

218
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.520
necessarily Opening up their ecosystem.
Yeah, Exactly. I mean, Twitter

219
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.860
is a poster child for
this, right? We, we grow

220
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.320
on the backs of developers.
We enable them to do

221
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.320
all these things. And then,
you know, we want to

222
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.230
reign in that because of
profitability concerns and just making

223
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.180
a better platform. And that's
great. There's nothing wrong with

224
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.060
that, but there's definitely room
to try and find a

225
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.480
compromise. Well, just a year
or two ago, there were

226
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.970
dozens and dozens of awesome
Twitter apps to choose from.

227
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.280
And now that's really compressing
and it's clear that Twitter

228
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.790
wants to kill all the
Twitter apps with their limitation

229
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.710
on the number of API
keys that they're going to

230
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.440
give out because they want
to control the experience. They

231
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.330
want to be the client.
So I think that the

232
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.230
you're right, that the, the
door is closing on third

233
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.090
party apps in general. I
know that there was another

234
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.670
Instagram client on windows phone
who was having trouble, where

235
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.540
they would upload photos. Instagram
would detect that it wasn't

236
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.970
uploaded by the Instagram app
and then like hide it.

237
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.390
I can't remember the name
of the application right now.

238
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.210
I do remember that that
was actually a week after

239
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.690
I joined Instagram for the
first time. And I remember

240
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.890
that being, I remember complete
Twitter uproar for, for windows

241
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.220
phone, from windows, phone users
and justifiably. So you don't

242
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.230
want to build an app
for us, but you will

243
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.740
delete all of our images
from the guys who did.

244
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.060
But I think that's just
a tough one that we

245
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.070
couldn't have seen coming two
or three years ago. But

246
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.010
now that it's here, it's
really tough to deal. Well,

247
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.250
and from a user's perspective,
it's extremely hard to explain

248
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.070
the nuance of that. Like
let's say my wife gets

249
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.380
a windows phone. It's pretty,
it's red. She likes it.

250
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.350
She gets, it gets an
Instagram app. And then suddenly

251
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.190
things start disappearing. It feels
punitive. Like, do they not

252
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.170
like us? Are we not?
You know, do we not

253
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.530
bleed? You know, that's, it's
not a windows phone thing

254
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.030
that it turns out in
that case, it was some

255
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.150
user agent and they were
trying to block spam. But

256
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.580
at the moment you don't
care. You just want to

257
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.700
use your app. Yeah. Yeah.
And unfortunately, a lot of

258
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.910
these applications because they're made
by independent developers, aren't free.

259
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.900
So, you know, you're, you're
investing two or three bucks

260
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.970
sometimes as much as tanks.
I just want to make

261
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.340
sure that it's clear that
you just said investing and

262
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.560
I thought you were going
to say 99 cents. And then

263
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.300
you went for two or
three bucks. That is quite

264
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.300
the investment. Well sometimes. Well,
that's the other thing. When

265
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.730
does I find windows phone
app prices are usually a

266
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.070
little bit more than what
I see on iOS or

267
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:46.470
Android sometimes not all the
time, but sometimes, but you

268
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.790
know, you've, you've invested a
lot of sweat equity and

269
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.390
learning to use that application.
And you know, when he

270
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.760
could just goes, poof, you're
out of two or three

271
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.500
bucks, you're out of all
the time you spent with

272
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.690
the app and you're left
trying to find something else.

273
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.670
I teased you about investment,
but you're you're right though.

274
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.030
One app. Sure. It's 99 cents,
a couple of hundred apps.

275
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.850
And a couple of years
later when you've tested a

276
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.560
bunch of apps and you've
got yourself down to the

277
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.540
40 or 50 that you
use on a regular basis,

278
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.820
you might be into it
for two or 300 bucks.

279
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.870
And when people ask me
why I resist moving to

280
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.070
windows phone from, from the
iOS ecosystem is just, and

281
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.450
I got a couple of
hundred bucks into this and

282
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.620
I've got to go and
buy a bunch of new

283
00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.590
apps. That's enough to keep
people, you know, at least

284
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.960
power users, they've put money
into it from switching as

285
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.930
well. Yeah, that's definitely one
of the problems I've I've

286
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.220
had when switching between all
these devices. I, I had

287
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.050
to have invested. I'm not
a big app guy, but

288
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.930
I've had to invest it
about 40, maybe $30 in

289
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.950
windows, phone apps, probably more
because of the Xbox live

290
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.160
games. And when I initially
switched over to the HTC

291
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.550
one first, you know, I,
I'm not gonna lie. I

292
00:15:54.550 --> 00:16:00.640
miss those applications. And even
when I switched, so I've

293
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.180
avoided buying applications on iPhone
in Android, just cause I

294
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.650
know I'm going to go
back to windows phone at

295
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.010
some point, I don't want
to become so invested that

296
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.750
I I'm, I think twice
about it. I mean, a

297
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.000
lot of people interpreted that
pieces, you know, me coming

298
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.680
out against windows from him
saying I'm never gonna use

299
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.480
it. And it really wasn't
that it was just, you

300
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.240
know, sometimes you need the
right tool for the right

301
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.930
job, which I just stole
from Tom Silva in this

302
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.360
old house. But it's true.
You know, like sometimes you

303
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.020
just want something that works
and then it has That.

304
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.830
You just sometimes want something
that works. And this isn't

305
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.270
a really important thing for
some people in their lives.

306
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.210
They've got, you might have
a Honda civic for your

307
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.790
car and you might have
a Samsung TV and you

308
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.980
might have an Xbox and
another person might have a

309
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.160
Mercedes and a PlayStation. We
all have these things in

310
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.010
our lives. Somebody else rides
the bus. I don't know.

311
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.280
But that phone and its
ecosystem needs to snap into

312
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.030
your life. Right? So my
wife got a Nokia nine

313
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.690
20. She has a red
one. Okay. If that device

314
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.490
hadn't paired with the Bluetooth
in her car, she would've

315
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.190
blamed the device. And this
is a non tech. My

316
00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.820
wife's nontechnical she would have
gone to at and T

317
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.590
this phone is broken. Then
they would have given her

318
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.540
another one and she would
have come back. And then

319
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.160
she would have said, okay,
well this, this, this one

320
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.250
didn't work anymore. Either my
phone is broken. My car

321
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.610
is broken or this windows
thing, if she calls it

322
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.140
is broken. So there's an
example where one person has

323
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.480
this car and that TV
and this object in their

324
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.420
house and the phone ecosystem
just works. And another person

325
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.700
says it doesn't work. And
they say, that's a deal

326
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.060
breaker, no Bluetooth in my
car, give me a phone

327
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.860
that has Bluetooth. And they
might end up on Android

328
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.890
or iOS or windows phone
or whatever, simply because that

329
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.020
was the only device they
could get to, to work

330
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.740
with that one device that
they cared so much about.

331
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.690
Yeah. And I think, I
think those people, normal people

332
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.990
are justified in that. I
think the key here, I

333
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.740
think has always been interoperability.
And if it just doesn't,

334
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.440
you know, I have a
bunch of Microsoft products. I

335
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.530
have an Xbox three 60,
I've already, pre-ordered an Xbox

336
00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.560
one. I have a windows
eight PC. But if these

337
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.810
things can't communicate with all
the other devices in my

338
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.540
life, all those things that
I need to get things

339
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.560
done, you know, I don't
know if that's necessarily investment.

340
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.820
Anyone should make, even if
they aren't a power user.

341
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.910
Yeah, no, I totally agree.
I actually wrote a blog

342
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.040
post about how everything is
broken and no one is

343
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:33.740
happy. And my complaint was
getting my Gmail to work

344
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.280
with my calendar on windows,
with my outlook and with

345
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.830
an Android tablet, kind of
give them all to work

346
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.320
together. And it was just
like, this is, this has

347
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.750
gotta be a solved problem.
And even today, right. We're

348
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.640
still trying to figure out
how to get calendars to

349
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.050
work like it's 2013 and
I may or may not

350
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.380
be able to have my
calendar everywhere. Yeah. I mean,

351
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.750
a lot of people think
that, I mean, I want

352
00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.250
to be, I don't think
switched to this company solution

353
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.220
is necessarily the right problem,
the right answer to every

354
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.830
question all the time. I
feel like even with, even

355
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.740
with iOS, you know, if
our, excuse me, actually, a

356
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.230
better example is with email,
right? The answer to why

357
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.020
this Gmail work on my
windows phone from someone who's

358
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.890
usually switched to outlook.com. You
know, that's not nice. That's

359
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.530
not an answer. Yeah. I
mean, it's, it's the, the

360
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.800
underlying protocol. And then these
little protocol Wars, the whole

361
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.150
calendaring war back and forth
between Google and, and Microsoft

362
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.030
as they like, Oh, we're
shutting, calendaring down. Google says

363
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.190
and Microsoft like, ah, but
we kind of rely on

364
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.110
that to work and, Oh,
we'll turn it back on

365
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.380
until December. I mean, that,
that's just, how am I

366
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.140
supposed to explain that to
my wife? You know, how

367
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.420
is someone supposed to explain
that to their nontechnical husband,

368
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.710
your calendar doesn't work today?
Why? Well they're shutting the

369
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.800
government down. I mean, what
can you possibly tell someone?

370
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.010
I mean, a lot of
it's just, you know, political

371
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.100
Wars coming into the technology,
coming into the industry and,

372
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.240
you know, putting the brakes
on this stuff like, and

373
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.350
Google's defense, the licensing has
changed after seeing for Gmail

374
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.400
users has to cost them
something on the other. Yeah,

375
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.430
No, I totally understand. It's
a business decision. I think

376
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.040
that no one ever expects
the vocal minority to be

377
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.010
as loud as they end
up being well, like right

378
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.470
now I launched a call
burner in order to do

379
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.690
this call with you. And
that it says it's going

380
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.970
to stop working in December.
Okay. Well, Skype is changing

381
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.690
their desktop API. So call
burner the way that we're

382
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.180
doing this recording right now
will stop working December. Now

383
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.550
there's two ways we can
freak out about that. We

384
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.820
can just generally freak out.
We can find out what's

385
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.760
underneath that. I'm sure it's
poor messaging because surely they

386
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.760
have to have some API
available after December, or I'll

387
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.420
just start doing my audio
directly off the sound card.

388
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.090
But from the point of
view of someone who's, you

389
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.510
know, not totally technical, it's
like everything is going to

390
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.030
break and destroy the world
in December. And you'll never

391
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.600
be able to record a
call again. Well, that's exactly

392
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.700
what that sounded like to
me because I have no

393
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.350
idea, Poor messaging and actually
speaking of poor messaging, this

394
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.540
is, here's a funny thing
about me. I have my

395
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.120
windows phone, cause I'm trying
to write this, this application

396
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.840
for it. It's a news,
a news audio application. And

397
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.900
I go back and forth.
I've got these little SIM

398
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.090
adapters where I can swap
my SIM back and forth

399
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:25.050
between my windows phone and
Illumio at 10 20. And

400
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.220
I keep using the iPhone
as my main phone, but

401
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.530
I keep demoing things about
the 10 20 that I

402
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.580
really like. Like it irritates
me that my iPhone doesn't

403
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.620
have live tiles. You know
what I mean? It's just

404
00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.250
a bunch of numbers. It
tells me nothing. And from

405
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.880
a messaging perspective, I'm convinced
that Microsoft dropped the ball

406
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:49.920
marketing, like the people hub
on fricking windows phone. I

407
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.890
mean, that's amazing. You can
pin people to your home

408
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:58.920
screen and then see their
tweets, Facebooks and LinkedIns. I

409
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.450
think that seems to be
a particular problem for not

410
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.050
just windows phone, but also
windows eight, right? Like windows

411
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:12.660
eight also has a centralized
people have to that rarely

412
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.040
ever. I can't remember one
time they actually shared any

413
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.280
information about it. Any windows
Eat commercial? No, you're, you

414
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.020
know, it's funny. It's, it's
funny. You mentioned that because

415
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.090
I'm looking at my, my
sister right now, I've completely

416
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:28.650
forgotten that I had actually
pinned my wife. So I

417
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.200
paid, I went into the
people, hub, found my wife

418
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.830
in my contacts, pinned her
and now I can click

419
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.440
there and I can, and
I've got Skype integration maps,

420
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.310
Facebook, Twitter. I totally forgot
about that because no one

421
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.340
it's not in your face.
No. And I feel like

422
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.680
that's the problem for windows
phone, I think is other

423
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.770
than live tiles and the
Metro design language. There's a

424
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:54.150
lot of innovation happening. It's
just, it's just below the

425
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.940
surface though, right? Like it's
there, there are great things

426
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.680
there. You just, they're not
in your face and because

427
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.120
of not in your face,
maybe it's just not a

428
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.490
priority for some of the
commercials and outreach at the

429
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.940
company. I don't know. You
know, it's funny there's there's

430
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.380
this kids hub feature where
you can, I don't think

431
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.750
you don't have kids, right?
No I don't. But I

432
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.330
do use kids corner for
I'm actually in the car.

433
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.260
I usually as a, an
impromptu mode. Yeah. So what

434
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.420
kids corner does, it says,
these are the only apps

435
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.130
that you can run when
you're in this mode. So

436
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.690
from the home screen, you
swipe to the side and

437
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.270
then you can hand the
phone to a kid and

438
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.910
then they'll figure it out.
But it's deep, buried in

439
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.270
settings. The only people who
will ever use kids corner

440
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.940
are those who will dig
for kids score, which is

441
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.050
tragic. And I mean, it,
it really is. There's some

442
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.400
great ideas. I mean, are
applications that can give you

443
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.980
a kids' corner kind of
experience on Android, but it's

444
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.720
not as seamless. And it's
not as easy to use

445
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.850
this wit, but windows phone
is doing. And I feel

446
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.640
like that's the problem with
this phone a lot. It's

447
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.190
not that they don't have
the feature set to compete.

448
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.740
It's that, you know, sometimes
you have to look a

449
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.490
little bit under the surface
to find They don't, they

450
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.590
don't market it. This is
the thing, like, I don't

451
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.360
want to see dancing people.
I want to see people

452
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.820
talking to me about real
problems. Like I want to

453
00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.700
see I'm vignette of a
person having a problem and

454
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.460
then solving it. Like I'm
looking at Paul throws site

455
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.070
right now. And he's talking
about driving mode, a new

456
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:23.410
feature coming in windows, phone
update three. It's brilliant. When

457
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.950
it detects the Bluetooth in
your car, it automatically stops

458
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:30.010
accepting phones and text messages,
and it will text the

459
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.230
person back. So if my
wife calls me while I'm

460
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.080
driving, it will text her
and say, I'm driving, I'll

461
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:41.170
call you later. But she
so brilliant. That's genius. I

462
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.540
mean, in the problem is,
is, well, the other problem

463
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.360
is, is we're never going
to see. We're probably never

464
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.290
going to see that feature
advertised and the windows phone

465
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.880
ad for the last six
months, we've only seen specific

466
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.660
phone advertisements, nothing feature based,
you know, the Lumia 10

467
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.120
20 has the world's best
camera or something like that.

468
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.770
The camera's cool. I mean,
the camera's awesome. Let me

469
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.720
give you an example. I
was in New York. I had

470
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.760
the, the, the, I have
my iPhone, but I was

471
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.030
using the 10 20 to
get around New York because of

472
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:18.370
the subway and the, the
here transit application by far

473
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.180
the most amazing subway application
in existence. Like I, I

474
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.040
literally have been in New York
three different times in the

475
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.410
last two months. And each
time I swapped my SIM

476
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.290
into the Lumia, just because
here, here, transits that good.

477
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.410
Okay. I'm using the phone
and it's a yellow phone.

478
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.390
So you got to give
him credit for being bright.

479
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.490
Now of course, now that
I phones are bright too.

480
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.690
No, one's going to be
able to see it. But

481
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.820
as soon as this guy
at this restaurant saw the

482
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.260
phone, he's like, is that
the new phone? That's a

483
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:47.230
camera. So like brand recognition,
bright red, bright yellow phones.

484
00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.840
The guy says, that's a
phone, that's a camera. But

485
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.790
now people are using that
against them and saying, well,

486
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.120
it's a camera. And then
they added a phone, which

487
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.660
is not True, which is
not true at all. And

488
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.500
going back a little bit
earlier to the, the public

489
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.570
breakup with windows phone, like
I wrote that forgot to

490
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:08.500
go mobile.com and immediately when
that came out, you know,

491
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.420
there were some pushback about,
well, you're a bit unfair

492
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.610
to Nokia. And, you know,
honestly looking back on that

493
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.580
part of the article, it
was just a sentence. But

494
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.640
I think I was, you
know, Nokia, a lot of

495
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.000
the great things that are
happening for windows phone are

496
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.080
happening because of Nokia, right?
Like, and that was, that's

497
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.790
another one of my concerns
for windows phone. You know,

498
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.930
now that Microsoft is Nanda,
Microsoft is Northern to buy

499
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.570
them. You know, that's great.
But the Lumia 10 20

500
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.660
has a great camera. You
know, Nokia has been very

501
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:46.620
great about creating very specific
for their devices that change

502
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.430
that. Does it change the
equation for windows phone users?

503
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:52.500
The problem is, is that
I came from a windows

504
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.840
phone, eight X, and I
didn't get a Lumia 10

505
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.200
Lumia nine 20 until about
two months ago. Right? So

506
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.110
I've experienced both sides of
it. And while if you

507
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.070
have a Lumia, you're great.
If you have an ACA

508
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.720
at X, you're not seeing
a lot of the great

509
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.190
stuff that's going on. That
is interesting because it seems

510
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.460
like these vendors have taken
what used to be crap

511
00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.000
where crap, where in the
sense of, Hey, I'm HP,

512
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.700
here's a windows machine with
a bunch of other crap

513
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.640
from HP. And they're saying,
all right, let's not make

514
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.370
a crap word. Let's make
it value added where, and

515
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.770
I think Nokia went, went
all out with that. And

516
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.410
they said, all right, we
can build deep hooks into

517
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.720
the operating system where we're
going to add features that

518
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.000
are specific to Lumia like
headphones and Dolby and, and,

519
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.800
and, you know, glance mode
and all these different things

520
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:46.460
that are Lumia unique, you
know, Lumia specific, they're arguably

521
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.190
crap where in the sense
that they are things that

522
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.400
ship with the dos, but
nothing that Lumia ships would

523
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.350
be considered crap by any
sense of the word. You

524
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.660
know what I'm saying? It's
vendor it's vendor where I

525
00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.330
don't know, we need a
better word for that. And

526
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.120
in my opinion, I think
that has, that's something that's

527
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.910
specific to windows phone, you
know, like iOS doesn't allow

528
00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.060
it well, well, fair enough.
It's iOS has a different

529
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.060
equation, but you know, Android
because it's free and open

530
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.290
source companies take it a
bit too far. And you

531
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:19.250
end up with some things
that honestly I've used an

532
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:26.150
agency one for a month
before blink feed is terrible,

533
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.300
but you know, like windows
phone is one of those

534
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.070
platforms that allows CA allows
carriers and OEMs to customize

535
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.750
that kind of thing, but
not go overboard. You know,

536
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.660
all that stuff still on
installable. You know, it's like

537
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.730
Android where I'm stuck with
it from the rest of

538
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.040
my life. Yeah. I, I,
my wife's a at and

539
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.530
T she's like, what's this
at and T radio at

540
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.890
and T Uverse, not, not
for us. Click on install,

541
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.760
click on install. But speaking
of, of, of vent of

542
00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.410
carrier, where, and then vendor,
where I've got a galaxy

543
00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.710
S four that I'm working
on a review of, and

544
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:07.370
this thing has five different
apps called messenger messages, messaging

545
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.960
some from Samsung, there's like
Samsung messenger there's at and

546
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.950
T messenger. There's the, the,
the actual Google brand messenger.

547
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.550
Everyone who I've talked to
who said that their team

548
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:23.240
Android said I should torch
the phone and go stock

549
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.540
because there's probably 15 apps
from at and T and

550
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.150
another 15 apps from Samsung
that have nothing to do

551
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.570
with the Android experience that
had been installed by default.

552
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:37.640
And it's confusing. It is
Android. So when I went

553
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.290
into get an HSE one,
I originally went in to

554
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.750
get a galaxy S four
for some news coverage on

555
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.890
gotta be mobile. And I
felt the phone. I looked

556
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.010
at it, I played with
the play with the user

557
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.260
interface a little bit. And
I went, this is terrible.

558
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.350
I looked around, I looked
at the HTC one and

559
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.700
I'm like, well, at least
if I'm going to pick

560
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.400
an Android device, it's gotta
get great hardware. You know,

561
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.480
like it feels substantial in
the hand. And I feel

562
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.050
like Android manages to perfectly
replicate the problems I had

563
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.960
with windows mobile, which was,
you know, there are too

564
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.650
many fingers in this pie
and none of them are

565
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.260
doing a great job of
any Microsoft. Arguably was doing

566
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.870
a great job, but everyone
else who had a stake

567
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:26.500
in this just wasn't performing,
you know, Android is a

568
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.050
great operating system. Ish. You
know, it's not, it's Be

569
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.140
careful. You're going to anger
the Android fans, and they're

570
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.480
going to come for you.
Well, I've already angered the

571
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.370
windows phone fan. So, you
know, I might as well

572
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.760
make it equal opportunity, but
entrance great. Right. There are

573
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.550
things that happen on Android
that will never happen when

574
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.790
other operating systems, you know,
kind of like having two

575
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:52.740
applications, label music that you
can install. Yeah, that's true.

576
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.900
I mean, the thing is
though about Android is that

577
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.560
the, the, the weaknesses that
you have full control and

578
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.290
the strength is that you
have full control. When you

579
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.540
swap out the keyboard, if
you want to you, is

580
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.280
there something that you don't
like about it? You swap

581
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.680
it out in a phone,
like a, like an iPhone

582
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.930
or windows phone. If you
want to like have the

583
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.130
default maps app change, that's
trivial on Android, on iOS.

584
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.760
It's not really possible. No.
And those are great. Those

585
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.530
are great things to have.
If you're a power user,

586
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.770
that's the thing for you.
My problem is, is I'm

587
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.760
though my job dictates that
I am a power user.

588
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.280
I'm not a power user.
I don't like that kind

589
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.070
of control. Sometimes. I like
to be told how to

590
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.470
do things and you know
where to go and where

591
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.680
to find it. And I
feel like the industry, I

592
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.490
feel like the success of
the iPhone and to a

593
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:46.350
certain extent when this phone
validates that sometimes you need

594
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:51.390
company design driven user interfaces.
Sometimes you want to say,

595
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.820
you know, stop, you can't
do that. That's going to

596
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.720
be detrimental to you. Yeah,
exactly. Exactly. So you're saying

597
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.480
that you think you might
go back. I think that

598
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.230
I have decided I'm agnostic.
I'm going to move freely

599
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.750
from phone to phone. You
know, sometimes I'll go to

600
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:10.860
Easter sometimes I'll go to,
I don't know, Yom Kippor,

601
00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.840
you know what I mean?
I'm going to be non-religious,

602
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.610
I'll go on a good
joint. All of my friends

603
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:19.490
in all of their technology
platforms For me, I, I,

604
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.930
I know that I'm probably
gonna go back and it's

605
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.400
not because iOS isn't great.
I, it is personally, I

606
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.860
actually love iOS seven and
apparently I'm one of the

607
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:33.630
few people do, but I've
got to go back because

608
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.050
unlike some people, I am
a very steeped in Microsoft's

609
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.820
complete ecosystem. And just like
you, your car analogy, I'm

610
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.210
actually the jerk who goes
out and buys everything from

611
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.420
every company, you know, everything
that a specific company matrix,

612
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.540
and I've had a Zune.
I had a zoom since

613
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.290
2006, You used to be
like Zune guy. Like you

614
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.590
were all about the Zune.
Yeah. I, and I still,

615
00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.410
I still adore Zune. I
love X-Box music, but it's,

616
00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.030
you know, it's like that
first love, you know, like,

617
00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:04.390
yeah, you've moved on, you
know, and you found girls

618
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.880
that are prettier, but you're
not entirely sure that if

619
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.670
she showed up one day,
you wouldn't go back. Well,

620
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.760
you know, it's about the
hardware. It really is. Zune

621
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.350
was like the first surface,
you know what I mean?

622
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.270
It just, it felt different.
It felt right in your

623
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.290
hands, but the ecosystem just
didn't happen. They should have

624
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:25.630
called it tiny Xbox or
something like that. Well, I

625
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.610
guess we got, we got
that up point eventually. I

626
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:33.190
mean, It's all coming together.
Yes. Microsoft products identify with

627
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:35.230
me because, you know, I
actually switched from a Mac

628
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.660
to a PC in 2005.
Like I went the opposite

629
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.870
way and fell into Zune
and everything else. And I

630
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.790
love what the company is
doing with Metro. You know,

631
00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:46.210
like I adore SkyDrive I
think that live tiles are

632
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.390
absolutely brilliant. They're not brilliant.
When use, when they're your

633
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.510
only source of notifications, it's
a horror show, but you

634
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.230
know, like No live tiles
are the one thing that

635
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.530
once you put together a
really like, here's another idea.

636
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:03.070
I'm like, I've got ideas,
man, for, for commercials. Like

637
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:06.190
what about a commercial that
just shows different people's home

638
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:10.930
screens? Cause my wife's completely
different than mine. And whenever

639
00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:12.550
I meet someone who has
a windows phone that hasn't

640
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.910
actually configured their home screen,
it's been two minutes, the

641
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:18.610
length of a commercial showing
them how to organize their

642
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.040
home screen and pin their
family and friends. And they

643
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.620
freak out their brains explode.
I've had this phone for

644
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:28.090
a year. I had no
idea. Yeah. And I think

645
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.040
that's also one of those
things that, you know, when

646
00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.150
this phone is very, I'm
not gonna say power user

647
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.430
heavy, cause it's not. It's
just some of the things

648
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:38.860
aren't obvious unless you're looking
for them, you know, like

649
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:41.290
a lot of people don't
know the tap and hold

650
00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.200
anything in order to resize
it. It's the new right-click,

651
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:50.170
it's not discoverable. Yeah. And
you know, all operating systems

652
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.820
do that. And that's so
I kind kinda, you know,

653
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.010
don't want to harp on
windows phone for it. But

654
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.890
when his phone is very,
when his phone uses that

655
00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.270
gesture very heavily, you know?
Yeah. Well, cool. Well, thanks

656
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:03.280
for talking to me and
I assume that we can

657
00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.790
go to gotta be mobile
and or end connected to

658
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.600
learn about your struggle, your
personal struggle with mobile phone

659
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.310
usage and whether or not
you decide to stick with

660
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.460
iPhone or go back and
forth. Yes, sir. All right.

661
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.440
Thank you so much, Travis
Pope for chatting with me

662
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.650
today, this has been another
episode of Hansel minutes and

663
00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.060
we'll see you again next
week.
