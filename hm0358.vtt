Scott talks with Willem Larson

11
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.630
from language hunters. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

12
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.550
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'm here at agile

13
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.640
open Northwest and I'm sitting
down with Willem Larsen from

14
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.510
language hunters.org. How are you,
sir? Good Scott. Thank you

15
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.100
so much for talking to
me today. This was really

16
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.320
fascinating because I have a
passion for languages. I know

17
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.050
that the people who follow
me online know that I'm

18
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.860
always thinking about languages, particularly
smaller, more obscure languages, not

19
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
Spanish and French and German,
but you know, Ethiopian and

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.950
Zulu and things like that.
So what is language hunters

21
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.410
and why would a person
with passion and language care

22
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.590
about language hunters? Language hunters
is a five Oh one

23
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.850
C three nonprofit that whose
purpose is to revitalize endangered

24
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.970
languages and actually specifically to
teach communities to do that

25
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.270
work themselves, which is a
big issue because oftentimes these

26
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.710
small languages are cultural property,
especially in North America, you

27
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.360
have native American languages that
belong to the people. You

28
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.490
know, maybe one of the
most valuable things they hold.

29
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.390
And so we teach them
to do all that work

30
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.810
themselves and for all members
from kids to elders to

31
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.170
participate in that revival of
their language. When I think

32
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.900
of learning a language, though,
I think of the ubiquitous,

33
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.150
like Rosetta stone, I'll buy
a bunch of CDs. I'll

34
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.120
get the lonely planet sheet.
It sounds like hassle and

35
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.400
hard work. And for a
small language there isn't a

36
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.850
lonely planet. Right? Right. Yeah.
We like to think of

37
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.850
language hunting as like the
rugged all weather version of

38
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.670
language acquisition, and you don't
need CDs. You don't need

39
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.920
any kind of computers. You
don't need any extraneous expensive

40
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.290
tools. Now there, it's wonderful
to have them. Don't get

41
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.790
me wrong. I've recorded a
lot of language. Hunts is

42
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.270
what we call it when
we learn languages live from

43
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.870
a live speaker in the
moment. And I, I do

44
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.560
record them on occasion for,
for mnemonic purposes and for

45
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.370
documentation, but it's not required.
Language hunting has to work

46
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.100
at the end of a
dirt road with no electricity

47
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.040
with people who may have
really difficult, you know, social

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.820
issues going on poverty, lack
of access to all kinds

49
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.710
of resources. And so it's
optimized for the most challenging

50
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.640
of situations, which is funny
because then it makes learning

51
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.280
French pretty much just snap.
When I, when I try

52
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.110
to teach, when I try
to get my wife to

53
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.920
help me with my Zulu
and the belly language, it's

54
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.950
a Bantu language that she
speaks. Unfortunately, I think I'm

55
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.950
coming at it from an
engineering perspective, which is like,

56
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.100
alright, well, what's the past
participle for, to be, you

57
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.980
know, like, and she doesn't
think it that way. She

58
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.470
understands what that means. But
as a native speaker, she's

59
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.270
like, I don't know, you
just say it this way.

60
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.490
And we always come at
this and we always have

61
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.950
this impasse where she's not
telling it in the way

62
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.620
that I want, and I'm
not receiving it in the

63
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.680
way that she has to
give. How can, how can

64
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.860
a language hunt change that,
You know what we like

65
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.620
to think of language? I
think culturally, we've inherited this

66
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.420
view of language as information.
It's something, you know, it's

67
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.080
data and maybe you can
put it on a page

68
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.840
and it can live there.
And that's just simply not

69
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.410
the way language works. Now,
the study of language linguistics

70
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.830
is really fascinating and I'm
a, I'm an amateur linguist

71
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.940
myself. I love talking about
language, but language is really

72
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.930
an activity. It's something that
a human body does. It

73
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.600
requires musculature requires breadth and
requires your brain absolutely requires

74
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.900
your ears, but it's a
whole person activity and you

75
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.440
can do it gracefully fluently.
Well, I know we're not

76
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.150
so fluently and there's levels
of proficiency and there's levels

77
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.040
of complexity of information that
you can transmit in this

78
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.600
language activity. But, but it
is abs it's, you know,

79
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.960
it's as physical as any
sport, you know, it's not,

80
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.210
it's not our brains just
making beeps and squawks. It's

81
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.580
far more subtle and intricate
than that. And so what

82
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.120
we do with language hunting
as we take that as

83
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.290
our assumption, and we learn
language in context in C2

84
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.540
and from a speaker who
has no, ideally has no

85
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.560
teaching ability, no linguistic understanding
of their language that actually

86
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.260
gets in the way. In
fact, if they know English

87
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.800
that can get in the
way, because how they learned

88
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.320
English, if it's a second
language will influence how they

89
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.540
try and pass on their
own language, you know, they'll,

90
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.110
they'll want to help us
by teaching. And then that

91
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.530
ends up being teaching about
the language, teaching, the linguistic

92
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.350
knowledge we have of the
language, rather than learning the

93
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.260
skill of speaking and writing
if that's part of it.

94
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.290
So, so in language hunting,
we set up situations, problems

95
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.140
that we need to solve.
For example, I'm thirsty and

96
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.710
I want a glass of
water and we into it

97
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.830
without a bridge language, we
dive right into it. And

98
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.290
I learn how to get
myself a glass of water

99
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.340
using the language. And there
can be immense amounts of

100
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.130
complicated for abuse or idiom.
And it doesn't matter because

101
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.090
I don't know what's happening
in, in context and the

102
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.460
hunt. All I know is
if I say this thing,

103
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.730
the speaker reacts this way.
And if I say it,

104
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.090
I'm a little off the
speakers, brow crinkles. So I

105
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.070
don't say it like that.
And if I say it

106
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.130
spot on, there's a big
smile that spreads across their

107
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.610
face. And then, all right,
I'll keep doing that. And

108
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.100
what happens just like children.
I mean, this is how

109
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.270
children learn their mother tongue,
the most complex or Nate

110
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.770
languages without any even orthography
any written element. There's no,

111
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.430
no books, no, no literacy
possibly then yet still young

112
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.940
children, toddlers grow up and
master this language with no

113
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.910
problem. And so that's what
language hunters were able to

114
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.170
do that same pathway or
that the natural learning natural

115
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.890
language acquisition that children have
then yet we turn it

116
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.300
up to 11 as Nigel
might say. So we, we

117
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.670
apply all kinds of learning,
accelerators, what we call rules.

118
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.420
We gave them a fight.
So they are game rules.

119
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.550
And we find ways of
one shortcut after another finding

120
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.070
every way to cheat the
system and learn faster. And

121
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.530
does that cause it to
be, is it easier to,

122
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.620
to, to hold? Cause that's
the thing that I'm struggling

123
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.320
with is the, it makes
sense for an hour or

124
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.180
two. And then the next
day I've lost half of

125
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.520
it. And the next day
I've lost even more That's

126
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.870
well, you know, there's retention
is another issue. You're describing

127
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.790
a phenomenon, which is probably
a, what we call history.

128
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.720
SIS neuroscientists say that forgetting
is the friend of learning,

129
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.930
which is yeah. Something that
would probably blow your mind.

130
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:05.710
But it's quite true that
the, the human mind, as

131
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.370
it builds new structure, it
goes back and forth across

132
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.750
this boundary line of, of
fluently expressing this new ability

133
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.540
or information. And then Whoa,
lost it. What was even

134
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.000
I talking about? I suddenly,
I don't understand it. And

135
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.250
then I'm back to understanding
it. If you stay on

136
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.830
it, you're back to understanding
it. And then you're back

137
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.580
to forgetting it and what
that happens. And within that,

138
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.880
that boundary line though, is
moving forward, the structures are

139
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.360
graining and complexity, right? So
it's not just one location.

140
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.740
If you stop your learning,
there's some degradation over time.

141
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.450
But even then if you
re interact, if you revisit

142
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.690
that same material, that same
skill, you'll find it comes

143
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.510
back much more quickly than
a person who's never touched

144
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.220
it before. And that's how
you know, that, that you

145
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.420
really did have that experience.
That was history says, and

146
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.570
it's a good thing. And
part of the learning journey

147
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.120
Does this work on, on
adults because you know how

148
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.280
they say a five year
old can learn a language,

149
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.290
but by the time they're
12, it's too late. And

150
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.600
I'm thinking like, if I
go back and study Spanish

151
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.720
books, which I learned in
my teens and my early

152
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.630
teens, I'm like, wow, I
really know Spanish. Like that's,

153
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.940
it's baked in because it's
what I spent four years

154
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.530
in high school doing. Yeah.
But if I try to

155
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.380
learn French, it just doesn't
happen. I'm an old man.

156
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.020
Yeah. That's funny because I
took four years of Spanish

157
00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.740
in high school and I
can't say, Okay, ready? I,

158
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.440
this is a problem. All,
I was a language, not

159
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.200
in high school. I took
like four or five languages

160
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.950
and jeez, French, German, Spanish
a semester Japanese, a little

161
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.630
bit of Russian, a semester
of Arabic. Right. I really

162
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.270
can't speak any of them.
I, you know, it's funny.

163
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.020
I did the, I did,
I did the Spanish, like

164
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.750
the whole AP Spanish. Cause
you need that to get

165
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.730
out of high school. Yeah.
I did the exact same

166
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.980
thing. I did a semester
of Arabic and I was

167
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.140
like totally into Arabic for
like, you know, half a

168
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.910
year. Cause I don't, I
don't, I had a reason

169
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.740
to, I don't know why
maybe I wanted to eat

170
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.660
at restaurants or something and
then it's gone. Yeah. And

171
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.740
there's like six alphabet letters
and seven phrases left and

172
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.310
that's yeah. Yeah. And it's
not necessarily a positive sign,

173
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.670
like a history. So this
might point us to, because

174
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.120
I went during those years,
I was drilling knowledge about

175
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.970
the language, but I wasn't
drilling the ability to fluently,

176
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.500
fluently, speak the language. So
languages that, and of course,

177
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.800
this is all before language
hunting languages, after the development

178
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.190
of language hunting, which has
really been a community project,

179
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.800
I certainly don't take all
credit for the existence of

180
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.340
language hunting. It's we think
of it as an open

181
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.810
source approach that is we're
constantly iterating on and ever

182
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:54.380
improving that has these five
core elements. But so in

183
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.660
any case, how did we
get there? See here's Theresa,

184
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.200
let me, let me ask
you this. If I want

185
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.800
to go home and try
this with my wife, do

186
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.690
I need a training course?
Do I need to buy

187
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.000
something? Or can you give
me the basics of what

188
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.560
I would do? So then
I could go and sell

189
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.270
my wife on language, I
think. Cause I want her

190
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.660
to teach me into belly.
Yeah. Well, so what you

191
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.330
are going to do, what
a language Hunter does is

192
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.660
teach themselves a language. You
don't want her to teach.

193
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.010
I don't want her to
teach back a trigger. All

194
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.470
kinds of terrible behaviors and
divorce and yeah. Oh, well,

195
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.610
there's that right? And teach
me to drive, please, honey.

196
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.470
No, what you want is
you don't want to trigger

197
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.580
any classroom habits or anything
that has to do with

198
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.210
the culture of that kind
of learning. What you want

199
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.010
is to have what is
a traditional food activity that

200
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.320
from They make this thing
called Sada out of cornmeal.

201
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.690
They cook it. Is there,
there Any kind of drink?

202
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.100
That's true. No, they're mostly
tea. The tea time would

203
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.680
be very traditional. Like simply
the creation of the tea

204
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.920
time is they're very English
over there. Afternoon tea soup.

205
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.010
It's funny. And it's funny
you say that because that

206
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.330
is our default hunt around
the world and village societies

207
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.780
too. There is a traditional
drink, usually tea, which is

208
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.670
what plants and hot water.
So it's not hard to

209
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.940
invent this on your own
that. And so what we

210
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.070
do is our default hunt
is an empty cup and

211
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.590
a full cup of tea.
And I mean, there's a

212
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.050
teapot, maybe not. And what
we do is we get

213
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.140
really good at that as
our backup. But ideally you

214
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.650
find something that is even
more tuned to that culture

215
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.000
so that the corn meal,
my be an even better

216
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.580
option. But what you do
is you, you do what

217
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.690
we call the tiny hunt.
You put a couple of

218
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.060
cups down and we do
the team. You have a

219
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.220
cup of tea and an
empty cup and you, you

220
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.010
do what we call killing
a ferry. Whenever you translate

221
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.850
from one language to another,
on a sentence by sentence

222
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.480
basis, you're basically word for
word even is even worse.

223
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.230
You're killing fairies. You're claiming
that this sentence in this

224
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:17.610
nuanced, rich cultural idiom on
the left side equals this

225
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.360
sentence and this other nuanced,
rich cultural idiom, that is

226
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.660
probably your cultural idiom so
that you think it makes

227
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.380
an especially rational, logical sense.
And I guarantee you, English

228
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.130
is totally crazy language. You're
really you're killing me. Cause

229
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.110
you're making me feel like
that's exactly what I do.

230
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.890
Well, then that's our instinct.
That's conventional teaching and that,

231
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.420
and all it is is,
you know, it's what we

232
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.820
call a decelerator it just
slows learning down. It doesn't

233
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.800
mean that learning won't happen.
It's just the long way

234
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.620
around the mountain. So we
went short cuts. So what

235
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.250
we do is we, we
want to develop the brain.

236
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.400
So the target language is
Zulu. The Zulu where we,

237
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.710
the end, the belly is
the language with Zulus And

238
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.900
the belly let let's do.
And the belly. Now, the

239
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.170
reason why I take the
belly, not Zulu is because

240
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.840
the first thing you want
to develop is a sense

241
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.790
of the hyper specificity of
what you're hunting. That's interesting

242
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.890
because at the end, the
belly speaker can go to

243
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.500
South Africa and speak and they're
mostly understood, but it's almost

244
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.950
like Spanish and Italian or
Spanish in Spain versus Spanish

245
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.130
in Mexico. There are differences.
There's huge. And not only

246
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.550
that, but then you, if
you say I speak and

247
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.690
a belly, someone won't go,
you're speaking, Zulu wrong, which

248
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.930
happens. I mean, Spanish happens
with Spanish. You're taking Spanish

249
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.560
wrong. There's also status issues.
Lower-class Spanish, right? Hi. You

250
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.540
want to learn the higher
class? No. We want to

251
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:42.460
learn live language. It's always
better than the what? The

252
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.770
common usage language, what they
call standard language. A standardized

253
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.960
language is just a as
linguists, say, as a language

254
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.100
with an army and dialects
don't have the army, right?

255
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:58.310
So what we're doing is
always going for what is

256
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.310
most alive and vivid right
in front of us. And

257
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.550
that's where the fastest learning
will happen. Like the way

258
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.680
that you phrase it, that
it's live because it's in

259
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.670
my house every day, all
day for the last 13

260
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.340
years. Yeah. Right. And so,
and the belly, let's go

261
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.510
back to that hunt, empty
cup, full cup. You're going

262
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.650
to kill that first ferry.
We do this because it's

263
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.260
the hardest thing to hunt
in the beginning. It can

264
00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.630
be done. It might take
you an hour and you

265
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.060
might wonder why you spent
all that effort. I think

266
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.160
it's worth it, but let's
make it easy. So you

267
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.630
just say, how do you
say, what is that in

268
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.330
end of belly, right? Yeah.
So you notice there's not

269
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.220
really any teaching going on.
Someone's just going to tell

270
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.940
you right. And say, what
is that? And then you'll

271
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.430
get the information. And then
you'll just parrot what they

272
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.580
say. This is what we
call copycatting as best as

273
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.150
you can, as closely as
you can. But mumbling a,

274
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.550
we call it, we have
a rule called mumble, close

275
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.310
enough is good enough. Just
parrot it right back at

276
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.320
them. Just like a little
kid and point at one

277
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.110
of the cups, the empty
cup. So what is that

278
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.520
now? What will happen is
the speaker usually go, yeah,

279
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.050
you said it right there.
Is that a thing? But

280
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.540
you just don't that's it?
That was that one ferry

281
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.040
was the last English you're
going to say, and you

282
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.960
stay in the belly and
you go, what is that?

283
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.320
Okay. What is that? Right
in the belly. And sooner

284
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.210
or later, the speaker will
go, Oh right. And you're

285
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.510
pointing at the cup and
the speaker will tell you

286
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.970
that da, da, da. And
so then you parrot that

287
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.510
back and then you get
a question. If, once you

288
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.830
feel you've got a hold
of that, you get a

289
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:32.020
questioning, look on your face
and you know, you really

290
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.930
summon it. Right. And you
pointed the other cup, really

291
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.900
like, look like you have
a question. Some languages don't

292
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.410
have rising intonations like English.
So you can't cheat that

293
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.270
way. So you've really got
to get good at looking

294
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.750
confused. That makes me think
of American sign language, because

295
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.370
that's what we taught the
kids when we did baby

296
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.370
sign language. And the man
was so expressive with his

297
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.100
body. And because we learned
sign language from a man

298
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.130
who was mute Oh, wow.
Right. Is it Portland community

299
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.190
college? And he could not
speak. That's amazing. So he

300
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.370
just would, he would, yeah.
He would slap the table

301
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.830
and he'd put his finger
up and he'd just point.

302
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.890
And he would use his,
it was so I'm like,

303
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.510
Well, absolutely. I I'm actually
a lot of deaf speakers

304
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.740
are my heroes and mentors.
I mean, they're the, some

305
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.040
of the most eloquent and
express the people I've ever

306
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.420
met. I have a mentor,
Raven Sequoia. Who's I mean,

307
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.940
I just, I mean, she
can tell stories in sign

308
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.250
language that just make hair
stand up on your neck

309
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.770
and you, I may not
even know half the signs,

310
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.480
you know, but you know
exactly what's happening. They're so

311
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.960
evocative. So, and, and it's
funny cause you mentioned that

312
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.920
because that's what we do
is we teach sign language

313
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:50.790
in coordination with language hunting,
the sign is not necessary.

314
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.140
You can language hunt without
arms. Right. Okay. But it

315
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.360
is a helper. It is
what we call an accelerator.

316
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.390
And so it's one of
our game rules is if

317
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.620
you can, at all use
gesture to boost the vividness

318
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.710
of what you're doing, especially
pointing at the cup with

319
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.140
your finger. Now you can
point with your lips, her,

320
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.180
you know, with your chin
and in a lot of

321
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.960
cultures, that's actually what they
do. And traditional cultures, it's

322
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.380
rude to point and some
of them. So this is

323
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.130
always tuned for the culture
that you're working with. Even

324
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.770
better learn and to belly
sign and do this, but

325
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.040
so point at the full
cup, what is that? You'll

326
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.260
get an answer to go
back to the empty cup,

327
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.860
you know, impaired it back
As the analytic person in

328
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.820
my mind is thinking, well,
I haven't spoken English anymore.

329
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.860
I've already said, we learned
about what is that? She

330
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.760
said, cup, presumably know, hopefully
she didn't say white or

331
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.510
pattern or China. We don't
know. She said something. And

332
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:52.250
then she might say ETA
ETA, or she might say

333
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.800
full cup or you know,
who knows what? She's I

334
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.600
don't know. I just have
to parrot it back. How

335
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.270
do I know I'm learning?
Oh, you'll find out what's.

336
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.490
This is where it gets
intriguing. Not only I'll have

337
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.250
you already found out, whereas
you're using signs. Cause you're

338
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.640
trying to pair signs up.
If you choose to use

339
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.320
that as a booster, which
I recommend with the, I

340
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.360
mean, and a belly, it
may be like that as

341
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.480
what it might be. That
what, what that is that

342
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.000
what you know, who knows?
Right? So, but when you

343
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.540
get your answers, when you
find out, because what disappears

344
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.270
and it's filled in with
the word that is either

345
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.720
cup empty cup or whatever,
right? The noun now an

346
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.430
adjective segment is appears on
what disappears and bam. Now

347
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.560
you at the very least
know which, which signed a

348
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.520
pair with that sound right.
Easier. What sign in ASL?

349
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.240
So this is what happens.
It's like a, what happens

350
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.010
is rather than analyzing over
and over and over, you

351
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.200
have this sort of shooting
from the hip sense of

352
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.190
what's going on and everything
is like an educated guess.

353
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.780
It's like solving a mystery
and you can make things

354
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:07.130
clearer by having better props.
The best possible setup is

355
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.000
the same colored cup, the
exact same shape. Now, if

356
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.430
you have an empty white
cup and a full black

357
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.630
cup, you've set yourself up
a headache, right? So empty

358
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.830
white cup, empty, full cup,
exact same designed cup. Right.

359
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.240
And you know, the table,
maybe you've got a very

360
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.170
clean tablecloth with nothing and
nothing else there. Right? Maybe

361
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.910
there's a fork next to
your cup. What does she

362
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.330
know what you're pointing at?
Right. So you, you ask,

363
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.160
you know, you point at
the empty cup and you

364
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.550
say, well, what is that?
And she tells you again,

365
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.490
and you get your affirmation.
And 90% of language hunting

366
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.520
is verifying that, you know
what you know? Right. So

367
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.500
lots of, and then you
ask you with your questioning.

368
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.100
Look, you make the statement.
That is an empty cup,

369
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:59.650
but with a questioning look
okay now hopefully you'll get

370
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.410
a yes. Oh. And then
you've learned yes. Then you've

371
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:06.390
learned. Yeah. Okay. Now if
We'll get the right reaction,

372
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.980
what you can do is
go to the full cup.

373
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.380
And then you say that
is an empty cup with

374
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.780
your questioning. Look, and then
she'll get it. She'll be

375
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.500
like, Oh no, that is
not an empty cup. That

376
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.230
is a full cup. So
you get, no, you get

377
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.680
a negated full sentence. And
then you get an Afro

378
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.910
affirmative sense sentence. So this
is how piece by piece,

379
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.120
we build up our fluent
conversation, right? From the get

380
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.590
go. I'm a big fan
of learning. Hello, goodbye, niceties.

381
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.840
Like please, thank you. Excuse
me. Which not all languages

382
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.120
have. And the same way
English has. So keep that

383
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.980
in mind. But, but those
are easy. Just looking at

384
00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.210
phrasebook and test them out.
And you can, you know,

385
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.030
you don't have to hunt
those per se, but this

386
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.420
structure part is what you're
hunting. So you've gotten a

387
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.560
geisha and you've gotten full
sentence next. You know, you're

388
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.100
looked down the road towards
mastering this language. And as

389
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.590
you look down that your
net, your next job, you,

390
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.440
this is the what conversation
you now want to master

391
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.530
all the rest of the
questions of journalism. Who, what,

392
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.740
when, where, why, how we
include, how many in there

393
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.870
and what happened is the
capper to this hunt. And

394
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.180
once you can answer all
those questions, you can pretty

395
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.390
much get all your survival
needs met really well in

396
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.900
the language. And your next
task is going to be

397
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.160
to stack sentences together and
tell stories and the past

398
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.960
president future. And it continues,
right? So you can hunt

399
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.200
your way towards just like
a child does towards complete

400
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.470
deep, eloquent fluency in a
language at the highest levels

401
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:46.350
of proficiency without ever going
into English and learning all

402
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:51.930
the cultural elements that belong
to all those conversations. Right?

403
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.810
So you'll learn how to
fill like an Irish. I've

404
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.970
learned how to fill a
cup of tea, right? There's

405
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.470
a right way to fill
a couple of a cup

406
00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.020
of tea. And, and you
may or may not know

407
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.210
that you need to actually
put in the hot water

408
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.370
and the tea cup of
warm it up, and then

409
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.800
you throw that away. Cause,
and then you fill it

410
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.730
up with your tea water.
Now that's a well filled

411
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.210
cup of tea, right? So
you learn in hunting the

412
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.460
language. You start to learn
all these, these, these social

413
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:25.140
niceties and courtships and setups
and agreements that are critical

414
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.460
towards good relationships with other
people who are native speakers.

415
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.910
That language. See, that's interesting.
When, when we have tea

416
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.760
at home, we just, we
just have tea. But when,

417
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.200
when other end the belly,
people come over, suddenly my

418
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.170
wife who I, you know,
I, I realized that she's

419
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:47.480
African, but she's also right.
When, when the elders come

420
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.540
over, suddenly she's got a
towel over her arm and

421
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.060
a big bull and she's
pouring hot water onto their

422
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.960
hands. And she she'll take
the bowl to them and

423
00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.170
wash their hands. And that
happens all before the tea.

424
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.140
Wow. And then when she
serves the tea, there's an

425
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.680
invisible pecking order. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. You know, elder male,

426
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.830
elder female, the little kids
come last, you know, the

427
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.950
host versus the hostess, all
those kinds of things. If

428
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.320
I was applying language hunting
to those things, it would

429
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.940
take longer. But certainly I
would be able to pick

430
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.800
up all those different things
about the pecking order And

431
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.400
really what you've just described
as an immaculate design of

432
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.140
a relationship. What's funny about
language hunting is it ends

433
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:34.480
up being a relationship hunting
and every culture has these

434
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:40.450
setups. What we call them,
these designs were easy, effective,

435
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:48.190
genuine, impactful, positive interactions can
happen between elders and those

436
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.960
who are younger to build
communities, build families. And you'll

437
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.870
notice when I talk about
how you want those cups

438
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.110
the same, and there's the
simple difference. And then, and

439
00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.630
how great he hated the
progression is. And that in

440
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:06.070
that same handwashing and the
pecking order, it's also present

441
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.110
there as you get deeper
into culture, you realize a

442
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.630
lot of these designs have
been done for you, right.

443
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.490
That you can buy it
through observing. You can, you

444
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:19.840
can see how these rituals
work and then piggyback on

445
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.640
them. That's very cool. So,
so do I, as the

446
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.190
person who wants to learn,
drive the discussion in, because

447
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.530
presumably the person who I
want to learn a language

448
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.750
from given that we're pretending
that they don't speak English.

449
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.080
Yeah. They're the, they're who
I pull the information from.

450
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.940
I mean, they're not driving
it, so I've done the

451
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.940
MTT now what, like how
do I drive the conversation

452
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.560
forward? Oh, well you just
keep asking those questions. If,

453
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:52.330
if there's, if it's already
been laid out an obvious

454
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.580
fashion, that one of those
cups is yours, and one

455
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.650
of those cups is hers.
You can move to mine,

456
00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.610
yours through pantomime and you
know, just use your imagination

457
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.340
or watch kids arguing over
this is mine and that

458
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.680
is yours. And you'll get
how to make those signs.

459
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.520
Right? These are all very
human behaviors. It's we, we

460
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.210
haven't reinvented the wheel then,
you know, once you've done

461
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:16.810
that, then the next thing
is to ask the where

462
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.930
question, which can be as
easy as this is one.

463
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:24.340
Usually people either invent themselves
or guests or we show

464
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.600
them and then they go,
why didn't I think of

465
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.670
that? You just put the
cup under the table. Right?

466
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.770
And then you act like
you can't find your cup.

467
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.810
I was trying to figure
out like, how am I

468
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.820
going to hide that? It
was very easy. And then

469
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.940
you start, you know, mumbling,
dah, dah, dah, dah, empty

470
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.950
cup, dah, dah, dah. You
know, like you don't have

471
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.940
words, empty cup and on
the belly empty cup and

472
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.420
the Valley. And then what
happens just like we do

473
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.770
with children, the, the, your
wife will say, Oh, you

474
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.950
want to know where the
cup is, right? Oh. Or,

475
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.590
Oh, where is the cup?
It's under the table. And

476
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.020
so you, you manage through
trial and error to fish

477
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.200
out the part that where
is, where's the cup and

478
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.590
you all, do you also
get freebies, right? So if

479
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.470
you're quick enough language Hunter,
you actually will be able

480
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.510
to catch that. You want
to know where the cup

481
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.290
is. And then it gets
compressed when she sees you're

482
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.630
confused where the cup is,
but now, you know, do

483
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.840
you want to know, right?
You make a guess. I

484
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.790
mean, what was she, what
did she say? You know,

485
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.220
what else could she have
said, this is basically Sherlock

486
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.940
Holmes when you've eliminated the
impossible, what is left? No

487
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.580
matter how improbable must be
the answer. Right? And that's

488
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.900
language hunting. It's it's language
acquisition through inference and play

489
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.740
and speaking, right? So it's,
it's supercharge. It really is

490
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.060
mystery solving. It has a
directiveness. You're basically describing how

491
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.490
I taught my kids English
in the last five years,

492
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.950
except I do this in
a directed hour a day.

493
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.580
And this brings us back
to why adults are far

494
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:57.470
better language learners than children,
because children are wonderful. I

495
00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:01.460
would say children are not
amazing language learners. Children are

496
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.720
inevitable. Language learners. Adults are
amazing language learners, but they

497
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.920
are not inevitable language learners.
So it takes a, a

498
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.450
child from the day they're
born, about 20 years to

499
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.720
reach a college level ability
in their language. And I'm

500
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.450
not talking college level language
class, but I can go

501
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:24.740
to an English speaking university
and hold my own. Right,

502
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.650
right. It takes 20 years
to get there. Maybe not

503
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.280
maybe 18, if they're precocious,
super precocious, maybe 11, you

504
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.310
know, some geniuses. Right. But
really it takes about 20

505
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:39.020
years. You or I go
to France study at a

506
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.450
university for four years. I
think we're going to be

507
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.150
pretty far along. We'll be
there for years. We know

508
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.880
we've met these people. They're
everywhere. I was reading about

509
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.390
this Canadian guy who apparently
is like the biggest thing

510
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.700
in China. Yeah. He has.
I think his name is

511
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.160
dash Shan. And he's only
been there for like 10

512
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.740
years. And he's like, he
owns Chinese TV. Like you

513
00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.720
want a white guy in
China on TV. He's your

514
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.660
guy. Yeah. But we're all
the time. We're sending our

515
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.030
college level kids overseas to
learn a language. And they're

516
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:09.680
coming back, having taken college
classes immersed in that target

517
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.560
language. They're at a college
level ability. It took them

518
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.980
two years, three years, four
years to get where it

519
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.310
took that baby 20 years.
Right. So the reason is

520
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.530
the reason why kids inevitably
learn, but adults are amazing

521
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:29.000
at learning. Is kids have
the, have a capacity for

522
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.470
play and play is a
killer language or a killer

523
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:38.870
learning accelerator. Right? You really
can't beat it. So as

524
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:45.420
successful adults who, who decides
that they picked up their

525
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.070
target language and goes for
it is going to wire

526
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:53.860
place somehow into that and
build on that. And the

527
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:59.560
more they build on the
other things children do. And,

528
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.440
and to keep that ability
honed like children have a

529
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.890
willingness to say it incorrectly.
Children have a willingness to

530
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.720
try out a statement that
they know and a whole

531
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.000
bunch of different contexts. My
daughter is doing this she's

532
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.740
two and a half. And
she's like, is this mine?

533
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.860
Oh yes. Is it yours?
No. Is it moms? No.

534
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.250
Is it my brothers? No,
isn't mine. Yes. Right. And

535
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.690
that's scientists who study learning.
I have words for that

536
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.450
and it's called a variety
and interleaving where we're all

537
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:30.910
constantly interweaving and the wiring
together, different experiences and different

538
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.760
colors of the same knowledge.
Right. And it makes her

539
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.540
stronger capacity in the brain
to express that ability and

540
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.450
knowledge. So you take that,
you turn it into a

541
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.300
set of rules, right? And
you gain the rules, you

542
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.780
find shortcuts and cheats. This
is something children can't necessarily

543
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.070
do. They don't develop their
mind thinking about thinking, learning

544
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.800
about learning, you know, until
like, I don't know, 10,

545
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.390
11, 12. So when, you
know, when a college age

546
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.980
learner and adult, wow, there's
some powerful ability to still

547
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.250
be that sort of crazy,
crazy echoes from childhood in

548
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.590
their teen years or full
of play and energy are

549
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.680
still there, but the adult
MetaMind is strongly built and

550
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.230
you get some of your
strongest language learning and strongest

551
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.740
memories from those college years,
which are super impactful years

552
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.320
for learning because of that
play and a MetaMind are

553
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.780
at their peak. You know,
it's like a Venn diagram,

554
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:29.920
so I'm 39 and I'm,
I'm still fairly proud of

555
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.010
my ability to learn languages.
And it's because I I've

556
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:36.280
cultivated that sense of play
willingness to make mistakes. And

557
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.520
I game it, I learn
about learning. I make rules

558
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.490
about how I learn and
swap them with other language

559
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.210
hunters, which is where the
most exciting language learning happens

560
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.360
when you are learning. And
Dibeli from a fellow language

561
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.020
Hunter. I mean, geez, what
could have taken weeks takes

562
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:58.000
hours? You know, I mean
your hair's flying, but even

563
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.940
then, even with a, you
know, language hunting was designed

564
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.000
for an elder speaker who
may be hard of hearing,

565
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.430
maybe bitter about their language.
Maybe they were beaten it

566
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.800
beaten for speaking it when
they were young, put in

567
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.770
a residential school, language, hunting
was designed for that most

568
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:15.130
challenging of contexts. How can
I create the most ease

569
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.560
and safety and comfort and
play in that situation? And

570
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.320
like I say, because of
that, because of the intensity

571
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.250
of that challenge, it's almost
like rocket engines on a

572
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.370
stock car for, you know,
like a language where, Hey,

573
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.100
we're good friends. Let's just
learn some, you know, Ethiopian,

574
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.340
This is cool. This makes
me feel like I'm going

575
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.810
to be able to like,
literally, I feel like I'm

576
00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.860
going to build a go.
And re-energized my, with my

577
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.910
mother-in-law who lives with us,
who may not feel that

578
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.210
there's value in what she
knows. But then from the

579
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.610
point of view of me
as the language Hunter, she

580
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:54.050
is just walking, talking valuable,
right? She's the living language.

581
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.560
She's in my house every
day. That's exactly. I think

582
00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.990
how I see elder speakers
all the time. I mean,

583
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.240
it's funny. I meet, I
meet someone who speaks a

584
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.290
fascinating small language. And I
mean, I like that Estonian

585
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:09.040
speaker at this conference. And
I, I realize he's in

586
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.740
Portland, which, I mean, this
never happens, like go to

587
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.870
conferences around the world. And
I'm like, Oh, well, that's

588
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.630
great. You speak loud via,
and that's wonderful. You know,

589
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.250
I'm never going to see
you again. So we'll do

590
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.520
a tiny hunt and goodbye,
you know, but, and I

591
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.550
get so excited because it's,
it's an opportunity to develop

592
00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:27.310
that relationship and they are
this treasure house and every

593
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:31.960
language gives you another way
of experiencing the world, which

594
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:36.160
more and more research is
coming out, showing how the

595
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.530
more languages, you know, the
more flexible and healthy your

596
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.260
brain and the more tools
you have in your toolbox

597
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:48.310
for troubleshooting your world And
empathy for other cultural empathy

598
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.340
and yeah. All the good
stuff. Good stuff. Well, that's

599
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.770
fantastic. So people can learn
about this at language hunters,

600
00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:57.430
Language Hunter's dot org. We
have a Google group. We

601
00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:02.830
have, there's a blog dot
language, hunters.org. Yeah. I mean

602
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.770
there's, and we invite you
to participate in the community,

603
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:10.030
help us improve the ever-growing
system of rules, ask your

604
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:14.770
questions. You know, it really
is. It's a, you know,

605
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:18.940
a creative commons kind of
system players from around the

606
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.110
world are retooling the rules
for their own context for

607
00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:26.050
their own languages. Every language
has, has, it has its

608
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:29.350
own set of challenges that
you have to point these

609
00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.600
rules at to, to iterate
on and to improve on.

610
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.850
And this also sounds like
a fun activity for sure.

611
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.170
Yeah, absolutely. We're actually, we're
a locally here in Portland.

612
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.720
We're teaching every week we
do Irish, Russian and Spanish

613
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:52.360
in local schools. And it's
really hilarious actually, the, we

614
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.980
did three months of Russian
and then I had my

615
00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.640
Russian instructor and I decided,
Oh, now I will teach

616
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.310
them to write and Russian.
Right. And so there was

617
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.830
no Russian writing at all
for three months, it was

618
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.180
all just conversation and those
hunts, right. And then we

619
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.000
got to the writing and
it was like this alphabet.

620
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.820
That's supposed to be difficult.
The Cyrillic alphabet with backwards

621
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.720
RS and Greek Greek letters.
And it just flew off

622
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.110
the page. And the first
half hour, the kids were

623
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:26.910
writing fluent, perfect sentences without
a single error. I mean

624
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.090
like 99 out of a
hundred sentences were written without

625
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.090
a single error. And I
mean, that's the kind of

626
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.310
thing that could happen because
they already knew it. They

627
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:40.830
already knew how to English.
So they knew how alphabets

628
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.880
work Three months, one day
a week, they were learning

629
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.900
One, two hours a week,
Two hours a week. Was

630
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.910
it two, one hour sessions?
I'm curious about two hour

631
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.910
to one hour session. And
after three months, it's just

632
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.450
kind of to conclude here.
You've got a teenager, who's

633
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:59.780
got some Russian now Actually
younger kids. So it's really

634
00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.160
it's. So remember what I
said about the Metta mines,

635
00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.140
right? It was difficult is
it's ironically, it's more challenging

636
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:13.220
with them. Ideally we'd have
an immersion environment multi-age scenario,

637
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.520
but this was nine to
11 year olds. So you

638
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.680
kind of straddling that the
Metta minds are just starting

639
00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.410
to develop, but even in
spite of that, yeah. I

640
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:25.400
mean, we had, we had
what we call and we

641
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.810
address asked and answered all
those journalism questions. We'd gotten

642
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.760
to the point where we
could take field trips to

643
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.710
buy bus tickets, max tickets.
Right? Yep. That's what I

644
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.330
wanna understand. How far could
they go? You take an

645
00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.100
11 year old. They could
do what with it, get

646
00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.990
on the bus. Those would
all be new. How hunts

647
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.460
and keep in mind. But
yes, they, you know, they,

648
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:53.510
they could get on the
bus. They could, they, they

649
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.360
can count. They can ask
how you're doing. They can

650
00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.280
find things they can ask.
Why do you want this?

651
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.670
Why do you have that?
They can trade objects. They

652
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.520
can get their needs met
as we say, well, right.

653
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.400
So without struggle, they can
get their survival needs met.

654
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.010
And if they ever don't
have a word, nouns are

655
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.400
cheap. Cheap. All you have
to say is what is

656
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.930
that thoughts? Right in Russian?
You know, what is that?

657
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:24.230
It's that easy. Well, that's
what it is. So, and

658
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.790
then they've got the noun
and then they slip it

659
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:29.990
into a sentence they're already
fluent. And so it's, we,

660
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.600
this is one of our
tricks are cheats. That little

661
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.570
kids don't necessarily know, little
kids want to ask, what

662
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.780
is everything? We know that
in the beginning, you want

663
00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.180
to start with a couple
of cups. So in that

664
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.940
hunt, how many nouns, where's
it, wasn't that hunt. I

665
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.360
gave you what the full
cup, empty cup. Two, one

666
00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.330
really cup and T maybe,
I guess it depends on

667
00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.910
whether the speaker brings it
up. That's a good point.

668
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.490
So I half the time
they, it is, it ends

669
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:57.290
up being an empty cup
and a cup of tea.

670
00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.560
But the other half of
the time, it's just two

671
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.840
cups. One is empty, one
is full. And so you

672
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.820
can whittle it down to
even just one now and

673
00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.840
in two adjectives and then
get a conversation going. And,

674
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.500
you know, you grow from
there. Sure. But that's one

675
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.140
of our cheats. We call
it it's vertical slicing. It's

676
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:19.910
exact same thing as vertical
slicing children, horizontally, horizontally slice.

677
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.100
So they go for a
sea of language where we

678
00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.160
go for one fluid stability
at a time. Well, this

679
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.810
is very, very cool. Thank
you so much for chatting

680
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.090
with me. Yeah. Thanks, God.
All right. Well, you can

681
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.040
get all those links on
the show notes and check

682
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.170
out language hunters dot Oregon.
Of course go Googling for

683
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.710
language hunters and you'll find
videos and resources. Join the

684
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.920
