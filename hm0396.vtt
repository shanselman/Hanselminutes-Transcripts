8
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.950
Scott talks with Chris dancy
about the quantified self. Hi,

9
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.870
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

10
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.020
minutes. And I'm talking with
Chris dancy who wired called

11
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.200
the quantified man. And how
are you? Right? They actually,

12
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.180
the headline was the, what
was it? The obsolete tech

13
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.140
worker, obsolete tech worker, the
absolute tech worker who rebuilt

14
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.120
his life. But inside, they
called me the quantified man.

15
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.280
And they had like a,
a video hangout on their

16
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.980
YouTube channel where people threw
vitriol at me that I

17
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.040
was some type of digital
Satan. But yeah, Well, let's

18
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.920
explore why you're a digital
Satan. I know, I know

19
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.090
that I have. So what
does it mean to be

20
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.880
quantified? I, I think it
means to measure lots of

21
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.780
things about yourself and as
a diabetic, I've got my

22
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
Fitbit, I've got my blood
sugar meter. I've got my

23
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.080
continuous glucose meter and I've
got my insulin pump. So

24
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.860
amongst my peers, I'm pretty
darn quantified. You are pretty

25
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.790
darn quantified. I met you
on an airplane though, either

26
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.270
going to, or coming from
South by Southwest, I was

27
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.770
so excited. And then I
met you and then I

28
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.430
got even more excited And
you have a lot more

29
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.340
data about yourself and your
movements and the things that

30
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.800
you do then. Yes. And
actually I was just at

31
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.620
a conference called defrag, which
has a API developer, or

32
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.780
it's a kind of a
developer kind of smart. So

33
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.250
I don't know what kind
of conference it is. I'm

34
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.540
not gonna pretend like I
know what I'm talking about.

35
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.750
And I was finally asked
a question. No, one's asked

36
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.550
me in two years because
I came out, I went

37
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.500
to cyborg camp two years
ago and then came out

38
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.140
of my data closet by
accident. And when I showed

39
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.210
somebody something, but somebody said
to me, how much data

40
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.320
do you have on yourself?
And I said, what do

41
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.670
you mean? And I'm like,
you know, you have all

42
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.060
these systems clicked and down.
So I guess I'll officially

43
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.980
sign your show. Cause you've
got a really cool show

44
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.610
here. I officially have 14
terabytes for four years of

45
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.390
text data on everything from,
did I take a screenshot

46
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.340
to what song did I
listen to to how much

47
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.940
did I walk to you
name it? How many times

48
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.950
did I use the restroom?
I mean, but it's all

49
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.220
for me, it's all low
friction, right? So no work

50
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.380
involved, right? I have to
just live my life. I

51
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.150
have to be on the
air with you and data

52
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.970
has to be collected. And,
and that has to then

53
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.340
be presented to me in
a way that's searchable in

54
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.520
a way that's visual. I
use a Google calendar for

55
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.350
the visual. I tied it
all to Maslow's hierarchy of

56
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.350
needs. And then I'll ultimately,
I've been playing around with

57
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.020
Stanford steep learning engine to
dump large chunks of it

58
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.300
in there to find out
what I can get. Okay.

59
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.840
So let's, let's back up
and then we'll close. Sorry,

60
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.490
this is good though. This
is why that's what I'm

61
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.530
here for. Let's take this
apart a little bit at

62
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.520
a time. So quantification, self
quantification, this, the idea that

63
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.280
I'm going to do passive
things, whether it be wearing

64
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.770
a wristband or carrying a
phone in my pocket, you're

65
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.970
probably excited about the iPhone
motion processor and you simply

66
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.460
live your life. You're not
like keeping a log book

67
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.520
or checking a box. You're
not being obsessive, your wellbeing,

68
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.640
obsessive compulsive, but you're not
being actively put obsessive compulsive.

69
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.220
Yeah. So I think that's,
there are a lot of

70
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.270
QSRs that don't find me
to be particularly appealing. What

71
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.010
was that term? You just
said quantified softwares. They call

72
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.770
them QSRs. Okay. There are
a lot of, because I

73
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.290
don't do the work, right.
I'm not sitting in, logging

74
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.660
in QS is beautiful because
these people have taken time

75
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.570
to really document and capture
large portions of their life.

76
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.090
They got journals that are
just very intricate, looks like

77
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.340
something DaVinci would create. And
then they turn them in

78
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.280
these beautiful art projects, young
going to New York city this

79
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.130
weekend to see Nicholas Fenton's,
he's having a sale. And

80
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.060
he gets really into personal
data art for me, I

81
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.550
don't have time. So, you
know, if I can set

82
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.280
up a routine to collect
some information in the background,

83
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.230
then that's good for me.
And if I believe that

84
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.720
information can be harvested and
used in some amazing ways,

85
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.730
and we're starting to see
that that's actually what's happening,

86
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.910
especially when you know, more
people talk about internet of

87
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.520
things and more people talk
about quantified self. You know,

88
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.920
my whole thing is if
you take the quantified self

89
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.550
at a very low friction,
mom's just baking cookies and

90
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.500
you take the internet of
things, the kitchens just doing

91
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.840
things. Don't mom and you
marry those two pieces of

92
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.540
data together. You have what
I call existence as a

93
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.950
platform Existence as a platform.
Now, how is this different

94
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.660
or how does this relate
to the kind of life

95
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.600
logging where you see like
different researchers go and plug

96
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.180
cameras in, or they wear
something around their neck and

97
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.270
they're, they're filming and they're
recording. They're like TiVo in

98
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.540
their entire existence. And they
put, and now he's put

99
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.010
on the Google glass. So
they are complimentary things. Yeah,

100
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.320
I think there's definitely, there
seems. I mean, I was

101
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.060
just at the QS conference.
I did one of their

102
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.180
little keynotes two weeks ago
and there definitely seems to

103
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.510
be some overlap, although no
one's willing to come out

104
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.600
and say what the difference
is, you know, that's, that's

105
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.400
cool. It seems to me
that the difference is measurement

106
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.580
is different to me and
measurement and data mining is

107
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.820
different from a recording of
the, I almost had a

108
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.070
thought there. I'm trying to
say that like keeping a

109
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.370
bunch of data time-based data
seems different to me than

110
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.700
just running a surveillance camera.
Yeah. So the opposites Lifelogging

111
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.580
really at its essence is
the, is surveillance inside out,

112
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.150
which is in French is
called Seuss valence. And when

113
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.170
you, when you freaking awesome
word, thank you. And when

114
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.580
you, when you kind of
record and capture, you know,

115
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.700
when, when, when you are
the camera, I think that's

116
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.320
important. And I think in
some ways, you know, Google

117
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.000
glass, all these other silly
things that are out right

118
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.810
now, I'm, I'm, I'm a
modal user to, sorry, it's

119
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.910
now called narrative, which is
a little camera that clips

120
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.420
to your shirt, those people,
you know, I think that's

121
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.550
really interesting. I think that's
a great way. I think

122
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.980
it should be even easier.
So a device that I

123
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.230
love that hasn't come out
yet, but it's on, Kickstarter's

124
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.170
called capture with a K,
but like, pretend you and

125
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.640
I are just talking right
now. And you say something

126
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.190
really amazing. Like you always
do, like earlier healthcare is

127
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.180
my mortgage. I can just
tap the wrist. And the

128
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.200
capture's passively recording all the
time, which, you know, people

129
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.240
should be more worried about
these devices, not Google glass,

130
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.550
but if it's, and then
you, you know, your kid

131
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.680
says something amazing, just tap
it in. And that captures

132
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.150
it. Right. That's so powerful.
Right. So I think lifelogging

133
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.810
is really cool. And you
know, people have called called

134
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.430
me a light flogger. I
really believe that the, you

135
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.460
know, there's too many people
out of work. There's too

136
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.260
many people who are underemployed
and there's gonna be people

137
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.990
who are confused about what
will be around in five,

138
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.620
six, 10 years. And if
we don't use personal information

139
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.090
like solar energy as a
renewable source, both for yourself

140
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.560
and for your environment, I
just think we're doomed. Well,

141
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.190
I think that the, the
essence, the essence there that

142
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.580
I think is most important
is that to simply log

143
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.820
stuff for logging sake, could
arguably be called a compulsion

144
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.800
or obsessive compulsive. And that's
what they said on YouTube.

145
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.510
Then when I did the
wired thing, I was, I

146
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.690
was OCD or something. Well,
and whether you are or

147
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.450
not, I think you probably
are. But I would also

148
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.850
say that that's why you're
successful. I know for a

149
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.160
fact that I have OCD
tendencies and that's why I'm

150
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.040
a good diabetic. Yeah. If
I didn't, I've been smart.

151
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.130
I've been checking my blood
sugar 10 times a day

152
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.310
for 20 years. You know
what I mean? And I

153
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.980
like to like pause and
let the gravity toss of

154
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.960
that, like sink in, you
know, it's not my I'm

155
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.310
not looking for Let's do
it again. Yeah. But how

156
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.370
many times a day, 10
times a day for 20

157
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.880
years. Two years. Yeah. The
thing is once you've reached

158
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.280
40 and beyond, then you
get to start saying 20

159
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.200
years, like it's a big
deal, which is great. If

160
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.380
kids are in their twenties,
you know, since before you

161
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.410
were born son, I'm really
looking forward to saying that.

162
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.280
But my point is, if
I didn't have a little

163
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.280
bit of OCD, I wouldn't
keep it up. Right. You

164
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.710
would get fatigue, you get
info, fatigue. I have no

165
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.200
problem with being, you know,
being labeled OCD. I think

166
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.910
the problem I have with
when people use that term

167
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.760
and unrelated to this conversation
is we as a culture,

168
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.110
you know, I know there's
a lot of talk about

169
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.020
right now, women in tech
and massage, you know, misogyny

170
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.820
and also the kind of
stuff I wish we'd stop

171
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.550
abusing like mental health terms
as like, just throw away

172
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.450
things point, there needs to
be another word I'm not

173
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.990
calling you on the carpet.
And just like, I'm so

174
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.700
tired. Oh, I'm ADHD. I'm
like, I don't know if

175
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.610
maybe, or, you know, another
one I'm bipolar. I'm like,

176
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.080
I don't know. Maybe if
you knew someone who was

177
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.820
bipolar, it wouldn't be a
joke. Do you know? That's

178
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.890
a very valid point. A
lot of people I know

179
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.200
are saying that, Oh yeah,
I think I may have

180
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.980
adult ADHD. I say, you
know, I think you probably

181
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.520
just have internet. Yeah. You
just have internet at your

182
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.600
house. Really? What I do
with my information is create

183
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:08.090
inner net. Ooh. You're just
dropping the knowledge. Okay. So

184
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.960
that's what it's about. You're
absolutely right. Internet, right? All

185
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.560
we have left is the
inner man Internet, right? This

186
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.970
is important because it's one
thing to, to have OCD

187
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.680
or we need to find
a non mental health related

188
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.110
way to say no, but
I think it's a valid

189
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.900
point, but it's another thing
to use that data. Now,

190
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.050
my point is I talked
to other diabetics a lot.

191
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm using diabetes as the
example. Cause that's what I

192
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.150
understand. And they'll say, well,
what do you use to

193
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.970
log? And I said, well,
I don't actually save the

194
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.440
data. I save a window
of it. So for me,

195
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.570
the logging created psychic weight
and stressed me out. And

196
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.270
I know that there is
a log available and I

197
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.370
could look at the last
year, two years, five years

198
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.670
and do something about it.
But ultimately the momentary, the

199
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.780
instantaneous stress of diabetes is
more important to me. So

200
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.610
I have a window of
about five hours that I

201
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.590
care about and I care
about it down to the

202
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.880
minute. It's your life and
death. But After that, I

203
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.250
don't really care how I
did yesterday. Yeah. So I

204
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.560
mean, I think people also
think that I, you know,

205
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.770
I review, you know, all
of this data about my

206
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.200
life. I'm exactly like you,
I could care less. You

207
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.660
know, where it comes in
handy is when I need

208
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.890
something situationally. When did you
talk to Scott or really

209
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.770
cool stuff. When, when, when
did you, when was your

210
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.790
voice above 71 decibels? So
when you can Google the

211
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.290
inner net, there you go.
It becomes, See, that's interesting

212
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.260
now, funny story, and this
is true because, and this

213
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.870
is again the tiny quantified
self talking to the actual

214
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.570
clinic itself. My wife and
I are at this noodle

215
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.460
place. And she's, and I'm
like, we have not been

216
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.280
here since March. And I'm
like, no, no, we were

217
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.740
here. We were here in
June and we have that

218
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.440
kind of standard, you know,
a marital argument. And I

219
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.910
was like, no, I'm pretty
sure we were here. She's

220
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.520
like, no, you're insane. It's
like, okay, well you're taking

221
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.850
this way too seriously. So
I bring up Foursquare and

222
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.280
I show her the check-in,
I just scroll back and

223
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.290
I go, no, here we
were. And here's the time.

224
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.600
And she goes, Oh wow.
You know where we were

225
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.100
at all times. And I
was like, well, I mean,

226
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.400
anything important? Like I don't
know where I was between

227
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.650
this noodle place and the
gas station, but I know

228
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.440
where I checked in. Right.
There is proof that we

229
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.910
were there and that stopped
the argument. It was kind

230
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.400
of cool. I had actually
forgotten about it. I do

231
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.770
that maybe twice. I don't
think GPS has actually to

232
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.840
get us places it's to
keep the people sitting next

233
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.930
to us. Quiet. Yeah. I,
I really liked that Tech

234
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.670
tech has a weapon. I
don't know why we just

235
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.850
don't explore that. You know,
I started as swears. Yeah.

236
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.770
Yeah. I appreciate that. We
don't work blue here on

237
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.130
Hansel minutes. Yeah. So that
was another thing where I

238
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.970
didn't realize that I'd been
passively collecting the state. I

239
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.820
like, I like being mayor.
That's why I do Foursquare.

240
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.920
Like my kids are Good
example passively. There's an app

241
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.500
called moves and it's on
iOS. It's on Android. It's

242
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.270
probably on windows phone by
now. It's probably on everything.

243
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.880
I don't know, but it
passively collects movement and stuff.

244
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.440
So you don't actually have
to wear trackers and stuff.

245
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.030
Oh, I just want the
ones I love, but they've

246
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.860
opened up the backend of
their API so people can

247
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.590
develop for it. And there's
this one called moves export.

248
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:12.040
I found the other week,
which checks you in frictionlessly,

249
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.010
behind the background into Foursquare.
And what's nice about that.

250
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.770
Frictionless checking is for what
you talked about. My fear

251
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.260
though, is, you know, again,
you have all this brilliant

252
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.260
data about yourself and where
you've been when you were

253
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.690
mayor and you literally have
no access to it. I

254
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.060
always say to someone literally
go to Facebook and show

255
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.160
me what you posted last
week. They're like, I'd rather

256
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.110
rip out my legs, you
know, rip off my face,

257
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.840
you know? And there was
no easy way for people

258
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.780
to have what I call
perspective as a service. Where

259
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.540
is my information and why
can't I see it it's

260
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.170
important to me right now.
We, we totally ruined file

261
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.220
systems. We had hierarchies of
folders network connected drives. Oh,

262
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.110
I didn't know. Let's go
crazy. All right, let's create

263
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.270
the internet and put stuff
all over the place. And

264
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.280
if we don't somehow get
a handle on our personal

265
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.720
information, you know, you're misspelling,
something is going to seem

266
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.910
like, you know, a word
document in a folders can

267
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.860
seem like the least of
our problems when you can't

268
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.140
find out when Rocco, my
dog has seizures. When was

269
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.390
his last seizure? You know,
I've got two things, right?

270
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.340
I've got a tracker on
his neck and then I've

271
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.530
got an ambient noise sensor
in the living room. So

272
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.090
I can tell you, you
know, I can triangulate that

273
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.330
sort of thing. So I
get really passionate about why

274
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.250
it's so important for people
to at least have access

275
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.250
to their dads. Right. And
it's very frustrating that we

276
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.190
can Google the entire internet
in a second. But can't

277
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.230
tell me anything about yesterday.
Yeah. I have no idea

278
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.000
what's going to happen or
I can't, you know, search

279
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.730
outlook in less than five
minutes and have a crash.

280
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.280
Just show me, Show me
the documents you opened yesterday.

281
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.280
Yeah, that's a good point.
That's a good point. I

282
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.380
got it. I've got a
ton of them. This is

283
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.490
the analysis of what's going
on at work is people

284
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.190
always say, Oh, my work,
my job, my work, my

285
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.500
job, no one comes. Gentleman
can, don't get, show me

286
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.110
what they do for work.
And the only quantified ways

287
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.360
we have work are my
Andre emails on my appointments.

288
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.550
I don't know. Here's the
thing you may not know

289
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.890
about. This is, this is
funny. There's a buddy of

290
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.350
mine who has an Apple.
It's tough. Sorry. Say it

291
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.410
again. You know, cool stuff.
I don't know. Some stuff.

292
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.480
Check this out. This application
called time. Snapper is a

293
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.080
background screenshot maker. Do you
know about this? Well, I

294
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.850
don't know about the app,
the concept that they use

295
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.460
in oDesk. So if you
hire someone for a micro

296
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.410
task, one of the ways
you can monitor them is

297
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.960
through constant screenshots. Okay. So
if you have like a

298
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.220
virtual assistant or whatever, you
can see what they're really,

299
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.080
if they're really on Facebook,
are they really doing the

300
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.350
job? Yeah. So when you're,
when you're an independent consultant

301
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.390
and you're doing your timecards,
it's like, well, what was

302
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.580
I doing at three o'clock?
Oh, I was goofing around

303
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.980
on the internet. There it
is. It's like TiVo. It's

304
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.230
like a DVR for your
desktop. I think that's a

305
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.330
great idea, but you gotta
be able to access that

306
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.120
data. And you're saying that
it's spread out, it's in

307
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.760
this API and that API
using to aggregate all of

308
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.560
that. You bring it all.
You're using Google calendar. There's

309
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.280
your database. So yeah. So
everything comes in. It's this,

310
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:54.440
the processes, you know, very
simple steps, collect, protect, reflect

311
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.040
project. So collect, I just
got to get it all

312
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.780
in there somehow. And that's
like, and it's gotta be

313
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.410
low friction. So a what
can I use? And I

314
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.710
switch applications, devices, sensors, and
services. Like people change take

315
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.660
showers, right? I'm like, God,
that's gone. Now. I find

316
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.250
something better. If I can
get the data, if I

317
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.140
can find a system that
gets it out by RSS

318
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.050
or through, you know, any
like a Yahoo pipe or

319
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.240
if, or Zapier, or I
can just write a hack

320
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.460
to get the information out,
I'll use it. And then

321
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.740
I just want basic things
and location, time duration, I've

322
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.300
got a bunch of bullet
points. So I created what

323
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.390
I call these kinds of
insights and data insights. And

324
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.120
then I just moved that
into a Google spreadsheet to

325
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.900
collect it. I also then,
or any type of access

326
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.180
I could use Microsoft or
anybody just spreadsheet. And then

327
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.900
I move it into a
calendar view. I then store

328
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.840
it in a cloud just
as a text dump in

329
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.530
Evernote. And then that gets
exported out using into text,

330
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.770
just raw text dumps onto
my files. And it's really

331
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.680
have 14 terabytes of text
humps. So, and then the

332
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.150
last part is, you know,
how do you actually deal

333
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.740
with that? And that's where
you actually, you know, you

334
00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.540
can do some correlation looking
at it. So a bunch

335
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.820
of weird examples, I could
give a ton of how,

336
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.790
just the voice when I
used earlier, you know, the

337
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.010
lady who helps me clean
my house, you know, I

338
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.540
hired her about six months
ago and I could never

339
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.300
figure out why Sundays I
was getting so sick to

340
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.570
my stomach. And as soon
as I put a indoor

341
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.480
weather station on my desk,
right. I knew the air

342
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.540
quality was toxic. Cause I
was getting feedback. Right. And

343
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.950
I was like, Oh wait,
you know, I'm sleeping like

344
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.630
crap on Saturday night and
I'm waking up and I

345
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.250
have a headache by Sunday
afternoon. I had a camp.

346
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.610
Oh, okay. We're toxic air.
And it's smells like chemical.

347
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.450
That's lovely. So it's the
cleaning chemicals. It was cleaning

348
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.280
chemicals. So I just leave
when she's here now I

349
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.520
have no more problems on
Sunday. That is a first

350
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.420
world problem right there. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. First world. And

351
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.450
so it's a lithium problem.
Yeah. There's that. So what

352
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.600
do you, I understand the
collect part and I see

353
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.670
the idea of bringing it
all in, into some central

354
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.490
format and dumping it, but
on the, on the outside,

355
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.320
on the dashboard, I mean,
I feel like you'd need

356
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.600
it. I could do Google
analytics or a Hadoop or

357
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.300
something like that to really
mind this. Cause that's something

358
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.040
a lot of a, laptop's
not going to be able

359
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.520
to effectively build you a
view of your life with

360
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.860
multiple terabytes. No. So the
easiest way for me to

361
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.710
do it is to just
search the, you know, like

362
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.080
I said, I pump most
of it for, I think

363
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.420
public sake through a Google
calendar and I tie it

364
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.170
to tanneries in my life
or like financial, spiritual health.

365
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.120
Right? So every, every data
stream hits one of those

366
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.720
areas and it's color coded
and it's colors titled Maslow's

367
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.630
hierarchy of needs. And I
basically then say, that's it.

368
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.130
So that's one way I
can see the second way

369
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.810
I can. It was search
that information the third way

370
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.040
I can do it. Like
when you're going down, the

371
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.040
bigger, big data, 14 terabytes
of it. That's where I

372
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.410
just started playing with a
lot of these deep learning

373
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.320
engines that are open source
and just taking massive amounts

374
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.990
of information and dumping them
there. And what's just so

375
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.420
absolutely compelling. You know, a
lot of people use these

376
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.070
deep learning engines for sentiment
analysis on, you know, websites

377
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.830
or, you know, the public,
you know, what's the public

378
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.650
happy about Twitter is IPO.
When you can dump personal

379
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.930
data in there, it's like,
mind-blowingly cool. Cause they were

380
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.930
like, yeah, that was a
bad day. I remember. And

381
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.010
actually this is right. You
know, that, that, that is

382
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.750
such an interesting thing. I
think that I want to

383
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.620
dig into that. Cause sometimes
people forget to have measuring,

384
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.490
to have actual, you know,
non opinion-based at data about

385
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.180
something very often. I will.
Well, actually recently I was

386
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.570
at a conference and I
got a soda and I

387
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.020
said, I don't think this
is diet. And the lady

388
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.700
was like, no, no, I
promise it's diet. And I

389
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.460
drank it. And 10 minutes
later I had a chart

390
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.470
that was showing my blood
sugar going up and I

391
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.690
started to get sick and
I didn't want to be

392
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.820
that guy. You know what
I mean? Like the, is

393
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.610
this diet guy, but I
said that guy by the

394
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.680
way, but I don't want
to be that guy. I'm

395
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.930
a little bit more like
I will hurt myself rather

396
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.270
than be that guy, but
you know, a couple hours

397
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.190
into it. I was just
like, Oh man, I just

398
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.770
drank an entire regular soda
and that I'm going to

399
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.500
be dealing with this for
the next six hours. So

400
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.910
I was up all night
kind of dealing with that.

401
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.730
But it was funny because
I had the numbers to

402
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.700
prove it well before I
would have been like, I

403
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.040
don't really know if that
was, was that diet, you

404
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.230
know what I mean? I
had an incident last year

405
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.150
where a, and I've had
a few of these and

406
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.040
you know, I have to
be very careful about how

407
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.840
I phrase this, but I've
had a few incidents where

408
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.600
I've had run ins with
people or organizations. We'll just

409
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.300
put it that way and
they'll say, well, you know,

410
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.010
you know, you're, that's your
point of view and that's

411
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.410
just not true. And then
I just hand them a

412
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.630
mountain of data and they,
they literally collapsed because, you

413
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.180
know, you can say what
you want about collecting data,

414
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.790
but you don't want to
tell the most quantified person

415
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.010
on earth that he did
or said something that ruined

416
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.050
your day. If he can
prove everything he did and

417
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.000
said, Yeah, it definitely is
gonna make it really hard

418
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.280
for me to frame you
for murder. No I can't.

419
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.370
But I mean, We have
to get you an episode

420
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:45.260
of law and order, where
were you? Yeah, we did.

421
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.540
We have to have, you
know, he's Chris has murdered

422
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.210
someone. I was like, well
actually no, because the humidity

423
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.550
at the time, you know
what I mean? That's a

424
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:57.590
very interesting clue for the
quantified self. Yes, absolutely. That

425
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.930
would be that's it to
have an aura, Sherlock Holmes

426
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.390
kind of a thing. Like
you're the mystery person and

427
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.390
you are keeping track of
all of the environmental details

428
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.080
while solving crimes. You'd be
like monk except with data

429
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.120
to back it up. Yeah.
So our, our people now

430
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.910
you are an extreme you're
on the far end. There

431
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.620
are those that don't think
about any of these things

432
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.840
and they just listen to
their bodies. But I think

433
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.600
that the regular kind of
average internet connected person is

434
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.240
starting to move more in
your direction. We've got the

435
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.500
iPhone five S with this
motion, a processor in it.

436
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.860
And I didn't realize this,
but it's actually collecting data,

437
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.530
even if an app is
not asking for it. Yeah.

438
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.840
And you've got the, the
galaxy S four, which is

439
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.350
collecting temperature, humidity and pressure
really. And it's just, yeah,

440
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.240
it's just keeping it, you've
got the Modo, which is

441
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.310
always passively listening. The Moto
X, you know, this is

442
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.870
why I think it's so
important that we start thinking

443
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.150
about the inner net, right?
This is, and I just

444
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.670
pulled this term out of
my, you know, collective backend

445
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.740
at a conference. Cause someone
said, you know, why would

446
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.790
you do this? And I'm
like, well, I need to

447
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.740
start to myself like the
internet. And then I kind

448
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.030
of said, it kind of
fast. I'm like, Oh, I

449
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.130
meant internet. And then it
just became this thing. And

450
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.770
I'm like, that makes sense
to me. So, you know,

451
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.210
these funds are going to
get more and more sensors.

452
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.610
Our houses are getting more
and more connected. You know,

453
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.010
it's just like early web.
It's very deep fragmented. Nobody

454
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.510
wants to talk to somebody.
We don't have a Tim

455
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.520
burner's play. They're common in
sorts of stuff out, you

456
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.740
know? So who knows the,
the I've been getting connected

457
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.280
without realizing it. I added
the Fitbit and it's on

458
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.660
my wrist now. And it
took about a week to

459
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.370
get used to having this
thing on my wrist. Yep.

460
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.160
There's years. And, and I
got an Aria scale and

461
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.260
I see there's one right
there behind you. That's a

462
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.390
really great thing. Step on
the scale every morning. And

463
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.860
now I know how much
I weigh and it's really

464
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.930
awesome. You want some, you
want some hot scale tech.

465
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.850
Okay. What do we have?
Hot scale tech scale tech

466
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.210
minute. They've got this off
again. It's I love pretail.

467
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.420
I am big into Kickstarter.
Anytime I can buy, buy,

468
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.760
buy pretail over retail. I'm
down. Pretail I got to

469
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.390
write all these cool terms
down. So they've sold out

470
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.000
on Kickstarter. They've got a
thing where you put these

471
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.790
little sensors underneath your bed
posts, so you don't have

472
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.880
weigh yourself just when you
sleep your weight automatically. So

473
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.550
you tear your desk, your,
your, your, your zero is

474
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.920
your bed By itself. Yeah.
And then you get on

475
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.640
the bed. Yeah. And it
weighs you. Yeah. Effortlessly. And

476
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.610
that's what I can, you
know, ambient or calm technology,

477
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.290
it's just gets out of
the way and why we're

478
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.820
a bunch of sensors to
track your sleep at the

479
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.470
bed of the sensors of
tracking the way to the

480
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.630
bed can note, if you
were rolling around or not,

481
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.450
there's something called bed. It,
it actually does your heart

482
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.180
rate, but it wraps over
the mattress. So you don't

483
00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.490
wear anything. It just, when
you're rolling around, it's covering.

484
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.880
I just think this is,
this is kind of geeky

485
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.930
stuff. Sorry. It's deeply geeky.
It is B. It is

486
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.610
above first World. <inaudible> I
call it data Elysium. I

487
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.370
interrupted you about that whole.
So you've got your Fitbit.

488
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.350
I'm not actively trying to
quantify myself, but I am

489
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.540
indirectly doing it. Yeah. I
installed recently the Nike, this

490
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.620
app just came out three
days ago called the Nike

491
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.640
plus move app is the
very first app for the

492
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.250
motion detector. So I on,
on the iPhone. So I

493
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.900
put the thing in That
was the most connected man

494
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.970
on earth this, well, there
you go. See, there you

495
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.690
go. Well, the Nike plus
move application, here's the scary

496
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.990
part. It already had 10
days of data on me

497
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.890
because it pulled it out
of the motion coprocessor. So

498
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.770
it's, it's, it's collecting data
even though it's not running.

499
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.350
And it's not that there's
a background process. The processor

500
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.720
itself is keeping that data.
So that became really, really

501
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.700
interesting. I was like, Oh
wow. And then I started

502
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.200
to correlate that with Fitbit
and things like that. Yeah.

503
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.240
And so, you know, about
collecting data without really noticing

504
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.670
it, you know, who's been
doing this for decades and

505
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:48.530
probably centuries, our spouses, they're
watching everything we're doing. Right.

506
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.810
So, you know, I think
in some ways we do

507
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.000
it with our kids. You
know, as soon as the

508
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.850
biggest thing I struggle with
Scott is now they've been

509
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.830
doing this for three years.
It's sometimes like, even if

510
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.660
I look at you right
now, I actually have to

511
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.390
not directly look at you
in the Skype hangout, because

512
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.680
I see mountains of information
around you just like the

513
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.710
matrix. And it's really hard
because I had to literally

514
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.160
start to study Buddhism and
to meditate because I was

515
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.800
leaving physical space. You know,
people talking about, Oh, they're

516
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.260
checked out. Cause he's using
technology. There's the level of

517
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.050
beyond checking out because you're
using your phone too much

518
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.890
when you see people as
bits and it's just, it

519
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.840
is scary. So I took
my kids to Sherlock Holmes

520
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.150
and my kids are six
and eight and there's a

521
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.280
Sherlock Holmes exhibit. And when
it comes to your town,

522
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.630
you should check it out.
It's really one of the

523
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:38.380
best museum of science exhibits.
I've seen three things on

524
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.020
my list now it's fantastic.
So we go to this

525
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.130
thing and they've set up
this full-sized dire Emma, effectively

526
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.740
of Holmes's room. And they
give you a list of

527
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.990
things to look for kind
of like, where's Waldo. This

528
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.080
is your practice. Like, do
you find homes is Cain?

529
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.700
So the kids are like,
and we're looking at this

530
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.340
is full size, right? This
is a, a, a set

531
00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.890
effectively. So then okay. Now
with the kids are trying

532
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.980
to exercise their brains. So
let me go downstairs to

533
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.070
the next part of the
Sherlock Holmes exhibit. And it

534
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.940
is a complete crime scene.
Nice. And the kids spent

535
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.950
two hours with their little
notebooks doing like rubbings of

536
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.740
footprints and all this kind
of stuff to figure out

537
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.480
what's going on and you
do it. Or do you

538
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.010
just have your kids to
know I did it too.

539
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.770
I did it for you.
And there's like, there's 16

540
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.990
possibilities about like, you know,
what could have happened? And

541
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.150
they, you know, they got
it. Right. So they were

542
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.190
paying attention. And what was
interesting about it is that

543
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.520
now they're looking at people
in that kind of monk

544
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.290
or Sherlock Holmes way, like
you have mud on your

545
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.350
shoes, where did you, where
were you in the backyard?

546
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.540
Or, you know, do you
wash your hands? Why don't

547
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.030
think you did because your
nails are dirty. And so

548
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.770
many ways we do this
online too. You know, I

549
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.860
always tell people, you know,
don't think about people use

550
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.400
it. Don't create content online
for people who are going

551
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.620
to read it, create content
aligned for people who pattern

552
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:58.980
watch. And if you create
connected pattern, watching experiences, you

553
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.260
have people's attention. Right. Cause
they're looking for, they're looking

554
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.660
exactly like you just described,
they're looking for the clues.

555
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.840
So put a word here,
a picture there, something else.

556
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.640
I mean, I've had people
go to me while that

557
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.470
was really cool. I said,
what? And they describe the

558
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.230
situation. What do you mean?
Well, I saw it on

559
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.140
Instagram and then I saw
you posted something on Foursquare

560
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.870
and then on, on Google,
plus you put something and

561
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.660
then your LinkedIn and they'd
literally made my day. So

562
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.120
I, then I started experimenting.
Could I leave just the

563
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.870
smallest amounts of information across
10, 15, 20 networks to

564
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.120
see people would reconstruct my
day for me. Absolutely. Every

565
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.610
time. Yeah. Yeah. There, there,
there are those that are

566
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.680
kind of, we call it
low key stalking is what

567
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.710
we call that low key
stalking. Yeah. I mean, that's,

568
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.840
that's what the, these, the
young people call it. I've

569
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.770
been on like Instagram and
people will talk about that.

570
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.180
They'll say, yeah, you know,
I'm kind of low key

571
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.190
stalking his Instagram, but I
gotta make sure I don't

572
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.020
double tap or I'll like
that picture. And then they'll

573
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.940
know that I'm creeping around
What Facebook does when they

574
00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.490
introduced hashtags. Now I think
it's amazing if you just

575
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.740
do some hashtag searches for
how many people don't know

576
00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.440
they're publicly posting. Oh yeah.
They have no idea. Almost

577
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.020
like reading a 12 year
old diary. It's like, Ooh,

578
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.460
you just don't want to
lick your hand. You go

579
00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.250
wash yourself with peril. It's
like, don't hashtag search and

580
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.500
Facebook. It's, it's not for
the faint of heart. Let's

581
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.560
bring it back around to
talk about how we do

582
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.160
something with this data. I
didn't realize that even though

583
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.560
I don't tap my Fitbit
before I go to bed,

584
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.050
I can go back and
say, well, I was sleeping

585
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.780
between this time and this
time. And it will reconstruct

586
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.150
my sleep and tell me
when I was, you know,

587
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.790
moving back and forth. And
this is not something I'm

588
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.530
used to doing you of
course, to do this all

589
00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.320
the time. But I realized
that I'd only slept five

590
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.470
hours, three days in a
row. And I was about

591
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.870
to hit the wall. Then
it did, in fact, hit

592
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.050
the wall. Had I not
done that sleep logging, I

593
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.790
would have just slept in
and missed a meeting. You

594
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.190
know what I'm saying? Like,
it's, what's interesting to me,

595
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.770
isn't the collecting of the
data, but it's the using

596
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.070
it to make my life
better to change something. So

597
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.070
there's a couple of layers,
right? There's the, you talked

598
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.840
earlier about, you know, you,
weren't gonna hit your two

599
00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.330
step plumbing yesterday. So, you
know, you got on the

600
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.240
treadmill and now you're talking
about the sleep stuff. So

601
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.280
I think, you know, there's
almost like a level one

602
00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.540
where, you know, the information
and the devices and sensory

603
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.500
services applications, they enhance your
relationship with your own information.

604
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.570
So in some way, it's
like getting to know you

605
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.530
so that you can change
behavior. Level two is really

606
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.830
where you have this assisted
relationship. And this is where,

607
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.450
you know, I really like
to focus a lot of

608
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.540
my work and personal research
and that's how do I

609
00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.390
hook up these devices to
assist me? So if I

610
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:31.460
do raise my voice, like
I raise my voice like

611
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.080
this and you'll notice the
lights will start to dim,

612
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.100
right? If my heart rate
gets too high, the lights

613
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.350
at the house, temperature changes,
and then there's, there's the

614
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.810
adaptive experience. And that's the
one I'm coding up now.

615
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.550
And that's where I really
want it to look at

616
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:48.120
my calendar tomorrow and start
to introduce music and, and,

617
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:54.470
and, and experiences and environmental
conditions and suggestions to optimize

618
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.220
tomorrow through today's environment. So,
you know, you've got this

619
00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.950
kind of reflective thing that
we all do. You've kind

620
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.900
of got this assisted thing
where you could say, Hey,

621
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.820
you know, just modify the
environment for this condition. And

622
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.120
you've got this kind of
adaptive state where you can

623
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.570
pre, I call it preconditioning
spaces. And I think smart

624
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:13.820
cities are all about preconditioning,
but I think that's pretty

625
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.910
scary stuff. If you actually
think through the process, What

626
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.370
I think is a little
bit funny about this also

627
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.640
is that there may be
those listeners who are hearing

628
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.810
you and some non-zero percentage
of them may have just

629
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.870
kind of declared that you're
a kook and they're like

630
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.630
this guy's got way too
much information going on, but

631
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.910
those are the same people
that go and see science

632
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.030
fiction movies, where Arnold Schwarzenegger
gets out of his bed

633
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:43.750
at, at, on Mars. And
his house says, welcome, you

634
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.670
know, hello, your vitamin a
level is a little bit

635
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.620
low. We'll be, you know,
I'll be putting that into

636
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.140
your juice this morning. And
then we noticed your heart

637
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.000
rate was up last night.
Did you have a nightmare?

638
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.210
And we think that's awesome.
I feel like what you're

639
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.900
doing actively is the beginning
of what will then happen

640
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.290
passively. Well, it's funny. Cause
every time I speak at

641
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.450
a conference or someone talk
over it, you know, I

642
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.850
have an opportunity to speak
with someone as cool as

643
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.910
you people always go, you
actually are the living in

644
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.950
the future. And I'm like,
no, I'm living in what

645
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.010
we call the present. I'm
just paying more attention. Right?

646
00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.920
So, you know, I'm not
like some brilliant person. I'm

647
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.740
a guy who likes to
hack data. I'm a guy

648
00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.650
who likes to buy consumer
gadgets. I live in pretail.

649
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:25.530
I live in connected devices.
And I think ultimately, I,

650
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.630
you know, I spent a
decade as a SQL DBA.

651
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.910
When you start to realize
that life is a select

652
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.340
statement, why wouldn't you build
the best parts of it?

653
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.250
You know? And this is,
you know, and I believe,

654
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.500
you know, ultimately I've said
it a million times, I'll

655
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.440
say it again. People need
to work. And how do

656
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.050
we build a platform for
people to work? And if

657
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.880
they don't work, how do
we let them not work

658
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.520
and still make a living?
And, you know, mom making

659
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.320
cookies is doing a lot
more than making cookies. And

660
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.070
information's all sorts of good,
Certainly as honorable to have

661
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.260
a hobby as any other
hobbies that I've heard about,

662
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.300
whether it be coupon, clipping,
or all the other things

663
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.670
that people use to pass
their time. Although you've got

664
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.820
data to show for it.
A buddy of mine here

665
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:07.380
in Portland, ward Cunningham is
a technologist and he made

666
00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.170
the Wiki. When I went
over to his place a

667
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.760
couple of years ago, he
has quantified data, not on

668
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.150
himself, but on the plants
around his house. He knows

669
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.240
about the humidity, like of
different corners of his house

670
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.390
because different plants face the
sun in different ways. And

671
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.700
from his perspective, not only
is it a super fun

672
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.370
hobby, cause he's hacking Arduinos
to do this work for

673
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.070
him, but he gets to
see how it affects things.

674
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.680
And he says those plants
are growing better now because

675
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.670
I kept the data actually,
you know, I'm just realizing

676
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.140
that I have even more
data because I have a

677
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.510
weather system, a little tiny,
one more data. I have

678
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.130
a little weather thing on
top of my house that

679
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.790
manages my watering of my
lawn. Yeah. Now you're going

680
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.470
to make me go and
open that thing up and

681
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.770
find out how to get
there. He'll wake up tomorrow

682
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.230
and suddenly the world will
be information and you'll want

683
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.650
a relationship with it. And
it's, it's not, No, I

684
00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.960
want, I want to unlock
the information of my sprinkler

685
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.410
system. Yes. Free it. I
mean, this is, this is,

686
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.450
I mean, all these brilliant
developers out there, all looking

687
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.060
for cool stuff. And yet
we're making like, you know,

688
00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.730
you know, you know, silly
games on our phones and

689
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.180
sticky websites to keep people's
eyeballs occupied. And I don't

690
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.740
know. I just think we
can, we can do better

691
00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.670
as a species, you know,
So people can go and

692
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.930
learn more about you@aservicesphere.com. They
Google for Chris dancy. They'll

693
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.390
find your Twitter, your LinkedIn
they'll find the wired article.

694
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.790
They'll find your slide shares.
Where else do people need

695
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.970
to go to check out
information about the quantified self?

696
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.390
Well, there's that quantified self?
The, the actual organization. They

697
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.740
have a website where they've
got just brilliant talks and

698
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.800
about the collection and the
technique, because there's also a

699
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.580
very deep conversation around the
technique specifically. I, you know,

700
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.380
I don't know. I mean,
a lot of people write

701
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.630
about me until this year.
You know, there's a really

702
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.870
good, nice NPR piece that
people can listen to. I

703
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.670
don't have a homes. I
mean, service. Here's where I

704
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.610
kind of like put all
sorts of stuff. But like

705
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.620
I said, it's all just
kind of out there. Or

706
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.630
you just reach out to
me, you know, my phone

707
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.640
number is actually on the
internet. So if you have

708
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.390
any questions, it's, it's good
stuff. And I can't thank

709
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.190
you enough. I was so
enamored with you after I

710
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:12.860
met you on a plane
and, and truth be told,

711
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.890
everybody should know, I stopped
you for like, I dunno,

712
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.170
it's been a year and
like to actually get to

713
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.360
talk to you. So, so
you've been low key stalking

714
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.240
me on Instagram. Trying not
to like my pictures. No,

715
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.100
just, just kinda like I
keep, I think I've been

716
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.550
like old school, old sock
is sending you emails randomly

717
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.970
like, Hey, can we get
together? Hey, you're going to

718
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.640
get together because you've got
such a brilliant perspective on

719
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.300
work and the future of
work and health, you know,

720
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.310
I just felt like I'd
met like, you know, like

721
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.270
Darth Vader, my, my, my
quantified Darth Vader father. Well,

722
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.310
that is very kind. I
appreciate you chatting with us

723
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.400
on the show today. Thanks
so much. This has been

724
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.650
another episode of Hansel minutes
and I'll see you again

725
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:56.390
next week. <inaudible>.
