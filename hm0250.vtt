presenting, withdrew Robbins. Believe it
or not. This is Scott

8
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.590
Hanselman and my voice is
broken. This is another episode

9
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.400
of Hansel minutes. How's it
going everybody we are at

10
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.130
at webcams in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands I'm here with drew

11
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.860
Robins. How are you, sir?
I'm doing all right. We're

12
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.310
both a little tired. Yeah.
I've been talking for eight

13
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.090
hours straight and my voice
basically fell apart about an

14
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.640
hour and a half ago.
Yeah. Well, I tried to

15
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.040
help you out with talking
as much as possible, but

16
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.410
it became apparent that people
showed up. They hear you.

17
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.820
I was, I was mentioned
as the sidekick several times

18
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.840
on Twitter. I, not me.
I didn't say that, but

19
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.500
like, and I had someone
was great and the other

20
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.240
guy that's right. Yeah. We,
we just came off of

21
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.970
like, literally let me see.
We got up at six

22
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.330
this morning and I got
up at 4:00 AM the previous

23
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.630
day traveling of course, all
this way. And then we

24
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.350
put together a webcams, James
senior's webcams. We are in,

25
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.510
I were going to do
a Belgium and a couple

26
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.770
of days. And we ended
up working. We were basically

27
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.740
onstage talking from 9:00 AM till
five 30 and we did

28
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.000
all the new stuff. So
NBC three new getting all

29
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.370
that that's right. And when
we weren't on stage talking,

30
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.580
you had a surrounding of
people that you were answering

31
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.250
questions too, so you didn't
get any breaks. Really? Yeah,

32
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.380
it was, it was pretty
funny. And we had a

33
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.520
lot of diet Coke and
was, it was, it was

34
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.250
exhausting. I was mentioning to
the guy who was very

35
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.440
kind enough to drive us
back here to the hotel.

36
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.650
He's like, you know, what's
it like, how do you

37
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.250
feel? Are you excited? And
it's just like I told

38
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.400
him, I said, I don't
think that people fully realize

39
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.810
the, the complete fullness that
you have to throw into

40
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.380
something like that. I mean,
you give your all, yeah.

41
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.560
Any amount of energy that
you have to sustain throughout

42
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.830
the day. Right. Continue to
present, just drains the heck

43
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.230
out of you. I mean
that I could, you know,

44
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.500
we could phone it in,
we could just sit and

45
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.700
do the demos and have
no at all, but we,

46
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.430
we both want it to
be good. Right. Yeah. And

47
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.830
it's, it's bizarre. I haven't
done a full eight hours

48
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.140
at that, at that energy
level. All Right. Like trainers

49
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.960
do that all the time
that work, you know, every

50
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.140
day and do eight hours
a day training people. And

51
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.870
that's just, I can't imagine
doing that. You know, I

52
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.540
used to do training, like
know, and your class at

53
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.500
ASP, like 10 years ago.
And I, I almost interviewed

54
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.220
at development, but, but I
just couldn't conceive of that

55
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.820
energy output because some of
the, you know, some of

56
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.380
the people just don't think
of it as being a

57
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.750
lot of work, a lot
of energy, but you know,

58
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.450
I I've always, some people
don't like my talks. They

59
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.730
don't like my style, but
I, I think of it

60
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.840
as edutainment. So it's like
a Vegas show with code

61
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.550
and debugging in and zooming
tools. Yeah. That kind of

62
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.280
becomes your unique thing. Cause
you have that, that kind

63
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.530
of stand up side of
you as well. So you

64
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.550
can intermix the like there's
some people and I may

65
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.130
be one of those that
try to intermix humor into

66
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.430
presentations and it just doesn't
come off and people are

67
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.770
just like, you know what,
just give me the information

68
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.620
and we'll be fine, but
I definitely have a good

69
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.180
knack for introducing the humor
intelligence. I think I do.

70
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.160
But I was funny who
there was a, if you

71
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.120
look at the comments on
the, on the asp.net MVC

72
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.390
talk, I did last year
in Belgium, there were a

73
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.880
bunch of comments on the
channel nine site that were

74
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.700
like, can I get a
version with the jokes edited

75
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.120
out? Actually, I remember that.
Yeah. I thought that was

76
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.030
really bad. I was like
really sad. It was a

77
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.100
decent doc though. It was
good. It was okay. I

78
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.890
mean, some of the it's
like some people think I'm

79
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.690
doing the jokes because I'm
starving standup comedian, her failed

80
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.020
a failed stand up. But
it's more just that I

81
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.870
put on a talk that
I would want to see

82
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.950
and I just cannot sit
through an hour long talk

83
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.510
without fun. I love listening
to stories with, to talks

84
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.000
with their stories like Mark
Russinovich and Raphael of Waikiki

85
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.270
and these guys that just,
they tell a story. And

86
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.640
then the code is kind
of the side effect of

87
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.130
that stuff. I love that.
Yep. It's a softer side

88
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.740
of the whole thing. So
you mentioned a few there.

89
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.590
What are some other speakers
that you really enjoy listening

90
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.880
to? I'm Billy Hollis. Billy's
great. Billy is like the

91
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.620
Southern Baptist preacher center. And
this is, I love, I

92
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.400
love speakers that have war
stories. They're not just going

93
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.330
through the demos like rich
Richard Campbell is always got something

94
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.210
where he'll just stop and
tell you a story about

95
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.250
what, and it might be
a story of something that

96
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.560
happened last week, but then
he'll tie it back to

97
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.740
whatever, right? The COVID that
he's talking, Richard's a great

98
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.820
storyteller as well. Yeah. But
this was actually our first

99
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.550
time speaking together. You and
I, Yeah, it was an

100
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.130
interesting experience for me. We
had kind of practiced And

101
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.020
talked about how we pass
back and forth and then

102
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.510
we effectively just throw it
out the window. Right. As

103
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.850
soon as we got to
say, did that bother you?

104
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.280
I mean, did you feel
like, okay, I guess we're

105
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.420
doing it this way. I
had never, I usually am

106
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.150
always kind of the, just
the solo act. And so

107
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.450
I had never done demos
under the pressure of interruptions

108
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.620
and distractions. And it was
a, it was pretty interesting

109
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.900
trying to keep my mind
on what I was supposed

110
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.720
to do. And then the
technical steps that the demo

111
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.320
versus the talking back and
forth. Yeah, you were my

112
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.410
code monkey for a number
of demos, but this wasn't

113
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.840
in the classic code monkey,
since this was in the

114
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.800
Chris sells Don box, Doug
Purdy style of code monkey,

115
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.210
which means you have to
be insulted by the presenter.

116
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.810
You have to be witty
with your replies. I will

117
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.260
tell you to sleep writing
code. Exactly. So, and it

118
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.110
worked at times and not
at others. Yeah. So I

119
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.910
was wondering if like, people
would know if we were

120
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.580
playing silly or not, you
know, but I hope they

121
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.340
did. We'll see when we
look at the videotape later,

122
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.850
but w it's fun, you
know, you tease people when

123
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.960
they're writing code about their
use of hotkeys or they,

124
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.730
you know, moving the mouse
too slow. Yeah. So that

125
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.630
was fun. So I know
that you may not think

126
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.370
this, but there's a lot
of people out there that

127
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.300
really respect Scott Hanselman as
the speaker. And one to

128
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.510
know, you know, how do
I become a better speaker?

129
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.780
How do I become like
Scott Hanselman and be a

130
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.290
great presenter? So give people
out there, some, some advice

131
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.990
of, you know, I, I'm
pretty sure just knowing you

132
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.210
and knowing your background, there
was no kind of classic

133
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.420
speaker training for Scott Hanselman,
but how do you get

134
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.020
started as a speaker? Well,
I mean, I always talk

135
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.530
about the, they do a
lot of theater in high

136
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.290
school. So in some ways
that was kind of classical

137
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.600
training for being on stage.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, for

138
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.420
that classical classical, in that
high school theater kind of

139
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:04.570
way classical in that it
was musical theater. We first

140
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.380
you have to want to
be on there, want to

141
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.020
be on stage. And for
me it's about getting the

142
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.530
energy, which is really ironic
because I am extremely innervated

143
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.280
right now. Right. The opposite
of energized, I have zero

144
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.710
energy, which is funny because
the audience was feeding me

145
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.680
energy all day and I
absorbed it and I was

146
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.680
amped and stoked and excited.
And then at the end,

147
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.560
I just collapse. And I
go, I come back on

148
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.180
these trips and my wife
looks at me. He's like,

149
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.850
why do you do this?
And I was like, it's

150
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.180
for the high, like, you're
so low though, right now,

151
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.580
what have you done? You
have to want to feed

152
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.610
on that, on that. But
this is what teachers do.

153
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.520
You, you focus on a
couple of people in the

154
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.070
room, even though we were,
I think we had 300

155
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.820
people show up 360 or
something like that. I picked

156
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.770
like five or six and
I kept looking at them.

157
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.000
Typically, you want to pick
somebody in each section of

158
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.100
room that you're going to
look at. And ironically, if

159
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.060
you mix it up enough,
people around that person will

160
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.820
think you're looking at them.
Right. So you'll literally will

161
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.250
get a feeling that every,
almost everyone in the room

162
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.840
thinks that you've connected with
them. And so I usually

163
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.750
just pick, you know, unique
looking people, whoever the most

164
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.930
interesting looking person, right? There's
the people that are also

165
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.780
kind of connecting with you
and nodding and giving you

166
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.380
kind of positive feedback to
keep you going. Exactly. And

167
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.930
they're usually awake if they're,
if they're the person who's

168
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.840
awake, I don't look at
the sleeping people. So you

169
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.460
didn't look at me today.
Or like there was this

170
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.320
one guy, there was this
one I wouldn't look at

171
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.570
you cause you were asleep.
Most of the time, there

172
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.180
was one guy who, when
we asked, are there any

173
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.450
Ruby people here? He said,
I'm the Ruby guy. So

174
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.390
I started calling him Ruby
guy because whenever I would

175
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.770
refer to something that was
of Ruby rails, I would

176
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.770
say, yeah, you know, Ruby
guy likes that. So he

177
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.960
was the guy in the
left section, but I would

178
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.960
keep looking at, you know,
at each section I could

179
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.900
describe the person and what
I associated with that person.

180
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.270
Like I had a classic
ASP guy in the back.

181
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.090
I had a VB guy
on the right. I had

182
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.150
the dotnet 2.0 guy in
the middle, you know, and

183
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:13.310
I just would use those,
those locations as spatial references.

184
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.370
So that way I was
consistent, I would always move

185
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.530
to one side of the
stage talking about one topic

186
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.380
point, always moved to the
other or gesture in a

187
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.470
certain way. That was something
actually that Billy Hollis told

188
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.400
me was associate different parts
of the stage with different

189
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.800
things. He was really good
at this. He would like

190
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.020
make the left side of
the stage, the client and

191
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.090
the right side of the
server. And he was really

192
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.290
consistent, even though he didn't
call it out by him

193
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.570
moving his body. That, that
side, when he was talking

194
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.930
about different topics, it reinforced
what he was talking about.

195
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.200
So he, he would say
like, let me step out

196
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.550
of the box for a
second. And let me go

197
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.930
over here and talk about
the client. And then you

198
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.090
do that. And, and he
would move always to the

199
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.210
same location. Right? And then
visually it would help you

200
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.840
build the, the picture of
whatever was the process that

201
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.660
was going on was, yeah,
You see some speakers at

202
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.740
times, they're moving around the
stage, but it's accidental and

203
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.420
it looks very random and
it's more, it looks more

204
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.810
nervous. Even if they aren't
nervous, it looks nervous. The

205
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.930
more intentional you can be
a meaningful about movement, the

206
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.910
better like definitely standing still
is probably better than random

207
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:25.400
movement, but having intentional movements
is even better. So Really

208
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.030
intentional, anything you don't want
to do anything on stage

209
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.400
when 300 people or 3000
people are staring at you

210
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.060
without knowing why you're doing
it. And if you have

211
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.840
an affectation, which we all
do myself included, they're going

212
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.210
to all notice that. But
to your point about intentional

213
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.450
movement, I learned that doing
speaker training, actually I did

214
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.140
do some speaker training. If
you move there, we'll look

215
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.080
at you. If you stop
moving, they'll look at your

216
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.120
slides. If you turn slightly
in return your side to

217
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.880
them, they will look at
the slides. If you turn

218
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.490
your body square and face
them, they will look at

219
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.580
you. So you can actually
control what they're looking at.

220
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.610
So you can like turn
to the side and narrate,

221
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.410
and then the end and
you look up to the

222
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.260
slides and they will look
up to the slides. So

223
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.750
being aware of that kind
of stuff makes it, it

224
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.860
makes a huge difference if
your intent is to control

225
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.480
the flow of information. Yep.
So what are the other

226
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.040
factors in, you know, maybe
somebody is out and speaking

227
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.430
to user groups or at
these code camps and other

228
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.670
regional community events. And they
want to kind of break

229
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:35.430
into larger events, whether it
be the, the vs lives

230
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.520
or dev connections or some
of the events that you

231
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.830
do here in Europe, that
you've talked about the dev

232
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.620
days. And I'm trying to
think of some of the

233
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.070
others, but the larger events
with a bigger audience, how

234
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.400
do they, how do they
break out of the regional

235
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.010
events and get into that?
What other factors are involved

236
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.470
In the new, in the
new world, in the new

237
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.490
internet, record your events. If
you're going to talk to

238
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.100
somebody, whether it's 10 people
at a user group or

239
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.850
a hundred people at a
code camp record yourself, it's

240
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.720
really difficult because there's really
only like, you know, three

241
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.090
ways that I can hear
about you as a speaker

242
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.770
word of mouth, or someone
sent me some list of

243
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.650
reviews, like actual rolled up
data that said you did

244
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.250
a good job or video.
There's no other way for

245
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.380
me to hear about how
you did at an event.

246
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.260
Send me videos of me
video. If someone is saying,

247
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.440
I want to come speak,
you know, I've spoken here,

248
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.840
I've spoken there. That's great.
But now what am I

249
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.000
going to do? I'm going
to go and ask somebody

250
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.910
if I know someone at
the conference, Hey, how did,

251
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.110
how did drew do? Did
he speak well on, honestly,

252
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.650
I want to see a
YouTube video and not, not

253
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.320
a cheesy gorilla. One where
someone is wandering around falling

254
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.340
you, but like decent audio,
audio, audio, audio, setting up

255
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.030
a tripod and a little
Bluetooth audio at a, at

256
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.610
a user group for a
while there I was taping

257
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.910
everything I did not just
because I wanted to promote

258
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.920
what I was doing, but
I wanted to look at

259
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.290
it and get better. Sure.
So I would go and

260
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.180
bring the video camera and
record it. It's not. And

261
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.070
then you can take the
best ones and post them

262
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.100
out there. Yeah, absolutely. If
you gotta gotta to record

263
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.010
yourself because you never know
when a video is going

264
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.530
to turn out to be,
you know, the video, a

265
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.790
good one. And actually, Paul,
I think it was Paul Mooney

266
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.700
taught me this when he
started me doing this, because

267
00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.120
one time he came to
a conference that I talked

268
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.040
to winter elect, I was
at a winter elect conference

269
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.810
and Paul brought a video
camera, totally guerrilla style and

270
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:44.520
recorded my talk on social
media for developers. And I

271
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.980
was like, okay, Paul, that's
cool. Thank you. You know,

272
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.660
but it's very grilling. He
just sat there and he

273
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.560
followed me and I didn't
really feel that quality was

274
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.360
very good, but he was
so nice to have done

275
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.430
it. He threw it up
on the web and I

276
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.230
threw it up on my
blog. And even though it

277
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.590
was awful quality, it has
still to this day, one

278
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.460
of my most popular videos.
Wow. And Paul does this

279
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.100
all the time. He's always
recording videos. So then I

280
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.050
said, I'm going to start
doing this more formally. I'm

281
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.830
going to take responsibility and
I'll, I'll ask the conference.

282
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.500
Would you please record this?
Or I'll take a flip

283
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.500
camera and throw it on
a tripod. Cause you know,

284
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.560
you might give 10 presentations
before. One of them is

285
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.140
awesome. But when you get
the awesome one, it proves

286
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.570
that you can do it.
It proves yourself, you can

287
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.830
do it. And then you
can go back and you

288
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.870
can say, look, you see
how that worked and that

289
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.010
didn't yep. Ask yourself exactly.
Like what did I do

290
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.900
right when I do wrong
and what do I need

291
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.670
to do more of and
less of Absolutely videotaping yourself

292
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.370
is hard, but I'm watching
it and it's harder. Oh

293
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.370
God, I can't listen to
myself. I don't know how

294
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.940
you guys can stand me.
I'm the same way I

295
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.820
can not hear myself speak.
Well, I certainly can't hear

296
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.520
myself speak when I sound
like this. Yeah. I'm just

297
00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:00.070
totally destroyed right now. Right.
Right. Yeah. So what do

298
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:05.020
you do? Like when you,
You have, I mean, every

299
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.240
time I've seen you present,
it's great, but I'm sure

300
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.670
you have ones that are,
you're less than happy with

301
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.170
different presentations. What do you
do to recover from those?

302
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.200
And not only like, kind
of afterwards to say, well,

303
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.930
that was, you know, not
the best and I'll do

304
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.480
better next time. But do
you have techniques for recovering

305
00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.270
during a session? Cause there's
times that you just know

306
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:31.420
it's going bad, you just
feel, Yeah. Yeah. The, the

307
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:36.310
bad ones hurt, you know,
they hurt because you're just

308
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.570
kicking yourself. It's usually stupid
things that I get. Cause

309
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.170
a bad thing, like not
sleeping enough, always nails me.

310
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.970
You know, it's really difficult
to go to bed at

311
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.770
3:00 AM and then wake up
and give a great talk

312
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.010
at night. So like here,
even though I'm totally shattered,

313
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.590
I thought it went okay
because both of us were

314
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.340
very conscious about our jet
lag situation. And when we

315
00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.320
went to sleep and I
got a full eight hours

316
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.010
before we talked, that was
great things that didn't go

317
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.460
well today were as a
result of prepping on some

318
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.220
things and you know, over
prepping in some instances and

319
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.970
under prepping and others. So
the talks that I've given

320
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.900
that have gone poorly are
kind of follow a couple

321
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.080
of classes of things that
can go wrong. First is

322
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.130
hardware, nothing, you know, nothing
you can do about that,

323
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.280
but have backups. So first
I would run, I would

324
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.610
carry multiple laptops. So for
the longest time I carried

325
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.030
two laptops that started to
hurt. Now I carry one

326
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.510
laptop and then two hard
drives. So I have another

327
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.910
entire hard drive. Cause it's
the hard drive. That's the

328
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.130
most like nine times out
of 10, the hard rival

329
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.220
die. I actually had one
situation where the LCD panel

330
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.830
died, but I could just
plug it into an external

331
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.340
monitor. And I was okay,
but I have an ex,

332
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.930
I actually have two hard
drives with me today. I

333
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.180
have an internal that I
can literally swap out. It's

334
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.150
a complete image and boot
up and I'll be right

335
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.420
back where I was. So
literally we could have crashed.

336
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.010
I would have replaced it
during lunch and we'd be

337
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.890
back up and no one
would have bothered. And then

338
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.620
I have an external hard
drive where I, the worst

339
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.690
case scenario would be. I
would go buy a hard

340
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:15.120
drive and then maybe restore
a ghost image from that.

341
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.490
Hi, this is Scott coming
to you from another place

342
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.580
in time. Are you using
agile practices to manage your

343
00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.860
software development? There's lots of
tools in the market that

344
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.870
manage the steps of a
project, but most of them

345
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.080
focus on individual roles. Get
ready for a solution that

346
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.510
caters for the success of
the whole team. Guys at

347
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.650
Tellerik introduced team pulse. It's
an agile project management tool.

348
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.010
That'll help you gather ideas,
estimate plan, track progress in

349
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.850
a common workspace. Finally companies,
regardless of their size can

350
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.770
use a lightweight and convenient
tool that makes all the

351
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.130
stakeholders work as a United
team. Even if they're in

352
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.700
different countries by combining intuitive
user interface and the power

353
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.580
server light team poles removes
the roadblocks that you typically

354
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.670
face and applying agile in
an effective manner, no more

355
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.630
lost data, no disparate systems,
no lack of critical analytics

356
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.380
regarding the health and philosophy
project. See if yourself get

357
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.020
a free copy for five
users in one project at

358
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:15.890
tellerik.com/team pulse. And please do
thank Tellerik for supporting Hansel

359
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:20.750
minutes on their Facebook fan
page, facebook.com/t L E R

360
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.470
I K Tellerik. We do
appreciate it. There wouldn't be

361
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.190
a Hansel minutes if there
wasn't teller helping us. So

362
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.700
hardware, backups, backups, backups, and
then I have all the

363
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.150
presentations, everything. Every single thing
that we talked about is

364
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.750
in Dropbox. So let's say
my computer's dead hard drives

365
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.360
are dead. My backup is
dead. I get somebody else's

366
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.670
machine and a fast internet
connection, and I can bring

367
00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.460
it down in Dropbox in
about 20 minutes, assuming they

368
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.490
have like visual studio and
the basics. Sure. So that's

369
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.330
one thing to being prepared
for hardware. Failure is important.

370
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.230
Being prepared for software failure
is hard. And the only

371
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.240
thing that I've found that
I'm interested in, how you

372
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.770
do it is practice, practice,
practice, the more stuff that

373
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.240
goes wrong when you practice.
It means that you'll have

374
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.060
seen that already when it
does go wrong live. Right.

375
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.610
You know what I mean?
There was a thing today

376
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.940
where we had a really
long hang and it looked

377
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.150
really bad. Well, it turned
and I was like, everyone

378
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.970
was like, Oh no, you
know, this is some horrible

379
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.710
thing is happening to the
demo. And they've, they've made

380
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.230
a mistake and they've screwed
up and look, internet Explorer

381
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.170
has hung. I, you know,
visual studios hung it's it

382
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.950
sucks. Well, it was actually
that it was referring to

383
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:36.050
a SQL server name that
was hard coded in a

384
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.290
web config file and it
didn't exist. And I knew

385
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.960
that because when I, when
I saw it, I'd had

386
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.660
it happen before. And I
said to myself, clearly the

387
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.070
only thing that's going to
cause for me to hang

388
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.640
that long, the SQL server,
trying to find a machine

389
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.650
that's gone. Right. And I
went right to it and

390
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.010
I fixed it. Yup. But
debugging that without it, once

391
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:58.500
happening. Yeah. It was funny.
I had fixed that issue

392
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:05.760
by the way. I'm my
<inaudible>. But yeah, there was

393
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.980
a, there was another situation
where it was just having

394
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.670
gone through the steps several
times and being able to

395
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.250
replay those quickly in your
mind to realize that, okay,

396
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.240
I just forgot step three
in case today, because I

397
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.480
was having fun being interrupted
by Scott jokes and stuff,

398
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.270
which was fun. But, but
yeah. Being able to replay

399
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.310
that quickly and say, okay,
I had forgotten the step.

400
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.190
Let's go fix it. Yup.
And in some cases, those

401
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.580
just become teaching moments themselves.
Anyway, I think it's, it's,

402
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.870
it's okay for things to
break on stage. If you

403
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.600
can recover and explain and
make the breaking a learning

404
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.400
experience. Yep. So practice, practice
practice is the one thing

405
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.330
you cannot go over your
demos too much. And you

406
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.080
know, really you can make
mistakes speaking, but if your

407
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:59.820
demo goes poorly, then it
really, it under cuts the,

408
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.800
the, the, the, the essence,
everything that you're trying to

409
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.980
do, it gets uncomfortable very
quick for the audience. Well,

410
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.710
yeah. You know, unless it's
part of your shtick and

411
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.900
sometimes so, you know, today,
you know, and part of

412
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.790
my shtick is consciously making
syntax errors. And this is

413
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.660
actually a new thing I've
been doing lately that, that

414
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.390
a lot of people have
never, they know that I'm

415
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.320
doing is I'll make mistakes,
put a, you know, put

416
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.310
a curly brace somewhere and
put it in, put a

417
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.270
semicolon somewhere else. And then
they'll start taking yell out,

418
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.980
Hey, no, no, you got
to do this. It's not

419
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.620
going to compile or whatever,
but that shows that they're

420
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.730
paying attention and they're engaged
more in there. They're stumped

421
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.820
Scott. So we had a
couple of, of bugs and

422
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.830
some goofy things that we
were doing today that were

423
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.680
on purpose, but it meant
it was after lunch and

424
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.330
it was fun and it
made for a more engaged

425
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.330
audience. So then they get
to see you goof up

426
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.750
and then they're involved in
the fixing. But I dunno

427
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.450
if I would recommend that
for a beginner. Cause it's

428
00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.650
pretty. Yeah. It's tough. It's
tough. And it's tough to,

429
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.670
to, to make it look
honest that you meant to

430
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.940
do. Yeah. Well then if
you do it long enough,

431
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.530
the real, then you can
get away with a little

432
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.750
times. Cause an actual mistake
you can say isn't he

433
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.880
just recovered from, but yeah.
I usually use throw two

434
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.220
or three mistakes in every
talk just to make sure

435
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.960
that they're paying attention and
just cause it's fun. So

436
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.270
yeah, practice a lot. And
then there's all the basic

437
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.990
stuff that people forget that
just kills me. You know,

438
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.440
I can't see your fonts.
They're too small. The F

439
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.210
you know, you're trying to
fit too much stuff in

440
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.580
a, in a, in a
PowerPoint. PowerPoint is not a

441
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.200
word document. And if you
say things like, well, you

442
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.880
won't be able to see
this, or you can't see,

443
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.330
but it says, then you
zoom in, fix it. Also

444
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:57.050
the, the number one mistake
is slides as crutch, right?

445
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.650
Don't read me your slides.
I can read faster than

446
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.790
you can speak, period. So
if there's some quote or

447
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.790
some, you know, amazing quote
by JFK that you want

448
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.390
them to read, just shut
up and let them read.

449
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.380
Which brings me to the
kind of the final really

450
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.170
good tip that I learned
about is that silence is

451
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.830
really important. And it's better
for you to be quiet

452
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:26.720
than say, because even what
you will perceive as being

453
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.440
for an incredibly long amount
of silence, you know, three

454
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.380
seconds, two seconds, they won't
notice. It sounds like a

455
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.260
lot of time in your
head when you cause everyone's

456
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.400
staring at you. But if
you consciously replace the ums

457
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.430
that you're going to say
with silence. Yep. It'll sound

458
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.170
really like that. It goes
back to that pause. Think

459
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.750
about the next thing you're
going to say and be

460
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:54.040
intentional about it. So It
gets everything right. Intentionality. Yep.

461
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.790
Which is more of a
skill than, than anything. I

462
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.760
mean, you have to be
conscious and never have I

463
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.530
molt, and I'm not a
good multitasker, but never have

464
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.740
my multitask. Then when I'm
presenting, because you're, you have

465
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.500
words coming out of your
mouth at the same exact

466
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.750
time as your fingers are
typing at the same exact

467
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.450
time as you're thinking of
what to do next. I

468
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.940
mean, it's, it's a special
kind of multitasking, but it

469
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.610
is the only true multitasking
that I think I'm able

470
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.520
to do anymore. Yeah. Let's
do that. Yeah. It takes

471
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.040
a lot of practice. I
mean, not just, not just

472
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.280
practicing demos, but just doing
a lot of speaking. And

473
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.640
we talked about this because
you know, I've been at

474
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.650
Microsoft, I'm doing more management
than out speaking lately. And

475
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.870
just getting back out there
in front of an audience

476
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.400
can be rough at first.
And so, you know, it

477
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.490
was, it was much easier
when I was out working

478
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.030
for Microsoft in the field
presenting every week or even

479
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.450
twice a week to keep
that skill up. But you

480
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.860
know, it's one of those
things that the more you

481
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.140
practice, the more often you
do it, the better you

482
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.940
get at it. Well, that's
a good point. Let's talk

483
00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.630
about this. Or the last
talk I did before this

484
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:07.270
talk was my PDC presentation,
which I thought, and this

485
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.850
is just me personally, when
I came away from it,

486
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.290
like it was one of
the best talks I've ever.

487
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.690
Yeah. I thought the same
thing, actually. I thought that's

488
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.120
one of the best presentations
I've seen Scott give. Yeah.

489
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.570
Nothing about anyone else's presentations,
but just my own. That

490
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:23.050
was my, my personal best.
I think it was like

491
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.140
nine out of 10 that
it just, everything worked. And

492
00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.790
it was one of those
things where everything just came

493
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.670
together. The demos worked and
the timing works and I

494
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.530
stuck the landing and it
was live and it was

495
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.110
streaming and there's all, it
was just great. And I

496
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.370
haven't talked since then. So
that's October, November, December, January.

497
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.760
So what was I saying
to you on the, on

498
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.800
the, as we were coming
over here, We were nervous

499
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.560
that you could live up
to your last presentation. I

500
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.260
was a mess from the
moment I got off the

501
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.380
plane, the last two days,
hanging out with you, right.

502
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.870
Even walking up, we've been
wandering the streets of Amsterdam,

503
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.860
talking about everything. And then
always coming back to the,

504
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.120
this is going to be
awful. Nervous. Yeah. We're totally

505
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.840
screwed. You were pretty nervous
before the PDC session too,

506
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.870
though. I remember that talking
to you and remember I

507
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.170
was nervous about timings and
nervous about I think. And

508
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.870
that's another thing that I
think people have a impression

509
00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.990
that Scott Hanselman doesn't get
nervous before he goes on

510
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.870
stage. James Senior knows that
I am a nervous wreck.

511
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.830
Right. I am a 14
year old girl for like

512
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.970
two days before these things.
It is just awful. Yep.

513
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.190
And then the second you
get on stage, you just

514
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.100
forget that stuff. The adrenaline
rush. Take the energy. Yeah,

515
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.950
Totally. Yeah. So the argument
that nobody yet, you don't

516
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.200
get nervous. I mean, you
get, it's a different kind

517
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.940
of nervous. It's not like
butterflies nervous about the basic

518
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.540
execution. I know I can
speak on stage. I just

519
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.280
don't know what's going to
come out of my head

520
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.200
and if I'm going to
be able to be, and

521
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.820
then I've also got the
additional problem of diabetes. So

522
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.590
you probably noticed towards the
end of the day to

523
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.190
day, I was checking my
blood sugar while speaking, typing,

524
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.650
I was going to tell
you four times, If you

525
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.830
catch me at the right
moment, like the sight of

526
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.010
blood will turn me away.
Oh, I didn't know. You

527
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.480
had all of a sudden
right in front of me.

528
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.610
Cause you were trying to
hide it behind a laptop,

529
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.310
prick your finger and tested
your blood sugar. And I

530
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.100
was like, okay. I'm okay.
I didn't know you had

531
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.940
that. Yeah. Some people will
just go out. Yeah. I

532
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.390
don't know why It's a
thing people have, but yeah.

533
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:31.760
So sometimes people will see
me checking what they think

534
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.520
is my pager. You know,
it's my insulin pump. And

535
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.520
I actually find a portion
of the talk where I

536
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.080
don't have to hit the
keyboard for a while. And

537
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.570
I'll literally just keep talking
without missing a beat while

538
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.690
checking my blood sugar and
then, you know, drinking an

539
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:48.440
orange juice or whatever to
keep from falling over. They

540
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.780
miss a beat. Yeah. Prick
finger, put it onto those

541
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.170
strip and then check the
number and then you're back

542
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.860
then. Yeah. I always, I
always compare speaking under pressure

543
00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.730
like this to like, cause
I'm all about analogies, right?

544
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.790
And I throw analogies at
the wall like spaghetti and

545
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.500
hoping that some of them
will stick. And I, you

546
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.720
know, but one of the
one is that there is

547
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.450
an analogy, right? There is
it's speaking. LA is like,

548
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.030
when you're a little kid
like eight or nine or

549
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.480
10 and you're running downhill
as fast as you can

550
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:25.190
downhill. And you're going so
fast, faster than your feet

551
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.040
have ever gone because you're
running downhill. But if you

552
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.940
think about your feet for
a second, you're going to

553
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.060
miss a step and you're
going to just spill. Right.

554
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:38.270
So you have to think
about not thinking about your

555
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:42.340
feet so that you don't
fall, right? So you like,

556
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.280
you need the concentrate, but
it's the concept. It's like

557
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.850
a Zen thing it's concentrating
on. Not concentrating. You need

558
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.480
to be absolutely intentional and
think about every single aspect

559
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.660
of what you're doing from
your breathing to your, how

560
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.760
wet your mouth is to
where you, you know, if

561
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.400
you got burgers in your
nose and what are your

562
00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.840
demos are doing all that
without overthinking it. Because if

563
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.910
you do, you're going to
think about your feet and

564
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.170
totally fall over. So that's
the Zen place you have

565
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.380
to get to think about
everything and nothing. Yeah. That's

566
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.500
a good point. Yeah. I've
always thought about it as

567
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.500
a, trying to, you know,
I'm treading water and I'm

568
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.570
trying to keep my head
above water. And if the

569
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.150
session's going well and doing
fine, keeping my head above

570
00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:26.130
water, as soon as I
get below, I started to

571
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:31.110
panic. Panic sets in and
the session just, just starts

572
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.150
to go South. But Well,
that gets to your question.

573
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.040
I'm not sure. I really
answered about like when you're

574
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.580
down, how do you recover?
How do you recover? I

575
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.820
don't know, man. I mean,
you hear about the stent.

576
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.320
I hear about standup comedians.
They bomb bombing means that

577
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.890
you just did horribly. And
they bombed like night after

578
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.980
night after night. And I
think that you keep going

579
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:57.000
up there because you know,
one that you won't and

580
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.600
aye. Aye, aye, aye, aye,
aye. Tell jokes that don't

581
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.850
go over or I do
demos that don't work or

582
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.880
whatever. And you just hope
that that's not the one

583
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.370
that's filmed and that's not
the one that is live

584
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:12.150
streaming that's remembered. Yeah. But
as far as like tips

585
00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.520
and tricks, there's no tricks
that I can. I mean,

586
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.430
we don't put in tricks
to make demos work. We

587
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.630
don't like cheat or, or,
you know, everything we're doing

588
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:26.370
is real know you'll hard.
You'll, hardcode the occasional XML

589
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.010
file, but you're not going
to cheat in any major

590
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.280
way. Yeah. Because that would
be neat. That wouldn't be

591
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.380
a demo then that would
just be watching a slide

592
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:39.570
of pictures of things happen.
But a preparation I think

593
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:44.040
is the thing I probably
spend a week on and

594
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.800
off getting a good hour
and a half, two hour

595
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.950
demo working. I know that
James senior who put together

596
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.150
the webcams content just spent
months. Right. Getting it perfect.

597
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.430
And not only did he
do that, but he also

598
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.320
made content that could be
given to other people to

599
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.800
present. Yeah. I was going
to say preparing demos for

600
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.040
other people to present and
trying to handle every random

601
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.710
thing that they might do.
Yeah. It's a, it's pretty

602
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.020
difficult. It's a nightmare. He's
actually come up with a

603
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.720
really nice format though that
I'm starting to use as

604
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.470
well, but he makes this
landscape page and he's got

605
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.910
pros on the far left
column steps in bold face

606
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.800
in the middle and then
a screenshot of what you

607
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.320
should be looking at on
the right. It's a really

608
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.810
great thing. He says he
actually has a service that

609
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.400
does that for him. So
he'll record the presentation and

610
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.200
he'll send it to the
service. They'll write everything up

611
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.330
that he wrote that he
did. So they're basically, it's

612
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:42.520
like a code presentation transcription.
Yeah. I know. It's just

613
00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.460
a consulting company that we
use. Cause I want to

614
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.770
have them do that with
my talks. It's great. That's

615
00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.800
great. Yeah. I didn't even
know that that existed. They

616
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.470
build our demos, you know,
we come up with kind

617
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.750
of conceptualize it and then
they'll go and do the

618
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.300
coding for us and they'll
break it down and script

619
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.930
it. And for the talking
points rather than us going

620
00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.480
and typing them in for
them, we'll just go through

621
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.700
the demo, say what we
want to say. So it's

622
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.670
more natural. And then they'll
record that into the pros.

623
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.160
See, I've never, you know,
10 years of doing this.

624
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.920
I've never done that. I
never thought about that. I

625
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.820
break things down like, like
a short story. I think

626
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.680
about what am I trying
to accomplish in the next

627
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.220
hour? I break it up
in 10 minute chunks and

628
00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.390
I have a peak or
kind of a crescendo somewhere

629
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.580
in the middle or three
quarters of the way through.

630
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.110
And I think about just
like classic eighth grade English,

631
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.290
here's my thesis. Say what
I'm going to say, say

632
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:40.570
it. What did I just
say? I was just going

633
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:46.120
to do that and repeat.
But yeah, if I started

634
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.490
doing presentations for other people
that I would give, I

635
00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.410
would, I would definitely want
to use a transcription service.

636
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.150
How do people break into
it and move into the

637
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.440
big stuff, nail it down
at the local code camps

638
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.120
in the local things, the
a hundred person events and

639
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.230
also speak anywhere. One of
the things that's actually funny

640
00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.890
is that people don't realize
that there's other places to

641
00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:13.180
speak and other opportunities that,
that, for example, like with

642
00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.850
me, they won't see me
because I'm speaking at events

643
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.210
that they wouldn't go to.
Like next month we've got

644
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:22.870
MVP summit, but I'm going
to actually run down to

645
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:29.350
LA and speak at a
interior decorators, bloggers summit, and

646
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.290
I'm doing it for free,
but I want the practice.

647
00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:34.630
Right. And it's this kind
of other expertise that you

648
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.210
have, which is having a
great blog, right? So we

649
00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.090
can take that to anywhere.
And I do talk. So

650
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:42.430
I'm doing a talk at
Intel to their agile conference

651
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:45.460
and you know, don't doing
nothing non-Microsoft stuff, right? There's

652
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.220
stuff on the side, I'm
going to talk about, you

653
00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:52.390
know, being effective versus being
efficient in information overload. And

654
00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.910
I'll do that. And like
this thing that this interior

655
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:57.160
decorators thing they heard, they
heard, I gave a good

656
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.480
talk at this, this conference
for called blogging while Brown

657
00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.150
it's for bloggers of color.
And they had someone saw

658
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.040
me there and they said,
Oh, you should come to

659
00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.800
BlogWorld. And I went to
blog world and these fit

660
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.110
in with my kind of
my existing job. And it

661
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.060
gives me an opportunity to
practice. So for example, they're

662
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.850
going to pay, they don't
pay these little gigs. They'll

663
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.370
pay for the flight to
fly me to LA that

664
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:22.420
morning practice by giving a
talk to these interior decorators

665
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:24.670
and I'll come up to
Seattle and then I'll give

666
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.670
the MPB temp, MVP summit.
And I'll be a warmed

667
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:31.510
up as it were. That's
an example. I speak at

668
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:35.200
like Portland, community college or
local local colleges, local user

669
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.070
groups that you know that
I'm not, I'm not blogging

670
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.650
about that. I'm off at
such and such. I'd spoken.

671
00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:44.760
I'm in Eugene, Oregon, a
little, little town in Oregon.

672
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.290
It's like a three hour
drive. They invited me down.

673
00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.800
They said they would give
me tacos. So they bought

674
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.390
me tacos and I drove
down and I gave a

675
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.180
talk, but that's how you
kind of keep that's one

676
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.240
of the secrets. Isn't it
we'll do anything for tacos.

677
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.970
That is a secret. But
I think the actual secret

678
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.600
is though that for every
big talk, I guess what

679
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.420
I'm saying is you can't
be expected to not speak

680
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.060
for three months and then
go to a code camp

681
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.030
and be awesome and nail
it. Right. You have to

682
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.620
be doing this, like, think
about it in the terms

683
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.200
of the I'm the comedian,
you gotta do the small

684
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.930
clubs. You gotta do it
all the time. And there's

685
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:21.240
enough stuff going on out
there. Like everyone's like, why

686
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.000
are you speaking at an
interior decorators conference? Well, because

687
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.760
it's sharpen the saw, where
else am I going to

688
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.670
talk? Whether it's a user
group or MVP summit or

689
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.660
any opportunity I've spoken at
small financial services companies on

690
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.720
how to use Twitter and
things like that, anywhere that

691
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.850
you can talk to a
different kind of person. I've

692
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:40.830
talked to like old people
in suits where I had

693
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.140
to wear a suit and
I've talked to, you know,

694
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.950
whatever, right? Any opportunity to
speak. When you have an

695
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.640
arsenal of things that you
pull out and use onstage,

696
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.460
like your analogies and other
stories that you tell, and

697
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.280
those stories often then unique
ones, the new ones come

698
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.260
up because you put yourself
in a different situation. Right.

699
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.860
And then you can, you've
told it, it worked and

700
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.360
you hold on to put
it in. Yeah. You put

701
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:09.030
it in the safer isn't
later. Absolutely. Well, I think

702
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.880
that's it really? I mean,
it's a sharpen. The saw

703
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.520
practice as much as you
can talk to anybody, whenever

704
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.860
you can take any opportunity
to talk to 10 people

705
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.380
and have a luncheon talk
to a thousand people at

706
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.010
a conference, when you do
it, record yourself. When you

707
00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.550
present, be prepared, be prepared
about what you're going to

708
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.700
say, don't memorize it, but
know your stuff backwards and

709
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.240
forwards. Do your demos the
least 10 times I do

710
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.910
most of my 20 or
more. Right. You went through

711
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.830
the demos over and over
and over and over again

712
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.650
and still thinks, went wrong.
But the things that went

713
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.540
wrong we'd seen before and
we knew what to do

714
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.440
about it and then wake
up the next morning and

715
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.670
do it all again. Yep.
Cool. Well, I'm going to

716
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.310
pass out now. Okay, great.
Cool. You're going to pass

717
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.480
out too. I think so.
Alright. It's bedtime out here

718
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.900
in the Netherlands. We will
see you again next week.

719
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:02.970
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes.
