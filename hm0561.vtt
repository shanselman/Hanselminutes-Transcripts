00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.420
From hanselminutes.com. It's handful minutes,
a weekly discussion with web

2
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.760
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

3
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.320
number 561. In this episode,
Scott checks in at connect

4
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.310
in New York with Joel Spolsky
from stack exchange stack overflow.

5
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.540
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

6
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.780
Hansel minutes. I'm here actually
in New York at connect we're

7
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.840
backstage. I'm here with Joel
Spolsky. How's it going? Hi,

8
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.700
Scott. How's it going? It's
great to be back on

9
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.980
Hansel minutes. Yeah, it's been
a while. I've been on

10
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.260
stack overflow podcast. A couple
of times. It has been.

11
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.090
We need to get you
back by the way. Yeah,

12
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.750
we're doing that every week
now. Seriously? Yeah. That's cool.

13
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.960
How many episodes are you
up to now? 50, 60

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.290
chilly nights. A lot a
ton. We kept changing the

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.460
name of it. And when
we had to reset the

16
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
numbers. Oh, really? What is
the name that became stack

17
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.300
exchange stack overflow? Again, I
didn't even remember. I didn't

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.810
even notice that happens. Just
cloud dot clown dot far.

19
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.930
Thank you for already having
me bleep you out within

20
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.830
a minute of the podcast.
So I didn't even remember

21
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.300
that. I know that you
were stack exchanged, but I

22
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.120
guess there's eight guys was
always stack overflow. So that's

23
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.490
why you went with the
name after years and years

24
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.950
of trying to convince people.
No, no stack exchanges though.

25
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.610
The larger thing that includes
a stack overflow stack overflow

26
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.070
is really sort of at
the center of what we

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.940
do. And so when I
think of stack overflow though,

28
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.030
I think if stack overflow
server fault and super-user wow.

29
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.090
That's old school and then
long tail as long, 150.

30
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.480
Yeah. Yeah. Really the long
tail is not, I don't

31
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.740
want to exclude anybody but
math. So math overflow, mathematics

32
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.310
that Stacie Shane's a lot
of other, slightly smaller ones

33
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.620
like statistics probability and that
kind of stuff. But really

34
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.470
math is, is huge. There's
a lot of different languages

35
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.350
now. So let's take a
phone, Russian psychofillin, Japanese textures,

36
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.030
Spanish. Those are really big
and fastest growing. You. It's

37
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.700
probably stack overflow in Portuguese
and Russian, I think are

38
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.330
two giant stack. Overflow's really?
Ah, yup. See, that's the

39
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.210
thing, right? Like math, isn't
my thing, Portuguese. Isn't my

40
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.180
thing. So it's easy for
me to have blinders on

41
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.230
and not even know exist.
It's like orchid, right? Number

42
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.960
orchid came and went and
never used it once, but

43
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.080
it was huge. Right? So
like I say, back in

44
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.520
Brazil, I was talking with
Jen yang. If your designers

45
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.820
are creative director of psycho
flow and a good friend.

46
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.860
And one of the things
that I love about him

47
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.060
and his design philosophy around
these stack overflow stack exchange

48
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.880
X other sites, is he
really tries to understand the

49
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.730
audience to make sure that
the theme fits. It's not

50
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.380
just a one how to
make it for them. That

51
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.900
was something really like Jeff
Atwood. Also, it was very

52
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.970
much about like, this has
to be your site. If

53
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.970
you're, if it's the, I
don't know, WordPress psych or

54
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.250
something, if you're a WordPress
person, you really have to

55
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.290
feel like this is your
site. It's not just a,

56
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.200
like a little colony that
the, that the overlord set

57
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.590
up for you. Yeah. And
Jen really takes that all

58
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.330
the way through to the
graphic design, which you see,

59
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.460
not just him, there's other
designers too, that work on

60
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.170
the new sites. But every,
every new site that comes

61
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.930
out, like a lot of
consultation with the active people

62
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.850
in the community about what
are the right, you know,

63
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.400
what's the right font. What's
the right color is what,

64
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.010
the rights and most what's
the right logo. Yeah. And

65
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.560
I remember when it was
just gin. Yeah. And then

66
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.210
I remember when you, He
was trying to hire people

67
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.610
now, so now he's got
a team. And at that

68
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.110
time we used to joke.
Cause we would look at

69
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.880
these other companies, we'd be
like, did you hear Twitter?

70
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.700
Twitter has 40 graphic designers.
And we'd be like, what

71
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.740
a 40 people do there.
We couldn't even figure it

72
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.560
out. It's like they put
birds on things, resize, PNGs,

73
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.300
I guess. But I don't
know why they had so

74
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.480
many and now, ah, now
we have a dozen or

75
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.820
so Stack overflow. That's a
big deal though. Like, is,

76
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.330
does that representative, is that
emblematic of the growth of,

77
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.990
Yeah. So the company is
like 300 employees as of

78
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.790
today. So pretty big company.
Do you know everyone? Absolutely.

79
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.520
But it's getting to the
point where it's like, I

80
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.040
know that I graduated with
her. I probably forget more

81
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.200
people every day that I
meet. Yeah. It's kind of

82
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.330
going down. That's like, there's
a legitimacy. Those, you will

83
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.120
300 person company. That's <inaudible>
all those people are. Like,

84
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.130
we think of them as
like the little birds with

85
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.660
their mouths open and you
got to fly back the

86
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.750
nest and give them a
paycheck every two weeks. And

87
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.090
hopefully they do great work.
Yeah. How many people are

88
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.680
in at fall? Fantastic. Buck
is a about 35 people.

89
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.420
Trello is about a hundred
people, 173 companies, three companies.

90
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.520
Yeah. That's cool. Located at
all. Or is that a

91
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.990
way to like cut costs
or How do you do

92
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.210
that? Not quite well. All
right. So let's say stack

93
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.600
overflow. It they're all headquartered
in New York, but they all

94
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.790
also use a lot of
remote workers. So most of

95
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.490
our development teams, community teams
and all of these companies

96
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.070
are remote people that we
hire wherever they may be

97
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.010
Really. I mean, you've really
pioneered that like companies like

98
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.400
Microsoft, Remember that I'm a
remote employee. Sometimes every Are

99
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.700
super not remote friendly and
it's, we're constantly teaching them

100
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.080
and stack overflow. They're unapologetically
remote. It's a, it's more

101
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.590
than that. It's that there's
a huge difference between being

102
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.890
the remote employee at a
company that's not really focused

103
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.690
on being remote where you
really have to work hard

104
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.660
to, to remind them that
you exist and to like

105
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.700
not get forgotten at a
meeting or you go to

106
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.350
a meeting and they turn
on the little TV screen

107
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.940
and then it's sort of
like the connection goes down

108
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.330
and they forget you. And
so for us, everything is

109
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.290
remote first and the teams
are remote first and it's

110
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.620
just not enough people in
any one place that any

111
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.170
meeting could ever be held
in person. And so the

112
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.350
assumption is a meeting is
going to be online. And

113
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.780
that, that kind of makes
a big difference, both in

114
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.970
the kind of people that
we can hire in that

115
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.820
we can hire great people
all over the place, much

116
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.450
slower turnover. I guess we
don't lose employees so much

117
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.710
because we're often one of
the best employers in, I

118
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.800
don't know where, or why
or Arizona or someplace that

119
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.120
doesn't have as big a
tech to compete for our

120
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.200
great employees. So yeah, not
only unapologetic, but really happy

121
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.700
about it. And just the
quality of the work has

122
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.270
been much better because of
the high quality people we've

123
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.340
been able to hire and
keep in the fact that

124
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.100
they've been with us for
years and years. So very

125
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.380
happy about that for the
most part, there are, there

126
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.110
is a Trello and fog
Creek shared office in New York

127
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.560
city. And there's a sort
of the headquarters of those

128
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.040
two companies, but it's the
same office that office probably

129
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.990
holds 50 something people and
everybody else's remote It is,

130
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.540
is the intent to make
the art I've been been

131
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.120
to those offices. They're amazing.
You know, you've done blog

132
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.980
posts on like why it's
important to have a great

133
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.170
office if you do have
an office. Yeah, we do.

134
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.850
We still work on minimum.
Is there, is there an

135
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.560
intent to have like a
center of gravity? That's just

136
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.450
so awesome that you would
just really want to come

137
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.780
into work? Yeah, there, there
was historically we used to

138
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.580
say, you know, like we
kind of want to, all

139
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.650
of us being equal would
rather have you in the

140
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.290
office. But I think now
just for pure financial reasons,

141
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.530
always being equal, we'd actually
rather, you just stay at

142
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.500
home wherever it is that
you live financial reasons. Yeah.

143
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.890
We don't have to pay
for an office in New York.

144
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.590
It's expensive. And so, yeah.
Yeah. And given that, you

145
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.330
know, we get the same
quality work out of people

146
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.210
wherever they are. The fact
that they're in the office

147
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.810
just means that we're also
shelling out for. So I've

148
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.610
talked with a lot of
remote employees and I felt

149
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.460
this myself that because I'm
remote, I'm afraid that the

150
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.910
boss thinks I'm just hanging
out. That's interesting. I always

151
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.310
thought about the opposite. I
mean maybe I dunno. I

152
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.060
dunno if you code Scott.
I do. But the point

153
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.390
is, is that I know
the point is that I

154
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.290
have This, I believe and
forgive me the audience who

155
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.990
is listening, that I believe
that there's a low self

156
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.270
esteem for lack of a
better word. We have the

157
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.870
remote employee and we try
to overcompensate. So I believe

158
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.720
we work extra hard and
we have a tendency to

159
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.750
have some work life balance
issues where we work remotely

160
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.460
to have work life balance.
And then we stay up

161
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.650
all night because we're afraid
that the boss thinks we're

162
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.470
just hanging out. Right. And
you can just time your

163
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.190
emails to go out a
different strategy in the morning

164
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.230
and then leave. They compose
a draft and then send

165
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.490
it when you're at dinner.
The actually my, my theory

166
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.140
is if you're a boss
and you're looking around at

167
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.120
your team and your team
is all sitting in a

168
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.030
long table in one of
those Soho startups around the

169
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.710
corner here, right. Where they
all sit at a long

170
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.800
table, eight you're sort of
judging people based on, did

171
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.630
I see them at seven
o'clock at night, right before

172
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.390
I went home. Right? If
you don't have the people

173
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.310
sitting there at that table,
you judge them by their

174
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.680
check-ins. You judge them by
the actual work that they

175
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.040
do at, by the, you
know, button in C and

176
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.640
contrary wise, is that even
a word, if you're one

177
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.790
of those employees and you're
sitting there and so home

178
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.840
and it's five o'clock and
you're exhausted and there's nothing

179
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.700
left that you can do,
right. And it's just time

180
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.250
to go home. Or you're
nervous about your kids have

181
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.440
been dropped off at school
with a thing and whatever

182
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.830
who knows, or, you know,
your, your new Apple Mac

183
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.590
book pro has just arrived
and you want to go

184
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.350
pick it up before the
ups station closes or whatever,

185
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.090
whatever it is. It's distracting
when you're looking at like,

186
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.630
if your boss hasn't left
yet. And so you're on

187
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.990
Reddit and you're on doing
things on, right. You're moving

188
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.690
the mouse, moving the mouse.
And just like, you know,

189
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.790
all tapping into your visual
studio was in 2012, 2017

190
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.920
for Macintosh edition. Right. I
was in Japan and again,

191
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.100
in no intent to make
stereotypes, but in the office

192
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.720
I was in, in Japan
for the time that I

193
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.750
was there, there was a,
I won't leave until the

194
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.860
boss leaves. Yeah. That's a
role. And that's awkward. Yeah.

195
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.850
That was sort of a
rule in the America. In

196
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.760
the fifties and sixties, they
told everybody, you got to

197
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.440
do that. You got to
come before the boss it'll

198
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.620
leave after judging gaze. And
it was just based on,

199
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.560
you know, what they call
button seat time and not

200
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.650
based on anything realistic about
the work that you're doing.

201
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.380
And when you have a
remote team, you really can

202
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.480
only evaluate them based on
the actual work that they

203
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.880
did in their productivity. And
it's just so much easier

204
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.980
just to see like, that
person is fixing bugs and

205
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.590
checking in code. I mean,
that's a much easier way

206
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.530
without trying to remember if
they're at the office a

207
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.380
lot. Yeah. So what about
like soft skills? Like I've

208
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.960
got, I work remotely. I
have a team that works

209
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.180
for me. I've got someone
in Philly. I've got someone

210
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.210
in New York. I've got someone
in Northern Ireland and ultimately

211
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.580
it's like, are the Trello
cards moving to the right?

212
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.340
Cool. It's kind of all
I have. I can judge

213
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.190
that. They're doing well. As
well as every Monday, they

214
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.050
send out an email, which
is the, here are the

215
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.880
things I'd like to get
done this week. And they

216
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.640
tell it to the team.
It's almost like a standup,

217
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.160
that's an asynchronous Stan. It's
a commitment. Yeah. And then

218
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.920
Friday, this is what I
accomplished. And here's, it's very

219
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.930
honest. We try to say,
here's what we did not

220
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.270
do. Here's how we failed.
Right. And then we ask

221
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.430
ourselves, is there something that
another member of the team

222
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.060
could have done to may
have made you successful? And

223
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.840
then Monday we Try it
all over again. Try it

224
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.570
again. That's, that's nice. The,
you do need to Institute

225
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.250
this. I think everybody should
Institute them. I don't think

226
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.470
that's a remote that's specific
to remote work. I think

227
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.000
everybody has to figure out
how am I going to

228
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.240
keep people accountable and keep
people moving forward and keep

229
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.970
people understanding what thing it
is that they're trying to

230
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.740
move to the right, whether
it's cards on a Trello

231
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.290
board or some number that
they're responsible to increase. Like

232
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.820
my job is getting more
people to sign up for

233
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.490
stack overflow. So, you know,
at the beginning of the

234
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.020
week, I want to have
some metric. And at the

235
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.160
end of the week, I
want that metric to be

236
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.280
higher and figuring out what
it is that you're really

237
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.270
accountable for is important. I
mean, that's the hardest thing

238
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.110
I've discovered. Like as, as
I grow into being the

239
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.630
CEO of a larger and
larger company, discovering that it's

240
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.270
harder and harder to figure
out how to do that

241
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.190
as a company is getting
more and more complicated. You

242
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.180
know, they used to be
a time. If you're a

243
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.180
company with 12 people with
35 people, you know, you

244
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.580
all have lunch together, you
talk about things. Everybody understands

245
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.800
what you're working on and
what you're looking at. But

246
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.750
at some point it kind
of breaks down. And all

247
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.760
of a sudden you discover
that somebody has just spent

248
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.110
six weeks working on something
and you say, well, I

249
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.620
need to work on that.
And they're like, nah. And

250
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.300
you say, well, you know,
what's really important to us

251
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.040
is getting more people to
sign up for stack overflow.

252
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.740
And they say, yeah, well,
theoretically, it will get more

253
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.410
people to sign up for
stack overflow because you know,

254
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.540
the colors that I chose
are nicer than the whatever.

255
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.090
And so my peoples, like,
did you measure how much

256
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.500
that is? And you discover
one thing that I recently

257
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.380
learned as if a developer
on a dev team is

258
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.520
even 5% off on what
the mission is, they can

259
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.660
do 100% wrong work. If
they don't exactly understand, like,

260
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.030
what am I, what number
am I maximizing? What thing

261
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.310
am I trying to get?
They can do something that

262
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.040
kind of inadvertently, they, if
they think the goal is

263
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.810
to get more signups for
stack overflow and they say,

264
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.120
Hey, I'm going to work
on a, a, I dunno,

265
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.920
maybe let's show fewer ads
so that we can get

266
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.990
more, right. Maybe people are
more likely to sign up

267
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.480
if we don't show ads
so often. And that's just

268
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.670
their theory. And then they
could spend a year working

269
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.540
on that, that crazy theory
and not move the needle

270
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.190
at all. And the number
of people signing up for

271
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.420
stack overflow, because their understanding
of what, what we meant

272
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.460
by that was just off
by just a tiny, tiny

273
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.850
bit. Right. And it's not,
it's no malice at all.

274
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.400
No, not at all. Absolutely
not. Absolutely not At a,

275
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.280
at a giant company. Like
Microsoft is weird because you

276
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.710
know, we worked there in
the nineties, right? Yeah. How

277
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.170
big was it when you
were at Microsoft? 5,000 seriously

278
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.320
5,000 cap. Okay. Yeah. Like
our divisions, like 5,000, right?

279
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.960
Yeah. That's a big still,
that's a big, Yeah, no,

280
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.220
it's a big company, but
like now we're like a

281
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.480
hundred and 500,000. Right. But
it's a thousand little companies

282
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.920
have a couple of hundred
people each, you know what

283
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.600
I mean? Like I only
interact with a couple of

284
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.150
hundred people at a time.
So I feel like I

285
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.030
work in.net with a couple
of hundred people. But the

286
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.100
biggest issue that we have
is when people are working

287
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.960
on stuff and they have
no idea that someone else

288
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.420
is also working on the
same thing. Right. There's these

289
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.850
silos. We were going the
exact same thing. Even when

290
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.700
I was there, there was
this famous story. I don't

291
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.820
think I was there. But
at some point, bill Gates

292
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.440
said, how many people are
working on rich text editing

293
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.260
from windows right now, this
is windows 3.0, did not

294
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:43.860
have a common, rich text
editing control. Right. And the,

295
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.920
he assigned a guy named
bill Johnson to go count.

296
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.100
And he came back and
said, 123 people in the

297
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.930
company are working on a
rich text editor in some

298
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.180
way, shape or form. And
there was like 19 Dina

299
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.460
them, you know, there's mail
and this word and this.

300
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.220
Right, right. Exactly. How many
other, we have those conversations.

301
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.340
Now I got on that.
I wouldn't say trouble lowercase

302
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.240
T trouble. When Vollmer was
still the guy, when I

303
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.400
said I listed, I made
a tweet or something. And

304
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.830
I listed out how many
paint applications that we had,

305
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.480
you know what I mean?
Like different apps for drawing

306
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.430
stuff. It's more than just
paint brush, right? Yeah. Cause

307
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.460
there's like, you know, the
insert, paint, drawing thing and

308
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.920
word, and it was just
like, how many things do

309
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.290
we need for painting? Can
we, or photos? It was

310
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.820
like, there was a time
when there's like five different

311
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.090
ways to take a photo
album and hopefully we're getting

312
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.590
those things fixed. But that
sounds like that's just an

313
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.350
organizational thing in general. I
don't know if that's the

314
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.460
end of the world. Really.
I don't know if you

315
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.050
could make a company with
a hundred thousand people and

316
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.850
really only We have one
team, but say the thing

317
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.830
is then there's a huge
statue tax. Then they give

318
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.960
it a name called coopertition,
you know what I mean?

319
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.180
And they think it's a
good thing. And then you

320
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.430
basically like let's all against
other groups, let's all make

321
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.620
our rich text editor and
then we'll have them fight

322
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.980
in the battle bot arena.
Right. I dunno. It may

323
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.440
just be a question as
to whether a can ever

324
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.360
really get to a hundred
thousand people and still be

325
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.390
productive in a, in a,
in a way. Or does

326
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.600
it get any kind of,
does it have a disadvantage

327
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.330
or, or an advantage of
the company with maybe a

328
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.580
hundred companies with that? Some
people thousand companies Xamarin acquisition

329
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.060
point not screwing up Xamarin
I'm sure is high on

330
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.120
someone's list because it works.
Yeah. It's small, it's tight.

331
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.250
They have a different remote
policy. It works really great.

332
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.500
It's now part of a
division, a larger division. Yeah.

333
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.420
How do you integrate it
without breaking? What made it

334
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.450
awesome. Right, right. Yeah. Is
your company now, it's not

335
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.980
going to float out of
the biggest company you've ever

336
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.540
been in the boss of
yes. And every day it

337
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.540
is the bigger, bigger it
is. The biggest company you've

338
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.160
ever been the boss of.
Yeah. Do you have a

339
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.400
preference between 300 person company?
And what I think of

340
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.760
is like a high end
boutique When I visited you

341
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.160
Fog Creek, I was like,
wow, because I love the

342
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.350
idea of a boutique. You
know what I mean? Like

343
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.580
I want to be Macy's.
I want to, like, I

344
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.480
used to work at a
consultancy in the 93 94.

345
00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.360
And the, the, the gentleman,
the older gentleman who owned

346
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.510
the place said, this is
my retirement. You are my

347
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.890
legacy. Okay. There's 35 of
us at the casino. We

348
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.240
did actually still around. He
made a 35 person boutique

349
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.240
and he says, we're paying
the mortgages and the rent

350
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:09.190
for 35 people. This company
will go, you know, public

351
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.000
and maybe fail, but we
have value. We have quality.

352
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.500
And so there's something to
be said for that. Like

353
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.540
when do you stop? What
happens if stack overflow becomes

354
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.310
a hundred thousand people like
that would be a failure

355
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:22.460
or success? I think that
might be a failure. And

356
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.930
a lot of times I,
you can't call it a,

357
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.540
you can't call it either.
I think there's. So first

358
00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.060
of all, the, of the
companies, the a hundred thousand

359
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.980
person companies are, you know,
the, the Googles and the

360
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.630
Microsoft and apples and so
forth GM and are often,

361
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.270
they're trying to do a
million different things. They're trying

362
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.090
to do globally, an alphabet
of things, even an alphabet

363
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.030
of things, even. Yeah. And
that's sort of just a

364
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.890
different universe than when you're
trying to do one thing

365
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.870
and get it right. Yeah.
I th the difference between

366
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.350
a boutique of like 50
people versus the 300 people,

367
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.350
is that in the 50
person company, you kind of

368
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.360
look around and there's really
nobody to do that thing

369
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.030
that needs to get done
today. And so as CEO,

370
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.460
you do it, or you
have somebody who's unqualified to

371
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.410
do it, try to do
it in some kind of

372
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.420
hacky kind of way, where
you're like, Hey, you know,

373
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.730
we need to, I dunno,
build out or whatever today

374
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.670
we need a new payment
processor, or we need somebody

375
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.000
to figure out the 401k
plan or we need, I

376
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.440
dunno what it is. Like
any number of things that

377
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.260
you've done, expert thing, some
expert thing. And you just

378
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.060
end up either telling somebody
to do it, and they

379
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.410
have no idea what they're
doing. Or you take a

380
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.750
program off with programming to
work in a 401k for

381
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.690
awhile or whatever it is.
It's not really, really, really

382
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.480
optimal. Once you get to
300 people, then there's this

383
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.490
long period of time where
every time the conversation is,

384
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.810
look, we really need a
thing X, and therefore, let

385
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.240
us hire an expert next.
And you just start hiring

386
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.760
individuals with skills to do
all the different things that

387
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.980
need to get done. And
you almost like forget what

388
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.100
it was like to just
have somebody who didn't know

389
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.470
how to do that thing,
do it, you know, 90%

390
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.930
job. Right. And then just
move on because it's not

391
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.670
critical to the business. But
now you've got these company,

392
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.860
you've got two companies, three
companies that are in order

393
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.380
of magnitude. So like you
would, might visit one on

394
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.090
Tuesday and then go to
the other one on Thursday,

395
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.390
People between companies and not
so much, we've done a

396
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.490
pretty good job of separating
them now. So I'm a

397
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.000
hundred percent the CEO of
stack overflow, Michael is a

398
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.890
hundred percent of the CEO
of Trello, which is about

399
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.230
90 people. And I'm just
the chairman of the board.

400
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.090
So you don't have to
worry about the day to

401
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.410
day. Nope. I've got a
board meeting and I gotta

402
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.410
keep the dog alive taco.
It was my Pat also

403
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.170
the mascot of Trello. Yeah.
So when you hear these

404
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.090
stories about like, you know,
Jack is going to do

405
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.920
Twitter, and now the thing
at the same time, you

406
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.620
know, he's like 200%. Yeah.
That was a little bit

407
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.820
weird, but who knows Of
the doing, you're not doing

408
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.640
that. You chose not to,
It's not impossible. I mean,

409
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.750
like, you know, Like Musk
writing business, Elon Musk does

410
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.170
that too, right? Like flies
between SpaceX and Tesla. That's

411
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.630
true. But I mean, how
many businesses have space X

412
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.580
size are there inside of
Microsoft? You know, you can

413
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.360
have a CEO. Well, I
guess he'd be calling vice-presidents

414
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.610
and stuff. If you count
Google as like Gmail and

415
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.830
sir, Well, that's why they
changed it. The alphabet now

416
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.740
it's going to split off
into other things. Right. So,

417
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.590
yeah, I guess there's probably,
I don't know how many

418
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.300
VPs at Microsoft, there's probably
a bunch of thousand person

419
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.740
company. Sure. 115, you know,
that are, you know, half

420
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.850
a billion dollar companies. Yeah.
Mega mega companies. There's a

421
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.990
whole, there's a lot of
them. And then the, the,

422
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.200
the, the older fog Creek
is we recently hired a

423
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.930
Neil dash to be the
CEO of Hungary. So we

424
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.850
now have a full time
CEO of fog Creek as

425
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.980
well. So again, that's a
place where I get to

426
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.950
be chairman of the board,
just come in and they

427
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.420
tell me what they're doing.
And I say, that looks

428
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.910
good. And then that's great.
So then, and now we

429
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.530
like to talk about like,
you know, put all the

430
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.930
wood behind one arrow, you
focus on signing up more

431
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.930
people for stack overflow. Yeah.
I thought that the, when

432
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.500
stack overflow that the jobs
board came out second floor.

433
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.160
It was it called careers
Today. We call it stack

434
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.430
overflow talent, talent. Yeah. That
was, that was really smart.

435
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.130
Yeah. Because there was just
so much, there's so much

436
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.680
sloppy job boards out there,
you know what I mean?

437
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.620
And ultimately, no one wants
to make a resume. No

438
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.720
one wants to fill out
a resume. Like that part

439
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.270
from a, from an engineer's
perspective. Like, I haven't updated

440
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.070
my resume. Like this sucks.
I look at it and

441
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.690
like, Oh, this sucks. I
don't want to find that

442
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.300
word template. You know what
I mean? That, yeah, that's,

443
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.150
that's kind of the, I
mean, from an note, with

444
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.720
all due respect to like
$26 billion company inside your company,

445
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.100
LinkedIn, the developers don't really
like that style. I don't

446
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.270
know if the salespeople that
use it do, but I

447
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.730
know that business, I know
business people and networking and

448
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.260
healthcare executives. I know a
ton of people will get

449
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.130
jobs on LinkedIn. Right. But
developers, I get more email

450
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.740
randomly from like, I saw
your stack over here. Number

451
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.290
1% of whatever in stack
overflow, they come straight from

452
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.380
them. Yep. So that's, that's
a, that's kind of the

453
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.020
plan. I think like right
now we're probably a number

454
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.970
one of the niche job
boards or whatever, but ultimately

455
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.310
that's our goal for stack
overflow is to be the

456
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.610
place where developers keep their
developer story, which replace their

457
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.420
resume developer story is kind
of a, it's not just

458
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.790
where you work, but it's,
you know, a blog post

459
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.560
you might have written or
something that you learned or

460
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.330
a class that you took
her class that you taught

461
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.190
or all that kind of
stuff that adds up to

462
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.900
here is why I'm a
great developer and you should

463
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.910
hire me. I made that
app and I did that

464
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:13.120
thing. And that's Neil previously
worked on a thing called

465
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.480
maker base, which is sort
of aim to be the

466
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.520
I GB of, of programmers.
But this idea that programmers

467
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.410
work on things and they
want to show those things.

468
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.080
And our resume is this
ancient format where you list

469
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.390
companies that you worked for
and schools that you went

470
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.940
to. Right. And it just
doesn't really correlate to the

471
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.620
things that you made and
showing off of this stuff.

472
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.920
Yeah. I was a huge
fan of what a Neil

473
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.830
and janitor Piney did with
maker base. It's IMDV for

474
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.960
creators, for makers. I made
a thing. I made a

475
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.770
thing. Yeah. Put it all
in one place. Yeah. When

476
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.490
there are social developers, I
usually use this term social

477
00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.830
developers. I believe that there
are for every one or

478
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:53.460
two social developers, there's some
number 10, a hundred, a

479
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.920
thousand. Yeah. That are dark
matter. Developers talk about It's

480
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.630
come full circle. Now the
dark matter developers, right? The

481
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.660
space between the stars. But
there are also people who

482
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.960
choose not to be visible.
Right. How does the stack

483
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.470
overflow at GitHub? If I
have an avatar, that's a,

484
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.590
you know, a kangaroo, you
know, or I'm not a

485
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.840
straight white guy that has,
here's my face and here's

486
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.810
my name. And here's my
phone number that does want

487
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.370
to put that out. How
can I be a successful,

488
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.300
somewhat anonymous person in this
Create a developer story on

489
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.830
stack overflow, like make it
visible to employers and not

490
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.300
visible to the world. And
you don't want that to

491
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:35.220
be necessarily a public thing,
but that's not the, the

492
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.130
truth is a hundred percent
of these people have their

493
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.680
resumes. I don't like that.
It's so even the so

494
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.090
called dark matter developers, <inaudible>
I, I'm pretty sure that

495
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.560
they'll be the one. If
I could make an, a

496
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.470
developer story though, as a
pseudonym, as a, you know,

497
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.890
nom de guerre and then
have like an anonymous retailer

498
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.190
like Craigslist, that then says,
sure, I am I'm in

499
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.810
favor of that. I would
actually, the one thing that

500
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.740
I've been kind of begging
people to do, especially minorities

501
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.460
and women in the tech
industry is try to be

502
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.230
more visible. Even if you
don't want to use a

503
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.620
name that can subject you
to harassment, at least be

504
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.810
visible as a role model.
In other words, use an

505
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.900
avatar. If you're a person
of color in the tech

506
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.720
industry or a female in
the tech industry, just use

507
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.180
an avatar that doesn't even
have to be you, but

508
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.030
that represents yourself so that
you can serve as kind

509
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.580
of a role model for
people coming into the field.

510
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.400
So it doesn't look like
the field is monochromatic and,

511
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.900
and male. Yeah. It's good
that you're thinking about those

512
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.030
kinds of things. One other
thing I want, I want

513
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.360
to take a drastic shift
because my wife found one

514
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.110
of your YouTube videos, the
one that's called that you

515
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.150
saw. Oh, okay. So first
of all, before we even

516
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.280
mentioned this, if you've seen
you suck at Photoshop, cause

517
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.230
I just copied this, is
that what? I never seen

518
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.900
that video calls because there's
people in the comments arguing

519
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.790
about why does he think
he's so good at his

520
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.190
Excel? And why did he
name it that? So what

521
00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.320
is the context of the,
you suck at blank. Now

522
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.390
the con the context is
that I have now spent

523
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.600
my whole career sitting with
frustration and watching people whose

524
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.500
titles are things like CFO,
et cetera, who are like,

525
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.510
Oh yeah, this is Excel.
It's like my, I know

526
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.330
everything in Excel. And then
they don't know like Ronc

527
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.520
one notation and they don't
understand why cut and paste

528
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.820
the controversial notation that you
propose this the, the, the

529
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.370
way in the light, the
way to at least understand

530
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:28.820
what's going on. <inaudible> yeah.
It's cute. It's charming. It's

531
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.700
a default. Yeah. I know.
It's the Fisher price mode

532
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.460
for, but that's okay. Go
ahead. Enjoy that too. You're

533
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.140
just not never going to
understand why cut and paste

534
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.660
that. So that's a good,
that's a bit of Excel

535
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.200
bigotry there. I'm actually, I
feel that way about word

536
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.390
when I will get a
resume. I joke about this.

537
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.970
And so don't read too
much into this, but yeah,

538
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.160
but you hit the P
the paragraph, Mark and word.

539
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.350
Yeah. And it's all spaces.
And that's how you did

540
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.840
a ride, a line. You
know, it takes a lot

541
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.690
of personal strength to not,
you know, delete that. All

542
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.610
right. How do you not,
how are you not entirely

543
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.220
doing all your formatting through
styles? I've thought that I

544
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.770
could quit my job at
Microsoft. And my, I would

545
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.070
be the Tony Robbins of
reveal codes of word. And

546
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.080
I would just travel the
world, explaining everyone how a

547
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.570
tap stop works. Yeah. And
it would be life changing.

548
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.490
Cause I did a video
on that. It might be,

549
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.790
I think there's a slight,
they Excel users though. I

550
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.950
dunno. There's something about word
where just people just need

551
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.150
to get it done and
get the heck out of

552
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.030
there. Whereas the Excel users
can't be there. If you're

553
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.740
an accountant or something like
that. If you're in any

554
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.290
kind of data analysis type
field, you're in Excel for

555
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.390
seminars a day and this
stuff will really, really help

556
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.180
you. That's a good point.
I dunno, with word, you

557
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.370
can make it pretty turn
off reveal codes and say,

558
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.680
look, it's pretty. Yeah. With
Excel, you can't really fake

559
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.930
it kind of, and it's
gonna break later and it's

560
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.120
really what with Excel, you're
building a program. I mean,

561
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.130
the reason you're doing an
Excel instead of just doing

562
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.620
a calculator, because you want
it to be able to

563
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.500
redo you, see your writing
code and all the reasons

564
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.630
you want your code to
be robust, the same reason

565
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.700
somebody might want the Excel
spreadsheet to be robust. So

566
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.250
I, after years and years
of discovering that none of

567
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.560
the people that claim to
work on Excel really even

568
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.080
know, I just made a
list of all the things

569
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.600
that I just wish everybody
would know and did a

570
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.820
little presentation for my three
companies where they could just

571
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.400
sort of use an internal
presentation. Right. It's like, you're

572
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.140
a little crass in the
thing. And people are like,

573
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.670
why is he talking like
that? Like, Oh, I don't

574
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.470
think he ever expected they
would put it out. Right?

575
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.260
Yeah. And it was also
okay. So there's a very,

576
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.510
very funny series of videos,
which everybody should go look

577
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.990
on YouTube right now called
you suck at Photoshop, which

578
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.350
purport to be at tutorial
for Photoshop being told by

579
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.680
somebody who is in the
midst of a mental breakdown,

580
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.080
a divorce, and you hear
his wife yelling at him

581
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.230
from the background and just
real. No, it says it's

582
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:40.820
comedy, but it appears to
be just a grumpy Photoshop

583
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.520
tutorial. And so that was,
I sort of started with

584
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.410
that idea. This is going
to be an Excel, a

585
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.540
grumpy Excel tutorial. And when
I sent the email out

586
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.760
to the company that of
course the subject line of

587
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.800
the email was you suck
at Excel. And quite a

588
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.660
few people came and told
me, they thought that I

589
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.560
was actually right. They're like,
Oh, I just got an

590
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.110
email. Yeah. Personally, personally, you're
not saying second. See you

591
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.050
in my office. Yeah. Well,
it's, it's, it's a, it's

592
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.750
a lot of fun. It's
a cool video and yeah.

593
00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.350
It's worth taking a look
at thanks. Yeah. It, no,

594
00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.350
the Joel on software, how
long are you blogging anymore?

595
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.170
No, that's that's. I need
to bring up the legendary

596
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.900
archives. I don't even know
how to publish to that

597
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.360
anymore. I mean, I do
theoretically, there's a VMs. I'm

598
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.560
sure you keep the domain
paid for it. I've even

599
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.780
got a team of people
working on moving into WordPress,

600
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.510
but so that if I
ever need to publish again,

601
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.840
that's a way to do
it. But yeah, I just

602
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.640
don't. I have not had
time to write anything there

603
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.410
for quite a while. You
remember when you started that?

604
00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:43.830
1999, it was the first
post. And then in 2000

605
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.070
and I started kind of
in earnest when I left

606
00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.830
my job at Juno, I
had, I think like the

607
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.320
whole summer off, like I
had a pretty, I might've

608
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.990
left in February or something.
Those were the golden ages.

609
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.690
That was the time that's
when Blogging was cool. Yeah.

610
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.000
And then blogging was a
thing. And there's sort of

611
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.990
a weird thing that happened
with Twitter. I think really

612
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.080
a medium is that the
idea of a bunch of

613
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.570
individuals publishing their thing in
their own little world. And

614
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:13.250
just hoping that people find
them, someone else's walled garden.

615
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.800
Yeah. As opposed. Right. Right.
It's like, we don't want

616
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.600
to be in somebody else's
walled garden. Right. It's published

617
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.890
by ourselves. And that seems
like a kind of a

618
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.380
great idea, but it doesn't
really give you a district.

619
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.170
Right. The network effects. So
people have noticed that I've

620
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.860
started posting to medium for
my nontechnical stuff. But the

621
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.450
trick is you say import
story and it sets REL

622
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.760
equals canonical in the metadata.
Yeah. So then we're a

623
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.770
Google knows that it's the
canonical version of that URL

624
00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:43.100
is on your site thereby
maintaining your Google juice. Okay.

625
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.220
So I write it first.
Yeah. I import it never

626
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.940
copy paste. Right. Otherwise it's
duplicated content. Ah, yeah. And

627
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.100
Google, and then Google gets
mad. But then, then this

628
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.380
way I get the network
effect of medium, but I

629
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.570
own my words. Cause I
just, I truly believe you

630
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.030
should own your words. It's
a cool thing. I believe

631
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.180
that too. But what's really
happened with, I think everybody

632
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.730
that start try posting on
medium is discovering immediately that

633
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.920
that distribution is, is much
higher and it's not just

634
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.640
that it's Facebook and Snapchat
and Instagram text box and

635
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.730
a button you're using it's
easy and it gets you

636
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.970
some kind of distribution and
you get followers. Oh. And

637
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:21.250
YouTube. And that thing about
YouTube is you tell people,

638
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.360
click on the subscribe, link
down below and they click

639
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.940
on it and now they
get your future stuff. Whereas

640
00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.950
with the web back in
the old days, RSS, you

641
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.420
were just on your own
to get people to come

642
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.270
back. Yeah. And it never
really built up. And it's

643
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.250
sort of sad because there's,
you know, there was a

644
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.740
potential to build. I think
Dave wanted to this day

645
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.360
is still saying, God, I
wish we had just made

646
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.830
Twitter as a federated system
instead of a corporation. Yeah.

647
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.660
Cause There's, there's those of
us who think they should

648
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.880
have done that, like that,
cause one day there won't

649
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.340
be a Twitter. And, and,
and for a lot of

650
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.950
us, Twitter is the internet.
But now I've been blogging

651
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:54.210
now to April, 2002. I'm not
as OGE is an ill

652
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.730
on you, but it's like
14, 15 years now. I'm

653
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.250
not planning on stopping. No.
And the content is still

654
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.200
viable and you know what?
I think it's a developers

655
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.270
get in their own little
world. Like IRC is still,

656
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.110
that's still going on. Strong
developers getting their own little

657
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.360
in VI developer. It's weird
that developers are not early

658
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.910
adopters. Yeah. When we like
a thing, we like a

659
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.830
thing and we stick with
it. Yeah. Well the handlers

660
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.510
are looking at us here
through the door and saying,

661
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.810
it's time to go. So
yeah. Can I get you

662
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.400
on a stack of flip?
I guess let's do it.

663
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.920
Let's make it happen. We
can call in and we

664
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.760
can do it over Skype.
I've been using Zen caster.

665
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.790
Have you seen that? It's
a fantastic app that uses

666
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.690
HTML five and a web
RTC. Yeah. Records it and

667
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.290
uploads it to the Dropbox.
We, we tried it wasn't

668
00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:45.010
quite reliable enough for regular
podcasts. I've done the last

669
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.710
20 episodes with it and
it just went 1.0 glorious.

670
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.530
Give it a try. Okay.
Hey, thank you for hanging

671
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.600
out. Hey, thanks for having
me. I appreciate it. Yeah.

672
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.520
And come tell all your
listeners to go subscribe to

673
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.710
the stack overflow podcast. If
you are listening to my

674
00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.580
podcast and you don't have
a stack overflow profile, go

675
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:05.590
make your developer story. Check
out stack overflow. <inaudible> that

676
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.250
blog where we do all
our blogging now. Very cool.

677
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.220
There's a.blog. Is it domain?
There's dot Ninja also. Yeah.

678
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.180
Alright. This has been another
episode of Hansel minutes and

679
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.470
