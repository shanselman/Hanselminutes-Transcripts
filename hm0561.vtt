minutes, a weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

9
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.060
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing
show number 565. In this

10
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.380
episode, Scott talks with Samsung
engineer and developer advocate. ADA

11
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:12.800
Rose Edwards. How about web VR?
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

12
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.590
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking

13
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.310
with ADA Rose Edwards. She is
a senior developer at Samsung

14
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.490
and working on web VR.
How are you? I'm really

15
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.130
good. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks
for taking the time to

16
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.250
chat with me today. Thank
you for having me. So

17
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.530
you've been a developer for
a long time and you've

18
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.920
worked on PlayStation and you
worked at the financial times

19
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.150
and now you're at, at
Samsung and you're doing all

20
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.120
kinds of stuff. You also
blog and write code and

21
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.960
you have amazing get hub
activity graph that I'm jealous

22
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.480
of. Yeah, well it shows
how, how bad I am

23
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.830
at managing my free time.
Yeah. So this shows that

24
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.840
you're not, you don't have
work life balance, but it

25
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.000
sounds like you love your
work. I do. I love

26
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.730
it very much. I, yeah,
I do it every day

27
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.630
for fun. So, so you've
written a number of things

28
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.730
on kind of the future
of the web. And you've

29
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.960
been focused on, on web
VR lately. Do you have

30
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.880
a lot of VR machines
at your, at your house?

31
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.660
Yeah. So in front of
me right now, there's three,

32
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.490
give yours a Google daydream,
HTC, Vive, and a box

33
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.520
full of cardboards. So you
could say I'm a bit

34
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.210
of a fan. No, I've
had a couple of people

35
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.140
on the show to talk
about virtual reality in general,

36
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.740
I'm interested in your opinion.
I have a Vive and

37
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.140
you know, it's great, but
it really seems kind of

38
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.400
kind of early. Yes. So
we're definitely in the early

39
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.540
days of VR right now,
it's, it's going through a

40
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.780
lot of growth spurts, but
the nice thing about it

41
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.140
is that it's really hit
the web big time in

42
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.450
the last few years. So
it's got to the point

43
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.260
now where, where a developer
can come build something and

44
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.470
distribute it to a variety
of VR platforms without needing

45
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.760
to worry about exactly what
that delivering it to which,

46
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.610
which I think will make
it available to a lot

47
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.950
of developers to work with.
When I started doing VR

48
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.950
on my windows machine, it
seems like it's split into

49
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.120
the Vive people and the
Oculus people. And there's a

50
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.240
lot of like, fighting about
who's going to win. And

51
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.420
there also seems to be
a lot of exclusives, like

52
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.000
that's an Oculus exclusive and
you can't run that on

53
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.160
a Vive. I hope we
don't end up with the

54
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.760
web like that. So the
nice thing about VR on

55
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.000
the web is that it
works on all devices and

56
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.220
I, so I think out
of fights like that, the

57
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.630
only winner is going to
be the web at the

58
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.290
end of the day, because
I can build a VR

59
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.400
experience and I can target
it, both the Oculus rift

60
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.370
and HTC Vive, but I
can also put it on

61
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.250
the gear VR and Google
cardboards and on daydream as

62
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.070
well. So I don't need
to worry so much about

63
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.430
where it's going and because
VR is still very niche

64
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.140
and there are a wide
variety of, of hardware out

65
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.920
that people are using. I
think if you build something

66
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.080
and put out through the
web that allows you to

67
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.360
reach all of them at
once. So you don't have

68
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.600
to worry so much about
that. You're only targeting a

69
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.830
particular niche. Hmm. And we
wouldn't want it to be,

70
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.200
you know, separated. Like, I
wouldn't want to say, I

71
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.040
need to buy us a
gear VR to watch it,

72
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.390
to look at a JPEG.
You know, that, that, that's

73
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.790
the kind of thing we're
talking about. Yeah, definitely not

74
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.240
that if, if the future's
like that, then I think

75
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.400
my job as an advocate
for the web has gone

76
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.630
horribly wrong because, because at
the end of the day,

77
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.650
the web is all about
togetherness and trying to get,

78
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.920
and building one thing which
works across a wide variety

79
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.890
of platforms and works for
everybody no matter where they

80
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.800
are in the world or,
or, or who, or who

81
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.490
they are. It sounds, it
sounds like if I can

82
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.950
take just a little bit
of a detour for a

83
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.400
second that you, you and
I are very similar in

84
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.670
that we both went to
giant company and probably our

85
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.070
open web web friends thought
of us as being kind

86
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.750
of a, you know, Oh,
you sold out, look, you

87
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.920
went to big, but we
went there to move the

88
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.700
open web forward. Yeah. Like
I would like, I wouldn't

89
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.550
be working at Samsung if,
if they didn't support the

90
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.390
open web. When I interviewed
with them, they really wowed

91
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.620
me with, with the steps
they're taking to, to bring

92
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.290
the web forward into the
future. So they have their

93
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.590
own web browser, something internet,
which works on the gear

94
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.290
VR as well, which is
puts me in an interesting

95
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.620
position because in regards to
virtual reality, because it's one

96
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.100
of the, it's one of
the few web browsers that

97
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.100
actually focuses on virtual reality.
So yeah. Samsung are doing

98
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.910
a lot in for the
web. Well, they're one of

99
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.560
the, they're the second largest
contributor to the chromium project

100
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:11.600
after, after Google and they're,
they're on the W3C committees

101
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.650
for progressive web apps and
virtual reality. And they, yeah,

102
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.800
they've really get stuck in
it before I worked there.

103
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.070
I never even considered Samsung
in the browser space, but

104
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.700
it was been really surprising.
It's been a great place

105
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.600
to be, They've got their
own browsers so that they

106
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.600
can say here is how
a browser should do VR

107
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.240
correctly. And almost like this
is the lighthouse that you

108
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.700
should, you should follow. They're
setting the tone for Chrome.

109
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.490
And for Safari, I would
assume I'd like to think

110
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.310
so. I mean, like we
were the first VR browser,

111
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.540
so I'd like to think
were leading the pack, but

112
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.530
I think what I'd actually
rather see is everyone take

113
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.670
their own different approaches to
how they think a VR

114
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.560
browser should be. Because at
the end of the day,

115
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.630
the web grows through diversity.
And, and if one person

116
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.030
sets says, this is how
it should be and everyone

117
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.550
copies it, we're going to
end up missing out on

118
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.340
a lot of possible variations,
which could end up being

119
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.820
a stronger pattern. Mm, okay.
So it's really more of

120
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.400
an exemplar and we're going
to bounce back and forth

121
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.500
as we move the web
forward as it as a,

122
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.600
as a group, as a
team. I think so. Yeah.

123
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.270
It's definitely, I'm a very
like where the web VR

124
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.190
community is, is very strong
where we're allies not rivals

125
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.260
and people from very large
companies. So Oculus and Google

126
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:45.040
and Mozilla and Samsung, we're
all, we're all together trying

127
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.790
to, trying to do something
with the weapon VR, because

128
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.150
I think not only can
VR do a lot for

129
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.010
the web, but I think
the web can do a

130
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.610
lot for VR as well.
Now you've got a great,

131
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.370
I got a great article
that you wrote called a

132
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.590
Christmas Carol for the web
future, where you talk about

133
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.050
the ghosts of web pass
that goes to web presence.

134
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.270
And it feels like we're
just now getting out of

135
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.700
the ghost of web past,
which is, you know, you

136
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.040
visit a website on a,
on a, on a PC

137
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.200
or a Mac and it
looks great. Then you visited

138
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.780
on your, your phone. And
then it's like, download our

139
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.870
app. And the same thing
is happening in VR. I'm

140
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.000
looking, I have a car,
a Google cardboard for my

141
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.600
iPhone. And I also have
like 19 apps like that

142
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.060
are all in like this
little VR with a poop

143
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.600
emoji folder because it's like,
here's all this VR crap

144
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.590
that I've littered my phone
with. Are we heading in

145
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.420
that direction with VR? So
the way it's going right

146
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.710
now with native, it does
seem that way. But hopefully

147
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.250
with web VR taking off,
as much as it heads,

148
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.270
we're not gonna, we should
see much fewer sites forcing

149
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.940
someone to download, download an
entire, just to use it

150
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.670
for two or three minutes.
And the nice thing about

151
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.200
web VR is that because
a lot of the runtime

152
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.480
is in your browser, like
built in, you only need

153
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.930
to download the assets and
the libraries to do the,

154
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.710
the web GL bits and
bobs. So you end up

155
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.400
with this really lovely experience
where you go to a

156
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.180
URL and you can, and
then when the page is

157
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.750
loaded, which hopefully should only
take a few seconds. You're

158
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.930
already to put your device
into your headset or to

159
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.520
put on your, your HTC
Vive or Oculus rift and

160
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.920
jumped straight into the experience.
And that's the beautiful thing

161
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.500
with VR on the web.
I think of web VR

162
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.920
layers on top of web
GL, is that correct? I'd

163
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:48.110
say they're more side by
side. So web GL handles

164
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.860
a lot of the rendering
and the web VR APIs.

165
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.930
They provide an interface to
the virtual reality hardware such

166
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.620
as the controllers and the
headset. So for example, they'll

167
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.850
tell you the position, the
rotation of the Vive controllers

168
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.880
or the, or the Oculus
touch controllers. They'll tell you

169
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.330
the position, the rotation of
the headset and they'll, and

170
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:16.820
the specifications for the lenses.
They'll also give you also

171
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:22.400
provide methods, which you can
use to send essentially just

172
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.610
canvas information to the headset
and, or render whatever's on

173
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.060
the canvas. So you don't
have to use web VR.

174
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.580
You could, if you really
wanted to render with just

175
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.880
canvas today, of course, that's
not an option because it's

176
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.180
not fast enough, but it's
just ties into the canvas.

177
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:47.180
So the, the API is
that they're still in, they're

178
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.440
still in development right now.
I think they're on web

179
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.520
VR, 1.1 or 1.2. And,
but as, as they go

180
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.570
along, they're, they're really settling
down and, and there's a

181
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.460
really great polyfill for them.
So which allows you to

182
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.180
use them for on iPhones
and Androids with just a

183
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.410
Google cardboard and they will
work. And if you're on

184
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.530
a, like a recent Chrome
browser or, or Mozilla or

185
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.650
work natively with your HTC
Vive. So a lot of

186
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.590
things kind of work out
the box, but if you're

187
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.190
dealing with the web via
APIs that kind of accessible

188
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.160
to work with as a,
as a developer, but generally

189
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.990
I would suggest just find
a library to do it

190
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.710
for you. Okay. So like
right now I'm looking at

191
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:35.330
some of the stereo rendering
source. I started@webvr.info and kind

192
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.640
of found my way there.
And I see the kinds

193
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.230
of APIs. I'd expect a
talking to a device to

194
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.620
like, you know, enumerate them,
you know, get VR displays

195
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.500
and things like that. So,
but this is something that

196
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.160
someone who already knows how
to do canvas or already

197
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.870
knows how to do web
is going to feel reasonably

198
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.730
comfortable with, it's not a
whole new world. It's building

199
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.150
on stuff that we already
know how to do. Yeah.

200
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.970
If you've been, if you've
been working with three dot

201
00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.230
JS and you feel really
comfortable with it, it's, it's

202
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.050
not significant. It's not that
difficult to actually build something

203
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.070
with three GS and then
use the native web VR

204
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:20.400
APIs to make it work
in virtual reality. But many

205
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.890
developers aren't super comfortable with
working with three JS, even

206
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.510
though the web GL API
has been around for a

207
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.630
long time. It's definitely not
in the remit of, of,

208
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.420
of most web developers. So
I definitely suggest usually one

209
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.650
of the many tools out
there, which, which handle a

210
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.490
lot of the web GL
stuff for you. So just

211
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.530
to make sure some people
may not have understood what

212
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.620
you said, they're three dot
JS. You actually spelled out

213
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.240
the word three js.org is
a, an abstraction layer on

214
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.790
top of all the different
3d stuff in your browser.

215
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.080
Yeah. So three dot JS
is a, it's a library,

216
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:05.040
a really very, very well
done library for bringing web

217
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.250
GL to humans effectively. Like
if you, if you just

218
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.680
try and rendering a cube
with pure web GL, it's,

219
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.830
it's doable, but you're gonna
have reams. And if you

220
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.480
were to print out, you'd
have reams and reams of

221
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.000
paper, like you ended up
writing an awful lot of

222
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.690
boiler plate. So three dot
JS, abstracts away, a lot

223
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.500
of the boiler plate and
allows you to, to make

224
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.190
a web GL scene using
Java script, which a developer

225
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.180
might be more comfortable with.
Yeah. I'm looking at this

226
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.970
right now. And I feel
like, I almost feel like

227
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.670
when I look at examples
of 3d libraries like this,

228
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.610
the examples are themselves more
impressive than anything I see

229
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.430
on the web. Like, I'm
not, you know, you don't

230
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.360
see this stuff at like
a news site or wandering

231
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.790
around the web. It does.
It feels like it's, it's,

232
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.540
it's at a beginning stage
because otherwise I would have

233
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.730
bumped into things that were
amazing. Like this just w

234
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.510
just browsing the web regularly.
There's lots of API. So

235
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.900
that actually, which seem to
be, which has been around

236
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.360
for a long time and
a very powerful, but haven't,

237
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:15.330
I don't think received there,
like aren't as impressive as

238
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.430
they could be, like in
the way they've been used.

239
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.190
And I think VR is
making us rethink a lot

240
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.960
of APIs, entirely new ways.
For example, recently I built

241
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:31.740
a virtual reality app for
a conference. And, and so

242
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.140
as well as doing the
three D rendering web GL,

243
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.740
and it looked very pretty,
I used web sockets to

244
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.200
keep the entire audience synchronized
amongst one another, so that

245
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.040
they're able to, so that
they're able to see each

246
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.040
other in virtual space and
see me as well and

247
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.780
see 3d slides where I'm
just bringing content into existence

248
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.960
in front of them. I
think it worked pretty well,

249
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.000
and it managed to keep
over a hundred people, sink

250
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.910
toilet once and not fail.
So like, I think we're

251
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.310
going to see a lot
more stuff like that. And

252
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.890
another thing as well, which
I really like is the

253
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.970
web RTC API APIs. So
normally they use for stuff

254
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:16.800
like Hangouts or video conferencing.
But now I think we're

255
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.310
going to see a lot
more use of people talking

256
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.280
to each other in virtual
reality where their voice is

257
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.030
being sent via web RTC
and their position data or

258
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.440
the data associated with their
controllers or any, or any

259
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.200
of their virtual reality input
devices are all going to

260
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.140
be sent via web RTC
data channels. So I think

261
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.960
it's gonna be some cool
stuff coming out of unexpected

262
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.220
areas. When w if you
don't mind my asking, when

263
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.530
you put that together, you
know, how, how hard was

264
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.260
that like the barrier for
me seems that seems immense.

265
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.790
Like I would, it would
take me weeks to build

266
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.840
something like that. So I
built that in four days.

267
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:59.110
So the, the environment I
built using a library called

268
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:05.110
a frame, which allows you
to Mark up 3d scene

269
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.960
using web GL, but you
don't have to write any

270
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.910
JavaScript. You just Mark it
up using custom HTML elements.

271
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.580
And then the, to be
honest, the sinking bit was

272
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.510
quite easy. I, what I
did, I, I took a

273
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:28.300
users position, rotation data. I
stored it as a, as

274
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.330
into a, into array buffer
and setting that up to

275
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.570
the server as raw byte
data, the server just concatenated

276
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.240
everyone's raw byte data and
sent it back down again.

277
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.290
And people just rebuilt like
place other people's avatars in

278
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.980
the same place where they
were in the scene. And

279
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:53.410
because a friend uses custom
HTML elements, I was able

280
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.210
to use Java script. I
was really familiar with so

281
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.370
like dot HTML or element
dot set attribute in order

282
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.610
to update the position, the
rotation of all the avatars.

283
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:12.040
So it libraries like that
make it really accessible to,

284
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.280
to, to do really interesting
stuff in VR, because it

285
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.650
means you don't have to
think about the VR aspect

286
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.660
anymore. You just have to
think about what you're trying

287
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:28.180
to accomplish. Ah, okay. So
I'm looking at a frame,

288
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.200
a frame.io. And so I
could go and say, I

289
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.060
want a box. I want
a sphere. I want a

290
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.370
sky. I could do that
with JavaScript. Right. I could

291
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.520
use three dot JS and
I could do, I could

292
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.450
programmatically declare boxes and spheres
and put a sky around

293
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.780
them, or I can do
it in just kind of

294
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:52.020
quasi HTML. And that then
gets translated into web VR.

295
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.330
Yes, precisely. So a frame
is built upon three dot

296
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.330
JS. So if you want
to extend a frame or

297
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.180
do anything advance with that,
you can fall back to

298
00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.750
any preexisting, three dot, JS
knowledge you might have, or,

299
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.870
or take advantage of one
of the many, three dot

300
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:14.090
JS tutorials and examples out
there. But the nice thing

301
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.060
about it is that because
it's got this large community

302
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.450
and it's based on HTML,
you can Mark it up

303
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.280
and you don't really have
to worry so much about

304
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.650
that. And it gives you
a lot of stuff, a

305
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:28.430
lot of boilerplate built in.
So you don't have to

306
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.120
declare your camera and your
lights and your VR scene.

307
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.520
You just you'd right. You
create a dash scene as

308
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.100
a Dom element, and then
it gives you a canvas

309
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.770
and sets up your render
loop. It gives you some

310
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.360
lights and you can an,
a camera and even a

311
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.270
button, which when you click
on it enters VR. And

312
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.420
then you can use like
the ACE guy element to

313
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.740
set an image as the
box and like an aid

314
00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.810
box to drop a box
in there. And it allows

315
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.060
you to prototype stuff really
quickly. So even if you

316
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.450
were in a professional setting
where you wanted to do

317
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.960
a very performance web GL
scene, a frame is greater

318
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.410
prototyping, but if you're like
me and not super comfortable

319
00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.610
with writing raw web GL
or, or doing complex three

320
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.090
D stuff, then Hey frame
is a really great place

321
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.090
to get started. And you
can, you can build something

322
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.150
and share it very quickly.
Like, one of the things

323
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.900
I like doing is using
JS Ben or one of

324
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.850
the pair programming websites out
there, and I just include

325
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.850
the A-frame library and I
can write up some HTML,

326
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.660
which is, which is a
virtual reality scene. And I

327
00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.610
can send that to someone
and they can use that

328
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.010
on the spot, which is
really nice. And then they

329
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.540
can start editing it and
sharing it themselves, which is

330
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.280
a, I think a beautiful
thing. Is there any reason

331
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.590
why I wouldn't want to,
you, you used the, you

332
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.170
used a frame in the
context of prototyping. W does

333
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.510
that imply that I would
then stop using it and

334
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.120
move to something else? If
I was to kind of

335
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.850
quote, unquote, get serious, or
could I go to production

336
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.450
with a frame? So I'd
say for the majority of

337
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.700
web developers, a frame is
going to be fantastic and

338
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.940
it's going to be probably
all, all you need, especially

339
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.630
if you're pro, especially for
doing smaller demos or things

340
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.290
with single scenes. But if
you want to, like, for

341
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.960
example, if you wanted to
remake quake in the browser,

342
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:32.420
you'd probably use unity or
play canvas, or one of

343
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:39.740
the more interactive editors where
you can, you can inspect

344
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.040
the scene as you're doing
it. And, and it's more,

345
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.920
much more visual. And it's
so way of working, which

346
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.480
3d developers who've been working
with tools like blender and

347
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:56.100
Maya, maybe more, maybe more
used to, Okay. So let's,

348
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.170
let's pivot a little bit,
and let's talk about how

349
00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:02.310
we make this, you know,
like regular people use VR,

350
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.640
right? Like I bought an
HTC Vive for Christmas. It

351
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.400
was like my gift to
myself. But whenever I use

352
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.610
it, I feel like it's
a big deal. And, and

353
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.980
that's not a bad thing.
It's just like, okay, I'm

354
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.260
going to do VR now.
And I gotta plug this

355
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.380
big headset in, and it's
got three giant long cables

356
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.020
and there's things that are
mounted on the wall. So

357
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:25.470
I can walk around. Sometimes
I boot up, I use

358
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.560
steam or steam VR to
talk to it. And sometimes

359
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.220
it isn't detected and there's
firmware updates. There's a sense

360
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.230
that it's not like you
just jump into VR and

361
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:39.540
jump out. There's, there's, you
know, administrative boot up time,

362
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.300
but you don't see that
with like a gear VR.

363
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.190
Is it, you put your
phone in a slot in

364
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.430
your end, is that correct?
Yeah, that's correct. That's essentially

365
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.980
the advantage mobile, mobile VR
has over desktop VR right

366
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:58.170
now. Cause HTC, Vive and
Oculus are incredibly powerful and

367
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.870
you'll get brilliant stuff. But
if your, but the majority

368
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.110
of users either don't have
the hardware or don't have

369
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.110
the time or just aren't
in the right place. Whereas

370
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.120
a lot of people will
have their phone on them.

371
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.710
So, or may have, or
may have a gear VR,

372
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.560
more accessible so they can
just pop it in. And

373
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.850
the nice thing I like
is, is Google cardboard, which

374
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:30.030
is fantastic for, for getting
people started because I can,

375
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.070
I can bring a give.
Yeah, I can. Now I

376
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.410
can bring a cardboard to
someone. I show it to

377
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.870
them, show them some VR,
and then I can leave

378
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.450
the cardboard with them to
carry on doing VR stuff

379
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:43.050
with their own phone, because
they're not massively expensive and

380
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.200
I'm leaving one here or
there. It's just my way

381
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.900
of getting VR out there
a bit more. In fact,

382
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.270
at the conference I gave,
which I mentioned earlier with

383
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.780
the VR people, Google were
kind enough to donate a

384
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:59.580
hundred cardboards for us so
that everyone there got a

385
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.870
cardboard and they could, they
could have a go and

386
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.620
see what web VR could
do for them. And then

387
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.560
they were already set for
working in virtual reality because

388
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.260
they already had the smartphone
and the Google cardboard, and

389
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:18.300
they could get started right
there. So the what, what

390
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.360
do we lose? Like what
is the distance between a

391
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.910
$700 VR headset and a
super fancy, you know, video

392
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.950
card, all of which I
had to slowly build up.

393
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.810
It took me a year
basically to like upgrade my

394
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.630
computer until I was ready
to get a Vive versus

395
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.780
taking an existing gear, a
Samsung phone, I haven't and

396
00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.210
getting gear VR where like,
what's the distance in quality?

397
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.170
What am I losing? So
partly what you're losing is

398
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:50.330
just visual fidelity. You simply
like my, my SF and

399
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.970
it might be a fantastically
fast phone, but it's not

400
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.060
gonna push out anywhere near
as many polygons as my

401
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.960
Nvidia 10 80 graphics card.
It's sorry. I'm boasting about

402
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:06.170
my graphics card there. Yeah.
It's, it's in raw power.

403
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:12.470
It's not there. You're also
losing the ability to do

404
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:16.510
positional tracking as well because
HTC, Vive and the, and

405
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.110
the Oculus rift both give
you some kind of limited

406
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.930
positional tracking. So you can
walk around in the space,

407
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.290
but with the gear VR
and the daydream and the

408
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:33.230
Google cardboard, you're restricted to
only rotational data. So you

409
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:38.000
can't walk around, but you
can look around. And for,

410
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.430
for most people who do,
who are doing VR for

411
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.540
the first time, that that
is plenty incredible, but I

412
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.140
would love to see more,
more positional tracking done in

413
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.050
the future. But there was
this, there's a great quote,

414
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:55.010
which, which I love with
regards to this. Cause there's

415
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.550
a lot of people who
think that because mobile phones

416
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.730
can't render as many polygons,
it won't be as accurate.

417
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:07.340
Therefore it's massive. But if,
if visual fidelity was all

418
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.980
that mattered, we'd be watching
blue rays right now and

419
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:17.050
not Netflix. So this is
like a really kind of

420
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.750
intense virtual reality version of
the 80 20 rule. Like

421
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.380
80% is pretty fine. Like
we shouldn't feel bad about

422
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.520
that at all. Yes, very
much so. Yes, yes. Do

423
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.830
you, I don't know if
you remember, but there was

424
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:34.600
a time when, when Walkmans
came out and people said,

425
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.740
no, one's going to do
that. No, one's going to

426
00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.190
wear headphones around, like in
public. That would be completely

427
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.860
inappropriate to do that in
public. And then, and now

428
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.230
we have people walking down
the street, literally talking to

429
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:48.880
themselves and we wonder like,
are you, are you someone

430
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.940
who's disturbed or are you
just on a Bluetooth? Do

431
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.460
you think, like right now
I would feel awkward putting

432
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.890
on VR and sitting on
a train. That just seems

433
00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.470
weird. Is that just generational?
Do I just need to

434
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:06.160
die off before? That will
be okay. Definitely not. Like

435
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:10.360
I do occasionally see the
odd person wearing a VR

436
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.420
headset on the train or
at the airport and I'd

437
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.670
be guilt. I'd be lying
if I said occasionally, that

438
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:19.330
wasn't me. But cause sometimes
it's nice just to sit

439
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.820
in a cinema or by
yourself. But right now the

440
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.420
hardware is big. The hardware
is chunky like using, I'm

441
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.200
using a VR headset now
is like using a mobile

442
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.530
phone in the eighties. It's
this massive chunky thing, which,

443
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.470
which you look silly using
it, but you think you're

444
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.980
really cool. But as the
technology gets, I can, I

445
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.160
think we're going to see
a lot more acceptance of

446
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.040
people just being like, okay,
you're putting on your headset.

447
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.330
Especially if the headset looks
semi stylish or is more

448
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.900
integrated in one's lifestyle, but
I don't think we're going

449
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.560
to see this with VR
specifically. I think I can

450
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.540
see VR staying a, something
that exists in the home,

451
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.790
but I think augmented reality
will end up eventually being

452
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.980
on the street. I think
right now that's just inevitable.

453
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.210
Unfortunately, VR and web VR
is a great way to

454
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:26.310
start working with, with building
virtual reality interfaces and, and

455
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:31.710
planning for the augmented reality
future, which hopefully won't be

456
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.210
too far off. Do you
feel, so you feel like

457
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.980
it's a hardware thing. Like
if they come up with

458
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.170
a cool way to beam
the light directly into the

459
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.810
back of my eye, as
opposed to obscuring my view

460
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.360
and covering my face, or
like putting it into a

461
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.450
pair of sunglasses, like if
the hollow lens was in,

462
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.360
in buddy Holly style sunglass,
you know, the glasses, then

463
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.120
that might be more socially
acceptable To be fair. I

464
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.340
think, I think the moment
Apple do something, people are

465
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.240
going to accept it because
like stuff with Apple do

466
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.960
people seem to like, so
I think it's going to

467
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.770
be like a big boost
there and I can also,

468
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:13.910
I can also see, see
it happening when, when it

469
00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.270
just becomes too cool that,
that you're not embarrassed of

470
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.050
doing it in public. Like
when it becomes too useful

471
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.170
that you can't put it
down because like you remember

472
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.110
in the early days of
mobile phones, when people were

473
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.300
saying, Oh yeah, everyone's on
their phone all the time.

474
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.510
These days, like, they'd look
so ridiculous, constantly looking at

475
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:38.210
their glowing rectangle. And, but
what we didn't see was

476
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.730
that they were connecting with
the rest of the world,

477
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.700
through their friends, through their
phone. And I think, I

478
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.320
think once people realizing what
everyone's getting from AI, are

479
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.900
they going to be like,
okay, they're just using AR

480
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:54.590
to see their stock quotes
or have like the world

481
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.840
enhanced around them. So I
don't know if it's going

482
00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.680
to be some, make some
perfect use case or some

483
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.850
perfect hardware or some combination
of the both, but with

484
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.310
the amount of money that's
being put into VR and

485
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.650
AR right now I can,
I can't see it not

486
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:15.110
happening. That's the question like,
remember just a minute ago,

487
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.990
when they told us we
all needed three D TVs

488
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.740
and now most, you know,
most new TVs kind of

489
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.660
have three B 3d built
in, I think my TV

490
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.290
does 3d, but I don't
care. You know, like I,

491
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.180
we all thought it would
be a thing, but it

492
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.570
wasn't enough. You know, it
was, it was incrementally better.

493
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.000
It sounds like you think
that VR has the potential

494
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.220
to be much more than
incrementally, better. It's it's like

495
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.430
snow crash finally. We're, we're,
we're building personal Holidecks that

496
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.590
we're going to carry in
our pocket. Well, yes, definitely.

497
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.680
I agree with everything you
said there. And I think

498
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.480
the differences it's a matter
of timing, 3d DV came

499
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.020
out, but we had no
way to deliver 3d PV

500
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.900
show to someone because the
bandwidth wasn't high enough, there

501
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:04.530
wasn't enough, there wasn't enough
content or, or there wasn't

502
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:09.420
enough people actually producing good
content that was worth watching.

503
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.170
But with VR I can
take, or that won't be

504
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.970
three D I can do,
I can take a three

505
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:19.740
60 photo using my gear
three 60 camera, which is

506
00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.410
just a camera with two
lenses on either side and

507
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.590
takes a full three 60
degree photo. And I can

508
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.490
drop that photo into a
frame. And within minutes I've

509
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.310
got, I can show that
to someone and be like,

510
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.060
I've made this it's on
the web it's life. And

511
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.660
I've gone from camera to
showing someone in a very

512
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.880
short amount of time. So
producing VR content is strangely

513
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:50.790
enough, much more accessible than
producing 3d content. And even

514
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.060
though it seems counterintuitive since
VR is three D as

515
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.660
well, you can, if you're
doing stuff in real time

516
00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.940
where you're just rendering cubes
or dropping in three D

517
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.510
models or animations or putting
in some three 60 degree

518
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:08.070
video, which are compositing in
the background, it's, you can

519
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:12.840
do something really incredible without
needing a fancy camera setter

520
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.960
or, or special hardware to
play it on because it

521
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.900
just play on my mobile
phone or, or, or my

522
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.280
five or anything else. So,
yeah, I think, I think

523
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.460
it's the, it's the right
environment for VR right now.

524
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.000
We have the bandwidth to
deliver the content. We have

525
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.620
the content, the tools for
content creation of there and

526
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:44.280
the energy of the industries
behind that. I would like,

527
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.190
I like I'd put my
money towards, Well, it sounds

528
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.020
like you are. Cause you
know, you, you took the

529
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.020
job Well, okay. Yes. I
am putting my livelihood towards

530
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.490
VR, but that's fantastic. This
is kind of like, this

531
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.740
is my childhood. Like when
I grew up, there are

532
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.220
so many TV shows and
books and movies, which are

533
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.070
all about virtual reality and
going to virtual places, I

534
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.050
kind of feel, this was
like, this was promised to

535
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.660
me from when I was
a young kid and it

536
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.960
kind of felt like all
the stuff I dreamed about

537
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.310
happening then, then is happening
now. And like, I can,

538
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.770
I can stick on headset
and see what it's like

539
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.750
to be on Mars. I
can stick on a headset

540
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.370
and see what it's like
to be in a fantasy

541
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:28.410
world or, or on a
spaceship. Like it's, I can

542
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:34.500
go anywhere with, with just
by putting on a gigantic

543
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.560
headset on, but it's Yeah,
that's good. That's well, I

544
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.140
appreciate you Chatting with me
today. I'm going to include

545
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.420
links to all of your
different blog posts, some of

546
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.210
the great three 60 cameras,
like the Samsung gear three

547
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.120
60 and also where people
can get a Google cardboard

548
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.060
so they can experience this
for very inexpensive and then

549
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.020
maybe start getting better hardware.
Well, thank you so much

550
00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.290
for having me. I just,
yeah, I hope people give

551
00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:03.340
building virtual reality. Echo, I
mean, Jeff, check out a

552
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:07.990
frame and just get building
something Very cool. This has

553
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:11.110
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

554
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:19.330
next week. <inaudible>.
