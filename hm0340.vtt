episode, Scott talks with Paul Lucas.

9
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.910
Paul was an electronics designer
for the space shuttle program

10
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.050
and author of the best
selling Apple writer. Hi, this

11
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.300
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

12
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.610
And today on the phone,
I've got Paul Lewis. He is

13
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.030
a computer programmer and a
former NASA designer, but his

14
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.840
career has expanded much beyond
NASA cause he retired at

15
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.910
about 35 and went on
to do all sorts of

16
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.610
other different, interesting things. Thank
you sir, for chatting with

17
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.150
me today. You're welcome. Glad
to be here. So let's,

18
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.890
if you don't mind, just
for people who may not

19
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.050
be familiar with your, your
work, let's talk a little

20
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.540
bit about what you did
kind of in the seventies

21
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.370
at NASA, and then we'll
kind of move. Okay. I

22
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.150
was hired by a subcontractor
of Rockwell international to design

23
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
part of the space shuttle.
My job was designed high

24
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.550
efficiency, electronic inverters that take
the shuttle basic power from

25
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.000
the fuel cells, the 28
volts fuel cells and convert

26
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.190
it into power are suitable
for running lamps. And so

27
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.320
my advert went into all
the lamps on the shuttle.

28
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.470
When you see a news
footage of the shuttle and

29
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.690
all the lights in the
crew quarters and on the,

30
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.270
on the flight deck, those
are all my lights that

31
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.180
run by my inverters. Wow.
So that was my, that

32
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.480
was my small contribution to
the subtle. And when someone

33
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.400
calls you and says, Hey,
we're going to go ahead

34
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.340
and do this space shuttle
thing. I mean, in, in

35
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.800
the seventies, you, you, you
know, you've gone to the

36
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.190
moon in recent memory, so
it's not complete science fiction,

37
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.660
but certainly the idea of
a reusable shuttle must've felt

38
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.920
a little bit science fictiony
It did it did. I

39
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.070
actually asked the program, went
along my involvement in the

40
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.680
program extended over about five
years as the program went

41
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.630
along, it became obvious that
it was going to be

42
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.500
a very, very complicated spacecraft,
more complicated than any other

43
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.470
has ever been. And I
don't think any of us

44
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.430
in the program had any
pre conviction of what was

45
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.420
going to take place during
the program, but it was

46
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.850
obviously complex at one point
at one point, Rockwell international

47
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.920
arrived and said, look, we
have a problem with the

48
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.240
fuel cells. We, you, 28
to 32 volts was to

49
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.990
limits the strip to stress
your inverters. We now realize

50
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.430
that it's kind of times
the voltage is going to

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.860
go up to 38 and
a half volts. What problem,

52
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.730
if any, and my managers
all intent on smoothing the

53
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.460
road, we're intent on saying,
Oh no, no problem. We

54
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.230
haven't had any problem with
that. And I argued and

55
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.050
argued. And finally I was
threatened to resign because I

56
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.490
knew that that the Apollo
disaster, which was fresh in

57
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.030
everybody's mind in those days,
resulted from people cutting corners.

58
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.310
And I was unwilling to
cut corners. So I had

59
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.040
quite a TIFF about that.
And I just said, look,

60
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.130
we can't, we can't allow
this. We, we have specifications.

61
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.340
And the, the foliage limits
are the things we've agreed

62
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.980
to. And suddenly they're asking
for a rather large increase

63
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.920
in, in the stress on
the components. And it just

64
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.440
isn't going to work. We
have to reevaluate the design.

65
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.290
So because I threatened to
resign it because I, I

66
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.800
pushed my resignation letter into
more hands than absolutely necessary.

67
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.960
They backed down and I
was able to get the,

68
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.680
the, the review done and
make the modifications that were

69
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.790
required to make it safe.
But after the challenger disaster,

70
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.880
and I think 86, what,
what came out of Morton?

71
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.570
Thiokol the, the subcontractor responsible
for the solid rocket boosters

72
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.870
sounded very familiar to me
because they also had exactly

73
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.050
the same thing. Some engineer
who knew the system intimately

74
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.320
well was objecting and saying
you can't launch under those

75
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.230
conditions. And his managers overruled
him and said, no, no,

76
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.880
we can't say that to
NASA. We've got to tell

77
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.370
them it's all right. And
the next morning the shovel

78
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.450
blew up. So I didn't
feel so overcautious when that

79
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.790
happened. No, though. When, when
you are a effectively, a

80
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.610
chicken little, I mean, chicken
little at the time, perhaps

81
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.450
whistleblower after the fact in
retrospect, but there must be

82
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.870
people blowing whistles and declaring
that the sky is falling

83
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.360
all the time. You know,
the system more than ever,

84
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.860
right? Yes. It happens all
the time. How does the

85
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.110
manager know that this is
a problem or this isn't

86
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.850
a problem? They ultimately either
trust you at the time.

87
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.300
Oh, that's your question. Yeah.
Well, that's a good, that's

88
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.240
a very good question. In
this case, I think the,

89
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.670
the managers didn't think very
hard about it and they

90
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.200
were, they tended to rely
on their own past experiences

91
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.540
with simpler projects. And they
just said, does this look

92
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.030
like a big deal? To
me, it's just a, whatever,

93
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.510
six extra, extra volts. What
they didn't realize was the

94
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.390
stress on electronic components and
a running electronic circuit is

95
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.040
the square of the voltage
change. And so it was

96
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.740
a much larger difference than
they were realizing, and that

97
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.340
was beyond their expertise. So
I, you know, I just

98
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.230
think they figured that would
go along. Even though I

99
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.390
had objective, they thought they
could talk me down. And

100
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.090
that's the one, that's one
of the funny things about

101
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.820
a position like that. I
was younger than my managers.

102
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.310
They all had more experience
in the field, but none

103
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.500
of them had worked on
a spacecraft, a complex spacecraft

104
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.650
before. And none of them
had worked with a specifications

105
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.250
that were so rigorous and
specific as on the subtle.

106
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.400
So I think they were,
I think they were inclined

107
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.200
to just tell me that
I didn't know what I

108
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.430
was talking about, but as
it turns out, I was

109
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.120
able to put a component
on a test rig and,

110
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.530
and make a, make a
deliberate installation errors such as

111
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.140
might happen on the production
line and blow it up

112
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.530
by putting 38 volts on
it. It's exploded. And at

113
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.170
that point, I think at
that point, I think they

114
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.110
began to realize that I
wasn't just being a nervous

115
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.220
Nellie or whatever the expression
is. That's it Fairly explicit

116
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.710
way of making your point?
Yeah. I just said, come

117
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.500
here guys. And I hooked
this component up deliberately backwards

118
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.720
to make my point. And
it turned out later that

119
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.510
in fact, a wiring person
did hook one of these

120
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.640
components up backwards and it
exploded. Wow. That pretty much

121
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.770
did the get the job
When you're making a specifications

122
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.020
like this, presumably you're thinking,
well, this is going to

123
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.660
go to space. And the
specifications, you know, are all

124
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.020
assumptions. I mean, you can,
you can specify things like

125
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.340
voltage, but then there are
also environmental things that you,

126
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.330
you, you think you're specifying,
but then, you know, who

127
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.840
knows what's going to happen
Actually, actually specifications for spacecraft

128
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.930
don't allow any leeway for
the, for the person reading

129
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.510
them. They don't say, we
think this might happen. Or

130
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.180
we think that might happen.
They just say the components,

131
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.480
shell survived, the following temperature
range and the following pressure

132
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.330
range. And this component needs
to be cooled in zero

133
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.820
gravity, which is not so
easy. Things like that. So

134
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.920
it, it spells it out.
It doesn't leave anything to

135
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.800
the imagination. And so a
person can just go, we

136
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.790
met every specification and actually
that's probably what NASA prefers.

137
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.010
They don't like the, you
know, we think this will

138
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.950
work kind of a response.
So there really is no

139
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.070
room for error in these
situations. Oh no, no. It's

140
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.490
very specific. A NASA specification
for a spacecraft on man

141
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.120
spacecraft is more exquisite and
specific than any, any legal

142
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.260
document you can imagine reading.
It just says exactly the

143
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:50.170
temperature, humidity, vibration, everything else,
voltage range, all those things

144
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.450
are spelled out explicitly, which
is why by the way,

145
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.790
Rockwell and what came forward.
As soon as they realized

146
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.840
that because of a bus
switching procedure error, the, the

147
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.550
voltage on the bus might
go up to 38 and

148
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.360
a half volts. They instantly
told everybody within 24 hours,

149
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.580
once they realized that they,
they got to that stage

150
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.230
of the design and they
said, whoops, what happens if

151
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.820
this switch has turned this
way? And that switch has

152
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.760
turned that way, the a,
the fuel cell is completely

153
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.790
unloaded and they hadn't considered
that possibility. And the volt

154
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.350
is left up to 38
and a half volts. And

155
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.900
they, and they instantly informed
you of everybody by memo

156
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.420
within 24 hours, which NASA
required them to do. Of

157
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.380
course, wow. I'm looking at,
I've looked at some of

158
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.360
the documents that you can
get. You can go up

159
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.250
to nasa.gov and there's a
technical reports server. And I've

160
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.060
spent some time looking over
some of your documents from

161
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:42.250
1977 through 1981, they're all
available as PDFs, or you

162
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:48.040
can order them. And the
language is extremely dense. There

163
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.460
is no, there is no
room at all for, for

164
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.830
error in, in, in the
language. It's almost like a

165
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.970
legal document. I mean, worked
on banking systems, but I've

166
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.660
never seen anything quite this,
you know, dance is the

167
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.980
only word that I have
for it as far as

168
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.480
information dense. Yeah. When, when
I reported on my work

169
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.160
in articles, technical articles, I
was already pre predisposed to

170
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.320
writing it in a way
that's be no possibility for

171
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.650
ambiguity, but then it went
through several review cycles with

172
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.800
people, both in NASA and
in my own company to

173
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.720
make sure there wasn't anything
left to chance. And so

174
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.720
what you see there in
those documents is the result

175
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.330
of several editorial passes after
my own writing. And I

176
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.580
tend to be the kind
of person who writes in

177
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.720
an explicit way without, without
ambiguity, but that natural tendency

178
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.900
was amplified by the people
who reviewed it afterward. Wow.

179
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.960
And then afterwards, I am
told that you created a

180
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.690
mathematical model of the solar
system that ended up being

181
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.310
used. Yes, I, I, in
the early seventies, the first

182
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.510
programmable calculators arrived, and this
was, this was well before

183
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.600
personal computers were available, but
I was really curious about

184
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.640
programming and, and solving mathematical
problems. So as soon as

185
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.500
one was available, I bought
one that was an HP

186
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.050
65, I believe was the
first one or the <inaudible>

187
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.540
one of the two. And
I have great fun with

188
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.820
it. And pretty quickly I
had written a solar system

189
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.200
model using a pretty simple
methods for all nine planets.

190
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.080
And I published it in
a magazine and the people

191
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.570
at JPL, all of whom
had the same programmable calculator

192
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.310
wanted it, so they could
use it in their daily

193
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.330
work because they otherwise had
to submit a batch job

194
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.630
to a huge mainframe, to
get a prediction about a

195
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.550
trivial positions of the planets
kind of problem. So I

196
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.440
got, I got in touch
with them and they asked

197
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.090
for some changes and they
pointed out an error I

198
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.670
had made in the position
of Pluto. So I got

199
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.400
a amount of correspondence. So
that's the basis of that

200
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.350
is the people at JPL
were using my program on

201
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.430
their, on the same programmable
calculator I was using to

202
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.470
create the program. What made
you kind of drop out

203
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.480
is not meant in any
way of a pejorative term,

204
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.930
but what made you stop
kind of working so intensely

205
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.270
and then instead kind of
moving to a more remote

206
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.490
location and kind of focusing
on This is going to

207
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.290
sound, this is going to
sound a bit hokey, but

208
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.420
I was deprived of a
childhood. And so once I

209
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.930
had enough money to retire,
I, I did. So just

210
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.610
to be able to go
do something besides work for

211
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.890
a living, I had never
actually done the sort of

212
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.140
thing that children do when
they're children. That part of

213
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.810
my life, that part of
my life was, was never

214
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:23.270
existed. It never happened. So
I had a much narrower

215
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.810
and more conservative idea of,
of having enough money for

216
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.530
retirement. In the early seventies,
I got enough money together

217
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.830
to buy a small, silly
piece of land in Oregon

218
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.950
and, and still have $3,000
left over. So I set

219
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.520
up time to retire. So
I, so I had gotten

220
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.580
done with my work for
NASA. The project was completed

221
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.040
and that the people I
worked with obviously wanted me

222
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.660
to stay on and work
on a lot more things,

223
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.150
because I was pretty good
at what I did, but

224
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.090
I explained what I just
said. And I guess they

225
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.180
realized that we agreed, but
they kept me on as

226
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.220
a consultant for a couple
of years afterwards. So every,

227
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.500
every couple of months I
would go down for a

228
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.410
week and, and solve some
engineering problems for them. And

229
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.690
then go back and I
had a vegetable garden and

230
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.910
they had little wood, heated
cabin and things like that.

231
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.610
It was great fun. And
so I did my back

232
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.230
to the woods face in
the middle of the seventies

233
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.950
when apparently everyone else was
doing it. And then, and

234
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.170
then the fun part, I
was sitting in my little

235
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.790
cabin by 12 by 16
foot cabin with a book

236
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.450
copy of scientific American with
a kerosene lantern. And there

237
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.790
was an advertisement for the
Apple two. It was 1977.

238
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.040
It was an advertisement for
the Apple two. And I

239
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.410
said, Oh my God, this
is better than even a

240
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.340
programmable calculator. So I ordered
one with, with actually with

241
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.800
two thirds of the money
I had left. I ordered

242
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.660
an Apple to thinking how
much fun it would be

243
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.700
to play with. I wasn't
thinking about anything else beyond

244
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.580
that, just to have a,
to have a computer of

245
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.310
my own was just mind
boggling to me at the

246
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.390
time. And then about a
year later, two years later,

247
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.900
a magazine asked me to
write an article about Einstein's

248
00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:00.540
theory of relativity for the
Centennial 1979 offense of Einstein

249
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.660
birth. So I started writing
the article and it was

250
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.730
a bit more complicated than
the articles I'd written for

251
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.260
them in the past. There
was a, there's a bunch

252
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.540
of different bits and pieces
to <inaudible> activity. It's not

253
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.360
so easy to write about
for a popular audience. And

254
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.970
so I had pretty soon,
I had pieces of paper

255
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.830
all over the room with
little bits and chunks of

256
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.470
ideas that I wanted to
get into the article, but

257
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.020
in exactly the right order,
the thing about special relativity

258
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.090
is you can't skip over
anything and you don't want

259
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.100
to put something complicated in
too early. If it isn't

260
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.960
tied in with what's around
it, if it was a

261
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.620
perfect place for some kind
of a textual organizer. So

262
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.390
then I thought, okay, I
have an Apple two, and

263
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.450
I've been programming, various silly
programs with it. Maybe I'll

264
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.850
write a program to organize
all these bits and pieces

265
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.710
of notes, and I can
move them around on the

266
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.630
screen and just add things
and remove things. So what,

267
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:50.460
so in parallel, I started
writing a word processing program

268
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.940
and the article for the
magazine. So I was the

269
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.700
customer of my program and
I was using the program

270
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.740
half the time and writing
the program half the time.

271
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.530
And I call it Lexa
calc, which is a program

272
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.190
named that hasn't been used
yet, probably because I told

273
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.910
people they couldn't do it.
But anyway, I called it

274
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.410
Lexus. Can I envision that
it would be popular like

275
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.560
VisiCalc? And it would be
four words. What VisiCalc was

276
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.620
for numbers anyway, Apple heard
about it and they buy.

277
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.510
Then they realized that they
couldn't sell any more Apple

278
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.300
tools unless they had some
programs readily available for people

279
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.080
who weren't themselves programmers, in
other words, and, and end

280
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.440
users of personal computers. So
they were more than excited

281
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.710
about having more applications available.
So they heard about my

282
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.730
program. They asked to see
it. So I rode my

283
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.800
bike down to the mailbox
with a big Manila envelope

284
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.350
thinking to myself, Hey, maybe
they'll like my program. Maybe

285
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.120
I'll make a hundred dollars.
And in the next five

286
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.090
years, it became a best
seller. It was available worldwide

287
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.490
and it was called Apple
writer. And that's, I retired.

288
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.050
One of the reasons I
retired is I really made

289
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.760
a lot of money on
that program. And I retired

290
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.760
again. I retired from, I
guess one could say that

291
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.750
I retired from my retirement.
Hey, this is Scott and

292
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.910
I am really excited about
these guys. This is a

293
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.150
special offer from our friends
at DN simple, true story.

294
00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.020
Carl reached out to DN,
simple to ask them if

295
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.420
they wanted to advertise with
Hansel minutes, because we liked

296
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.640
them that much. I was
a kind of a funny

297
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.410
thing. They didn't come to
us. We went to them

298
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.560
because we think DNSimple is
great. It's a hosted dentist

299
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.560
service that you use to
manage your domain names. Prices

300
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.250
started about $3 a month
for up to 10 managed

301
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.410
domains. You can also use
DN simple to register a

302
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.190
domain names, purchase SSL certificates.
All of my domains have

303
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.680
been moved off of GoDaddy
and are now at DN

304
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.800
simple. I like it because
there's an application on my

305
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.140
iPhone. I can manage my
DMS from there. There's an

306
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.290
API that you can use.
The best part actually is

307
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.650
these one-click services. So you
can register a domain, get

308
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.270
it up and running in
a couple of minutes and

309
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.240
then go in and apply
services to it. So you

310
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.730
can say this domain is
for Google apps and this

311
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.490
domain is forget. Hub pages
in this domain is preposterous,

312
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.910
and they know the DNS
records and set them up

313
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.640
for you. Even for something
as complicated as Google apps,

314
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.670
there's like 11 different settings.
You need to create, they

315
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.920
handle it all for you.
So here's the deal. They've

316
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.580
got a special 30 day
trial. You can cancel at

317
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.480
any time, but Hansel minutes
listeners get three months of

318
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:25.690
free DNS service. So you
got a DN, simple.com/h M

319
00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:31.450
special deal for Hansel minutes,
listeners just visit Deon simple.com/h

320
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.450
M Hanselman. His listeners get
three months of free DNS

321
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:40.180
service love these guys. They're
so nice. DNSimple hosted DNS.

322
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.710
Check them out where you,
what you clever enough or

323
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.950
prescient enough to keep them
from giving you a hundred

324
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.120
dollars. Oh yeah, no, no,
actually it's the things worked

325
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.580
my way. I, I think
nature favored me in spite

326
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.390
of my, my silliness, the
original version of Apple writer.

327
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.830
I, I sold to Apple
outright for $7,500, but the

328
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.220
problem was they had no
programmers at Apple to improve

329
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.140
it. And people wanted improvements
right away. They wanted a

330
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.380
wider, a wider display, more
characters, upper and lowercase, all

331
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.960
kinds of things like that.
And especially as the Apple

332
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.530
to hardware evolved and made
it possible to display upper

333
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.510
and lower case characters and
80 columns wide, all those

334
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.970
sorts of things. And so
finally, after a while, they

335
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.340
just gave up and they
said, you know, do you

336
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.740
have a new version of
your program? I said, yeah,

337
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.620
but one it's a completely
different version. It has nothing

338
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.660
to do with the previous
one, which was true. And

339
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.020
two, I'm not selling it
to we'll do a royalty

340
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.780
arrangement. And they, and they,
by then they had anticipated

341
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.180
that that would be the
case because of how badly

342
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.270
the first one went. They
took my program, the one

343
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.520
I sold to them for
$7,500 and stripped out my

344
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.680
name and copyright notice and
sold it as an Apple

345
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.520
product and asked them how
they thought they could do

346
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.720
that. And they said, well,
you didn't tell us we

347
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.460
couldn't. So anyway, so, so
I was, I got a

348
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.550
chance to, to have a
preview of what could go

349
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.250
wrong, where the stakes weren't
very high in the late

350
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.940
seventies before the main stream
event took place. So I

351
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.370
was able to benefit from
my past mistakes in a

352
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.370
way that nothing, no great
loss was incurred. So the

353
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.550
new program, which I had
totally rewritten it and made

354
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.980
it much more efficient. And
I insisted on a number

355
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.750
of things. One, it was
royalties on me. I wasn't

356
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.030
selling them the program and
two, they couldn't take out

357
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.820
my name. So the only
reason I'm a household or

358
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.510
was a household name in
the personal computer world in

359
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.610
the mid eighties, mid eighties,
for example, was because of

360
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.620
that. I told them they
couldn't take my name out

361
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.880
of the program. Well, anyway,
so I said, so they

362
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.010
said, okay, royalties, that's fine
with us. That means no

363
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.110
upfront money. How do you
rate? And I said, Oh,

364
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.180
I don't know, 25%. How's
that sound to you guys?

365
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.010
And they said, sure, no
problem. 25% sounds reasonable. These

366
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.640
are of us realized that
royalty rates on software are

367
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:55.140
almost never that high. And
the result was that, that

368
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.480
they sold quite a lot
of copies of the program,

369
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.910
but the volume of software
in those days was a

370
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.610
tiny fraction of what it
is, for example, with Microsoft

371
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.610
now, but not withstanding that
it was quite a, quite

372
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.540
a lucrative arrangement. And then
as, as the sales started

373
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.600
going up in a hockey
stick fashion, they said, you

374
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.910
know, this 25% thing, that
wasn't such a great idea.

375
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.490
And I said, well, yeah,
maybe not, but I don't

376
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.830
think that we should change
it at this point. So

377
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.750
they argued about it a
little bit, but I was

378
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.060
unwilling to give way there
was no incentive for me

379
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.460
to change it. And I
don't think, I think they

380
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.100
finally realized that, you know,
the program was selling itself.

381
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.920
They didn't need to try
very hard to get people

382
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.750
to buy it. And how
long did that last For

383
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:44.570
about from around 1980 or
81 until about 85. And

384
00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.160
it was in the millions,
I'll just say it was

385
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.000
in the millions of dollars
in royalties. You know, these

386
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.830
things go up in a
hockey stick fashion. I know

387
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.530
I wrote a, I wrote
an application for the original

388
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.230
Palm pilot and it went,
it went up in a

389
00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.450
hockey stick fashion, and we
made all sorts of money

390
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.860
and then it just disappeared.
It just disappeared. What was

391
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.080
happening was what was happening
in the, in the early

392
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.450
to mid eighties was that
people were buying more Apple

393
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.810
twos because there was a
program or there was VisiCalc

394
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.180
and Apple writer were the
two bestselling programs at the

395
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.850
time. And people had dawned
on people that a, there

396
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.220
was software available. So they
weren't buying a hobbyist machine

397
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.030
anymore. And B a personal
computer made sense, which, which

398
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.300
in those days, you know,
people were becoming aware of

399
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.280
the fact that there was
a new consumer product called

400
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.120
the personal computer. And that
was fact number one is

401
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.960
second. Number two was how
many of them were there?

402
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.560
This is, this was when
IBM was selling their personal

403
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.090
computer as an entry system
for their main line business.

404
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.690
The, the IBM people in
those days never really appreciated

405
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.970
the, that there was a
market for personal computers, they

406
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.550
of it as a way
to get people, to buy

407
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.760
larger machines, just as a
sort of an introductory thing.

408
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.180
And they actually called it
the entry system. That's that

409
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.040
was their name for it.
Internal TBM. Oh, I have

410
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.440
a nice, I have a
story about IBM at the

411
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.190
height of an Apple, right.
Popularity. IBM called me up

412
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.890
and they say, we'd like
something like Apple writer for

413
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.940
the IBM PC. I said,
okay, what business terms? And

414
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.100
there was a long pause
there. They were accustomed to

415
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.460
talking to programmers who weren't
their own managers. And so

416
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.110
I think they were shocked
by the fact that I

417
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.600
instantly switched over to the
business mode. Anyway. They said,

418
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.760
well, we have this worked
out. We'll give you a

419
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.610
hundred thousand in royalties after
which we own the program.

420
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.970
And I said, a hundred
thousand in royalties, let's see

421
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.640
that's 10 days of royalties
on Apple or right now,

422
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.050
which was true. And they,
there was a long pause

423
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.570
on the phone line. That's
six. They realized at that

424
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.150
point they were going to
get anywhere. They, then they

425
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.080
then called John Draper, AKA
captain crunch, and offered him

426
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.650
the same deal. And he
took it. And it wasn't

427
00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.480
a very good program. I
forget the name of it,

428
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.850
but it wasn't very good.
And when somebody asked him

429
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.240
about it later, allegedly John
Draper replied, they asked for

430
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.260
a hundred thousand dollar program.
I gave them one. Now

431
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.540
I can't, I can't verify
that quote, but I've, I've

432
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.040
heard it from several different
sources. So You turn it

433
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.970
into free where then after
1992, after, you know, it

434
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.230
was discontinued, As soon as
the program became popular and

435
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.080
successful, it occurred to me
that it was going to

436
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.390
be too pricey. It was
$125, which in those days

437
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.760
was a lot of money
for a program. I decided

438
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.610
to create a version that
was missing a few features

439
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.390
that I could give away
in schools. And so I

440
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.810
did that. I wrote called
it free rider and Apple

441
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.010
agreed. I showed them the
program and it wasn't able

442
00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.170
to print. It was just
a, it was able to

443
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.440
create data files and, you
know, it was limited. So

444
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.440
let's say I wouldn't be
upset. And I was able

445
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.750
to offer it. And for
awhile, there was a program

446
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.610
called free rider floating around
and everybody knew it was

447
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.030
mine. And then somebody took
it over and added a

448
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.950
print feature to it and
called it Fred writer and

449
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.950
charged people $10 for it.
So that was my first

450
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.650
exposure to what happens when
you offer free software, somebody

451
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.420
will take it over and
offer it for sale. And

452
00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.790
since then, I have to
tell you that because I

453
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.220
have so many free programs
on my website, that I'm

454
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.680
constantly having to get, to
try to keep people from

455
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.650
selling my free programs or
pockets with them together on

456
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.600
a DVD and offering them
for sale and things like

457
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.530
that. It's just exceedingly annoying.
And one of the reasons

458
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.720
is people who are young
enough and inexperienced enough, don't

459
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.390
realize that if something is
free, it doesn't mean you're

460
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.290
free. It's all right for
you to sell it. That

461
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.090
doesn't necessarily follow. And I
think a person who's young

462
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.720
enough who doesn't know enough
about law might think that

463
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.550
because something is free, then
it's all right to sell

464
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.700
it. And I've had any
number of conversations with young

465
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.870
programmers who didn't understand that,
that doesn't follow When you

466
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.940
were a young program when
you were getting started in

467
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.280
the business and not necessarily
a young programmer in the,

468
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.950
in the age sense, but
in the, you know, you're

469
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.910
getting into personal, you've created
Apple rider, you're having some

470
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.780
success. Are you hanging out
virtually or otherwise with, you

471
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.450
know, the Dan Britt kins
or the, you know, Charles

472
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.860
Simoni, are you, is this
a club of people? Because

473
00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.130
my entire programming career took
place from rural Oregon and

474
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.740
elsewhere in the woods. I
hardly ever met people like

475
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.010
that. And I would get
an invitation to go to

476
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.530
the hackers conference every year.
And I would just forget

477
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.170
it. I wouldn't do it.
So I never actually met

478
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.000
any of those people. I
met a lot of people

479
00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.490
at Apple, of course, directly
people who worked for Apple

480
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.760
and people who showed up,
but I didn't actually meet

481
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.850
most of the people who
were in the mainstream. I

482
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.280
would exchange letters from time
to time and then maybe

483
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.860
a TV interview, that sort
of thing. But I didn't

484
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.240
have that as a peer
group. Not really, and not,

485
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.350
not because people didn't ask
me to, but I just

486
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.560
wasn't interested. I didn't want
to abandon, regarded that I

487
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.630
had the perfect world. I
was living in the woods

488
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.930
and it was quiet and
I'm pretty, and I could

489
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.360
write programs and it just,
you know, I didn't want

490
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.430
to go to the city
when I did go to

491
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.640
the city, I have to
mention this in passing. I

492
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.300
was unwilling to make any
compromises and the distance between

493
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.420
where, where Apple was located
in Cupertino and the San

494
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.810
Jose municipal airport was maybe,
well, I don't, I don't

495
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.740
remember maybe 10 miles, 12
miles. And so I would,

496
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.460
I would do is I
ride my bike to the

497
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.160
airport where I had my
airplane. This was when I

498
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.040
had royalty money. Right. And
I put my bicycle in

499
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.530
the airplane and fly down
to San Jose land. The

500
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.440
airplane takes the bicycle out
of the airplane and ride

501
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.320
my bike to Cupertino and
people who show me on

502
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.050
me showing up. They didn't
quite, you know, we thought

503
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.080
you lived in Oregon. Well,
yeah, I do. And I

504
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.690
just rode my bike down.
You rode your bike all

505
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.600
the way down just to,
I didn't necessarily, I didn't

506
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.270
necessarily mislead them to that
extent, but I think it

507
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.220
took them a while to
realize that I was, I

508
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.800
was mixing bicycles on airplanes.
What do you, what do

509
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.160
you feel about building software
as a single individual where,

510
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.120
you know, you've built Apple
rider and you've built a

511
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:46.360
rack Ophelia and you've, you've
built stuff where you understand

512
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.840
it from the beginning to
the end versus working on

513
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.620
something larger than anyone human
could possibly understand, like a

514
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.870
subsystem within this space. I'm
not sure my opinion on

515
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.700
that subject is worth very
much since I've never done

516
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.010
the ladder that you just
described, But you built a

517
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.250
subsystem and PI's part of
a larger system that then

518
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.990
became part of a space
shuttle. Yeah. But that was

519
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.840
electronics is there Is that
much of a difference is

520
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.330
not creation of a system,
a creation of a system.

521
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.120
It's very different. If you
write a piece of software

522
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.360
as a team with other
software developers, you have to

523
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.540
be very careful about naming
conventions and, and interfacing and

524
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.220
all that sort of thing.
If you write a piece

525
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.490
of it, if you create
a piece of a spacecraft,

526
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.500
all you need to be
aware of is where it

527
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.990
mounts physically and what the
voltage is that is going

528
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.230
to be driven by. So
it's much, much simpler. Now.

529
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.930
That's not, that's obviously not
true for all spacecraft work.

530
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.000
If I had been responsible
for part of the avionics

531
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.190
or something like that, that
would have been different. But

532
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:47.370
I had the irony was
that my inverters appeared all

533
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.010
over the space shuttle, 20
or 30 of them altogether

534
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.560
in the, in the cargo
Bay and the crew quarters

535
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.960
on the flight deck. But
they were all pretty much

536
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.230
alike. And they were individually
quite simple because they, all

537
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.150
they had to do was
be hooked up to 28

538
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.920
volts and they provided light.
So, so it was much

539
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.730
simpler, you know, by the
way, once I realized how

540
00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.180
simple the outcome was, the
desired function was, I made

541
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.000
the design as simple as
humanly possible. I had a

542
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.610
very simple design, which I
did deliberately. A lot of

543
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.190
people in the field of
electronics would like to have

544
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.710
a design complex enough that
it ends up being an

545
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.800
advertisement for their, for their
ingenuity. I didn't feel that

546
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.120
way about it at all.
I only want it to

547
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.250
do what was not catch
fire and kill last minutes.

548
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.100
That's all I cared about.
So I deliberately chose the

549
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.980
simplest possible design. And when
people read the documents who

550
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.590
were referring to earlier online,
they can see that it's

551
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.680
extremely simple. I did all
I could to eliminate parts

552
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.110
and limit the parts count
so that there would be

553
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:48.450
fewer modes of failure. So
I think actually a large

554
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.550
software project with multiple programmers
is way more complicated. And

555
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.280
in fact, it's qualitatively so
different than it's, I'm sorry,

556
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.830
it's quantitatively so different than
it's ends up being qualitatively

557
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.250
different. So I've never, so
even in hardware design, I've

558
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:06.210
never had a big teamwork
component where I had to

559
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.400
name things in certain ways
and learn how to communicate

560
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.830
in certain ways. And certainly
in the world of software,

561
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.080
I'm really an activism, a
throwback. I, I've never worked

562
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.320
on a software project with
even one other person in

563
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.450
my entire career. Wow. Have
you taken your love of

564
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.150
simplicity or you're striving for
simplicity and applied it to

565
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.880
the software that you did
and do continue to create?

566
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.080
Oh yes. And I also
release most of my source

567
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.730
code. I'm like most of
my projects, my source code

568
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.620
is released. So people can
look for themselves and see

569
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.470
that, that I named things
in certain ways to make

570
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:43.620
it easy, to sort things
out. So, yes, I, I

571
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.770
try to avoid complexity there
also. And as I got

572
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.660
older, the reason it becomes
more obvious. I don't want

573
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.670
it to not be able
to understand my own projects

574
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:54.950
after five years after the
fact, that's a big danger

575
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.870
as you get older. And
even at the peak of

576
00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.500
one's career, if one writes
a complex piece of software

577
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.020
with the intent of blowing
the minds of people around

578
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.260
them, the risk is that
after 90 days they won't

579
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.470
understand their own code. I
try to avoid that one.

580
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.580
So you release things for
free and you put them

581
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.060
out there, but you do
still rent, maintain copyright. You've

582
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.060
you've put out software you've
put out. Yeah, no, I'm

583
00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.010
sure. You know, I'm sure,
you know, the reason why,

584
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.380
if I release a program
that don't have a copyright

585
00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.810
on it, people will take
it and incorporate it into

586
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.360
their own projects and offer
it for sale. In fact,

587
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.790
I have to tell you
that a number of occasions

588
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.180
where I have released under
the GPL, people have taken

589
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.340
the code and just stripped
out the GPL notice and

590
00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.940
used it in their project
because of that mentality. I

591
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.060
actually don't think most of
the people who do that

592
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.510
have criminal intent, they're just
too young and inexperienced to

593
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.660
understand that the fact that
something is free doesn't mean

594
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.000
that they can sell it
to take it over and

595
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.440
sell it. It doesn't mean
that What makes you want

596
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.240
to put things out for
free? I mean, you, you

597
00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.040
put out a book when
you did your around the

598
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.640
world solos. Now we're switching
over to the truly philosophical.

599
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.860
Well, since our, since I
retired at the age of

600
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.870
35, I always wanted to
retire as young as possible.

601
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.490
We'd go play because I
never got to play when

602
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.260
I was a kid. And
I always thought that was

603
00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.970
a, a catalog, a lack
in my background, but what

604
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.790
didn't occur to me that
if I succeeded in retiring,

605
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.280
that I had faced a
problem that I certainly hadn't

606
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.890
anticipated, which was that I
needed to feel as though

607
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.460
I was accomplishing something that
I had constructive work. So

608
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.370
I'm really a workaholic and
I could never actually be

609
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.430
retired in the sense of
going fishing though. I always

610
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.470
have to have some sort
of project. So since, since

611
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.050
that I've useful to other
people, and I just said

612
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.090
this to my neighbor the
other day about something unrelated,

613
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.060
I really have to feel
useful to other people. That's

614
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.430
a, that's a core value
of mine. And so if

615
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.160
I write a program, I'm
always thinking, Oh, well, let's

616
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.920
see, is this going to
be something that people will

617
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.040
find useful? And I just
did an SQL, a tutorial

618
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.250
with that in mind, just
to make sure that, that

619
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.640
I hardly ever write programs
for my own use. And

620
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.290
if I do write a
program, that's really only for

621
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.880
me. I hardly, I don't
necessarily even release it. But

622
00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.370
if I do release a
program, it's it's with the

623
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.210
knowledge that somebody will find
it useful. Dosing is something

624
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.830
that drives you. I mean,
you, you, you're not, you

625
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.750
don't necessarily want to get
paid. Like you said, you

626
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.230
put out your book and
it's, it remains free, but,

627
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.000
but you produced and you
put it out there and

628
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.330
hopefully it helps. Yeah. People
find it useful. People will

629
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.270
find that what I do
useful, obviously, if you work

630
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:33.150
for a living, if you
worked for a living and

631
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.310
made a salary, but you
knew that what you did

632
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:39.000
was completely useless to anyone
else. It would probably destroy

633
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.980
it for you. I would
certainly destroy it for me.

634
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.710
I don't know about other
people. So if you do

635
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.350
something for free, I think
the same rules apply. If

636
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.750
you do something gratis, if
you intend to put it

637
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.880
out there and offer it
for free, you still want

638
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.450
it to be useful to
people. Otherwise you wouldn't necessarily

639
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.600
do it. Let me ask
you this in closing, what

640
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.190
is, what is the thing
that you were the most

641
00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:01.710
proud of? What accomplishment are
you the most proud of

642
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.700
free or otherwise? Oh, okay.
Here's my answer. When I

643
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.190
lived in Oregon and I
was getting royalties for Apple

644
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.530
rider, I became aware of
the fact that I'm not

645
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.720
going to say which town
in Oregon, there was a

646
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.350
15% pregnancy rate. It's a
local high school. And so

647
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.740
I single-handedly started a planned
Parenthood clinic in that town

648
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.460
against, I guess, fierce, local
opposition with my own funds.

649
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.850
And there were death threats
and there were fire bombings

650
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:29.730
of doctor's offices and all
kinds of things. It was

651
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.190
the single thing in my
entire career that I was

652
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:36.510
most proud of because it
actually made a difference. Young

653
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.670
women were able to complete
their educations. Certain number of

654
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:45.170
lives weren't destroyed and naturally
enough as being, because I'm

655
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.390
a lifelong rebel. The fact
that everybody was angry about

656
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.190
it and couldn't understand why
I was doing it. That

657
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.790
helped also. That's great. Well,
I really appreciate you sharing

658
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.820
your stories with us and
people can go up on

660
00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.380
