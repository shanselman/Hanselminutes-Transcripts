Vista X-Box three 60 spelunking
and more <inaudible>. Hi, this

18
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.770
is Carl Franklin, and you're listening
to Hansel minutes. I'm not

19
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.200
here with Scott this week.
In fact, Scott is here

20
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.510
with Chris sells. He decided
to do something a little

21
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.790
bit different this week, took
his portable rig over to

22
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.210
Chris's house. They both live
in Portland, Oregon, and here's

23
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.920
the conversation that ensued this
Hanselman. And this is Hansel

24
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.930
minutes. We're doing a little
something different this week. I'm

25
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.860
over at Chris cell's house
at Casa de cells, and

26
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.410
we're doing our very first
Hanselman it's show with a

27
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.450
guest. So now you don't
have to listen to me

28
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.160
and Carl, you have to
listen to me and Chris

29
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.740
sells. Thank you, Chris, for
having me over to your

30
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.500
house. I'm happy to, at
the very least, I just

31
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.390
love when new people come
to my house and I

32
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.780
get to give the 15
minute mandatory. Here's all the

33
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.370
remodeling we did at my
house. So you were a

34
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.010
new victim. Thanks very much,
Scott. It was very lovely.

35
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.190
I liked the, the hardwood,
but more importantly, the Xbox

36
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.990
connected to the media center.
I thought it was. Oh

37
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.050
yeah. And you know, did
you notice that the way

38
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.350
the furniture was arranged in
the family room, we had

39
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.160
to have the LCD flat
panel up on the fireplace.

40
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.650
We had to buy that.
Not because I wanted it.

41
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.710
Oh, no, but because that's
the only way to arrange

42
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.040
the room. Yes. Clearly a
flat panel was required to

43
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.800
make the remodeling work. Absolutely.
Right. Fantastic. So you, you,

44
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.890
you listened to our show,
you drove up to saddle

45
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.740
and listen to our show
in the car. So what

46
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.130
happens is that whenever I
have a period of time

47
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.520
when I've got some free
time and I can't read,

48
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.140
cause I'm a reader is,
you know, I will download

49
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.410
your, a bunch of your
shows. You know, maybe some

50
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.470
just recently I was driving
back from Seattle or I'm

51
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.430
walking through airports or I'm
standing in line with a

52
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.460
bank, washing the dishes on
a Saturday afternoon. You know,

53
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.000
those kinds of things. I
download a bunch of shows

54
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.840
and then I listened to
them. And then, because I

55
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.090
happen to have your phone
number on my S that

56
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.690
same cell phone, whenever I
have a problem with whatever

57
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.670
you said, I call up
and bitch directly. And it's

58
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.510
a fabulous feedback loop. So
you had so many problems

59
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.700
with the show that you
had us come to your

60
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.860
house so that we could
hear them out in a

61
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.000
complete full Chris shell. Chris
sells feed feeds back show.

62
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.520
This is that show. Actually,
it's not that at all,

63
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.770
because, you know, I know
that I've had problems with

64
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.530
individual shows and I've called
you and you've been nice

65
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.110
about it. Right. But overall,
I love the show so

66
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.510
much that I've been after
you for weeks to let

67
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.300
me horn in on one.
I'm just like, Carla, always

68
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.110
let me horn in on
the.net show. So plus I,

69
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.620
you know, you're always, so
whenever you're talking to Carl,

70
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.980
right, Carl has a certain
background in a certain sensibility

71
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.700
and that's great because that
represents a huge percentage of

72
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.680
overall.net developers. I just wanted
to, I mean, you know,

73
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.460
Carl likes line continuation characters.
I like semi-colons, that's it

74
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.010
that's the whole difference. Not
that there's anything wrong. Not

75
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.130
that there's anything wrong with
that. Yes. So you are

76
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.490
coming at this from the
curly braces, old school perspective.

77
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.540
Well, old school in the
sense that I like to

78
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.060
program a solution to a
problem, even when it's not

79
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.220
warranted, that's what I consider
old school. Right? Writing a

80
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.080
solution when it's not warranted.
What you mean, What I

81
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.960
mean is if I've got
a problem in my life,

82
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.810
the very first thing I
think of is how can

83
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.970
I write a piece of
software to solve it as

84
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.780
opposed to there are people
in the world and arguably

85
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.010
most programmers have problems to
solve. And then they apply

86
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.050
the appropriate tools. I only
have one tool software and

87
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.590
especially custom software. I mean,
you're even you're. I was

88
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.600
just going to ask how
much software runs this house.

89
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.010
I mean, I know how
much custom software is running

90
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.980
in my house between my
X tens stuff, the baby

91
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.670
cam motion chair. I mean
the, the alarm system, the

92
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.200
automation of Vonage, there's probably
12 crablets that I've written

93
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.080
that are, that are, that
are running my house. How

94
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.080
much software is running this
house. So it's interesting. So

95
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.690
I do a lot of
software to run my own

96
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.600
life, but I keep it
almost all of it's on

97
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.650
my laptop. And I have
these little programs that do

98
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.950
little things from, for me
on my computer. And I'm

99
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.480
constantly brainstorming new little things,
but you've always had this

100
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.340
wonderful ability to, you know,
solve a, you know, identify

101
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.830
a problem in your life
and solve it by just

102
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.830
knowing of every piece of
software that's ever been written

103
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.880
by anyone you've installed. It
all tried. It all gotten

104
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.730
to, you know, the obscure
command line arguments that don't

105
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.300
yet have documentation figured out
how those have worked and

106
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.780
then incorporated into your lives
so much so that, you

107
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.300
know, it's handy to have
you on that speed dial

108
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.460
again. Cause then whenever I
need something, you know, I

109
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.180
know exactly who to ask,
Right? But what, what, what

110
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.390
price, what price installing everything
in the world, right. I

111
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.330
mean, I am, I am
living the dream right now.

112
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.260
I've just installed Vista and
you know, people always tease

113
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.810
me because in windows XP,
when you click on the

114
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.890
start menu and go all
programs on my 1600, by

115
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.390
10 40 monitor, there's this
gray curtain that drops when

116
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.590
you hit all programs and
it fills the screen. My

117
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.500
all programs goes, I think
I get about up to

118
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.380
pee. And then it just
kind of flows off the

119
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.150
end of the right of
part of the screen. So

120
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.250
ironically, For most people, all
programs means all programs that

121
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.130
you happen to have installed
in the case of Scott,

122
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.550
that also equals all programs
ever written anywhere ever by

123
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.620
anyone That was fills up
the screen. So now on

124
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.870
Vista, when I click all
programs, I get this very

125
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.770
sad scroll search menu. It's
just not quite as impressive.

126
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.890
They're not all there. That's
not very tough ask. Right?

127
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.800
It's not like I can't
see that they're installed. I

128
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.960
have to know that they're
there. So I'm not digging

129
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.610
the new start menu. Well,
it's funny. I have, you

130
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.520
know, I used to run
the Longhorn dev center, right.

131
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.900
I mean at MSDN at
Microsoft. Right? And so I

132
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.950
was living that dream every
day, day to day for

133
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.820
18 months. And then we
have that big split, right.

134
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.630
Where Longhorn took a different
turn and wind effects was

135
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.440
split. And that was goodness.
And now it's done at

136
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.750
3.0, and that also was
goodness, in my opinion, in

137
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.850
terms of the naming, but
that meant that the, the

138
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.020
operating system in a different
way. And it was a

139
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.470
while again, before I could
make it a part of

140
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.130
my day to day life.
Again, I always had whatever

141
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.290
the latest bits were in
terms of that net Theo,

142
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.680
but in terms of Longhorn
lately, well, I guess we

143
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.450
call it Vista now, lately.
My Vista experience has pretty

144
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.190
much been a $300 Linux
PC that I bought and

145
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.720
then installed Vista on. And
after about, I got to

146
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.780
use that computer for about
18 hours and then my,

147
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.960
my son's confiscated it and
now it's in their room

148
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.880
and it's been an excellent
test of the operating stuff.

149
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.180
And what is the windows
experience index on this particular,

150
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:58.080
This experience index on this
one is like 4.2 for

151
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.330
300 bucks. Yeah. Oh dude.
Yeah. My custom built Fry's

152
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.780
PC, like, you know, lovingly
nurtured raid this and that

153
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.620
two gigs around also 4.2,
because that's the thing that's

154
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.410
funny about the experience index.
It's the lowest, whatever the

155
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.130
lowest score is. Mine was
processor. So for me, it

156
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.670
was a tie between processor,
which is a very low

157
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.970
end processor. And, you know,
I didn't use the built

158
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.340
in graphics that came with
my, my little PC. It

159
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.550
was also a free SPC
prize special, but I bought,

160
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.410
I upgraded the video card
to the 256 Meg video

161
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:38.030
card, but I only bought
the $50 256 Meg video

162
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.280
cards. So it's, it's tied
with the CPU for the

163
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.550
love. When did the Pentium
four, three gigahertz becoming low

164
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.030
end, low end processor? You
would think I've got that.

165
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.880
I think I've got like
a 1.6 Celeron that's what

166
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.280
I have. And we're both
at 4.2, so, and it's,

167
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.380
and we're both CPU bound.
That's what's not cool. I've

168
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.330
got hyper-threading and everything. So
I don't know it's got

169
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.300
nothing. It's not the same.
My wife runs a $300

170
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.490
fries PC, which is apparently
not as good as yours.

171
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.080
And she has an experienced
index of one because she

172
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.700
has the integrated Intel, you
know, super not 3d. She

173
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.150
actually, when she runs solitaire
the new like w w

174
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.280
Avalon based windows presentation foundation
solitaire, it says unable to

175
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.060
start hardware, renderer, falling back
to software rendering or something.

176
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.090
And she can't run solitaire
and Minesweeper at the same

177
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.840
time. He's too much Wait,
isn't this the same PC

178
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.050
you just threw. One of
those ready boost USB drives

179
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.360
into, you said it was
doing good things. It is

180
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.570
Solitaire faster than ever then
telling me that it can't

181
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.990
render The graphics. But yeah,
it does load faster. I

182
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.330
ran a test yesterday where
I had a Excel and

183
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.490
word and outlook all running
at the same time. And

184
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.400
did that, that swapping back
and forth. It's just it's

185
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.680
night and day. I mean,
ready boost took this little

186
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.700
512 Meg box and gave
it life again. Now my

187
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.280
two gig box, I haven't
really noticed a difference yet.

188
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:04.220
Sure. My 768 Meg tablet,
my Toshiba tablet. Sure it

189
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.730
did. So you've noticed that
the Vista was in fact

190
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.490
faster on that box then
the next week. And, and,

191
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.120
and, and it's interesting to
watch the light on the

192
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.250
USB drive. Cause then you
get a sense of when

193
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.560
is it that it's, it's
reading from this? Cause the

194
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.560
USB drive has a light
touch, your disk access light,

195
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.690
right? So you can, you
can hear kind of moments

196
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.000
of quiet and the hard
drive when it's instead reading

197
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.370
from the USB drive. I'd
like to get ahold of

198
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.830
some of those, those stress
testers that they showed at

199
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.590
tech ed, where they were
demonstrating, ready boost. So I

200
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.770
could find out if it
really is super fetch, really

201
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.500
working well. I mean, isn't
the little green light is

202
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.370
enough for you. Well, I
just expected to go into

203
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.510
task manager and see physical
memory, virtual memory, and then

204
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.600
ready boost the, or something
to show up as another

205
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.000
graph. I would be surprised
if it wasn't in there,

206
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.840
you know, they got like
every possible metric under the

207
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.750
sun, You know, that's a
good point. And if there

208
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.030
isn't, it's probably in perf
Mon. Yeah, yeah. I bet

209
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.300
it is in there. Yeah,
they do. In general, I've

210
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.400
noticed they do an excellent
job making that data available.

211
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.820
Let me ask you this.
Why, why am I suffering

212
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.050
with Vista? I I've got
drivers this and this. I

213
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.630
mean the, the, the software
stuff's working, I mean, I'm

214
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.300
running.net framework. I'm developing in
the Denton framework. Three O

215
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.830
card spaces works great. WPF
works great. Indigos works great.

216
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.730
So all of the wind
effects stuff is great. What,

217
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.000
what are people Complaining? Right.
I mean, let's just be

218
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.300
real. People are bitching about,
about Vista. Is it really

219
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.210
just drivers that they're complaining
about? I, I wonder about

220
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:42.030
that the only driver issue
I had with, like they

221
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.600
say this little $300 PC
was for beta one and

222
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.090
beta two, the sound drivers
didn't work. And it was

223
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.660
my understanding. They were doing
still big, big magic on

224
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.510
the sound. And, but an
RC wanted magically works just

225
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.080
fine. And that's it. Yeah.
And it just works my

226
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.240
gig. I'm sure. Well, I
can't be sure, but I'm

227
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.380
guessing it has something to
do with, there's a whole

228
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.010
new driver model Vista. Right.
And so that driver model

229
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:16.620
is all about performance and
robustness. Okay. And so every

230
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.680
time you have a new
driver driver model, you've got,

231
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.080
you know, you've got to
deal with, you got to

232
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.390
decide how to deal with
legacy drivers. And I don't

233
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.070
know what the decisions they
made there were. And do

234
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.780
you have to, if you're
not dealing with legacy drivers,

235
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.260
get new drivers with the
new driver model. And my

236
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.240
guess is that the legacy
driver support to live up

237
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.110
to the robustness, isn't letting
in some drivers that maybe

238
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.520
would add to more capability
or compatibility, but would decrease

239
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.050
robustness. Right? I mean, if
you think about it, the

240
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.140
PC was fabulous because of
general purpose and does absolutely

241
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.000
everything and you can plug
any old thing into it

242
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.860
and you can write software
to do any old thing,

243
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.700
but we've the problem with
that was where it's great

244
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.680
for geeks, right? You and
I love that. And every

245
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.870
time they turn a little
knob and make it more

246
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.560
robust, they take away capabilities
and we complain, right. And

247
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.540
we write the blogs and
we complain and people see

248
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.740
right where the loud minority,
right. So that's fine. Except

249
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.310
most people use PCs and
they're not willing to have

250
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:32.250
it crash and they're not
willing to have it allow

251
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.260
insecure things to happen. They're
just not most people want

252
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.350
the computer to work as
a VCR, right. They just

253
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.630
want to turn it on.
I want it to work

254
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.440
Always on or on quicker
or whatever it's called, you

255
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.140
know, push a button, come
out of sleep mode. And

256
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.210
it just it's intuitive. And
it just, and it never

257
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.690
crashes. And it always, it
always does what you expect

258
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.390
and it protects you from
the hostile world. I mean,

259
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.820
we have an ecosystem in
the internet that is increasingly

260
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.520
capable and capable of code
and it's capable of evil,

261
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.840
just like any ecosystem in
wild. I mean, we're talking

262
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.190
about at this point a
natural system, right, where nobody's

263
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.440
in control and it evolves
in its own and bad

264
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.500
things and good things happen
in equal measure. And so

265
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.490
the individual nodes at the
end to provide that same

266
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.090
safe and happy experience have
had to evolve very quickly.

267
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.830
So I would even argue
that one of the goals

268
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:41.900
that the Xbox team had
was let's start over with

269
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.960
a machine where we can
bake in security and robustness

270
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.790
as first class citizens and
an intuitive interface and give

271
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.120
people an, you know, a
VCR like experience at the

272
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.300
same time. Notice that over
time, the X-Box three 60

273
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.700
gets more and more capable.
The, you know, the big

274
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.850
ticket items that people want
to do with their PC,

275
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.160
right? All the media stuff.
It's not just for playing

276
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.500
games. Right. But the difference
is, is that an Xbox

277
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.970
three 60 is tantamount to
a Mac because it is

278
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:20.770
a platform with one hardware
play with one hardware platform.

279
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.220
There's not a Dell, Xbox
three 60 and an HP.

280
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.160
X-Box three 60. There is
one. And the reason that

281
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.840
I think that Apple succeeds,
so, so dramatically is that

282
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.440
there's one with, with the
security robustness and it just

283
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.140
apples work. You push a
button that turns on, cause

284
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.300
there's only one hardware platform.
There's only one driver to

285
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.100
have. I mean, you get
your little peripherals, you got

286
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.830
your USB cam, but there's
really only one motherboard chip

287
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.860
set to support. There's only
one power management system to

288
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.350
support There's N chip sets,
right? Cause they changed them

289
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:54.010
themselves, but they have houses
filled with all the old

290
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.440
computers, right. They can just,
they can walk up and

291
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.860
definitively know this is every
possible combination or nearly every

292
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.720
possible You can't go to
Fry's and say, I like

293
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.500
it, buy a Mac motherboard
and a Taiwan Chip sense

294
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.400
over there. You know, councils
are very like that. But

295
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.030
you know, as we get
to next gen councils, especially

296
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.410
the three 60 and probably
the <inaudible> not so much

297
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.960
the, we, I don't think
we will get to a

298
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.200
point where they have more
and more capability where they're

299
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.810
starting to encroach on the
PC world. For example, you

300
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.180
know, you wrote a blog
entry about, gosh, I can

301
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.430
keep all my media on
my PC. And if it

302
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.370
happens to be a media
center PC, which is specifically

303
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.740
about managing media, then there
is a way to hook

304
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.840
it through a three 60.
But even if it's not,

305
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.230
there is a whole other,
you know, streaming API that

306
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.230
the Xbox and the PC
both support for getting that

307
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.170
media and sharing it. So
we're starting to really get

308
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.800
to the point where, you
know, people have asked the

309
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.150
question, why is it three
60, a media center extender

310
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.040
and not a media center.
I'm asking that question now

311
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.080
because I, right now I'm
having some trouble with my

312
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.030
drivers and Vesta and I'm
having trouble plugging in some

313
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.490
removable drives. And a couple
of days ago, I had

314
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:09.050
this sense that my media
was not safe. Where exactly

315
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.960
is it? I needed to
be somewhere that is secure

316
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.650
as backup is back, back
up bubble and is available

317
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.920
from anywhere. Ordinarily it's been
on my main Vista PC,

318
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.380
it's been unreliable. So I
moved that drive over to

319
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.940
the media center and then
chaos ensued because now drive

320
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.820
letters have changed the location
of all the media chains.

321
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.480
So the windows media library
gets confused. It's got to

322
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.340
rebuild the whole library. I've
got 8,000 songs. Wow. Right.

323
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.650
I mean, this is a
nontrivial amount of music. And

324
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.320
I went to rip digital.com
and I had those guys.

325
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.120
Yeah. Yeah. I wondered about
that. You send them your

326
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.150
big stack of CDs and
they sent you back for

327
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.570
high quality MP3s WMA. They
sent me MP3s. This is

328
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.200
back in the day, high
quality, 192 KB, you know,

329
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.000
on a bunch of DVDs.
Yeah, No, I'm a, I'm

330
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.810
a dyed in the wool
MP3 fan too. I've ripped

331
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.020
all my own stuff to
MP3. And this was, you

332
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.770
know, when we had WMA,
which you know, for, for

333
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.740
all intents and purposes is
higher quality, but in terms

334
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.740
of support and compatibility, I
want to be able to

335
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.450
buy a song and use
it everywhere. You know, I,

336
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.030
I put, so back to
this, I got Vista, right.

337
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.000
I put on my box,
suddenly iTunes wants me to

338
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.950
authorize again. It's the same
box. Yes. But in terms

339
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.600
of iTunes and how it
determines sameness. So now iTunes

340
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.320
says, puts up this ominous,
you have used four out

341
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.560
of five of your authorization.
Yup. Four out of five.

342
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.340
Holly. I got one machine.
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yep.

343
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.940
So now hopefully Apple, I
mean, OD audible does the

344
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.500
same kind of thing. Yeah.
And I'm a big audible

345
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.610
fan, but audible has this
great thing where you can

346
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.530
say, okay, here's the list
of all the PCs that

347
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.720
have been authorized. And if
you want, you can take

348
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.310
some of the old ones
off the list, where can

349
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.800
I do this? This is
on their website. Yeah. Okay.

350
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.170
See, cause right now I'm
having trouble because audible thinks

351
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.140
I've, I've, I've maxed out
as well. And they won't

352
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.230
let me to authorize from,
from iTunes. I have done

353
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.710
it before where I've gone
to the website and I

354
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.650
imagine Apple's got to have
a similar thing. Well, yeah.

355
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.970
I think probably gotta to
call them and yell at

356
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.040
them or complain or something
because the thing is, they

357
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.960
say they want you to
go to the PC and

358
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.030
de authorize first. So the
right thing for me to

359
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.250
have done would have been
D authorized before the upgrade.

360
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.660
But I didn't. So now
that PC Is gone. Yeah,

361
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.020
yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean,
and of course it's completely

362
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.890
impractical for them to expect
you to remember, to go

363
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.200
and be authorized. Yeah. Because
it's not like we get,

364
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.780
I mean, with, with DRM
becoming more and more prevalent,

365
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.600
it's not like one PC
only has one source, so

366
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.370
I'm not gonna use WMA.
Cause it's not going to

367
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.440
play on my eye and
I'm not going to be

368
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.170
using AAC because I love
Mac, but I don't love

369
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.390
them that much. So I'm
going to go with MP3.

370
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.390
Yup. Except for all my
MP fours, which are the

371
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.620
ones that I bought from
iTunes. So have you been

372
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.330
doing this? Have you been
like buying? Oh, that was

373
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.730
in movies, not TV shows
and movies because I just

374
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.140
will buy the DVD. I'll
use like PSP video nine

375
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.730
and I'll just squish it
and put it on my

376
00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.970
PlayStation portable. Right. And I
get a much bigger screen,

377
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.390
a battery life. That's like
10 hours long. And I

378
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.660
don't have a, an iPod
with the video support. So

379
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.860
I have, I had occasion,
I dunno, about six to

380
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.510
nine months ago where somebody
had a little, you know,

381
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.960
w M a based video
player. And somebody had a

382
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.180
video iPod now that, like
I said, this was six

383
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.460
to nine months ago. So
who knows things might have

384
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.690
changed, but at the time
it was amazing. The difference

385
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.820
in quality between the iPod
video and the w Emma,

386
00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.820
I mean, the iPod video
was twice as good and

387
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.650
clarity and brightness, the holes.
And, you know, this was

388
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.020
the, the mandatory demo, right.
He said, okay, so you're

389
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.550
watching a movie, right? The
guy who owned the thing,

390
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.230
and I had the headphones
in and the whole thing

391
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.500
he's like, watch this, he
reached over, grabbed the iPad

392
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.620
and video, pulled the microphone,
cord out, which happens all

393
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.300
the time. You're on a
plane, you know, you've got

394
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.430
it in your pocket, whatever.
Right. The thing comes out

395
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.610
all the time. And you
looked at the movie, it

396
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.830
had noticed that you'd pulled
out the microphone or the

397
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:21.690
headset. And it had paused
the movie. I mean, it's

398
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.120
as opposed to, Oh, crap.
I got to find it,

399
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.660
plug it in, rewind, find
where I was. Just those,

400
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.810
that kind of attention to
detail. I mean, those guys

401
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.320
are fabulous. So why I'm
looking at an eye river

402
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.720
clicks, you know, the clicks,
I'm thinking about that. And

403
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.830
so I'm going to maybe
take a look at one

404
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.130
of those to see if
the user enter this there's

405
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.930
the Zune. Right. Well, so
the zoo, so this is

406
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.140
the thing I'm looking forward
to the Zune, although Brown

407
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:51.450
mystifies me, but I'm looking
forward to see if it

408
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.690
has that same attention to
detail that the Apple, and

409
00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.900
I'm not saying the same
features. Right. But it's, it's

410
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.800
a unit of delight, right?
When, when you do something

411
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.890
that normally you're not supposed
to do, but you do

412
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.100
it any way. And the
right thing happens anyway, right.

413
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.280
Unit of delight. So let
me ask you this. Why

414
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.160
is it that someone can
work on a project, on

415
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.720
an iTunes clicks, Zune, or
whatever of Vista and then

416
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.540
myself or anyone else on
the internet or anyone listening,

417
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:26.190
installs it, and out of
the box has a bad

418
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:30.870
experience. Even though it's been
tested for three years, it's

419
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:35.010
been installed 15 million times. And
I just happened to have

420
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.250
that crappy experience. And then,
and then one asks themselves,

421
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.140
has anyone ever installed this
before? Yeah. You know, I've

422
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.400
seen that happen a ton
of times, both for Microsoft

423
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.510
products and not Microsoft products.
And I think it boils

424
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:58.220
down to the fact that
fundamentally engineers build systems based

425
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.420
on the normal scenarios, right?
These are how we expect

426
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.770
the user to interact with
the system. And that's fine,

427
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.220
except we're humans and a,
we don't know how we're

428
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.290
supposed to interact with the
system. So we're just doing

429
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.490
the best we can. And
B even if we do

430
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.160
know we still make mistakes.
And so what I think

431
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.440
happens is we design the
systems, hardware, software combinations for

432
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.990
this set of scenarios. And
as engineers, we use the

433
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.930
thing as we build it.
And we build up so

434
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.420
much knowledge of how the
thing is built and designed

435
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.890
that we just automatically go
down those trusted paths where

436
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.020
things work. And we just
kind of, I think we

437
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.990
even block it out as
engineers, we black out the

438
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.670
stuff we know doesn't work.
We just don't even think

439
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.330
it doesn't exist anymore as
a possibility. And so I

440
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:55.790
think I have noticed in
over the years in various

441
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.420
teams that I've seen internally,
like Vista, I've seen what

442
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.330
those guys do and that,
that three Oh right. I've

443
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.450
seen what those guys do.
And the better, of course,

444
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.500
you know, it's not, is
not one team, right. It's

445
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.770
a good Julian and the,
the better subsystems and Vista

446
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.890
and the better subsystems in
that scenario are the ones

447
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.270
where even towards the end,
they're getting it in customer's

448
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.890
hands, they're taking feedback. And
they're making changes even though

449
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.140
right. They, they use it
in a way that is

450
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.630
not meant to be used.
And we still want to

451
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.990
enable that the pit of
success. Exactly. Right. We want

452
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.050
to push everyone into the
pit of success. Absolutely. Right.

453
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.360
So I've got this, this
nano iPod nano two gigs.

454
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.480
I've got the new, yeah.
I want to see it.

455
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.180
I've got the new, the
new one. No, let's just

456
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.340
the crappy old one. Oh,
well you don't want to

457
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.830
see that this is, this
area is, but it's still

458
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.930
pretty cool. Yeah. It's tiny.
You could be careful. You

459
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.080
don't accidentally swallow. It it's
that small. So I got

460
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.960
iPod iTunes seven, right? So
we have seven versions of

461
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.800
iTunes here. Do you have
all seven? No, I'm just

462
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.050
saying that one has, they
have built seven versions. So

463
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.570
you think that, you know,
it's not 2005 versions of

464
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.450
visual studio, but they've had
some time they've had some

465
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.220
time to potentially work on
it. So here's the deal.

466
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.250
It's a two gig El
cheapo. That's the cheap one,

467
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.870
right? It's the nano with
two gigs. Isn't it? Yeah.

468
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.200
So I want to plug
it in and I want

469
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.690
to S to my machine,
and I want to say,

470
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.730
I've got, and I can
keep in mind, I've got

471
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:29.470
6,000 songs. Right. So I've
got on my computer. So

472
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.300
I've got 20 or 30
gigs. I think it's like

473
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.000
30 gigs of music. Right?
Sure. I want to say,

474
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.660
gimme two gigs of the
good stuff off the top.

475
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.100
Sure. That seems reasonable. Right?
So no, But they do

476
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.180
have this whole thing. They
have ratings and they do

477
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.890
this careful thing where you're
allowed to rate it on

478
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.780
the device and you can
sync the ratings with you.

479
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.560
The issue is now that
there's other kinds of content

480
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.450
that you can put on
your system, you can put

481
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.850
podcasts, contacts from outlook calendars,
from outlook photographs. You can

482
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:04.070
Put context in here. Yeah.
I can go here And

483
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:09.530
I can say extras contacts.
So I've heard that presells

484
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.680
I heard that they're doing
games on this thing too.

485
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.010
Like they have an iPod
version of, of Tetris. Oh

486
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.130
yeah. And you know, it
won't be a real platform

487
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.800
that they can run through.
Right. That's the, Oh, they

488
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.920
can run and doom on
those. Yeah. So here, there

489
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.350
you go. There you go.
There's there's rich. Clawson pulled

490
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.620
out of the, so I've
got context. So here's the

491
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.340
thing. I got contacts. I
got podcasts. I got photos

492
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.880
all on the iPad. I
just want to say, and

493
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.180
with the extra space, give
me some music. Oh, I

494
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.400
say, so you want to
say, give me a gig.

495
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.660
I've got to get whatever's
left over is left. I

496
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.250
made a list and I
made a list and I

497
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.190
called the list one gig,
which is the list of

498
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.880
music. Yeah. But that's, I
want to say with the

499
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.590
rest. So right now I'm
sitting here with a two

500
00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:02.870
gig iPod with a half
a gig empty, wasted, because

501
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.820
there's no, cause there's no
way in the interface to

502
00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.130
say, I want this, this
and this. I don't want

503
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:11.300
to have more than 300
megs for podcasts. That's weird.

504
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.020
So there's no quota because
it's all done by lists

505
00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.780
like playlist. So you can
say, You have to manually

506
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.090
create such a list. You
can't just say, let me

507
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.030
give you some rules, then
that's what you want. Right.

508
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.500
It seems reasonable. And it's
just, it's, that's an example

509
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:32.630
of maybe that's an unreasonable
expectation that I have, but,

510
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.040
you know, yeah. Pick just
got pictures of the baby

511
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.490
now on the, on the
iPod. And if you move

512
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.250
it really fast, it looks
like he's talking, It's like

513
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.950
your own personal little flip
book. That's an example of,

514
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.020
you know, people have been
using this for seven versions

515
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.780
and suddenly I feel all
alone from a user experience

516
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.700
perspective. Am I the first
guy who's ever wanted to

517
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.670
say, I'd like to fill
up the rest of it?

518
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.980
Oh no. Cause the shuffle
supports that, but not the

519
00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.710
nano. Oh really? The shuffled
up kind of the shuffle.

520
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.690
You can just say, give
me a bunch of random

521
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.390
music up to this point.
And he gives a quota,

522
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.520
I guess. So I haven't
seen a shuffle, but that's

523
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.130
what I heard. Wow. That's
cool. So I'm really interested

524
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.780
in, and here's a cruiser.
Good question. So from a

525
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.840
user experience perspective, we've got
seven versions of iTunes, 11

526
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.500
versions of media player. What
is that feeling that you

527
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.730
get when you load media
player, windows, media player, and

528
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.820
there's that kind of where
the hell am I? Right?

529
00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.400
There's that kind of, if
you ever get lost in

530
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.730
media player? Oh, I haven't
gotten lost in media player,

531
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:38.270
but I have definitely gotten
lost in software and I

532
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:45.250
definitely get lost in, in
software, like project Microsoft project.

533
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.100
I sat down, this was
years ago when I was

534
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:54.970
running a little software arm
of developmental. And I felt

535
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.540
like, okay, I want to
use what project is supposed

536
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.670
to be good at. I've
got a bunch of tasks

537
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.100
and sub tasks and I've
got timing estimates and I've

538
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.190
got resources. And I want
to lay that out in

539
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.400
a calendar or an a
calendar. Right. So I can,

540
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.830
yeah. But I mostly wanted
to know how long it

541
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.840
was going to take. I
think it was a calendar,

542
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.310
but you know, Gantt chart.
Absolutely. And so the problem

543
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:22.270
with project at the time
was I'd never done any

544
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.280
project management using Gantt charts,
using project, using software specific

545
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.700
for this. So I entered
all the data, but I

546
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.130
couldn't get the reporting and
the canned chart at any

547
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.470
of that to roll up
the way I suspected it

548
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.780
should. I just couldn't figure
out the interface. And the

549
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:45.070
basic problem was that there
was a core idea inside

550
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.740
of project, about how you
specify the data and how

551
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.200
things roll up. And then
once you have it in

552
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.710
using that core idea, right,
the right metaphor, then you

553
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.800
could do whatever you wanted
with the, with the software.

554
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.380
So I called up for,
I think for the first

555
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.500
time in my life, I
called up the Microsoft help

556
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.230
desk on their consumer side
right now on the developer

557
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.570
side, which I've never called
either. But I called on

558
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.820
the consumer side and I
waited and they had little,

559
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.790
you know, they had their
own DJ that was mixing

560
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.090
music and giving like little
news reports and weather around

561
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.200
the country from where people
were calling. So Microsoft's hold

562
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.780
music is its own radio
station with an actual DJ

563
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.640
and they have a DJ
and yeah, it was really

564
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.470
cool. It was actually that,
that was a part of

565
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.810
the fun part of the
experience. And then I got

566
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.140
a guy who knew project
and I told them when

567
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.300
I was trying to do
any detected that I just

568
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.870
didn't understand the whole thing.
Right. The whole, so we

569
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:41.340
literally spent like 90 minutes
and he taught me what

570
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.540
the core abstractions were in
the project in Microsoft project

571
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.760
and how to rearrange my
data. And then how do

572
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.740
I get the report that
did exactly what I wanted.

573
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.220
It was a fabulous experience,
but it's not the only

574
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.080
one I've ever had. Right.
I mean, that's a good

575
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.170
one that turned out well,
the auto out of box

576
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.470
experience is not something that
just happens. Right. Cause I

577
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:05.040
think what happens is with
any hardware or software platform,

578
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.540
there's two real modes. There's
what happens when I first

579
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.580
turned the thing on how
do I get my head

580
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.760
into it? And then there's
okay. I've found the features

581
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.310
that I like, and I
know how to use them.

582
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.060
And I've learned to ignore
all the rest, right? And

583
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:25.560
most software I'd say is
fairly good at the once.

584
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.360
You've learned where everything is
and making it work in

585
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.120
general, It really does work.
WordPerfect right. Shift Def seven.

586
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:34.020
That's totally obvious. That's how
you print. We came, we

587
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.180
came built in knowing the
shift of seven is how

588
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.760
you print. But once you
do know ship to have

589
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.500
seven by God shift of
seven prints. Right. But it's,

590
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.530
it's that out of box,
you know? Oh, how do

591
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.900
I print the screen? Right.
That's why I hate VIM.

592
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.170
Oh, because you will see,
I grew up as a

593
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.340
VI guy. And then I
spent a very painful summer

594
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.460
doing Emacs, like three months.
I had to leave the

595
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.890
guy who taught me, Emacs,
taught me how to start

596
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.660
it up. And then he
went on vacation for two

597
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.910
weeks and he didn't tell
me how to exit Emacs.

598
00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.910
So Emacs ran on my
machine for two weeks. Cause

599
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.610
I couldn't figure out what
the freaking key combination was

600
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.040
to turn it off. And
then of course there's the

601
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:16.610
carpal tunnel I gave myself
with the alt Metta left

602
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.400
elbow key combinations that I
never could figure out. I

603
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.140
mean, So if, if, if
we had some, some other

604
00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.150
people here like maybe like
John Lamb or some of these

605
00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:29.020
guys that are hardcore VI
types, EMX types, maybe Don

606
00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.220
box, Don Martin gudgeon these
are hardcore demons. Wouldn't these

607
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.640
guys argue that yes. Maybe
the out of box experience

608
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.620
sucks. But if you just,
if you just let it

609
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.900
flow over, you just drink
it in. Then you are

610
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.760
a Ninja and you can
take over the world. Absolutely.

611
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.030
You're absolutely right. I mean,
once you're into Emacs, it's

612
00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:51.580
the whole mental model is
fabulous. I've ironically, I've been

613
00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.670
able to grok get up
and have a look and

614
00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.920
terms of the mental model
of what makes the maxi

615
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.630
max. It's not a text
editor. It's an, an editor

616
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:05.080
editor, right? It's an editor
environment and that's what makes

617
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.510
Emacs so wonderful. And you
can build all these apps

618
00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.740
and there's a ton of
things you can do with

619
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.170
it. And it's a fabulous
mental model once you get

620
00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:14.800
there. But the auto box
experience for Emacs is the

621
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.380
worst it's socks. And of
course we eyes there too.

622
00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:20.380
Absolutely. So that's really interesting
because when you have, when

623
00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.600
you, when you take that
combination, a crappy out of

624
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.700
box experience and an unbelievably
powerful underlying thing, then you

625
00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:32.200
end up with very fervent
supporters like fanatical people. Like

626
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.570
if you only could understand,
that's like with me, with

627
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.180
me and code rush, right.
Code rush is better now

628
00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.460
because in the 2.0 version,
they have a training window

629
00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.240
that basically suggests, you know,
in this context you ought

630
00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.460
to push this hot key
and that's cool, but took

631
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.590
them two versions to do
it before. I was like,

632
00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.640
Oh no, dude, if you
type NTL, Fs, LPSC, you'll

633
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.650
get it. You know, and
you'll get this great macro.

634
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:56.140
Yes. Oh totally. I was
just gonna spit in against

635
00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.600
the wind. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And of course I'm not

636
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:04.180
a code risk user, but
calm, you know, calm is

637
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.550
the classic example of this,
right? I mean, we used

638
00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.830
about Wednesday. You'd look out
into the audience of people

639
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.140
you've been teaching all week,
but how to use calm

640
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:19.950
and you you'd see this
placed overlook and, and, and

641
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.020
this, like, some of them
were rubbing their foreheads. And

642
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.240
at that point I'd say,
you know what, if you

643
00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.290
resist, it just hurts more.
Just let it wash over

644
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.020
you. The headache will go
away and suddenly calm, you

645
00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.730
know, calm will make sense.
And by the end of

646
00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:37.120
the week, that was the
case. But man, it hurt

647
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.850
the middle. Well, you just
Said that. Let, let it

648
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.890
wash over. You. I've said
that so many times in

649
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.770
training sessions for like XML
or the diamond framework, you

650
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.360
know? All right. Well, the
Donna, do you remember the

651
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.100
first thing that they do
in that program? Like most

652
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.280
dotnet framework classes is they
run the reflection thing. They

653
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.670
go, here's the reflection let's
reflect over the entire framework.

654
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.990
There's 275,000, you know? And
then the very first slide

655
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:02.910
for when effects is like
we've added an additional 87,000.

656
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.860
Yeah. Yeah. That's good. That's
great. I remember my first,

657
00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.670
probably six months as a.net
framework guy, I would, I

658
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.370
was, you know, I was
enjoying C-sharp and I was

659
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.700
enjoying visual studio and that
whole experience and I was

660
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.730
really enjoying, not freeing memory.
Right. I mean, that was

661
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:21.920
fabulous. It was like 40%
less code right off the

662
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.120
top. But I w I
was so frustrated cause I

663
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.610
would be writing my program
and I'd get to, Oh,

664
00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.700
I need a program to
calculate a hash or to

665
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.740
crack an Earl or two.
So I would write my

666
00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.680
little routine and I'd show
off my program to somebody

667
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.600
and they'd go, well, dude,
why didn't you just use

668
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.460
that piece of code or
there, or there it's all

669
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.530
built in it's all right
there. I'm like, Oh God.

670
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:45.050
Cause that was the big
deal. Right? All this stuff

671
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.410
that's there. And I can't,
I still to this day,

672
00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.580
can't say that I know
all the stuff. I, I

673
00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:54.470
I've tiny fraction. I know
Path.io dot combine or Earl

674
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:58.190
URI. Actually I fell in
love with the path manipulation

675
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.680
stuff. I know that one.
I like those, But there's

676
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.450
always that one thing you
don't need, you know, you

677
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:03.920
don't, you don't, you don't
have rather, you know, you

678
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.450
have to go and write
a thing. Like, does it

679
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.780
have like, was it path?
I don't know about that

680
00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.720
one. I know that I
definitely had to write the

681
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.480
thing where it'll create you
a temp file, but it

682
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.930
doesn't have the, it won't
create the temp directories. Oh

683
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.270
yeah. Right. So I had
to write that and you

684
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.160
know, it's it's of course
it's never going to do

685
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.770
everything. Sure, sure, sure. Otherwise,
luckily for us, otherwise we

686
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:28.760
couldn't justify our unreasonably high
salaries. So trying to tie

687
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.130
these, these things back together,
the idea of the out

688
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:34.130
of box experience. When you
get a, when you get

689
00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.490
a or an, I can't
tell you since I didn't

690
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:40.310
know the next word in
the sentence, is it an

691
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:44.540
historical or it's historical. It's
an historical. It's an iPod.

692
00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.960
So he hit an home,
run a home run. Okay.

693
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.110
So if there's the out
of box experience at an

694
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.020
iPod for like, you know,
my wife, who's a clinically

695
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.150
the canonical example, right. Our
spouses are always, Oh yeah.

696
00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.940
There's always the, what is
it? The w a F

697
00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.550
right? The wife acceptance factor.
Exactly. And then there's the

698
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.430
out of box experience for
the dominant framework or Vista

699
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.030
or framework three. Oh, with
both of them. I have

700
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:10.550
to, we have to tell
the user, like I've told

701
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.860
my wife, you know, just
let it wash over you.

702
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.310
I know the iPod is
an incredibly intuitive because with

703
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.620
the one where you, you
can turn the wheel, It

704
00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:22.340
took me 90 minutes to
figure out on an iPod

705
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.530
that I wasn't supposed to
be pressing on these little

706
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.300
buttons that I was supposed
to be moving my thumb

707
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.760
over the thing. It's very
confused. I'd never seen one

708
00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.010
used. I bought when I
brought it home. It's not

709
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.670
in the manual. It doesn't
say rub your thumb around

710
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.360
the thing. Doesn't I Know
that they say that the

711
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.050
design is evocative of caressing
something. So you're supposed to

712
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.770
just discover that, right? The
hard metal plastic thingy in

713
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:48.250
my hand, not big caressing,
but it's just like they

714
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.010
said that, you know, they,
they made the start menu

715
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.100
because they wanted to make
it discoverable right. By anyone

716
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.860
assuming they can buy into
the whole mouse metaphor. Right.

717
00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:01.450
Right. Totally. My wife's family
has come over from Zimbabwe

718
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.370
and I tried to teach
her mom how to use

719
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.280
a mouse. And it was
like, it was just, it

720
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.850
wasn't going to happen. It's
just, it's a nontrivial thing.

721
00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.250
She never connect the movement
of the hand to the

722
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.930
movement of this little tribe.
So what do I do?

723
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.790
I flip it over, trying
to show her the mouse

724
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.390
ball. It's not there anymore.
There's a laser. I literally,

725
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.920
I shoot. I pick, I
picked it up. I flipped

726
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.170
over like, well, let me
see mom, there's this? Oh,

727
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.020
well there used to be
this ball. Ah, damn it.

728
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:29.260
Well, there's a little tiny
camera and it's taking lots

729
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.990
of pictures and extrapolate and
I lost her there. Of

730
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:33.640
course, that doesn't help. So
we've got this out of

731
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.400
box sprints without a box
experience with anything, whether it

732
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.010
be a consumer product, whether
it be my remote control

733
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.890
or the diamond framework three
hour Vista is they're always

734
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.680
going to have to be
that, that, that moment of

735
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.930
pressure was we push. And
we say, just let it

736
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.910
wash over. You you'll get
it in a second. I

737
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.950
don't think there is. And
in fact, I think that

738
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.190
one of the things that
makes, that gives Apple, the

739
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:59.050
mind share across almost all
of their products and, you

740
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:02.620
know, market share when it
comes to MP3 players, is

741
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:09.190
that they have found the
ability to combine an amazing

742
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.730
out of box, experience and
amazing end to end experience.

743
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:19.030
And over time, those little
units of delight in ways

744
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.510
that even as you go
forward, even if you Scott

745
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.760
Hanselman get to a place
where, gosh, I wish I

746
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:30.610
could, but I can't. I
bet you still have features

747
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.830
that you have yet to
find in your iPod nano,

748
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.930
that will make you go,
wow. I didn't know that

749
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.020
that's really cool. I just,
I actually just upgraded the

750
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:39.940
nano yesterday. Cause I plugged
it in and said, Oh,

751
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.980
you've got a new, there's
a new version. You want

752
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.980
to download the firmware? And
I did. And they had

753
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.100
a feature for maximum volume.
I'd never seen before you

754
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.350
can set the volume and
the iPods and only go

755
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.630
to certain, no matter how
high you act, it might

756
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:57.430
accidentally. Oh, that's cool. Discovered
that. Never seen that. But

757
00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.530
do I want to have
this sense of kind of

758
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.140
spelunking and like, I don't
like going into Vista now

759
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.620
and like the on again
on a 1600 size monitor,

760
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.550
19 inch monitor the control
panel flies open bigger than

761
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.390
the monitor. So yeah. So
a while back, a couple

762
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.400
of days ago I was
wrong. I just had to

763
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.650
scroll down a bit to
see what was happening in

764
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.280
like T3, Z discovered a
whole bunch of stuff in

765
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.780
the deck. Wow. Look at
this. W And you know

766
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:30.180
what I found on their
windows firewall, thank God windows.

767
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.460
You know, I could have
seen Mac firewall. I could

768
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:37.480
have seen just firewall. No,
I saw windows, The windows

769
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.440
display settings, or the windows
that you think could put

770
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.960
that in front of everything.
A little reminder, like Jeff

771
00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.870
Atwood, just blogged about this.
He had a screenshot of

772
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.720
the, of the, the start
menu with windows in front

773
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.600
of every single word. Right.
Because windows solitaire windows calculator

774
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.870
as if you'd forget exactly.
Well, like at our company,

775
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.180
all of our database tables
have Kirlian in front of

776
00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.100
like, you know, so it's
just in case the company

777
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.150
might change its name. We
might forget who we're working

778
00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.920
for. Dustin's your name? Because
then you have to third

779
00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.830
through all the software and
change all the strings and

780
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:11.530
it'll take months. It's huge.
Yeah. What are we talking

781
00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.010
about? We were talking about,
you know, w w is

782
00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:20.140
there that, is it okay
to make, do spelunking right?

783
00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:23.530
To require spelunking to get
the, The, the, the device

784
00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.470
that Microsoft has come out
with that is the closest

785
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.460
to the iPod in just
glorious. Wonderful. What did you

786
00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.730
call it? Units of delight.
Units of delight is the

787
00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.910
freaking X-Box three 60, the
three 60. Is there? Holy

788
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.850
crap. I'm a huge three
60 fan. Absolutely. I mean,

789
00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:42.430
it has simplified my life
and gave him, give me

790
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.590
the ability to do plug
the digital camera into the

791
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.440
front of it before. No,
You got a digital camera

792
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.080
right there. I'm looking at
it. You take the USB

793
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.570
deal on it, plug it
into the USB port in

794
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.990
the front, and it immediately
recognizes it and displays the

795
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.840
photos there too. We have
to do that today. That's

796
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.770
awesome. Take your iPod or
any MP3 player or any

797
00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.430
USB stick, right. With MP3s
on it, plug it into

798
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.040
the front. And it just
works. So we had friends

799
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.950
over that had a digital
camera. I took, I took

800
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.100
a USB cable. I plugged
it in. It just worked

801
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.200
Well. So I didn't know
you could do that. Cause

802
00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:21.250
I had a cousin over,
she had been abroad in

803
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.080
Spain for a while. She
had a ton of pictures

804
00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.990
and I volunteered my house.
So she, so she could

805
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
have like a little party
for friends and family and

806
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.370
whatever. Right. And so I
took all of her. She

807
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.800
gave me just a CD
full of pictures. And so

808
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.050
I dumped them on the
media center and then I

809
00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:38.980
played them that way through
my Xbox. There's just something

810
00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.470
nerdy about the, okay, hang
on. The nerd needs to

811
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:47.200
run into the server room
and install his thing. That's

812
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.830
what the media center is.
Right. It's a media server.

813
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.440
Now the fact that I
also have it connected to

814
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.010
my television upstairs, that almost
seems wrong. Why couldn't you

815
00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:59.230
have I put the CD
in your X-Box and had

816
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.530
it uploaded to your media
server or just, I mean,

817
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:06.160
we have a trust relationship,
presumably between the Xbox. I

818
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.020
forgot about that. Why does
it, why didn't it just

819
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.450
take the CDM, play them
and you know what it

820
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:12.520
might've. I just didn't think
to try it. That'd be

821
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.470
a very interesting thing to
try. I don't know. But

822
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.110
those USB ports in the
front are amazing. I'm unplugging

823
00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.550
stuff. And we'll plug your
camera and take a look

824
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.830
at how You just use
blood random stuff in and

825
00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.850
you wonder what happens. Yeah.
Tony, didn't you dude. I

826
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.560
got an Xbox. The first
thing I did is I

827
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.220
said, you asked me to,
I play the keyboard and

828
00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.730
it works just great. Does
it really do Todd Man,

829
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.370
have you seen the Xbox
three 60 laptop? This guy

830
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:38.040
built Y yeah. He, what
he did was he took

831
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:42.030
a laptop chassis and he,
you know, this screen and

832
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.610
the place for the guts
and the, you know, the

833
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:48.270
little roller ball and he
took it all the laptop

834
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.970
bits and he put in
all the Xbox three 60

835
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.540
bits and the place for
the DVD drive and, you

836
00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.900
know, you'd press them the
big green button and it

837
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.320
would just play the Xbox
stuff on the monitor and

838
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.690
it was, it's totally awesome.
Yeah, it works. And you

839
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.780
know, you could put the
keyboard there and you have,

840
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.180
did you try a, a
USB mouse? Does that work

841
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:14.580
too? No, I'm sure that
wondering if it would appear

842
00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.140
What I did is I
tried to play doom. Right.

843
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:20.390
Do do, do them three.
And I want to do

844
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:22.550
it with the keyboard. Couldn't
do that. But like in

845
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.800
like fantasy star, one of
these chat things you can

846
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.560
type. Yeah. And of course
the reason is the games

847
00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.020
just don't even think to
take keyboard input because it

848
00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.960
doesn't chip with the keyboard.
Oh, actually speaking of keyboard

849
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.660
input, little tangent here, I've
got this IRR thing. That's

850
00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.210
controlling a robot. So I've
got this function, right. I

851
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.990
are infrared dot scent. And
when I do a, send

852
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.820
it with my list is
a little class. I wrote

853
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.120
it sends the forward command
to the robot. Okay. So

854
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.550
then I wrote a little
console app and I say,

855
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:53.000
you know, while console dot
check key or read key

856
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.500
or whatever it is, I'm
just checking for the one

857
00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.020
key. And then I have
a switch statement and then

858
00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.810
I go, I push the
button and it goes, sure.

859
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.780
So that works great with
one button press. If I

860
00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:07.700
hold down the keyboard, then
I get key repeats and

861
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.800
the buffer fills up. So
then I let go of

862
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.800
the keyboard. And then the
IRR, the program keeps reading

863
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:17.810
that buffer for like, you
know, 30 seconds, right. How

864
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.720
can I get from a
console app or WinForms app?

865
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:21.680
Or what is it that
any trend in the wind

866
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.500
farms app? Right. So I
D I put a, I

867
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.470
put key preview equals true.
I said, key down, key

868
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.690
up. Right? And then I
held down the key. I

869
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.450
made a background worker thread
that would basically fire off.

870
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.910
And then when the keyboard,
the key came up and

871
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:38.830
I would cancel the buy
the thing. But the, the,

872
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:44.000
the repeating though kept causing
these events to fire, I

873
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.760
guess, after you, even after
I, no, I'm saying that

874
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.160
as I hold down the
key, I keep on key

875
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.350
down, key, down, key, down,
key down, right? How do

876
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.210
I get, do I need
to use direct input in

877
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.950
order to get the, I
want the IRS to be

878
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:57.650
on when the keys down
and off, when the keys

879
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.570
up, I just want to
know, I want to status.

880
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:03.590
I want to spin like,
wow, True. If key is

881
00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.690
down, I think what you
really want is you want

882
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.300
the key down so you
can send forward and you

883
00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.660
want to keep up so
you can send Stop. But

884
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.300
I want for, it has
to repeat though, it needs

885
00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.890
to act like a remote
control. You hold a button

886
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:19.550
on your remote control and
it sprays. I see. So

887
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.650
it's not the case that
once you send the robot

888
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.830
forward, that it keeps going,
right. There's no, you, you

889
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.300
click it and it goes
forward. And then it just

890
00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.410
goes, There's no problem there
then. Cause you just, for

891
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.820
the key down on the
key up, and then you

892
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.850
have another thing that says,
well, we've had a key

893
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.840
down, but no key up.
So we'll keep sending. So

894
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.340
w in the, in the
wind forms app, when I

895
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:44.040
hold the key down the
entire form flashes, like I

896
00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.600
put a bunch of buttons
on it. So the forum

897
00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:49.890
kind of like shakes because
I, So you built yourself

898
00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:52.320
a little earthquake detector. I
don't know. I, I basically

899
00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.040
the, the, the, the forms
key down event, not the

900
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.440
event of the button or
a text box, but literally

901
00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.920
the form itself sure. Is,
is vibrates. It kind of

902
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.720
shakes like the key repeat
rate kind of kicks in,

903
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.000
and then all chaos is
ensued. You know, it seems

904
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.290
like it would make sense.
I just want to know

905
00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:13.080
that it's continuing to be
pressed, right. But I'm getting

906
00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.360
these repeated events. What I
really want is just to

907
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:19.620
ask the system, Hey, system,
what's the status of that

908
00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.170
key. That's totally against you.
Okay, We'll do that. You

909
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.170
can model it is against
the model, but there are

910
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:28.020
multiple layers of abstraction in
the model. And there is

911
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.940
a global mouse class where
you can say, mouse is

912
00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:34.770
buttoned down, is button up,
and you can do the

913
00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:37.140
same with the keyboard. And
it will, it's just system

914
00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:40.170
level, as opposed to, you
know, that next layer of

915
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:43.080
abstraction, which is, you know,
repeating it. This is an

916
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:48.330
system dot what, Probably the
assistant dot a windows dot

917
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:51.300
forums dot keyboard system.windows dot
forums dot mouse is probably

918
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.760
where it is. So the
work informs off to check

919
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.670
your book. I'm sure it
is in the book. I

920
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.840
wrote it down and flush.
Yeah. He was looking up

921
00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.970
to his, his, you got,
we got up here, you've

922
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.870
got windows forms and the
complete Frank Miller Spiderman next to

923
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:07.080
each other. He's got all
the good books here. So,

924
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.570
you know, that that's an
example. Like I was trying

925
00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:12.120
to get it to work
in the console and I

926
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.850
struggled. And I don't, if
you just said system forms

927
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.080
that, you know, it's just
not, when it's a form,

928
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.940
it probably not available from
the console. I have to

929
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.700
do something else to figure
out The keyboard. It depends

930
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.550
on what you mean. Right?
I mean, define available. Could

931
00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.190
you write a console app
that included system windows that

932
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.400
forms that DLL? Absolutely. I
don't know what you have

933
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.020
to fire up a message
pump, and then you're going

934
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.760
to be watching the stomach.
Can you, how are you

935
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.070
going to be watching the
keyboard? Okay. And remember, it's

936
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:38.670
the system global state, right?
So it's not about firing

937
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.640
events. It's about what is
this? So this gets into

938
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.740
the stuff that people get
frustrated about with a framework

939
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.880
where something that was global
ended up in some lower

940
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.160
down world. Like if, if
there is a keyboard class,

941
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.830
like you described, that's in
windows that forms, but really

942
00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:57.330
could be used anywhere Just
generally wouldn't use it everywhere.

943
00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.640
Right? I mean, that's the
question. Cause we have this

944
00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:03.090
problem all the time. I
worked on a product design

945
00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:07.680
team inside of the connected
systems division at Microsoft, right?

946
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.400
These are the guys that
don't Indigo and BizTalk and,

947
00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:14.070
and workflow and a bunch
of those. And I work

948
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:19.350
in a little team and
work constantly. It's amazing how

949
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:22.350
much time we spend arguing
about what do we name

950
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.680
something? Do we create a
new interface or not every

951
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:30.950
time we do, you know,
you've got new concepts, you've

952
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.380
got to teach to people.
What about the existing concepts

953
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.570
in the framework? Are they
the same? Can you reuse

954
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.520
them? Do you really need
a new thing? How do

955
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.280
you We'll push it up
to another group? Like I

956
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.070
know that Rob Howard years
ago was working on system

957
00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:46.480
dot web dot caching, built
the cache for asp.net, but

958
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.970
it's an app domain level
cash. They wanted to call

959
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:52.690
it system dot caching. Sure.
But you know, politics and

960
00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:54.580
this and that. And the,
the, the, the hassle of

961
00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:58.240
moving it up, you know,
basically over one dot, right.

962
00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.880
It was just too much.
But that constant, I mean,

963
00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.830
okay. So in that case,
it might've been too much,

964
00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.500
but it constantly happens. Right.
There's a bunch of stuff

965
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.160
in a system or system
dot component model in Dutton

966
00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.100
at three Oh, that was
built by the team, but

967
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.560
they wanted it. It was
more general purpose. They wanted

968
00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.290
it in a shared location
that has to happen. Right.

969
00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.870
People have to be able
to do it. Is it

970
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:23.110
a headache? Sure. Because the
further up the hierarchy and

971
00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:25.930
the namespace as you push
something, the more likely people

972
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.030
are going to get to
it. The more concepts they'll

973
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:29.830
run into when they're looking
for the thing they're really

974
00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:33.520
looking for, et cetera. Right.
But the thing that's funny

975
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.070
though, is that when people
who, When those things don't

976
00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:38.290
happen, like when system at
web dot caching doesn't get

977
00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:41.620
moved and then I, or
someone recommends, we use it

978
00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:45.460
in a console app, chaos
ensues, panic will sell for,

979
00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.730
I want to use Microsoft
visual basic. No, don't prefer

980
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.820
it. Oh, exactly. So if
I, yeah, in the book

981
00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.640
and the wind farms, two
book we talk about in,

982
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.230
in the first version of
the book, we said, if

983
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:58.810
you want to do single
instance detection, we built a

984
00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:00.610
bunch of the services and
we provide a class and

985
00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.020
you can use it from
sharp. You can use it

986
00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:06.250
from VB and that's fine.
Right. And when forums to,

987
00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:11.140
Oh, the VB team wanted
that functionality baked in, but

988
00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.510
it's not insistent on windows
that forums, it's a system

989
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.270
Dodd visual basic or whatever
that the namespace they own.

990
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:20.710
And it's in that, that
DLL. So in my windows

991
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.580
forms book, I say, okay,
so it's baked in, you

992
00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:30.340
can use real engineered, tested,
supported code for Microsoft BI

993
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.560
that does this thing. And
then your C sharp apps

994
00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.340
by simply bringing in the
visual basic deal. And that

995
00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.400
just feels makes people, as
it does visual basic guys,

996
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.700
you know, they already have
it. I don't have a

997
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.980
problem. Right. But the, the
sharp guys treat 'em like,

998
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.200
they're lepers. Yep. There's a,
there's a ton of really

999
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.820
great stuff in there too.
I mean, that's not the

1000
00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.820
only thing. There's, there's all
kinds of wonderful parsing and

1001
00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.850
all this stuff that essentially
used to be built into

1002
00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:58.480
the interpreter and visual basic
is still there. W we

1003
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.280
do the same thing with
system dot web. We like,

1004
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.140
well, we really would rather
not have a reference to

1005
00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:04.930
system dot webinar console app.
Well, why not? Well it's

1006
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:07.030
because we don't really have
a reason, but it doesn't

1007
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:10.660
really feel right. It increases
the working set and, and

1008
00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:13.450
there's a performance of loading
another DLL when you, and

1009
00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:16.900
so, for example, in when
you're writing click, once apps,

1010
00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:20.500
you can know what the
arguments were. If you say,

1011
00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:26.760
example.com/booz/food out application question Mark,
and then that whole query

1012
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.860
string to pass command line
arguments. Do you click once

1013
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.620
app it'll install and do
whatever it needs to do,

1014
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.460
and you can get the
click once arguments, but what

1015
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.310
you get is question Mark
block, you get the string.

1016
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:42.090
So what do you do?
Do you parse it and

1017
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:45.510
write a little parsing code?
Do you bring in system

1018
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:47.670
that web so you can
get all of their wonderful,

1019
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.240
very wonderful parsing code. Do
you dig in with reflector

1020
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.880
and just pull out the
little bits you need? What

1021
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.990
do you do? So that's
a, that's in general a

1022
00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:03.270
problem. And so it's constant,
it's a constant battle between

1023
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.180
what number of concepts do
you want to push to

1024
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.930
the wider scope versus where
do you think people will

1025
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:13.170
actually think to look for
that stuff? Right. Will I

1026
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:16.080
think to look for query
string, parsing and system, so,

1027
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:18.000
and have it be an
Emma's coral lib, in which

1028
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.680
case then it's called a
lib is a monster is,

1029
00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:23.510
or will I actually think
to look forward And tying

1030
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.730
all of this back to
the out of box experience

1031
00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.550
and my kind of original
questions on Vista. I was

1032
00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:32.690
poking around in the now
harder to browse all programs

1033
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:36.620
stuff in the start menu
in Vista. I discovered windows

1034
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:41.540
DVD maker in Vista. You
can make DVD. I discovered

1035
00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:44.840
windows meeting was a meeting
place or meeting. That's like

1036
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.020
a little peer to peer.
It's like not quite net

1037
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.480
meeting again. Or it's, it's
some kind of net meeting.

1038
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:53.210
I haven't run that I've
only heard, but I think

1039
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.250
it's like a peer to
peer file sharing. But when

1040
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:57.920
you find stuff like that,
when you literally are wandering

1041
00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.260
around in a neighborhood that
you thought you knew, and

1042
00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.990
you go, wow, when did
they it, But isn't that?

1043
00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:07.050
So the question is, will
those people stay Or will

1044
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.110
they move out of the
neighborhood? Right. If I bet

1045
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:13.760
my company on windows, collaboration,
meetings, applique thing, and then

1046
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.200
it disappears like net meeting.
Okay. But maybe No longer

1047
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.740
than the start menu, but
it's still in, at least

1048
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.800
in windows XP. It's still
there anyway, is it? It

1049
00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.840
Vista I don't actually know
if it's there or not.

1050
00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.700
I would be surprised if
it was a little Vista.

1051
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:31.250
I bet you a dollar.
I got a bucket that

1052
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:34.940
says it's still there because
Microsoft in general is darn

1053
00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:39.140
good about, they might, they
might make, say something is

1054
00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:42.260
obsolete or you shouldn't use
it, but they're damn good

1055
00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:45.440
about leaving it there if
you want to. Yeah. So

1056
00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.710
I wish there was a
way in, in my, in,

1057
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:51.110
in Vista right now. I
think maybe the welcome center

1058
00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:54.830
is that, which is the
guide people to the dozen

1059
00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:56.480
things that they really need.
I mean, that's what the

1060
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.150
Mac that, that dock at
the bottom of the Mac,

1061
00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.940
right. That object bar does
a good job of doing.

1062
00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.590
It's like, here's the Cool
I live. Right. Right. And

1063
00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:08.210
of course I, life is
just an umbrella for a

1064
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:11.510
bunch of others, Right? Yeah,
exactly. Right. It's like Microsoft

1065
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:14.300
word. Well, I would argue
that the start menu was

1066
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.910
our version of that. Yeah.
Right. But the start, everything

1067
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:18.950
is appear, right. Every in
the, in the start menu,

1068
00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.990
That's not true at all.
Right. That's the difference between

1069
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:22.820
the stuff that appears in
the start menu and all

1070
00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.480
programs. It isn't The case
that everything's up here in

1071
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:28.030
the start menu. Well then,
then when you get into

1072
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:31.270
the whole kind of the
start menu as a collapsing

1073
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:34.060
itself with the automatic Chevron
collapsing, right. It will, the

1074
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.890
start menu says, so here
are the things that you

1075
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:38.860
ordinarily click on. Well, so
it's, it's a, it's a

1076
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.470
duel at that point, it
plays a dual responsibility right.

1077
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.960
In the, you've never used
it before. It's the, here

1078
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.400
are the things you are
most likely to want to

1079
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.570
click on first. And then
over time it learns what

1080
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:53.110
you most often or most
recently clicked on. And then

1081
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:55.960
it personalizes itself to you
have you you've used the

1082
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.810
new start menu Vista, right?
Yeah. It does. It does

1083
00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:00.400
it do the same thing?
Cause I think it pretty

1084
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.240
much shows you everything well,
you, in that folder, you

1085
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:08.830
can view river of programs
kind of view. So we

1086
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:10.510
can go check it on
Vista. But the way I

1087
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:13.600
remember it was, there's still
this idea of two tiers.

1088
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.090
Right. Right. Which is, here's
the stuff you're most likely

1089
00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.190
want to click on. And
I kind of missed the

1090
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:22.150
program manager. I'm gonna write
that. I'm going to write

1091
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:24.340
that into in WPF. I'm
going to write a program

1092
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.020
manager, which is just going
to be a place to

1093
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.470
throw stuff. And if you
could, if you could keep

1094
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:32.200
the old windows 3.1 looking
for you, I'll do that

1095
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.710
as a theme. That'll be
awesome. That'll be, yeah. That

1096
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:38.560
would be awesome. Well, this
is now officially the longest

1097
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:42.010
Hansel minutes ever looking at
darn near an hour. Did

1098
00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:44.500
we actually have a topic?
I don't know. I worried

1099
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.810
we wasted people's times. You
remember the whole mission statement

1100
00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:48.640
of Hanselman it's is to
not waste time. So I

1101
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.130
would recommend you listen to
this show in quadruple speed.

1102
00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.160
So actually I'm a, I'm
a huge fan of that.

1103
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.710
I, I always download your
stuff and then re do

1104
00:57:56.710 --> 00:58:02.110
it at 1.5 speed. Cause
in fact, so Microsoft has

1105
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:05.350
meetings and stuff and they
have online corporate trading. And

1106
00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:08.590
if it wasn't, I, there
are a lot of cases

1107
00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:11.500
where I prefer to miss
a meeting and then play

1108
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.620
it back at 1.5 speed.
I just liked that better.

1109
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:20.110
Awesome technology is all organized
to enable our attention deficit

1110
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:24.940
disorder basically. Right? So here's
a little dirty little secret

1111
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.180
that we'll end on. So
I was using the, the

1112
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:31.240
replay TV, right. TiVo DVR
yesterday. And I, my wife

1113
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:32.680
came down and she says,
what are you doing? And

1114
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.590
I said, I'm watching dancing
with the stars since, but

1115
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:37.690
it's too fat. I was
skimming dancing with the stars.

1116
00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:40.540
I was playing dancing with
the stars back in, you

1117
00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.170
know, five X speed. It
was a two hour show

1118
00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.980
as the results show. Right.
I want to know who's

1119
00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.930
gonna win, but I do
want to see some of

1120
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:50.050
the dancing. So instead of
skipping ahead, 30 seconds, put

1121
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:52.240
it on fast forward on
fast food. I watched the

1122
00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.800
whole thing in 20 minutes.
I actually used to do

1123
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:58.510
that with my VCR. I
used to watch, I would

1124
00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:00.300
have liked this movie. I'm
like, well, I don't know

1125
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.620
if it's going to be
good or not. I got

1126
00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.260
20 minutes. I know I'll
watch it at, you know,

1127
00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.870
fast forward. And I can
see the hole. And it's

1128
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:09.090
amazing how little you need
the dialogue. If it's a

1129
00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:11.910
bad movie, you know that
the Comcast DVR that I

1130
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:15.000
use, the Motorola DVR that
Comcast cable gives you. If

1131
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.420
you play it in double
speed with the closed captioning

1132
00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:22.130
on the close captioning will
still be there. So you

1133
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.260
just have to read really
fast. So if you can

1134
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.570
read fast enough, you can
put it into in double

1135
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:32.300
X speed. I think, you
know, we talk sometimes about

1136
00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:35.870
the various gaps between various
layers of our society. I

1137
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:38.840
think that the real gap
is that is the knowledge

1138
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:43.760
consumption gap, right? How fast,
because this is huge avalanche

1139
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.340
of data. How fast can
I squeeze it into my

1140
00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.070
brain? And as soon as
we get to squeezing entertainment

1141
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:52.250
into our brain, then we
know we've gone totally around

1142
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:55.010
the back. I felt like
I had two solid hours

1143
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:58.910
of good dancing with celebrities
stuffed into my brain, but

1144
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:00.530
I'm not willing to give
them two hours of my

1145
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.510
time. I'm willing to give
them 20 minutes of my

1146
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:06.020
time. I think that is,
sounds like a personal problem

1147
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.740
to me. Yes. And on
that note, this has been

1148
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.540
our very first interview of
Hanselman. It's what Chris sells.

1149
01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:14.930
Thank you, Chris, for having
me over to your house,

1150
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:16.070
it has been a pleasure.
