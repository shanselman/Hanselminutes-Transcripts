In this episode, Scott and
Carl talk about baby smash.

9
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.100
I knew application Scott created
using WPF. Hi, this is

10
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.230
Scott Hanselman and this is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

11
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.780
And I'm sitting down today
with none of them. Carl Franklin.

12
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.540
He's back. Hey, what's up,
man? How are you, sir?

13
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.610
I'm doing great. So do
me a favor car. I'll

14
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.980
bring up a browser. I
have a browser right here.

15
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.140
Okay, go ahead and hit
www.baby smash.com. Baby smash, baby

16
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.860
smash, like Hulk smash, but
baby smash. Okay. It's coming

17
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.500
up baby. Smashed by Scott
Hanselman, baby proof, computer fun.

18
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.980
All right, go ahead and
hit download there. Alright. Should

19
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.340
I say run setup? Yeah.
Or he can hit launch

20
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.290
either one. It's an ad.
It's a click once application.

21
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.250
That's a click once. Okay.
So launch we'll do downloading

22
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.390
running. All right. So the
screen went white and a

23
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.620
dialogue box that says baby
smash options came out. Alrighty.

24
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.940
So do I just click?
Okay. What, what are you,

25
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.320
what are your choices here?
So it says welcome to

26
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.050
baby smash. We're adding new
features weekly this week, added

27
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.130
click animations and only graphics.
So I get that this

28
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.490
is for kids and you
basically map every key on

29
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.910
the keyboard and let them
bang on it and make

30
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.630
noises and pretty shapes and
stuff. Right. So like switch

31
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.850
the sound, drop down to
a laughter and they hit.

32
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.020
Okay. All right. So sounds
speech. None or laughter. Yeah.

33
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.100
Okay. I'm clicking. Okay. All
right. And, and, and turn

34
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.140
on your brain, like a
child at this point. Okay.

35
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:56.900
Wow. Love it. That's you
know, it reminds me of

36
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.290
a program that I wrote
called bubbles, especially when move

37
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.110
the mouse around and you
make the trail of bubbles.

38
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.280
Yeah. That's exactly what I
did on a shape. Click

39
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.020
on a shape or use
the mouse, the mouse wheel.

40
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:18.570
Yeah. Get some nice music.
Sweet. So is this a

41
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.320
silver light WPF? What is
this? Yeah, so this is

42
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.230
a WPF dotnet three-five WPF.
And I think the point

43
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.180
that you just made that
you, you wrote one called

44
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.920
bubbles, every, every developer who
becomes a dad eventually writes

45
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.670
this program, decided you have
to, I mean, we're, we're

46
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.830
too weak to go out
and, and, you know, kill

47
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.240
an antelope. Yeah. So we
do, we only thing that

48
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.010
we know how to do.
Right. Right. If we were

49
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.260
handy, I suppose we'd make
them a chest of drawers

50
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.620
or something of our bed,
But you know what I

51
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.350
did once and I hate
to hijack this again. But

52
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.580
for Christmas, once I made
a crazy eights program for

53
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.610
my daughter, my first daughter,
she was about eight or

54
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.090
nine years old, maybe seven
or eight. I can't remember.

55
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.330
But anyway, she, I, I
basically wrote the logic to

56
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.510
a card game for crazy
eights and cause we like

57
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.920
to play. And then I
took videos of my self,

58
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.670
a headshot sort of reacting
to every different kind of

59
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.160
card and every different kind
of play. And then just

60
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.430
a bunch of random things,
you know, about, you know,

61
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.740
practicing or piano, clean up
a room, that kind of

62
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.570
stuff. And just, I don't
know, maybe 45, 50 different

63
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.540
little video clips. And then
I just spliced them in

64
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.240
at different times in the,
in the game so that

65
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.520
she could actually interact me.
And I know it's a

66
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.000
terrible babysitter, but you know,
that's not the way I

67
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.760
used it. I just wanted
to make a nice game.

68
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.420
She could play. Sure. And
what's cool about that is

69
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.090
I also made it so
that you could swap out

70
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.570
the, the, the videos with
other videos. So I had

71
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.230
my brother come in and
do a bunch of videos

72
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.620
of him took the same
game, just replaced the video

73
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.190
files and he gave it
to his son for Christmas

74
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.820
too. Very cool. Yeah. It
was fun. Yeah. That's the

75
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.650
kind of stuff that I
want to do with this.

76
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.260
I want to make it
so people can have a,

77
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.370
what we're calling smashed packs
animals, you know, rather than

78
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.410
just shapes and letters, animals,
vehicles, musical instruments, the solar

79
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.140
system, whatever. Awesome. I want
to, I want to put

80
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.280
in direct support for recording
videos from your webcam. Yeah.

81
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.230
So you could have, and
we're all doing this in

82
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.260
WPF, right? So you could
theoretically have, you know, several

83
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.490
dozen floating, transparent movies running
in the loop, floating around

84
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.770
the screen and mommy and
daddy talking to you with

85
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.310
these, these videos. I like
how, when you press the

86
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.760
keys, Scott, that, ah, the
keys come up and, and,

87
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.480
and sort of rotate and
move around and then they

88
00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:01.040
sorta just fade gradually. It's
Cool. This started out really

89
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.090
small. So the, the story
is basically that a couple

90
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.400
of weeks ago I made
him come maybe a month

91
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.270
or two. Now I wrote
this WPF app like in

92
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.600
four hours and did it
in WPF. And I don't

93
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.690
know squat about WPF. So
I wrote it as a

94
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.180
WinForms application. And when I
say wind forms, I mean,

95
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.110
I wrote it in WPF
yup. With the knowledge that

96
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.450
I am a WinForms developer.
So I was, you know,

97
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.790
I had a code behind
and I was creating user

98
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.100
controls and adding them to
the tree, you know, and

99
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.810
doing all the kind of
stuff that you would write

100
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.450
it, you know, they say
that you can write Fortran

101
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.870
in any language. You know,
you can write a C

102
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.880
sharp and make it look
like assembler. If you feel

103
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.460
like it, I wrote a
WPF the wrong way. Now

104
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.050
I understand that WPF has
a very interesting high learning

105
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.660
curve. So I wrote it
wrong. And then I said,

106
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.730
well, I'm going to call
all of my people. I

107
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.040
know in my, on the
community and my readers and

108
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.060
people who are nice and
say, Hey, let's learn about

109
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.950
how to write this the
right way. So we'll start

110
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.080
with the nasty before code
and we'll end up with

111
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.720
a pretty after code, right?
So I've got this baby

112
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.540
smash a category on my
blog and I've done, I

113
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.150
think, six or seven refactorings
with WPF people. And I'm

114
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.700
going to meet, I'm actually
meeting Chris cells tomorrow for

115
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.080
lunch, who wrote WTF book?
I talked to Carl Shifflett,

116
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.040
it's up on code Plex
at covid.com/baby smash, where people

117
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.160
can, can give me a
lot of patches and stuff.

118
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.450
Jason camp gave me patches,
so it's slowly sucking less.

119
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.920
And then I, I met
with these guys at contango

120
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.860
and contango. They do WPF
and Silverlight work. And they're

121
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.160
out in there in, in
England. And I met Richard Griffin

122
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.240
and Felix cork. Felix is
a developer. You remember that

123
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.880
Felix and Richard, we had
on Hanselman, it's a couple

124
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.310
of shows ago. Yeah. To
talk about the relationship between

125
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.390
the developer and the designer
and the fact that baby

126
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.360
Spanish looks pretty at all
right now is entirely due

127
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.370
to Felix. Being able to,
you know, whip out a

128
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.420
pretty cool gradient and draw
a mouse cursor in like

129
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.840
two minutes. So he's been
doing the work in XAML

130
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.990
and then he ships that
over to me. So then

131
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.020
I went over to a
website called free CSS templates.org.

132
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.830
And if you take a
look@babysmash.com, which is where you

133
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.800
downloaded this from, it's actually
not a bad looking site.

134
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.110
Yeah. It's pretty good. Yeah.
I'm realizing that this is

135
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.960
the kind of stuff that
like, you know, the, the

136
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.130
Leon band bricks and the
different micro ISV types are

137
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.340
living. Yeah. We know I
did a micro ISP in

138
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.910
like 1998 when I did
gluco pilot, gluco pilot was

139
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.270
a blood sugar monitor for
the Palm pilot. Right. And

140
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.120
I had, I had three
pages and it looked very

141
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.450
nice and Netscape three, and
I, you know, let people

142
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.690
download my little Palm pilot
application. This was before PayPal.

143
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.990
So they used a shareware
tool called kg, a S

144
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.050
K AGI to pay me.
So it was all very

145
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.690
cheesy, but, and it took
me like weeks to get

146
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.810
all this set up, you
know, but with baby smash,

147
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.460
the website took maybe an
hour, two hours. The initial

148
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.390
application took, You just did
a basic ASP net site

149
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.480
with no with no look
and feel to it. And

150
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.170
then applied CSS. That seems,
What I actually did is

151
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.450
I went to free CSS
templates.org, and it's just one

152
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.050
of many, many free web
2.0 templates, websites found one

153
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.050
that looked kind of the
way I wanted downloaded it.

154
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.810
And then put it up
as just straight HTML as

155
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.890
is modified the content looked
at the way the CSS

156
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.080
did the tabs along the
top, change the tabs to

157
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.870
my own kind of tabs
added out of the stuff

158
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:50.690
that remembering that Leon Bambrick
did a really nice 25.

159
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.650
I think we had them
on. And we had one

160
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.170
in the show about this.
He said, 25 tips for

161
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.510
starting your own micro ISV.
Right? One of them was,

162
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.930
have a screenshot button on
the first page and have

163
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.390
a download button on the
first page. Yep. So I

164
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.430
set that stuff up and
then I've added a section

165
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.530
now called videos. Cause people
have been sending me their

166
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.920
YouTube and flicker videos of
their kids playing baby smash.

167
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.960
So if you go home,
maybe spanish.com click on videos,

168
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.010
you can see babies playing
babysit, mash, put all this

169
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.220
stuff up. Very, very minimal
minimal effort went to, I

170
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.120
stock photo.com, got the stock
photography paid for the stock

171
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.780
photography of the, the two
people on the front page

172
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:32.960
there. Right. And like on
a weekend. And, and I'm

173
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.260
realizing that I'm learning about
what it's like to be

174
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.640
a little microwave. Vino, of
course it's free, but it's

175
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.500
just really bringing back memories
of when I did this

176
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.550
10 years ago, but it's
so much easier as well.

177
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.610
And it looks like a
real legitimate company. I mean,

178
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.230
there's nothing about baby smash.com
that maybe gives away other,

179
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.240
you know, there's nothing that
gives away that it's not

180
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.980
a <inaudible> It looks great.
I'm a WPF question for

181
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.530
you if you don't mind.
Of course. So when you

182
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.200
click on like the function
keys, you get shapes with

183
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.740
faces on them. And I
say, faces, they're like smiley

184
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.700
faces. They're they're crude, crude,
animation, cartoon. Yeah. They do

185
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.580
animate. And every once in
a while the eyes blink

186
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.540
and stuff like that, my
brain thinks, ah, set up

187
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.240
a timer or something like
that. But that could get

188
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.690
really crazy with a whole
bunch of different shapes. How

189
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.530
do you do that? So
the thing that is really

190
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.130
crazy, amazing about this application,
you know, other, other than

191
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.010
the fact that you slap
the buttons and shapes appear

192
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.500
is that do this for
me, hit, hit the space

193
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.230
bar a whole bunch of
times, watch them all and

194
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.510
just go slept in. And
they're all flying in now

195
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.550
while they're flying in, run
around and click on a

196
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:52.340
bunch of them while simultaneously
scrolling your mouse wheel. Okay.

197
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.220
I don't have a wheel
cause I don't Have a

198
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.650
mouse connected, but can I
use what? But if you

199
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.230
did it, If you scroll
your mouse wheel, they zoom

200
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.530
in and out. So we've
got, you know, 20 or

201
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.570
30 shapes on the screen.
I got a bunch of

202
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:08.970
shapes now. Yep. Animating in
blinking, spinning, fading away and

203
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.730
talking all at the same
time. Right. And there, there

204
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.680
is not a single line
of threading code in this

205
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.930
entire application. So is that
an attribute that, that you

206
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.330
put in the XAML somewhere
to tell it to, to

207
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.710
animate that? Yeah. Well, all
of the, all of the

208
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.130
animations are declarative. You simply
say that you want it

209
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.930
to do this and they're,
timeline-based rather than in the

210
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.360
way traditionally what you do,
you know, frames, frame based

211
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.870
animation or key frames, their
timeline based. So you, so

212
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.750
with the blinking, you just
say, I want you to

213
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.700
keep your eye open for
two seconds and then close

214
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.770
it for a half a
second and then open it

215
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.460
for three and then repeat
that forever. Okay. And that's

216
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.950
it. And you just say
that, and it just happens.

217
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.240
Now the spinning in and
out is doing a thing

218
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.340
called tweening where you're doing
in-betweens right. There's, there's some

219
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.250
equations and you say, well,
I want this shape to

220
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.840
start out 180 degrees flipped
over and then I want

221
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.500
it to end at zero.
And I don't just want

222
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.270
it to rotate in. Cause
you can do that with

223
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.510
like one line of XAML
we've added a library that

224
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.490
Richard Griffin found on the web
for tweening that creates in

225
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:29.280
between frames and adds an
equation to those frames to

226
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.680
make them not just come
in in a linear fashion,

227
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.010
but you know, come in,
stop for a second, accelerate

228
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.020
a bit. And then, and
then kind of continue on

229
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.000
its way. Yeah. It's a,
it's a, it's a much

230
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.960
more visually friendly and attractive
kind of, of animation. It's

231
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.730
very cool. The tweening the
declarative tweening is happening kind

232
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:56.700
of automatically. We saw that@afirstfloorsoftware.com.
I have never, so confidently

233
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.270
stroked my fingers across all
the keys on my laptop

234
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.660
before this is just really
ridiculous. Isn't it It's liberating.

235
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.230
Isn't it. To be able
to slap the keys and

236
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.310
you're that stuff pretty, apparently
someone said that their, their

237
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.500
baby hit the laptop so
much that they happen to

238
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.510
hit the part on the
front of the laptop where

239
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.200
the hard drive is. Oh,
and so baby smash is

240
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.150
not recommended for really vigorous
babies with hammers or, you

241
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.550
know, with computers you care
about probably, But you had

242
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.090
to use a, an external
keyboard. Right. Very, you know,

243
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.490
that's a really good idea.
That's a very good take

244
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.770
a cheap old keyboard and
then move that. Yeah. I

245
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.230
tell you, it's been very,
very difficult to catch every

246
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.540
key. The biggest complaint is
that I can't catch things

247
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.890
like window L and like
the lock and I can't,

248
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.660
I can't catch the calculator
button on, on, on your

249
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.980
fancy Microsoft keyboard because it's
not really a key. It

250
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.200
just took me awhile to
figure out it's actually a

251
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.630
custom message to a, to
a keyboard drive. Okay. So

252
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.030
What I've been doing instead
is I do have one

253
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.810
timer in the application where
every second I bring the

254
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.040
screen to the forefront. So
even though if you hit

255
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.440
the calculator button on your
machine, the calculator is still

256
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.290
coming up because I can't
stop it. At least I

257
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.440
can avoid you seeing it.
And even though I've marked

258
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.120
the window as being top,
most interestingly Vista tries really,

259
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.730
really hard to keep you
from doing everything that baby

260
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.760
smash does. It tries to
prevent you from taking over

261
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.850
from grabbing focus. The other
thing that I've gotten in

262
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.100
trouble with is that you
can shut your computer down

263
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.580
if you have a sleep
button and there's no way

264
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.670
that I can really do
that. And if I, unless

265
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.460
I get that, that not
responding thing. And then Vista

266
00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.050
is just going to say,
baby smash is trying to

267
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.710
prevent you from shutting your
computer down. So it's been

268
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:52.390
really difficult to really get
the machine to chill While

269
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.450
you're talking. I went and
shrunk the bubbles program that

270
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.060
I had written years ago,
and it was years ago,

271
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.160
it was.net one, one, I
think, or at least it's

272
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.280
in.net shrinks.com/ten E V. Nice.
<inaudible> that'll take you to

273
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.750
the, the old.net code and
utilities page at Franklin's net

274
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.430
and there you'll see bubbles,
bubbles.zip. Very cool. Yeah. And

275
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.130
did it, did it go
full screen also? Yeah. Awesome.

276
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.150
And I was using GDI
plus stuff. And did you

277
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.940
end up having to do
threads and stuff now? Not

278
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.030
at all. I didn't do
any animation. I just, I

279
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.380
played a note and through
the middy, a library that

280
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.130
I wrote played a note
on a harp instrument, you

281
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.830
know, that just goes boom.
And the higher the mouse

282
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.160
goes, the higher the note
goes, and then it just

283
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:47.590
picks a random color and
draws the three-dimensional spheres bubble

284
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.980
on a blank. One of
the bits of feedback that

285
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.020
I've got do this for
me go to the baby

286
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.310
smash website. Okay. And on
the right hand side, there's

287
00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.550
a tab feedback. It's feedback,
click on that tab for

288
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.750
me. Neat. Wow. So a
dialog box pops up and

289
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.110
it's as leave a comment
and it did a nice

290
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.900
little pop up. That's pretty
cool. So I'll leave you

291
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.150
a comment, frankly, Take a
look on the ideas on

292
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.680
the left side there. One
of them, I think you

293
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.580
can help me with Add
an MMO component to allow

294
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:23.140
babies to smash together is
that a, Someone suggested multi

295
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.580
massively multiplayer baby smash. So
they would like world of

296
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.200
Warcraft or world of baby
match. But look at the

297
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.410
fourth one there on the
bottom Connect mouse position to

298
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.950
MITIE. Yeah. They wanted me
to play some notes and

299
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.700
stuff. So you can go
to <inaudible>. That's exactly what

300
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.960
bubbles does. And there's the
code in there. So too,

301
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.540
so feel free. Cool. I'd
like to see that I

302
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.060
need some, some code. I
don't understand how to talk,

303
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.100
how to make middies sound
nice on a Vista system.

304
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.220
So do this for me.
Scroll down a little, go

305
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.720
ahead and click away from
there. And then where it

306
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.850
says welcome to baby smash.
Yeah. See the word Appearing

307
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.470
in the parent and the
paragraph there. Go ahead and

308
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:03.320
click on feedback. Okay. So
what URL are you at?

309
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:10.190
Hanselman.com, baby smash index HTM.
And it's still okay. Now

310
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.270
it goes to feedback.baby smash.com.
This is a really cool

311
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.710
thing that I stumbled upon
from a company called user

312
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.150
voice. And it basically promises
to give your users a

313
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:27.350
voice and notice that the
URL appears to be baby

314
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.030
Smash. So I've seen The
name alias, and I think

315
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.310
C name alias is one
of the most powerful things

316
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.230
that a lot of small
businesses are not aware of.

317
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.270
I agree that feedback, maybe
spanish.com simply resolves to baby

318
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.770
smash dot user voice.com. So
I've basically outsourced my feedback

319
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.540
forum to user voice.com, but
it still looks professional because

320
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.590
I've used the same colors
and the same logo. And

321
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.050
it appears under my domain.
And this is why things

322
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.920
like, remember the show we
did on live domains and

323
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.950
Google, Google, and windows live
domains, right? This is a

324
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.950
way to make your domain
appear with another application. I

325
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.940
am convinced that for the
micro YSV being able to

326
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:16.430
use these small companies, outsourced
functionality can let you get

327
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.220
up and going. And no
time, it literally took 15

328
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.650
minutes for me to get
this forum going. And that

329
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.820
includes the DNS propagation because
orcs web the company that

330
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.240
does my ISP has an
online tool for DNS and

331
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.190
they instantly updated. So I
didn't have to wait for

332
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.300
any propagation of my sub
domain DNS. Very cool. Yeah.

333
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.790
So take a look. People
are putting in like we

334
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.550
have 12 votes right now
for connect mouse position for

335
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.640
Mitty. Yeah. So I've got
to figure out what's going

336
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.380
on with that. So people
are putting in their votes

337
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.670
about different features that they
want and babies. Gosh, the,

338
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:54.080
the mini library that's in
bubbles is an older version.

339
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.220
And if, if you want
a newer version for the

340
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:03.680
latest code, you can go
to shrink stir.com/ten E w.

341
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.620
And that's a DNR TV
show that I did on

342
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.150
my mini router and mini
player. So that is that

343
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.580
there's a link there to
the latest source code for

344
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:20.300
the mini tools. Well, that's
pretty awesome. WPF man, WPF

345
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.090
click once application. Yeah, It's
pretty interesting. There's a lot

346
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.390
of interesting stuff coming out
with WPF really soon. Now,

347
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.810
WPF is going to have
better click one support, click

348
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:33.140
one support for Firefox and
the dotnet three, five service

349
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.990
pack one. So right now
people have to have a

350
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.710
Firefox extension to get this
application running under Firefox, but

351
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.830
I'm gonna update it to
done it. Three, five service

352
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.990
pack one as soon as
that's out. And then that

353
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.650
will put a Firefox extension
on their system automatically and

354
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.230
let them automatically get this.
Let me see if I

355
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.290
can say automatically about six
more times, let them do

356
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.720
click once on their Firefox.
So that'll be cool. One

357
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.180
of the interesting things is
that a number of parts

358
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.960
of WPF are going to
be taken from software rendering

359
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.710
to hardware rendering. So I'll
be able to do things

360
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.280
like glows, you know, glow
and different, different shader effects

361
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.010
that'll be done using the
hardware, the kind of direct

362
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.840
decks hardware. Yeah. The effects
library. Very cool. Yeah. So

363
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.360
things are going to get
a little bit more powerful

364
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.480
and a lot faster. And
I'm also looking at things

365
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.830
like letting users record their
own audio sounds a record

366
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.990
themselves and their kids. And
then, you know, let kids

367
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.610
do little videos of themselves.
So I mean, the possibilities

368
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.490
are pretty much endless, but
I definitely need more people

369
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.650
to help me out. I've
had a number of patches

370
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:43.530
put up, but code plex.com/baby
smash, Great idea to incorporate

371
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:48.570
content from the user's machine
without reprogramming anything, you know,

372
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.380
just put whole bunch of
videos and images and stuff

373
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.590
right. In a directory somewhere
and just pull those up

374
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.230
and splatter those across the
screen. Yeah. There's a, there's

375
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.130
a lot of stuff that
can potentially be done interestingly

376
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.850
though, because the code was
slapped together. Every time I

377
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.330
sit down and it, it
is a refactoring, you know,

378
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.850
I'm introducing things I just
couldn't have thought of because

379
00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.490
I didn't, I didn't give
any thought to the, that

380
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.370
particular feature. You know, that's
one of the things that's

381
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.790
fun about it is that
it's so freeform. Yeah. Like

382
00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.670
when I, like, when Felix
sent me the, the new

383
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.240
XAML with the pictures of
the little shapes, he's the

384
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.060
guy who put faces on
them. Yeah. But then someone

385
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.370
said, well, I want the
option to have no faces.

386
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.710
Yeah. So then I've got
to go and make the,

387
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.570
you, I has face interface
and, and you know, if

388
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.960
I has face right. And
all that stuff is being

389
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.260
done completely on the fly.
And one of the things

390
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.630
that I have done very
poorly and I'd really appreciate

391
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.760
some help from somebody who
knows what they're doing is

392
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.710
I've done really no test
driven development. I don't understand

393
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.380
how someone would test an
application like this. That is,

394
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.030
you know, not only UI
intensive, but, but random, you

395
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.280
know, how do you make
sure that this something works?

396
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.320
That's a great question. Really?
The way that I test

397
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.510
it as if it doesn't
crash, then I figured it's

398
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.940
doing all right. But I'm
sure there are a huge,

399
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.330
huge number of bugs. So
yeah. I'm hoping more people

400
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.900
get involved. I've had a
couple of interesting responses on

401
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.630
Facebook where I had one
particular guy who was a

402
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.860
voiceover actor in a, in
LA who had done some

403
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.040
commercial work and some standup
comedy offered to do a

404
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.820
male voices for it to
say things like red square.

405
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.000
Wow. And yeah. So, I
mean, there's all sorts of,

406
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.330
of interesting stuff going on
and no one's asking for,

407
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.030
for any money and I'm
certainly not offering any money.

408
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.920
Although I did get $24
in donations on PayPal. Hey.

409
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.720
All right, man. So that's
something that's been a lot

410
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.420
of fun. Yeah. I think
it's cool. A two bedroom

411
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.220
or your kids are too
old though. You can't help

412
00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.560
me pretty much. Yeah. Sorry
about that. Well, I'll take

413
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.240
a look at bubbles. I'd
love to add the middy

414
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.750
library to this and see
how far our babies match.

415
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.500
Maybe Spanish goes. I'm just
really happy that it's required

416
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.120
really minimal effort to do
some pretty pout polished stuff.

417
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.370
I think there's probably 600
lines of code in the

418
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:20.120
whole thing. And I'm looking
forward to talking to some

419
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.450
real XAML experts and that
they're talking about moving more

420
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.510
and more of my programmatic
chunks of code into XAML

421
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.290
making it more declarative places
where I've done animations in

422
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.990
10 lines of C sharp
code will turn into a

423
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.170
couple of lines of SAML.
And that also will allow

424
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.570
the designer to come up
with the animations as opposed

425
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:42.320
to me doing them on
the backend. Very cool. Yeah.

426
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.340
Scott, it's been fun. Thanks
a lot for coming to

427
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.010
hang out again. Thanks for
inviting me. This has been

428
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.350
another episode of Hansel minutes
and I'll see you again

429
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.710
next week.
