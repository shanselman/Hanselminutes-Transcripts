episode, Scott and his wife

7
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.740
mode talk peak relationship tips.
Hello, small life. Hi there.

8
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.020
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. So you had

9
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.690
had the idea Mo Mo
is my wife, everyone say

10
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.160
hello to Mo Hi everyone,
to do a show on

11
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.140
Being married to a geek.
And that sounded more like

12
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.700
a coping mechanism show. Like
you would teach people how

13
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.810
to, I don't know, get
over being married to someone

14
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.120
who is so horribly damaged,
like a geek, but I

15
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.200
think that calling it key
relationship tips is so much,

16
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.590
so much of a better
title than coping with coping

17
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.610
with attention deficit disorder. That's
right before you get a

18
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.200
divorce people listen to this
show. I don't think this

19
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.060
show is going to help
anyone not get a divorce,

20
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.240
but that's what I wonder
if they pause it avoiding

21
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.840
divorce with geeks, Right? Yeah.
So geek relationship tips, I

22
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.060
think, is what we're going
to call it because there's

23
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.680
a lot of people out
there who are listening that

24
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.450
are programmers. And would you
say Mo that programmers have

25
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.320
different personalities? Did quirks stylistic?
Yeah, I would. I mean,

26
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.310
pretty much in a word
program is a weird sort

27
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.950
of your own breed you're
out there on your own.

28
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.770
And it takes a while
to kind of understand the

29
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.650
person behind the weirdness. But
once you do, I think

30
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.350
it kind of makes sense.
And is this weird in

31
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.620
a, like some kind of
damaged way? Or we just

32
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.540
like things just so, I
mean, it's not like I'm

33
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.820
lining up my silverware a
certain way, like making sure

34
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.050
it's all perpendicular to the
plate and then, Yeah, not

35
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.360
quite, not quite to that
extent, but I mean, you

36
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.940
know, you definitely like your
things a certain way, right?

37
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.280
You, you like your peanut
butter and you will notice

38
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.560
the difference between if I
came, what was that this

39
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.780
morning? It was chunky and
freaking peanut butter. What was

40
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.140
that? Yeah. You know, anybody
else Choked that peanut butter

41
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.650
down this morning, that was
some of the nastiest, where

42
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.690
was the cream, The peanut
butter, who does that? Who

43
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.870
notices that level of detail?
The minutia, you know, to

44
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.280
that point, you know, I
mean this morning, this Is

45
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.290
the tragedy of my life
for the, for the listener

46
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.020
this morning, I choked down
a peanut butter and jelly

47
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.330
sandwich with, with high fructose
corn syrup, strawberry jelly, not

48
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.350
the low sugar jelly I'm
used to and, and, and

49
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.300
some kind of expired. It
was like, it had an

50
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.350
expiration date of January, 2010. I
always check the expiration dates

51
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.200
and right, this is true
of crunchy peanut butter. And

52
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.390
I'm like, why, who would
crunchy peanut butter? What is

53
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.540
that? Who would put peanuts
and peanut butter? And, and

54
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.650
that's definitely not cause we're
on vacation right now. That's

55
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.010
right. So we rented a
house and the house has

56
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.110
a lot of the, you
know, the basic stuff, you

57
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.940
bring your own food, but
they have all the ketchup

58
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.440
and the condiments and what
have you. And they had

59
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.300
the peanut butter. So we
didn't bring our own peanut

60
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.970
butter and Ketchup is a
condom. And I can understand

61
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.280
that you need to catch
it, but who doesn't bring

62
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.120
peanut butter, but we digress.
That's a protein. We digress

63
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.670
on this issue Then let's
talk about really. Okay. So

64
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.620
when we got married, you
were just out of business

65
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.860
school. Yeah. And you had
the idea early on, I

66
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.140
think, cause we had only
dated. We've been married now

67
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.320
going on 10 years as
long as, and you should

68
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.290
know that. No, but it's
like 11 years since 2010,

69
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.860
but we got married. Oh,
you're right. 2000. Okay Dude,

70
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.470
come on, man. This is
not a sheet. I need

71
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.900
to worry about it. But
the thing is exactly. You

72
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.850
don't remember that, but do
you remember the peanut butter?

73
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.980
I thought it was 11
years. It feels like 12.

74
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.510
Oh man. You had had
the idea that we would

75
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.470
make a geek, not a
geek mission statement that we

76
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.840
would have a mission statement,
like a business. We would

77
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.140
say, this is what our
marriage believes in. Yeah. I

78
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.710
mean, you know, again, being
people with different backgrounds, but

79
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.690
both being college educated and
what have you been having

80
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.840
a business mind? It, it
seemed to make sense for

81
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.720
us to define who we
were going to be as

82
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.910
a couple, what we were
going to be about and

83
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.410
the kinds of things that
we want. And you have

84
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.600
a goal for anything that
matters to you. And I

85
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.330
think for both of us,
this marriage was important. And

86
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.210
so we kind of goodness
for that. Yeah, exactly. What

87
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.420
a coincidence. Yeah. So I
think we're both in agreement

88
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.240
that we should come down,
write down something or not

89
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.130
write down, but think about
what is it that we

90
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.020
want out of life. It's
not like we had it

91
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.840
like framed and stuff, although
we could have done that.

92
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.420
It's that good? Yeah. Where
does that go? T shirts.

93
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.760
What is the mission statement
we came up with you

94
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.190
tell me, is this a
test or I was just

95
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.140
trying to, I was as
a good host. I was

96
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.950
trying to defer to you.
Our mission statement was to

97
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.340
have a drama free marriage.
We just basically decided that

98
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.610
our marriage wouldn't kind of
to use kind of an

99
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.040
old American stereotype. It wouldn't
spill out into the front

100
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.670
yard and bother the neighbors.
We would keep our drama

101
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.640
to it, to a minimum.
And, and by drama, we

102
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.820
just wanted to figure out
what were those things that

103
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.090
typically cause drama and trouble
and marriages and we could

104
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.460
remove them. So then we
could focus on the really

105
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.050
good drama and not the
basic stuff that becomes a

106
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.240
big problem. So we came
up with a couple of

107
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.630
ideas on what we could
do to make it just

108
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.140
easier. When we said drama
free. We just saying that

109
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.360
we don't want to have
to fight about regular stuff

110
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.800
on a regular basis for
the last 10 years And

111
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.080
be calling the cops and
be going to the hospital

112
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.000
and be cutting each other,
whatever, you know, I mean

113
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.220
it's drama, But definitely I
think avoiding, cutting each other

114
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.190
is definitely a higher high
on the marriage tips avoid

115
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.330
cutting. Right. What's wrong with
you? No, this is more,

116
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.180
this is this. These are
really mundane tips even. Yeah.

117
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.400
But they make life easier.
And the first one that

118
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.810
you came up with was
the allowance system. Yeah. And

119
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.400
actually I think you are
the one that came up

120
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.050
with this, you know, one
of the things that a

121
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.530
lot of couples fight about
is money and they, they

122
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.870
just can never seem to
agree. How many accounts do

123
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.880
you have? You know, who
handles some money and what

124
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.130
have you. And I think
right off the bat, I

125
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.810
mean, I still remember to
this day that you said

126
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.300
two things, you said, you
know, one of the things

127
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.220
was avoid resentment. And the
other thing was that this

128
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.120
is figure out the money
situation. So we've never really

129
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.540
had any kind of arguments
about money because you, you,

130
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.880
we set it up so
that it was an open

131
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.070
system. And one of the
ways to do that was

132
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.130
exactly that to do that
alone. Right? And this isn't

133
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.830
about having a lot of
money or having a little

134
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.970
money. This is a cause
we've had arguments about there

135
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.640
isn't enough money to do
XYZ. Those kinds of arguments

136
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.490
are handled. We're talking about
the basic paycheck to paycheck

137
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.510
arguments. Like what's this $8
at target, those kinds of

138
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.810
arguments, or why did you
buy a, an Xbox video

139
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.450
game for 50 bucks? We
don't have that money, right?

140
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.940
Those are things. Cause in
the first few months of

141
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.990
marriage, when we basically got
one account, we put all

142
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.420
the money into a pile,
we pay the bills. And

143
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.180
then what would happen is
if you imagine this looking

144
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.420
through an online and online
bank statement, you would see

145
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.230
rent, electricity, gas, and then
it would be like $2,

146
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.010
$3, $4, $2, $5, $8,
$12, $50. And it would

147
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.880
go on for pages and
it was just onesy, twosy,

148
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.920
little crap. And we would
sit there and we would

149
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.630
argue lowercase, lowercase, a right,
but we'd argue about four

150
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.320
50 for that. You got
your nails. Why are you

151
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.440
eating? You know, it's $70
lunch to two times, you

152
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.830
know, a week or whatever,
or exactly. So the idea

153
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.850
was what to make this
simpler, Just have an allowance.

154
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.330
And you use that for
all the trivial things. So

155
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.160
you want to take yourself
out to a fancy lunch

156
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.930
on Monday, Hey, you know
what, take yourself off to

157
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.540
a fancy lunch on Monday.
But when the allowance has

158
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.300
gone, the allowance has gone.
So from that point on,

159
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.450
we just eat at home,
Right? So we put all

160
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.290
of our money into one
account as a direct deposit,

161
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.710
then our rent and our,
the big bills, kind of

162
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.200
the five big bills or
whatever, you know, the insurance

163
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.660
and stuff like that comes
out. And then we pay

164
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.220
each other in cash and
allowance. Right? So let's just

165
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.370
pick a round number, say
a hundred bucks, you get

166
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.110
a hundred bucks, I get
a hire bucks and then

167
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.720
I can go and save
that money and eat at

168
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.080
home every day or I
can eat at Quizno's every

169
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.960
day, but then I can't
buy an Xbox game or

170
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.150
whatever. And you can have
your nails done or not,

171
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.610
or buy clothes or not.
And then suddenly the, the

172
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.410
online ledger, the online checkbook,
just, Yeah, the noise went

173
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.060
away. You know, the, the
$7 is on the $10

174
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.010
is, and all that background
noise that was obnoxious went

175
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.890
away. Cause you went from
what, you know, 200 entries

176
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.230
to download one 10 a
month or something like that.

177
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.230
It was a lot cleaner.
Okay. And I've got, so

178
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.000
I've got money in my
pocket. I've got a couple

179
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.010
of twenties in my pocket,
folding money. I like to

180
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.530
call it a little walking
around town money. And if

181
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.870
I want to take that
money and go and buy

182
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.770
a video game or whatever,
I can do that. Or

183
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.630
if I want to eat
at Chipotle every day, this

184
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.110
week, but it's a, but
when the money's gone, the

185
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.310
spending stops. Right. And that's
the trick, Right? So you

186
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.530
want to find an amount
that you're comfortable with that,

187
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.570
you know, you can take
your whole paycheck and make

188
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.280
an allowance if you want,
but that's not going to

189
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.990
work for you. Well, when
the bills come, so you

190
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.360
want to find an amount
that is appropriate for you

191
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.390
and your situation. And then
once it's gone do whatever

192
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.070
with it. And it's what
I like about it too,

193
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.100
is it's guilt-free because you
don't get to challenge me

194
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.020
then and say, why did
you spend your allowance on

195
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.300
that? It's at my discretion.
What I want to do

196
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.710
with it is what I
want to do with it.

197
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.780
Right. I can blow it
all at once. I can

198
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.390
keep it all. Now this
of course doesn't count for

199
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.270
big family things like buying
a couch or if we

200
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.640
decided as a family to
buy a DVD player or

201
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.820
something. Right. But I mean,
I went and bought some

202
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.070
shoes that were, you know,
maybe a little, a little

203
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.640
more expensive, my prerogative. Cause
I had the cash a

204
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.530
little while back. I did
buy an Xbox, but I

205
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.860
saved up. Right. Right. And,
and it's, it's just like

206
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.780
allowance when you were a
kid, but it's amazing. The

207
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.550
argument that you don't have.
I mean, I'll come in

208
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.010
to the house, to the
house and I'll see a

209
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.820
big pile of clothes that
you've bought from somewhere. But

210
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.100
I don't have to feel
bad. I don't have to

211
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.760
resent. I don't have to
worry or be suspicious. All

212
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.440
those complex emotions go away
because you get the same

213
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.290
allowance that I do. Right.
And you obviously, you, you

214
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.070
know, you don't have any
hidden credit cards. There's any

215
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.760
secret credit cards. So you
must have paid for it

216
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.090
with your allowance. Therefore I
can, I can focus on

217
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.620
the, Oh, this is a
nice outfit and this isn't

218
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.200
that great. Exactly. Exactly. And
not on the, who paid

219
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.750
for this and why did
this happen? Right. Right. And

220
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.110
to be clear the allowances
just for, for fun stuff,

221
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.050
as you said, so, you
know exactly. We're not paying

222
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.570
rent with allowance, you know,
we're not paying, getting fuel,

223
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.730
you know, the right for
the cars and all that

224
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.830
stuff. Yeah. And, and, and
the other, the other thing

225
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.570
is that when we are
in, in, in tight times

226
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.290
financially tight times, which has
happened, we'll lower the allowance

227
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.990
as a group. Right. We
might say, all right, well,

228
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.970
we're going to get 50
bucks instead of a hundred

229
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.940
bucks as a team. Right.
It's so important to, to

230
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.740
expectations and to not because
the goal here, as you

231
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.260
said at the very beginning
is to avoid resentment and

232
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.960
resentment appears to be the
number one thing that really

233
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.180
causes trouble in the marriage.
It's that festering resentment. Absolutely.

234
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.060
Absolutely. And I think, you
know, women, not to sort

235
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.250
of put women in a
box, but our memories are

236
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.890
so much better married to
a geek or not. I

237
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.260
stand by that statement. It
depends on what you're trying

238
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.050
to remember. The important stuff.
I think women remember the

239
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.460
important stuff and you know,
the internet movie database, who's

240
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.610
that guy, that's a useless
detail to remember, you know,

241
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.340
I'm going to remember how
long we've been married. You

242
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.190
know, I'm gonna remember the
kid's birthday anniversary. Yeah. You

243
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.280
know, and that type of
thing, but it is, it

244
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.220
is really resenting is such
a key thing. And so

245
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.770
there are moments, I think
when I've had to kind

246
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.400
of let stuff go, you've
said that, you know, 10

247
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.380
years into it, I've got
10 years of baggage review

248
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.350
that I remembered As a
person with no memory myself

249
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.890
speaking. It is such a
freeing. It's such a freeing

250
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.870
thing because you seriously remember
arguments that we had at

251
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.410
parties eight years ago, you
know, and you'll say something

252
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.280
like, you always do this.
And like, you know, 2002,

253
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.300
I did that once. I,
and I don't remember these

254
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.730
things. I don't remember last
Tuesday unless I have to

255
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.500
go and check my calendar,
right? Hi, this is Scott

256
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.110
Hanselman from another parallel universe,
got to tell you about

257
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.970
some of our things our
sponsors are doing. They make

258
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.900
this free podcast possible. If
you're developing a new line

259
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.390
of business application, you've probably
tried the latest version of

260
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.970
server light. Now you can
get even better results by

261
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.000
combining the functionality and server
light for beta, with some

262
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.890
of the richness or the
third party controls from our

263
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.490
friends at Tellerik, they're the
first vendors to offer native

264
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.530
support for the server light
for beta and their rad

265
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.440
controls. You've got a new
server light for CTP suite

266
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.200
of these controls. They let
you tap into the frameworks,

267
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.450
great potential. You got native
right mouse click and all

268
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.670
the new features of server
line. There's 38 controls that

269
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.420
give you all these features.

270
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.480
compelling line of business applications
right away. I encourage you

and rock supporting Hansel minutes

273
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.390
on their Facebook fan page
at facebook.com/tellerik. Now back to

274
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.000
the show, I'm just like
one of those, it's like

275
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.720
one of those movies with
Robin Williams or I'm living

276
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.020
in the moment and it's
exactly there is no past.

277
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.900
Yeah, Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But
I mean, so what, what

278
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.450
do you want to say
though, about resentment as a

279
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.410
tip? I mean, just obviously
Every system that we've come

280
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.650
up with avoids resentment, if
you build up frustration or

281
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.980
anger or resentment and resentment
is the perfect word for

282
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.830
describing this, then that's what
bites you later. Right? So

283
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.270
one of the other things
we wanted to avoid is

284
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.210
that since you took time
off of working outside the

285
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.810
home, and now you work
inside the home, you worked

286
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.860
in nonprofits for a number
of years, right? And now

287
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.430
you work in another kind
of nonprofit, which is taking

288
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.270
care of the boys. The
idea of having time for

289
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.570
yourself yeah. Became a big
problem. And this was actually,

290
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.520
we, we ended up doing
this for three years before

291
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.470
we actually, we just kind
of went through life for

292
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.480
three years before we came
up with this system. Right.

293
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.930
And I think it was
John Lamb who suggested this at

294
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.240
some point. And the idea
is Mommy and daddy day.

295
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.880
Okay, well, this isn't date
night though. What is mommy?

296
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.210
Day and daddy day. So
basically, I mean, I'm off

297
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.900
the clock. If you will,
at a certain point after

298
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.580
you get home from work,
you know, you're going to

299
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.590
handle, the kids are gonna
make them dinner. You're going

300
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.960
to put them down. You're
going to, you know, basically

301
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.790
you're the one that's responsible
for them. And I get

302
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.010
to just go out and
play. You relax, have a

303
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.320
good time, whatever I want
to do. So you literally

304
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.950
punch out, not literally, but
almost literally. You're like, okay,

305
00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.080
it's five Oh one at
six o'clock dad's home from,

306
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.590
from, from work. Right. And
you'll just say, okay, goodbye,

307
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.540
everybody. It's mommy day. And
all the kids were like,

308
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.300
Oh, it's mommy day. Yay.
Yeah. And you'll get in

309
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.560
the car and you'll disappear.
Right. And then you'll come

310
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.710
back, you know, 11 or
midnight or wherever. Right. And

311
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.650
you go to the movies
or you go drive, I've

312
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.110
seen you just drive towards
Seattle and then turn around

313
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.410
and drive back. Cause you
love driving. Yeah. And connect.

314
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.710
Yeah. Try, go. Shopping, connect
with friends, have coffee with

315
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.450
girlfriends. And what have you,
I mean, it's, it's a

316
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.480
fun time to, to connect
with people and to just

317
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.540
let, go and take a
break. Exactly. I love that.

318
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.480
And we alternate mommy and
daddy day. Right. So it's

319
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.920
every other, I think we're
doing a, we're doing it

320
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:29.230
Wednesdays or Thursdays every other
Wednesday. Say for example, it's

321
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.200
mommy day, last week. It's
daddy day. This week I

322
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.320
used my daddy days recently
to build my arcade machine.

323
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.630
John and I were, I
would go over there. Right.

324
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:43.030
And this is again, guilt-free
exactly. That's very important. Yeah.

325
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.280
Well, it's a win, win.
I mean, you know, I

326
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.380
tend to get tired right
up in with the kids

327
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.750
all day. And you know,
sometimes I get frustrated. I

328
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.850
mean, they're young, they're high
energy, you know, and it's

329
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.850
it's work. I'm going, going,
going. So it's great to

330
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.940
just let go and recharge
and not have to feel

331
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.370
bad about it. You know,
it's great because it doesn't

332
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.070
cost from a financial point
of view because you're watching

333
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.900
the kids. So we didn't
have the college, you know,

334
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.670
so you'll take care of
the kids. You'll feed them,

335
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.440
you put them down. And
I get to just go

336
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.020
and relax with my friends,
my sister, whoever I want

337
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.260
to see and, and, and
be okay with it. Because

338
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.780
when I come back, I'm
a better mole and a

339
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.030
better mom and a better
wife for it, you know?

340
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.860
So it's a win, win,
win for everybody. And it's

341
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.230
not just mommy day. It's
also daddy day. And this

342
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.830
is the understanding that each
of us works our nine

343
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.350
to five. Right. And this
is really difficult to say,

344
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.380
And clearly mommy's work more
than that, right? Yeah. Nine

345
00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.870
to five 30. Really nice.
No, but you know, there

346
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.940
has to be an understanding
that we are each working

347
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.530
full time. Right. And while
it might be easy for

348
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.110
me to say I'm working
harder cause I'm, you know,

349
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.760
deep in thought or whatever,
or you're working harder. Cause

350
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.490
you're having to physically lugged
the boys around the point

351
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.630
is though we're we're on.
Right. And the point of

352
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.930
mommy and daddy day is
to shut off. Exactly. Exactly.

353
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.900
Yeah. And we found that
the regularity of it really

354
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.980
helped because rather than making
it an ad hoc thing,

355
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.210
like, ah, can we make
Friday daddy day? Which you

356
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.770
never really know when they
are in their rent. It's

357
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:18.320
very randomizing. Right. We went
ahead and we scheduled it

358
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.300
and we said, you know,
every other soul, twice a

359
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.160
month, I get a kid
Mamatina twice a month to

360
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.370
get that day. And that,
that, you know, that consistency

361
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.050
is good for us, but
it's also good for the

362
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.500
kids too, because once they
know this is what happens,

363
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.300
it's not a big deal
anymore. So they can say,

364
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.850
where's mommy. And you can
say mommy on mommy day.

365
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.280
And it's like, Oh, okay.
You know, they understand. And

366
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.290
they don't, they don't fight
as much. Whereas I think

367
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.360
if it's a onesy twosy,
you know, once, once every

368
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.060
other month type of thing,
then they, they sort of

369
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.160
feel like, wait a minute,
you know, this, we don't

370
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.340
do this. This is not
typical for us. Exactly. And

371
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.570
actually recently now that the
boys are old enough to

372
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.170
understand this is extended into
an interesting thing where we

373
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.230
each take one child and
we split off and it's

374
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.820
like, there's a two year
old and a four year

375
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.470
old. So it's like two
day and four day and

376
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.000
you'll take the two and
I'll take the four and

377
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.480
then we'll swap and it'll
be totally focused. So they

378
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.020
know about kind of pampering,
I guess, would be the

379
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.460
word. I mean, this would
be the adult word, but

380
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.850
the idea is that it's
like, one-on-one time with the

381
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.950
child. So we ended up
doing that as well. So

382
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.080
we'll swap back and forth.
And I think I took,

383
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.360
I took the two year
old to see Elmo. And

384
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.430
then you took the four
year old to see a

385
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.240
play and one on one
time. Right? Yeah. It's hard

386
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.480
when you know, your parents
have, you know, multiple kids

387
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.610
just to find that one
on one connection time. Cause

388
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.780
it's, you know, there's two
of them, they're both talking

389
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.630
at the same time and
you want to be there

390
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.880
for both of them, but
it's a challenge. And so

391
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.100
that's really cool too, to
be able to do that

392
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.670
so I can focus on
the, on the Yeah, exactly.

393
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.970
Very good. Yeah. And then
the other thing, I mean,

394
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.760
related to that, you're having
kids and the challenges and

395
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.010
the joys of having kids
is this whole idea of

396
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.920
putting the marriage first. I
think again, if it's someone

397
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.110
that you came up with
Scott, that was really, really

398
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.420
very cool. This whole idea
that the marriage is a

399
00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.420
foundation and you build on
it. Okay. So if you

400
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.120
don't take care of the
marriage, everything else is just

401
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.970
gonna fall apart. I remember
when I suggested this, your

402
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.870
initial reaction was negative because
Scott is got the sound

403
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:16.310
of his stuffing. Scott, Scott,
you literally were like, no,

404
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.920
no, no, the children come
first, right? You're like, there's

405
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.470
no, the kids are first.
But if you put the

406
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.910
kids first where where's the
marriage, right? And while it's

407
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.530
easy to say, well, we'll
put this first. We'll put

408
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:28.880
that, you know, you want
to put yourself first and

409
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.530
then you wanna put your
kids for then next thing

410
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:34.040
you know, everything is first.
When you, when you rank

411
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.230
these things, you've got to
say with a good marriage

412
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.130
comes good. Parenting comes good.
Right. Exactly. And I think

413
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.560
once we sort of came
to a consensus on that,

414
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.540
which I will admit did
take me some time. It

415
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.190
then became very easy to,
to teach the kids that

416
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.090
whatever mommy and daddy say
it, we speak as one.

417
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.830
You know, that, that was
the other thing that we

418
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.200
do. We sell them, have
these kinds of fights where

419
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.610
the kids are sort of
caught in the middle because

420
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.400
mommy said yes. And then
daddy said, no, they understand

421
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.240
that if mommy says, no
daddy saying no to Right.

422
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.420
That the, that, that just
never happens. I remember doing

423
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.780
this on my own parents.
The idea of a dad

424
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.700
said, no, well, I won't
tell mom, the dad said

425
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.320
no. And I'll ask mom
I'm will say yes. And

426
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.910
then boom, I'm in having
a unified front. It actually

427
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.160
sits on top of all
of these other systems, which

428
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.790
are all based on the
same idea. Right. And that

429
00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:28.320
kind of comes down to,
it's almost sounds like we're

430
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.940
talking about a business here,
but I guess a marriage,

431
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.790
in some extent is a
business. You know, not having

432
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.840
secrets, information sharing, I guess,
you know, the two year

433
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.370
old or the four year
old wants something and says,

434
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:39.870
Hey, what are you, what
did, what did mommy say?

435
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.260
What did daddy say? They
never play as against each

436
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.680
other. At least not yet.
I'm sure there'll become a

437
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.100
try. They tried. Well, yeah.
What I'm saying, they never

438
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.250
succeed. Right. So at least
not yet. And all of

439
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:55.890
that is about sharing information.
Right? Right. Well, I think,

440
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.800
you know, again, it's about
trust ultimately, right? You, you

441
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.510
gotta trust the person that
you're married to and they've

442
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.670
got to know who you
are. So what, what is

443
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.730
there to hide? Right. Right.
Well, your wife or your,

444
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.540
your husband or your spouse,
isn't just your girlfriend that

445
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.030
you live with. I mean,
I think that I forget

446
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.400
who said it, but there
was, there's a big difference

447
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.670
between you're living, you're living
mate and your spouse. If

448
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.140
you hold that marriage thing
as being very sacrosanct, then

449
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.530
it's taking it to a
whole other level. Exactly. Exactly.

450
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.410
So, yeah. I mean, you,
you have access to, to

451
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.850
my email and, and you
know, I have access to

452
00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.420
your email. I think again,
that the communication, the conversation

453
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.010
we agreed right off the
bat that we would each

454
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.620
have, you know, we have
the common credit card and

455
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.480
then you have one other
and I have one other,

456
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.430
right. Cause if I want
a surprise, I don't necessarily

457
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.500
want you to see that
type of thing. But if

458
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.990
you have access to that,
even if you didn't up

459
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.690
The fact that like, for
example, that we have a

460
00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.170
shit, we have a password
manager that has all of

461
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.350
our passwords, mine and yours.
Right. And if a, if

462
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.790
a picture of me with,
I'm just brainstorming here, there's

463
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.760
nothing I need to tell
you though. It's the picture

464
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.150
of that. I'm just, you
know, there was this time

465
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.640
in Vegas. I have a
picture of me with someone

466
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.180
shows up on Facebook and,
and you say, who the

467
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.160
heck is this? Right? And
I say, well, that was

468
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.310
me eight years ago, or
before we were married or

469
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.450
that was at this party.
There's no, there's no secrets

470
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.060
in that respect. There's no
need to say, Oh, well,

471
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.560
you know, we were at
a party and we, this

472
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.870
was one of the, the
marketing people and we took

473
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.300
pictures and it doesn't have
to be a sense of

474
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.560
something sneaky going on because
there's no, there's no accounts

475
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.110
that you don't have access
to. Right. I mean, again,

476
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.300
trust, right. You know, if
you don't have that, then

477
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.920
you don't really have a
marriage. Exactly. I mean, you

478
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.980
travel, you know, this year
traveled a fair bit. I

479
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.990
mean, you've been all over.
It's been a rough year.

480
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.570
You're in China, you're in
Australia. I mean, you've, you've

481
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.060
been traveling and again, trust
is going to be an

482
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.970
important thing there, but yeah.
It's trust communication. Yep. And

483
00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.650
that comes down to, to
setting expectations. Cause when I'm

484
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.290
on the road, there's always
that argument of like, well,

485
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.960
how much did you check
in? So we made a

486
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.420
couple of agreements when we,
and again, setting expectations, setting

487
00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.570
expectations. It's amazing how setting
expectations works in business. It

488
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.180
works in life. It works
in relationships with kids. It's

489
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.890
everything. The boys go down
at us. They go to

490
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.800
sleep at a certain time.
Right. So the expectation was

491
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.290
that I will communicate with
you in some way before

492
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.970
the boys go down, no
matter what time zone I'm

493
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.010
in to let you know
whether or not I've, we're

494
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.900
going to have a Skype
call, right. I'll be able

495
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.180
to talk with the boys.
Right. And if, if I'm

496
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.650
on a train or I
can't make it, at least

497
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.660
I can get an SMS,
a text message to you

498
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.850
to say, not going to
make it tonight. Let me

499
00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.080
talk to the boys on
the phone or whatever. Exactly.

500
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.270
And I set the whole
system up. So you don't

501
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.640
have to worry about the
Skype and it just works.

502
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.110
Right? Exactly. Absolutely. And actually,
and speaking of, of, of

503
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.710
phone calls, when I call
you and the boys are

504
00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.800
being wacky or whatever in
the background, you had this,

505
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.470
you had this tendency to
hang up on, not hang

506
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.860
up, like click, but like
I'm going to go click.

507
00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.540
And that really bothered me.
What was that about you,

508
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.300
you would be talking and
I'm, you know, I'm forgetting

509
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.980
that you're at the store
or that the boys are,

510
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.780
I dunno, swinging off the
chandelier's or whatever. And, and

511
00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.010
then you would just have
to go and then you

512
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.220
would click. But at the
same time I'd be talking

513
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.500
to you and then somebody
would call it. Maybe Scott

514
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.410
GU would call on the
phone, the other line. And

515
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.260
then I, I need to
switch over quickly. Right. But

516
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.710
in a graceful way. But
there isn't time in these

517
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.840
situations for you to like,
you know, if there's a

518
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.870
child about the vault off
the top of the refrigerator

519
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.960
and you can't exactly explain
that you just need. So

520
00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.960
I would be frustrated and
resentful that I would get

521
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.670
hung up on. And you
would be frustrated that you

522
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.850
would get hung up on.
So we basically came up

523
00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.940
with an expectation. It wasn't
really a system or anything

524
00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.460
you just said one day,
he said, listen, you actually

525
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.550
were pretty funny. Cause you
were, you basically like looked

526
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.990
at me like a child
and you were like, okay,

527
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.690
if I hang up on
you, we're probably not getting

528
00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:03.010
a divorce. Well, I mean,
I think you took it

529
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.220
very personal. Right. But it's
just hanging up on. Someone's

530
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.560
very personal. But if I
can explain my side of

531
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:14.260
it. Right, exactly. That's right.
Yeah. So what was the,

532
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.610
what was the story and
how do we, how do

533
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.540
we fix that? I think
again, expectations, you know, if

534
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.080
you assume that it is
not my goal to offend

535
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.720
you. Okay. It's not my
goal to just hang up

536
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.880
on you willingly. If you
assume that this is my

537
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.850
wife who loves me, there's
a reason, a compelling reason

538
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.950
for her to do this.
We all else will be

539
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.400
okay. So if I'm sitting
there and I'm watching the

540
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.680
four year old, you know,
for whatever reason, he's managed

541
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.330
to climb on top of
something, as you said on

542
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.340
the chandelier and he's going
to jump down, we don't

543
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.550
have shadow layers. If let's
just imagine The world where

544
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.950
we did. Oh, to be
so fortunate, I could see

545
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.670
him on the kitchen counter
though. Right? Right. He's managed

546
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.560
to climb up there and
then he's, he's, you know,

547
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.540
trying to leave off of
it or whatever. Cause his

548
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.340
brother's standing at the bottom
saying, I'll catch you. I'll

549
00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.050
catch you. And he thinks
the two year old can

550
00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.690
actually catch him Or, or
a Wednesday, which is what

551
00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.060
we would call that. That'd
be The regular Wednesday at

552
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.240
the Hanselman household. Right. Right.
But, but, and you call

553
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.460
it that moment. I have
a couple of choices either.

554
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.320
I just don't pick up
the phone. But because it's

555
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.480
you, that was another agreement
we had that. Especially if

556
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.040
you're on the road, if
you call me, I will

557
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.320
pick up. But I don't
really have the full time

558
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.060
to sort of say, Hey
honey, how's it going? Listen,

559
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.190
hold on the four year
olds about to leave, leave

560
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.340
off the contract. Exactly. So
I would say to you,

561
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.090
I can't talk. I gotta
go quick. Exactly. That's okay.

562
00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.520
No, but it wasn't cause
you, you want it. You

563
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.080
want it to know, well,
why do you have to

564
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.690
go explain it to me,
justify it to me. You

565
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.330
know? It's like, I don't
have the time rushed that

566
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.490
I want to talk to
you. Trust. That is a

567
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.330
compelling reason I can do
this moment. Right. So it

568
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.150
seems like a silly thing,
but the assumption is, assume

569
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.280
that this is your wife.
I assume she doesn't hate

570
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.070
your guts. And she will
probably call you back. Right.

571
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.800
So I've had situations where
I've called and it's been

572
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.670
like, you know, ring, ring,
I'll call right back. Right.

573
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.280
And that was it, which
means that, you know, something's

574
00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.060
on fire or someone's on
fire and you will call

575
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.670
me when the, they have
been extinguished and inevitably you

576
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.300
do. And the same thing
applies with work stuff. And

577
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.130
I think once you manage
to see from your point

578
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.050
of view of saying, yeah,
you know, when, when my

579
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.080
boss's boss is calling, you
know, I need to go

580
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.280
and I may not be
able to tell you y'all

581
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.870
he's calling. Cause he wants
to schedule a meeting or

582
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:22.400
whatever. Exactly. Yep. And, and
kind of wrapping it all

583
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.340
up. This whole set of
things there, we had a

584
00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.740
mission statement. What is it
that we care about? What

585
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.880
is our marriage? What is
our goal from a life

586
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.400
perspective planning, I'm a free
people, drama free. You can

587
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.890
borrow this. You're going to,
you're going to make t-shirts.

588
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.410
We came up with an
allowance system. We put the

589
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.740
money in one pile. We
pay ourselves first and we

590
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.440
drink the allowance or raise
the allowance based on how

591
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.340
we're doing financially. But the
point is that the administrivia

592
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.970
the minutia of life, the
personal, you know, buy a

593
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.310
book or paperback. We don't
use debit cards for the

594
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.200
one side cash has gone.
It's gone. Right? So to

595
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.530
be clear, we're not buying
a novel with cash. We're

596
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.660
doing it. We're not buying
a novel with a debit

597
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:09.560
card. If you buy candy,
soda, pop, whatever pants, candy

598
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.720
sort of puppet pants. Those
are the license for the

599
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:18.620
household pants for all mommy
and daddy day, right beside

600
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.260
just as you pay each
other for your allowance, you

601
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.510
need to set aside, pay
each other in time. Exactly.

602
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.060
Need a break. You deserve
it, enjoy it, come back

603
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.970
better for it. Now It's
not just date night. We

604
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.570
might have date night where
mommy and daddy go out

605
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.210
and do stuff. But this
is more about having mommy

606
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.570
and daddy have time away
from the family, right. Protracted

607
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.180
time. Right. And even a
couple of times we've had

608
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.430
where you, you know, you
go off and use some

609
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.480
of my, my miles, my
airline miles hang out for

610
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.800
three or four days just
so you can decompress trying

611
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.930
to have a unified front
right in front of the

612
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.410
children. And then for us,
we found it really, that

613
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.990
it works for us to
share passwords and share, you

614
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.030
know, you're logging into my
email and I'm logging into

615
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.970
your email and we know
where this one is. Yeah.

616
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.730
Yeah. I mean, I never
had any problem. It's hard

617
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.070
to keep secrets for birthday
parties. Yeah. Yeah. And again,

618
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.470
if the communication is there,
I hardly ever really feel

619
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.450
the need to go into
email account, you know? Cause

620
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.020
Well, there was a time
we were in the middle

621
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.550
of selling a house and
you were looking at my

622
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.010
email, you know, a couple
of weeks ago. And then

623
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.390
there was a time when
you were trying to plan

624
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.390
something for, for a surprise
party and you just said,

625
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.160
your birthday is coming up,
stay out of my email

626
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.350
for the next couple of
weeks. These are easily solved.

627
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.430
And then setting expectations for
being on the road. When,

628
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.780
when are you going to
call, how long are we

629
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.540
going to call? Not having
those days or laws or

630
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.710
hours go by without communication.
Right. Right. And wondering is

631
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.930
he Yeah. I said, okay,
are the kids okay? Yeah,

632
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.930
exactly. And then we had,
we had one problem, the

633
00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.270
hang up problem. This is
just an example you may

634
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.660
have, you may have some
other problem, but if you

635
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.750
set expectation for it, it's
amazing how these, these seemingly

636
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.240
large problems just go away.
Yeah. And a lot of

637
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.840
it is, you know, love
the person, right. And trust

638
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.140
that they are not out
to hurt you and the

639
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.870
rest just sort of will
fall away in time. Why

640
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:12.360
do you think that these
things, these tips work with

641
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.060
geeks, why are these things
Keke specific? Is it because

642
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.000
of our personality types or
do you think this is

643
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.170
going to be more than,
and maybe this is just

644
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:22.080
relationship tips. Maybe it's not
geek specific. Why do these

645
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.540
work so well for us,
These particular things worked for

646
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.790
us. I think, cause you're
you're you are a geek,

647
00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.640
but I mean, I could
see it where similar things,

648
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.840
maybe not necessarily in this
specific format, but the concept

649
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.120
is good for all relationships.
I think this is important

650
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.370
stuff you want to have
regardless of who you are

651
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.190
and who you're married to.
These particular ones just happened

652
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.770
to work for us because
you're such a weirdo, but

653
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.560
we've come to love you
as you are. Well, I

654
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.650
think the point is though
to realize how each person

655
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:54.270
thinks and set up a
system that doesn't necessarily cater

656
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.280
too much to their personality
types. But at least as

657
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.860
a realization that we have,
we have these differences that,

658
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.490
that these things matter like
that, the hangups thing, you

659
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:04.650
had no idea that I
was taking the hangups personally.

660
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.650
Right. But once that came
out, I was like, all

661
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.540
right, well let's just come
up with a basic system.

662
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.900
Not complicated. None of these
systems involve charts or graphs.

663
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.350
I mean, nothing here involves
big old calendars or complexity.

664
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.560
Yeah. I mean the truth
is any, any relationship is

665
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.290
going to be work to
a certain extent. Right. So

666
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.080
be willing to invest in
it, be willing to commit

667
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.720
to it, you know? And
when, once you say this,

668
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.330
this is important to me,
then this will go a

669
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:34.830
long way towards helping you.
That's good. Thank you. Alright,

670
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.580
let's go to the beach.
This has been another episode

671
00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.530
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
