Hansel minutes. Oh, weekly discussion

2
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.470
with web developer and technologist
Scott Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan

episode, Scott talks with software

7
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.250
tester, James Bach. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman, and this

8
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.230
is another episode of Hansel
minutes, and I'm still in

9
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.690
Sweden here at aura dev
in Malmo, Sweden. And I've

10
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.660
got the opportunity to sit
down with James Bach. James,

11
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.580
you may have heard his
name. He is a consulting

12
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.770
software tester and the author
of two books and a

13
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.560
contributed to a number of
books. He wrote lessons learned

14
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.590
in software testing, and most
recently wrote secrets of a

15
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.560
Buccaneer scholar. Thank you, sir,
for sitting down with me

16
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.200
today. Glad to be here.
So secrets of a Buccaneer

17
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.780
scholar, that doesn't seem as
clear to me as the

18
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.390
title lessons learned in software
testing. I think I know

19
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.800
what I'm going to get
from one of the books.

20
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.380
What am I going to
get from a Buccaneer scholar

21
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.720
book with a hyphen in
between buck and Aaron scholar?

22
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.550
Well, it's about a, an
aggressive sort of self-education that

23
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.310
I've been involved with since
I dropped out of high

24
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.130
school back in 1982, and
it's basically the secret to

25
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.030
whatever success I have in
this industry. And I wanted

26
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.960
to tell people about this
methodology I use so backup,

27
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.670
you dropped out of high
school and you never went

28
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.110
back. You don't have a
GED, you don't have a

29
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.880
GED. I have no formal
education past the past 10th

30
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.280
grade. It does not just
mean you have natural software

31
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.690
talent. Well, what happened? I
guess like a lot of

32
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.160
kids, my father bought me
an Apple two computer when

33
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.790
just before I was kicked
out of home when I

34
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.640
was 14 and I went
to live in a motel

35
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.120
room with my computer and
I spent a lot of

36
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.380
time skipping school and learning
how to program and learning

37
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.560
how to program an assembly
language. And so by the

38
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.950
time that I dropped out
of school, I went almost

39
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.240
immediately into being a video
game programmer. Really? So when

40
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.520
did you, you moved out
at 14. When did you

41
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.040
finally give up on school
at 16? As soon as

42
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.470
it was legal for me
to do so, although actually

43
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.780
it was my father's idea.
He, I was trying to

44
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.670
get them to let me
skip a grade, even though

45
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.800
I was failing every class
and he, and he said,

46
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.000
why didn't you just leave?
And I said, I'm allowed

47
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.520
to do that. Why didn't
realize I'm gonna raise my

48
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.190
sights? And he told me
something, which at the time

49
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.850
I didn't think was serious.
He said, you should just

50
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.390
take care of your own
education and not, not expect

51
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.000
anyone else to do it.
And I thought, well, that's

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.400
weird. What does that mean?
Take care of you in

53
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.400
education? Because at that time,
like so many people in

54
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.700
the, around the world, in
the industrialized world, I thought

55
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.850
of education as equal to
schooling. I thought of it

56
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.510
is exactly the same thing.
Of course, since then I

57
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.930
realized that education is a
vast thing and schooling is

58
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.890
a relatively narrow thing. And
I have been taking care

59
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.200
of my education, but to
do that, I had to

60
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.950
develop methods of doing that,
that allow me to deal

61
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.450
with my particular disabilities. And
do you think that you,

62
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.180
I mean, do you use
the word so I'll, I'll

63
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.460
continue that, do you think
you have a disability as

64
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.550
around, around either a learning
disability or a school specific

65
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.410
disability? I have no self
discipline. I basically, I maybe

66
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.070
have a little bit of
it. I might have traces

67
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.650
of it, but I basically,
unlike a lot of people,

68
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.550
I seem to have no
ability to learn things. When

69
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.210
other people tell me I
have to, or to do

70
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.670
things. One of the people
tell me I have to

71
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.890
above basic safety type things.
My teachers would say, you

72
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.950
should read this and I'd
go, ah, Well, isn't that

73
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.110
just disdain for authority? Is
that sit in that separate

74
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.050
from an ability? I think
that's what I mean, inability

75
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.950
is not unwillingness. Well, I
seem to not be able

76
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.560
to overcome Comment even when
it would be in my

77
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.130
best economic interests to do
so. So that's where it,

78
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.640
it moves into kind of
a disability. I don't think

79
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.490
of it as a big
time disability. It's just, it's

80
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.030
a, it's an attribute of
me that I've had to

81
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.820
learn to work with. And
when I realized it was

82
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.720
very, very serious was when
I was 12. And I

83
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.300
had been going through this
war with the school authorities

84
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.550
about hallmark. I refuse to
do homework because of the

85
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.700
13th amendment to the constitution,
which says there shall be

86
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.050
no slavery in the United States.
And I looked at that

87
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.730
and I said, that means
I don't have to do

88
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.860
homework. And they said that
that's, that's not what it

89
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.170
means. And I'm like, I'm
reading it. And it says,

90
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.550
involuntary servitude, this is involuntary
servitude. I have not been

91
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.130
convicted of a crime. It
says, unless you've been convicted

92
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.160
of a crime. So we
had this big fight and

93
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.560
they use all kinds of
psychology tactics to try to

94
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.290
break me down. And the
thing is that the psychology

95
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.240
tactics worked eventually I was
crushed. I was Crushed emotionally.

96
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.130
It was terribly depressed while
you're 12. I mean, it's

97
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.420
not an adult. Oh yeah,
it was absolutely. I was

98
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.940
so many things happen to
me when I was 12

99
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.090
that basically defined my seem
to define my life later

100
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.920
on. And so I defined,
I said, okay, I'll do

101
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.130
it. I will do the
homework I give up. And

102
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.760
then I discovered a horrifying
thing when I discovered it.

103
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.400
It was, I mean, it
was, I think horrifying is

104
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.980
the right word. My mind
was still on strike, even

105
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.310
though my executive will was
saying, let's do the homework.

106
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.380
My would, would refuse to
read anything on the page.

107
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.510
So I would try to
read on the page and

108
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.330
it would instantly disappear from
my mind as if I

109
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.320
had some sort of short
term memory disability. And I

110
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.720
tried again and I tried
again. And finally I realized

111
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.930
I couldn't force my mind
to work on things that

112
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.920
it, for whatever secret reasons
of its own didn't want

113
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.130
to think about. And up
until that moment in my

114
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.920
life, I assumed that I
was of one mind that

115
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.080
I get to choose what
I do. And it's all,

116
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.900
we all work together, all
the little neurons. And I

117
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.800
realized that I actually have
several different identity centers or

118
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.850
something. And so ever since
then, I've learned that I

119
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.650
have to treat my thinking
mind, like a pet tiger.

120
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.230
And if I don't treat
it right, it runs off

121
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.440
into the forest. And that
indeed several times in my

122
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.410
career, before I figured out
how to do this, I

123
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.120
experienced a deep burnout. Once
I experienced such a burnout

124
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.510
that I was not able
to read any email, I

125
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.450
got email phobia. And another
time I got such a

126
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.420
deep burnout that I would
be physically sick if I

127
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.910
sat down on a keyboard
and all of these were

128
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.690
from trying to push myself
so hard. And what I

129
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.600
had to learn is to
pace myself and a big

130
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.840
part of growing up for
me in my thirties was

131
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.530
learning how learning, what my
limitations were learning, how not,

132
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.990
what the signs are when
my brain is trying to

133
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.530
say, no, I don't want
to do that anymore. And

134
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.660
what that's meant is is
that I've had to do

135
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.820
all kinds, kinds of innovative
things, innovative to people from

136
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.140
the outside. But I know
that they look innovative because

137
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.190
I've gotten good at featuring
what I can't help, but

138
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.070
do anyway. So for instance,
I read the five books

139
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.740
on Darwin a couple of
months ago. I wasn't supposed

140
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.510
to read five books on
Darwin. I was supposed to

141
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.750
be doing something else, but
I was interested in reading

142
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.290
about Darwin. So I just
got absorbed. And ever since

143
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.930
then, I've been trying to
find connections between Darwin and

144
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.840
testing so that I can
teach my testing classes and

145
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.980
people can go how inventive
he's related, the Darwin and

146
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.930
the, and his approaches to
analysis and experimentation to software

147
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.540
testing. What an innovative thing
to do is is that

148
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.410
innovative or is that artificially
innovative? Well, I, what I'm

149
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.140
saying is it is kind
of artificially innovative. It's something

150
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.450
I couldn't help, but do.
And so I'm trying to

151
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.230
find a way to make
it useful, make it productive

152
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.920
time, make it productive time.
Retrospectively. I did that in

153
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.950
my talk today. I, I
did some playing around with

154
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.160
things that I didn't need
to learn a year ago

155
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.960
and learned about something called
a simulated annealing. And then

156
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.810
last night at 3:00 AM, I
realized that what I'd learned

157
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.470
about simulated annealing exactly fit
into a point I wanted

158
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.370
to make about efficiency and
software testing. And so I

159
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.580
was able to take that
stuff that I had done.

160
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.250
That was a waste of
my time a year ago.

161
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.200
And now retrospectively, it's not,
That's interesting. I might get

162
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.940
nailed by my readers on
this because whenever I try

163
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.970
to use my own, you
know, try to Google my

164
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.790
own brain here, but it
wasn't, it wasn't Richard Fineman

165
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.160
that wrote a book called
consilience. That was all about

166
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.650
how I don't think it
was five minute. I think

167
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.870
it's no different guy I'm
familiar with the book. Can

168
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.470
the idea is that there
is, there are silos of

169
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.560
knowledge. There's your sociology class
and there's your geography class

170
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.110
and there's your anthropology class.
And to look at them

171
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.310
in that way kind of
conditions the mind not to

172
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.450
make those connections between them
as being completely related. The

173
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.710
idea that everything is truly
and completely it, I don't

174
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.260
think you're right. It's not
Fineman, but I think the

175
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.750
book was called consilience. And
the idea was that you

176
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.270
need to have a much
more holistic view of the

177
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.210
entire world, as all things
are just, you know, there

178
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.220
are patterns that are valuable
to be looking for and

179
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.470
that, you know, all true
innovation comes from recognition of

180
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.820
those patterns. I think so,
Or I think enough of

181
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.010
it is true that I
can make use of it.

182
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:04.250
And therefore about seven, eight
years ago, I was making

183
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.640
an argument about some, some
new test technique I was

184
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.620
playing with, with my, my
friend who has two doctorates

185
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.390
Kim caner. Who's a professor
at Florida tech. And he

186
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.970
said, well, that's obvious to
you, James, because you have

187
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.860
an unconventional education, but most
people wouldn't, wouldn't be interested

188
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.070
in that. And I said,
well, that's interesting. Maybe I

189
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.640
should write a book about
that. Yeah. I, original title

190
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.540
was a YouTube can get
an unconventional education, or it's

191
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.780
not too late to have
an unconventional education. And I've

192
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:43.100
began to explore things like
what you just mentioned, which

193
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.350
is not to say that
a conventional education is a

194
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.420
useless thing, but I was
trying to think, what are

195
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.260
the advantages of an unconventional
education that a conventionally educated

196
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.310
person might benefit from as
well, and maybe make themselves

197
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.090
more powerful? So actually I've
been writing this book for

198
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.620
26 years and in different
forms and that most recent

199
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.320
attempt starting about seven years
ago was the one that

200
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.440
developed into the final version
that I ended up We're

201
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.110
publishing. Now it's interesting. I,
I listened to an episode

202
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.270
of fresh air, recently, a
fresh air. If for those

203
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.510
of you who are international
listeners is an interview show

204
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.910
a lot like this, that's
got a much wider reach

205
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.350
and talks to a lot
of different kinds of people.

206
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.840
And one of the people
on the show was a

207
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.180
high school educated per I
think he was a plumber.

208
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.540
And he, he started playing
with particle physics and string

209
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.170
theory, and basically decided that
equals MC squared was wrong

210
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.480
and wrote the whole thing
up. And he went on

211
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.620
this very quick Sadik quest
to determine that with his

212
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.060
unconventional education, that, that, that
all of basically all of

213
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.630
modern physics was wrong at
this fundamental point. And on

214
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.820
the show that basically they
took him around to different

215
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.980
professors and they introduced him
around and it became clear

216
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.910
that he was just wrong,
but he wouldn't accept it.

217
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.870
When you, when you have
an unconventional education, how do

218
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.100
you know when you are
just wrong because of some

219
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.770
missing bit of knowledge, versus
being able to actually go

220
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.370
and fill that gap in
your, in your brain. How

221
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.440
do you know that when
you have a conventional education?

222
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:15.060
I don't think anybody knows
that Or a sociologic societal

223
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.110
inertia, perhaps. I mean That
doesn't tell me if I'm

224
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.480
right or wrong. If everyone
believes it, or if, if

225
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.580
no one believes it and
that has nothing to do

226
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.830
with, I mean, you have
to do every single experiment.

227
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.910
I mean, you have to
go in like, you know,

228
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.220
rub the two balloons together
to make sure static electricity

229
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.050
works the way you think
it does. I mean, that

230
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.240
would mean you'd have to
spend the next, If I

231
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.620
wanted to have a deep
understanding of a static electricity

232
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.010
than I would, I would
reproduce a fair day's experiments.

233
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.730
And I would benefit from
doing that. However, when I

234
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.760
say that I have an
unconventional education, that doesn't mean

235
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.390
that I don't read, or
I don't, I don't learn.

236
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.280
I mean, I learn, I
learn from all kinds of

237
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.970
sources. What I mean by
that is that I don't

238
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.990
accept anyone. Else's affordably. That's
where the Buccaneer and Buccaneer

239
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.680
scholar comes from. I don't
accept anyone else's authority over

240
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.510
my education. I definitely use
all kinds of resources. In

241
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.200
fact, in 1990, I hired
a, a history professor from

242
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.490
San Jose state to push
me through some history stuff

243
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.860
that I was having trouble
getting myself to go through.

244
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.950
And so I paid him
$45 an hour to sit

245
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.620
in a coffee shop and
listened to me talk about

246
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.400
the thing that he suggested
that I read. And because

247
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.800
he worked for me and
because I didn't want to

248
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.520
waste my $45, I did
the reading. You hired a

249
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.460
personal trainer. I hired a
personal trainer in history. That's

250
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.010
exactly right. And he told
me at the time, he

251
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.990
said, Oh, you should go
to San Jose state. We've

252
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.810
got a two years humanities
program. And I said, well,

253
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.400
I don't want to do
that. And he said, Oh

254
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.650
no, it's just for you.
You would love it. And

255
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.140
I'm like, okay, I guess
so. I mean, if you're

256
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.860
doing it, I guess so,
see, I'm not against the

257
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.540
concept of schooling. I'm against
the concept of school, removing

258
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.830
your ownership of your own
energy. Hey everybody, this is

259
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.500
Scott coming at you from
another place in time. No

260
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.050
doubt. You'll probably bump into
testing tasks now, and then,

261
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.780
and your work and, you
know, writing functional tests is

262
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.760
probably not your favorite thing.
It's kind of difficult. It

263
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.610
takes time and the results
can be dubious. Well, get

264
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.460
ready to start liking tests.
Thanks to Tellerik with the,

265
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.480
the new web testing framework.
Building web automation test is

266
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.320
a breeze. You've got code
automation with advanced asp.net Ajax

267
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.540
and several light applications. You
can write a single test,

268
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.470
have it executed against multiple
browsers at once. You'd benefit

269
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.530
from a rich API there's
link support integration with visual

270
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.880
studio, unit testing, also end
unit X unit and MBE

271
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.130
unit, not to mention the
free rappers for Telerik rad

272
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.370
controls for ESPN and Ajax,
and several light, all shipping

273
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.790
with Telerik's new testing tool.
One of the best features,

274
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.870
the testing framework, which is
developed by art of test

275
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.340
is it's absolutely free. Freddie
got hooked on web testing

276
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.580
framework, start using it right
away, go to tellerik.com for

277
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.660
more info. Thanks a lot.
This, this makes me, I've

278
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.520
got two young kids, and
this makes me think about

279
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.920
the difference between conventional education
and what they call Montessori

280
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.690
education. Kind of letting the
child to be a little

281
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.510
more self directed. Have you
done Montessori? I haven't. We've

282
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.270
just visited the schools. I
have friends that swear by

283
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.580
it, but it makes me
feel like some people learn

284
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.770
some ways and some people
don't. I mean, some kids

285
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.530
thrive in a Montessori school.
Some kids thrive just fine.

286
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.190
I absolutely know what it's
like a game. And some

287
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.050
people are just good at
some games and not so

288
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.870
good at others. I'm very
good at taking tests. That's

289
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.650
a game. I was always,
I just enjoyed being tested

290
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.370
and I like sitting down
and taking the quiz. Other

291
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.580
people are very upset and
tense when they take tests.

292
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.370
And otherwise they're, That's funny.
When I was, when I

293
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.620
went into my college, what
do you call it? The

294
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.540
person, the counselor, the college
counselor. So I'm in high

295
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.690
school, I've taken the SATs.
And then the college counselor

296
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:56.560
says your sat scores and
your grades are not congruent.

297
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.780
Right? You have these low
grades and this high sat

298
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.630
score you've been hanging out
for the last four years.

299
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.210
And of course, they always
say this with some disdain,

300
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.590
like, what are you, what
are you doing? Well, I'm

301
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.050
having a fear, an underachiever.
I'm having a great time.

302
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.850
Well, I obviously, I'm not
an underachiever. I have the

303
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.710
test scores that show that
I'm at least good at

304
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.410
taking tests. So I got
that going for me. So

305
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.780
it sounds like you were
probably flunking out of classes

306
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.850
and not doing your homework,
but when they tested you,

307
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.590
you were doing fine. She
got in a physical fight

308
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.020
with one of my teachers
who was so offended that

309
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.600
I wouldn't show up to
his class. And I, I

310
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.730
was a troublesome child. That's
for sure. But what I

311
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.060
didn't understand at the time,
but was true at the

312
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.290
time is that if a
teacher approached me with respect,

313
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.890
they would own me. They
couldn't get me to do

314
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.830
anything. They wanted me to
do. There was a teacher

315
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.530
who she was a substitute
teacher and she also was

316
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.370
the sort of the police
woman of the bouncer of

317
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.740
study hall. And she had
a bad reputation of being

318
00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.490
always upset and angry. And
somehow she decided I was

319
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.190
okay. And she asked me
to do the sound of

320
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.340
this for the school play.
And I still remember that

321
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.620
to this day because it
was a very first time.

322
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:13.150
It dawned on me that
I could organize my thoughts

323
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.990
and complete a project. And
she got me to do

324
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.900
that by asking me nicely.
And I felt like I

325
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.110
wanted to perform for her
and other teachers would, if

326
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.910
I didn't do just what
they said, or if I

327
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.370
bucked them in any way
or thought critically about what

328
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.470
they were saying, they would
say, well, you have to

329
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.170
do this. And I'd say,
screw you. No, I don't.

330
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.060
You watch me, you know,
I'm, won't even show up

331
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.090
to your class or I'll
intentionally fail the test that

332
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.910
you give me how about
that? And they would do,

333
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.550
they would just go nuts.
They, they, they thought I

334
00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.060
was this incorrigible youth. And
even, I didn't understand at

335
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.090
the time why some teachers,
I would do things for

336
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.050
and other teachers. I wouldn't,
I certainly could have stayed

337
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.420
in school and gone to
school in different ways. If

338
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.400
I had been exposed to
the right kinds of adults

339
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.240
who led me along. And
in fact, although I described

340
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.750
myself as self-educated, it's more
accurate to say, I mentor

341
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.460
educated. My first boss at
the video game company taught

342
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.040
me to drive, got me
to learn, to play the

343
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.030
harmonica. We would jog together.
He taught me all about

344
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.720
professional coding and why, why
you can't have little flickers

345
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.630
and nasty looking stuff on
the screen. I said, Oh,

346
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.700
they can hardly see that
flicker. And he said, do

347
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.230
it over. And he brought
all this, this my first

348
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.760
sense of what professionalism was
to me. And so he

349
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.710
was a big part of
my education. My first boss

350
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.880
at Apple taught me tremendous
things about professionalism above and

351
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.760
beyond that. I wish I
could find this guy. If

352
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.070
you're out there. Chris Brown,
who was leader of the

353
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.890
development systems quality group in
1987, contact me. It sounds

354
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.760
like you have almost a
respect driven educator. That's what

355
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.770
it is. It's re I,
you know what it is.

356
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.120
And this is what I
wrote about in the book.

357
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.050
I don't have, self-discipline so
much. What I operate on

358
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.410
is passion. I operate on
heart it's feelings. It's the

359
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.980
feeling that my work is
being is needed by somebody

360
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.940
that drives me forward. And
any time I find myself

361
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.660
in a situation that I
don't feel needed, my motivation

362
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.410
completely collapses. And that's one
reason why I'm an independent.

363
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.800
I worked for other companies
for years, but for the

364
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.500
last 10 years, I work
for myself and I wait

365
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.440
for clients to come to
me who say, James Bach,

366
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.470
we've read your stuff. We've
seen what you do. We

367
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.370
want what you do. And
then I go, yes. And

368
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.590
I'm ready to be super
motive Waiting for them. So,

369
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.560
so how can those things
that are clearly working for

370
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.930
you be applied to other
people? I'm giving an example.

371
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.960
I was, I was driven
over here from the hotel

372
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.270
by a very nice young
man. And I was chatting

373
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.620
him up in the car
and I said, so what

374
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.790
do you do? And he
says, well, I'm a software

375
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.710
engineer. Oh, really? What, where
do you work? Well, I'm

376
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.740
unemployed right now. I'm driving
this car. And he said,

377
00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.450
well, if I can't get
a job, but my next

378
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.550
summer, I'm going to go
back and get my master's

379
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.450
degree. And I hear that
kind of constantly where it's

380
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.310
like, I'm going to just
peek my head out from

381
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.530
school for a moment. If
I can't get a job,

382
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.610
then I'm gonna duck down
again and try again. Cause

383
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.800
look what they're doing. When
you say I'm going to

384
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.920
get a master's degree. All
you're basically saying is I

385
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.680
want to now compete with
a slightly smaller, huge group

386
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.830
of people who are identical
to me, instead of saying,

387
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:33.080
how can I feature myself
as someone unique? And here's

388
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.860
the thing. When I became
a tester at Apple computer,

389
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.770
I hadn't heard of testing
before that. I did, I

390
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.410
did my own testing, right,
as a developer. So I

391
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.720
thought I knew about testing
and I'd never studied it.

392
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.670
And I realized I needed
to study and I studied

393
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.450
really hard. And I started
feeling like I was kind

394
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.160
of good at it. And
I looked around to four

395
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.890
or 400 other testers at
Apple computer in the group

396
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.890
at the time. And I
realized, I seem to be

397
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.770
only one of about a
dozen people who were even

398
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.880
trying to study this subject.
And I realized that maybe

399
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.670
all these other people that
all had college degrees thought

400
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:13.150
that their education was done
and I felt mine wasn't

401
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.270
done. So I was able
to just sing by them.

402
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.690
Now, why was I interested
in doing this? And they

403
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.260
weren't. I think maybe I
had fallen into testing as

404
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.340
something that happens to really
fit what I love, how

405
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.920
I love to think. It
just naturally fits my kind

406
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.290
of my complainy lateral thinking,
critical thinking type of personality.

407
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.900
I'm always trying to think
of a, of an exception

408
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.810
to a rule, How to
break it, how to get

409
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.040
around it. How do you
know how to get it?

410
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.650
Isn't it, it's kind of
a hacker mentality, I guess.

411
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.780
And, and so I really
fit in testing. So whereas

412
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.320
some people were trying to
Excel at testing when they

413
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.530
actually their heart wasn't in
it. I had found something

414
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.790
that my heart was attracted
to. So lots of energy

415
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.610
was liberated for me to
work on this, what you

416
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.850
need to do. If you
are an conventionally educated person,

417
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.460
I think is you need
to discover, and this is

418
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.230
the tough thing in life,
but we have all our

419
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.560
twenties pretty much to do
it. Discover what it is,

420
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:20.760
what mix of activities makes
you super excited that you

421
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.510
want to do. And then
if you go into that

422
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.850
field, you will be able
to compete, regardless of your

423
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.250
level of formal education, you'll
be able to compete like

424
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.830
gangbusters because you'll be surrounded
by people who were mostly

425
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.980
pushed into their, by their
parents or by their peers.

426
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.140
They don't know what else
to do. And you will

427
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.540
be able to run right
by them. Like they're standing

428
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.050
still and you develop your
reputation. And we can do

429
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.630
that in the modern world,
much more easily because we

430
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.360
have all blogs now, free
blogs that I didn't have

431
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.110
back in my day. And
you develop your portfolio, you

432
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.810
post examples of your work
on your personal brand, your

433
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.140
personal brand. Exactly. So that's
basically what I talk about

434
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.000
in the book is how
to do how I developed

435
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.210
my personal brand. And what's
amazing to me is I

436
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.610
heard from a guy with
12 years experience with testing

437
00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.580
and he said he had
to get IST QP certified.

438
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.010
And he's just no choice.
He has to do it.

439
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.530
And I said, I did,
I'm not IST QB certified.

440
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.540
And he said, yes, but
you're the famous James bot.

441
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.590
Right? But when I had
12 years experience, I could

442
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.570
have done the same thing.
And when I had six

443
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.540
years in two years experience,
I mean, I, wasn't always

444
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.660
famous as a software tester.
I became famous by being

445
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.200
passionate well and developing my
personal brand. So there's, there's

446
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.740
a, there's a, there's a
popular blogger. Jane Jeff Atwood

447
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.000
who writes coding horror.com. And
he talks about that. He's

448
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.720
not a particularly talented software
programmer. He, he admits that,

449
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.440
but he has, you know,
120,000 people that day that

450
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.660
read his blog. So he
says, what I lack in

451
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.670
talent I make up for,
with intensity is, I mean,

452
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.390
is that what you're saying?
I mean, one where someone

453
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.400
could take a cynical view
and say, well, you know,

454
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.310
the passionate person will win
over the more, maybe more

455
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.590
trained, more intelligent, but dispassionate
individual That may very well

456
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:06.940
happen. And there are also
situations, many situations that turns

457
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.360
out where people run away
from passionate people. They they're

458
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.260
frightened of them. But as
I say in the book,

459
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.050
you know, I don't need
everybody to hire me. I

460
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.570
just need a few people
to harm me, maybe even

461
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.390
one at a time. And
so there's a whole world

462
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:28.090
out there that can discover
me. It's okay. That my

463
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.650
spicy Tabasco brand of thinking
where I'm constantly calling bullshit

464
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:39.670
on people instead of accepting
what most people believe. Absolutely.

465
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.460
It doesn't work for a
lot of folks. Hey, there's

466
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.030
a lot of folks at
Microsoft to complain about the

467
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:49.210
things that I do doesn't
work for them, but there

468
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.860
are lots of people who
take me seriously and think

469
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.200
that I've got good things
to say. And I pretty

470
00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:01.060
much ignore people who don't
like what I have to

471
00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.110
offer and pretty much focus
on the people who need

472
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:09.160
what I have to offer.
And yeah, just, you know,

473
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.740
feature that I think we
all like that we all

474
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.060
have a balance of attributes,
a basket of attributes in

475
00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.340
us and a basket of
things that we want to

476
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.160
develop. We want to spend
our time doing some people

477
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.920
are more meticulous than others.
Some people have a lot

478
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.770
more charm and people skills
than I do. And I

479
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.960
want to work with those
people. They're always very comfortable

480
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.320
to work with, but I'm
not like that. So I'm

481
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.870
not going to compete with
them on that basis. So

482
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.640
are you saying that part
of your process was figuring

483
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.650
out what your weaknesses were
and how to downplay them

484
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.270
or how to do, are
you a person who like

485
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.450
downplays the weakness and works
to the strength? Other people

486
00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.100
say, well, you really need
to work on the weakness

487
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.050
and make it a strength.
Right? What I've found both

488
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:51.430
as a manager and just
personally, I found that I

489
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.310
need to, maybe I work
on the weaknesses a little

490
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.660
bit, but basically a downplay
them. And instead of trying

491
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.230
to practice being quiet, I
try to look for situations

492
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:06.940
where allowed guys needed. You
know, my wife recruited me

493
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.460
to be her husband because
she's an introvert and she

494
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.310
wanted an extrovert to be
your bodyguard. And I enjoy

495
00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.190
playing that role. I'm her
bodyguard. And every time we

496
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.770
go to the doctor, I'm
like her lawyer talks to

497
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:19.540
the doctors that she doesn't
have to argue with the

498
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.200
doctor and any kind of,
she needs to talk to

499
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.780
somebody on the phone. Who's
giving her a hard time.

500
00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.090
She passes the phone over
to me and I'm the

501
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.840
guy who's the, the bad
cop. And she gets to

502
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.960
be the, you know, soft
cop and the friendly person

503
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.630
who smoothed things over after
I leave them in shambles

504
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.630
and it works for us
and she does all the

505
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.000
finances and she does all
the paperwork. Cause she's good

506
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.590
that, and I'm not, I'm
not a meticulous enough for

507
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.460
that. And I work on
the big ideas and, and

508
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.670
speaking in public and, and
all this. And we compliment

509
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.760
each other very well. So
I like to downplay, I

510
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.450
mean, I'm 43. Now there
are weaknesses that I have

511
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.940
that I'm just don't think
I'm going to get over.

512
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.540
I just rather focus on
what my stress, Well, they

513
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.520
always say that when, when
you're out there and you

514
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.410
have a lot of emotional
baggage, the trick is to

515
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.920
find people whose emotional baggage
matches yours. There you go.

516
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.640
Whether it be a company
or an industry or in

517
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.010
that case, a wife. Yeah,
absolutely. Cause if you try

518
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:24.290
to, to work against that,
at least for me, it

519
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.010
goes while burn out I'll
I will, I will go

520
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.820
through a self destructive kind
of experience. So I have

521
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.120
to avoid that. What are
some of the, of the

522
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.520
really concrete things that someone
can take away from this?

523
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.590
It sounds like there are
a series of life, lessons

524
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:44.120
and stories. Are there techniques
within the book that the

525
00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.360
listeners can apply Futuristics that
I offer. And I try

526
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.430
to break down what I
do into 11 different elements.

527
00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.310
And sometimes people read it
and they think what I'm

528
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.620
saying is do these 11
things and you will be

529
00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.500
successful, not a cookbook. It's
not a cookbook. And I'm

530
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.630
not saying you two will
be successful if you do

531
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.840
these things. What I'm saying
is is that if you

532
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.530
happen to be either the
sort of person who has

533
00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.730
always struggled to play the
same kind of game in

534
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.100
a conventional thinking game, that
everyone else is trying to

535
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.850
play, and you're not being
successful for you, maybe you're

536
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.670
a different kind of mind,
the Buccaneer type of mind,

537
00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:26.720
like, like me and maybe
these elements will be helpful

538
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.660
to you if you are
a conventional thinking kind of

539
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.550
person, but you want to
be really great at what

540
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.120
you do. Maybe these 11
elements might be worth thinking

541
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.130
about, because maybe you'll find
something in them that you

542
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.920
can use to supercharge what
you already are good at

543
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.230
doing that. I don't happen
to be good at doing,

544
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.320
you know, fitting in and
getting along. So for instance,

545
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.310
one of the 11 elements
is called contrasting ideas and

546
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.400
it relates to my habit
of any time I find

547
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.040
myself thinking about one practice
or one philosophy or one

548
00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.640
way of organizing the world.
I find myself thinking, what's

549
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.160
the opposite of that? What
would be the thing that

550
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.560
was the furthest away from
that? And how do I

551
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.560
know that's not also a
good thing to do? And

552
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.420
so I find myself slamming
ideas together in my mind,

553
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.080
and I love getting to
arguments. I love dialectical learning.

554
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.150
A lot of people like
to avoid arguments and seek

555
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.360
common ground, but I seek
the potent learning that comes

556
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.460
from a strident disagreement. And
many times people think I'm,

557
00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.440
I'm angry at them when
I'm actually very excited about

558
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.670
what they're saying, and I
want to test it. So

559
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.910
I, I saw them. What
about this? What about this?

560
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:36.740
I'm giving them test cases.
Can I want to say,

561
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.810
can you pass this test
case? And they go stop

562
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.740
yelling at me. And like,
I'm, I'm loving. This is

563
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.770
One of the things that
might one of the many

564
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.980
things that my wife hates
about me is that we'll

565
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.890
have these arguments where I'll
pick a position. It could

566
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.070
be something basic or it
could be something political and

567
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:55.990
all we'll fight, we'll fight
and we'll fight. And then

568
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.200
I'll realize that she's right.
And I'll go, Oh, okay,

569
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.690
well, I totally see your
point. So I'll go from

570
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.480
this intense kind of like
attack mode where we're just

571
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.690
really having this great lowercase,
a argument, and it's very

572
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.800
enthusiastic and I'm really upbeat.
And then I go, and

573
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.130
then I've, I've, I've collected
all this great information from

574
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.530
her. I'll go, Oh, okay.
That's great. And she's like,

575
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.960
well, how can you just
go from having such a

576
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.780
strong opinion to like saying,
Oh, you're right. And I

577
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.170
said, well, it's a strong
opinion. That's weakly held. I'm,

578
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.500
I'm completely willing to, you
know, I mean, I believe

579
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.870
that they, that way of
saying, I mean, I believe

580
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.300
that gravity until you prove
it, you know, if you

581
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.070
prove right now that gravity
didn't work, I'd be like,

582
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.020
Oh, okay, great. And I
would be like the most

583
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:40.050
fervent anti-gravity. I said that
I have a little phrase

584
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.080
it's like that. I say
I'm a skeptic. And when

585
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.410
one of my other elements
is skepticism and skepticism does

586
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.750
not mean scoffing, which is
a lot of people think

587
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.230
it means scoffing. Oh, I
don't believe that what skepticism

588
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.200
means in the original sense
of sexism, pure Gus and

589
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.820
Purell of Ellis from back
2000 years ago, the original

590
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.870
skepticism was the spirit of
let the inquiry continue. I

591
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.950
never know anything for certain,
so yes, I'm going to

592
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.950
believe things, but I try
to sleep lightly on the

593
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.330
truth, strong opinion, lightly held
sleep lightly on the truth

594
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.330
so that your wake up
bubble. Right? Right. So maybe

595
00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.100
what your wife is thinking
as a lot of people

596
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.740
think that an argument is
a fight that's she doesn't

597
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.960
understand that Aren't you turned,
I'm trying to change her

598
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.770
mind. Yeah. Aren't you trying
to, to, to, to attack

599
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.590
me or change me or
manipulate me, how come you

600
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.230
suddenly stopped? That doesn't make
any sense? Well, maybe what

601
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.150
I wasn't trying to do
any of those things and

602
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.850
it just looked like that.
But of course it's hard

603
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.640
for folks like us because
sometimes we're in our own

604
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.130
head doing this and we
have no idea that everybody

605
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.850
else is terrified of us
or intimidated. I was once

606
00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.650
in a class where we
went around the room and

607
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:53.340
people gave words that were
associated with conflict. And I

608
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.270
was amazed because everyone before
me was saying pain. So

609
00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:02.640
funny, I said fun. And
I said, I said, excitement.

610
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.430
That was mine. Excitement. I
was the only one in

611
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:10.140
the room who had a
positive idea of conflict. See,

612
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.500
that's what Buccaneer comes from.
It's this. I realized that

613
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:20.430
the historical Buccaneers were aggressive.
People of adventurers. They had

614
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.940
to master lots of different
skills. They considered themselves a

615
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.730
free society of people, not
just a bunch of pirates.

616
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.980
They were a free society
trying to make it in

617
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.840
a new world where there
weren't so many rules. They

618
00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.740
were like hackers. They left,
they were life hacking, packing,

619
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.400
having left Europe where it's
all cloistered. And they realized

620
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.880
that, that they could from
these Spanish ships. And they

621
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.640
started doing that. And they
didn't think of themselves as

622
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.190
Steves though. They thought of
themselves as, Hey, Spain doesn't

623
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.410
really own this stuff. Anyway.
They just stole it from

624
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.980
these Indians. So we'll just,
we'll just steal it from

625
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.300
them. And the, the, the
17th century Buccaneers, unlike the

626
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:01.730
18th century, Buccaneers had a
social kind of basis, as

627
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.550
opposed to just being a
pirates the way they, they

628
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.580
turned into a later on.
And I'm like that. I

629
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.850
just, I don't quite fit
in and I do my

630
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.660
own thing and the world
can certainly get along without

631
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.540
me. And yet there are
certain kinds of things that

632
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.600
I can offer to the
world just as the Buccaneers

633
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.940
were used by the navies
of England and the navies

634
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:32.030
of France and in Portugal,
different times to fight the

635
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.390
Spanish, they were, they were
like a sort of exhilarating

636
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.330
force. That was a useful,
well, I'm a kind of

637
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.200
exhilarated forest that sometimes can
be used in addition to

638
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.500
whatever else they're doing. And
so I try to have

639
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.080
interesting things to offer people
that they might not get

640
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.110
anywhere else. And I teach
people this way of thinking,

641
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.810
well, thanks. This is, this
has been really fun. I

642
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.060
really appreciate it. It's been
really fun for me, Scott,

643
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.910
what you can check out.
James Bach on his website

644
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.760
is satisfies.com. I'll add the
links to that in the

645
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.150
show notes and bucking your
scholar.com. You have bucket near

646
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.550
scholar.com as well. Fantastic. Be
sure to check out his

647
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.880
books on software testing and
his newly released secrets of

648
00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.950
a fucking year scholar. Again,
thank you so much for

649
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:15.620
your time. This has been
another episode of Hansel minutes.

650
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.210
See you again next week.
