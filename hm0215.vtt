7
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.630
James sr. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman and this is

8
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.270
another episode of Hansel minutes.
And I am sitting today

9
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.200
in a fancy hotel room
in Sydney, Australia with James

10
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.720
sr. How are you, sir?
I'm doing fantastic. Thank you,

11
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.960
Scott. And we are in
the process of a worldwide

12
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.770
tour. You have gone through
London and Moscow and Toronto

13
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.670
in Beijing and Shanghai. And
I joined you in Beijing.

14
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.790
We've nearly forgotten that we've
forgotten the cities and we're

15
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.190
moving forward and you've got
Singapore left and a miles

16
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.650
to go before you sleep.
Yeah, a lot of places.

17
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.800
So it was a stop
in New York then onto Moscow

18
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.010
then to Beijing, which I
learned is not actually pronounced,

19
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.910
be judging, but Beijing and
whilst there, which was useful,

20
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.100
then Shanghai, and now we
are in Sydney indeed. And

21
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.960
so we are traveling and
we tend to travel a

22
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.230
lot and we thought we'd
do a show about travel

23
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.470
tips because we're both, I
think, seasoned she's in travelers.

24
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.740
We like to think such
yes. So if you are

25
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.780
a traveler, this is, this
is the show for you.

26
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.530
Let's talk about getting to
and from the airport and

27
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.270
kind of the prep stuff
that you have to do.

28
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.880
What are some tips that,
that you use for getting

29
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.480
ready to go to the
airport? Carry on that. Just

30
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.410
simple tip, just carry on.
Don't try and overpack. I

31
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.550
know that when I travel,
I always travel light. If

32
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.890
we just contrast that with
someone like my girlfriend, for

33
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.370
example, you know, and bless
her, she likes to take

34
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.880
a lot of clothes and
things overpack. I think people

35
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.890
don't realize you can get
away with a lot less

36
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.010
things when you're traveling. And
so just try and take

37
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.010
the bare essentials and carry
on your luggage. Exactly. I

38
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.350
think the thing to remember
is that wherever you're going

39
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.070
is probably not Mars. People
have legs and arms just

40
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.160
like we do, and therefore
one can purchase shirts and

41
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.890
pants. And if you forget
something or you really need

42
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.280
something, it can be purchased
usually very inexpensively don't panic.

43
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.130
Don't if you forget a
travel adapter, for example, for

44
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.120
power or I don't know,
I picked up 110 to

45
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.630
240 volt converter at the
hotel here. You can normally

46
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.390
get things from reception. They're
pretty accommodating, right? You're not

47
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.790
the first person to forget
something. So focus on the

48
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.400
essentials. Like for me as
a diabetic, I focus more

49
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.710
on power bars and snacks
and insulin and make sure

50
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.810
you've got your USB adapters
and your kind of more

51
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.890
exotic power adapters. Yep. I
mean, I think you and

52
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.110
I focus mainly on the
gadgets as well. Yeah. As

53
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.340
long as everything charges, pants
are really secondary. I've gone

54
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.170
with no clothes whatsoever, but
just as long as I've

55
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.780
got my laptop right. Renewed,
but a great high definition

56
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.300
camera. Exactly. And it also,
if you're going to be

57
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.010
gone for an extended period
of time, as you have

58
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.430
been used the hotel laundry,
you've got a single carry

59
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.040
on bag and a backpack,
and you've been doing laundry

60
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.560
at the hotel Who would
consider considered insane, but I'm

61
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.770
traveling now. I will be
traveling for 27 days total.

62
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.860
Wow. So nearly a month
and I'm doing it all

63
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.800
with a single carry on
and a backpack. So when

64
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.850
my backpack, I have two
laptops, I have a range

65
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.180
of gadgets from high definition
cameras to portable hard disc

66
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.070
drives. I have various sort
of paradoxes, et cetera, cameras.

67
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.940
And in my main luggage,
which I'm also carrying on,

68
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.550
it's a small kind of
wheelie luggage as well. And

69
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.320
we'll talk about that maybe
a little bit later on

70
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.410
it's basic clothes, wash bag,
all miniaturized And all segments

71
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.170
that I've noticed that when
we get through to security,

72
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.640
the way that you've packed,
as you've put all of

73
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.060
your toiletries in one bag,
that's sitting on the top

74
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.800
of your bank. So you
literally open it up, pull

75
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.300
it out. Boom. And right,
there are all of your

76
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.120
toiletries. Yep. Thinking ahead, what
are you going to need

77
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.920
to get out of your
bags in order to get

78
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.250
through the security airport process?
Right. And you would be

79
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.640
surprised how little you really
need to be taking when

80
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.150
you go somewhere. Absolutely. So
don't panic. And then of

81
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.100
course, checking in online. I
think we all use the

82
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.070
tickets now. You know, we
definitely want to issue the

83
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.730
paper ticket whenever possible. But
checking in at the airport

84
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.940
from a speed perspective is
dead. It, it can be,

85
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.790
it varies between airlines. If
you know the airline you're

86
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.610
traveling with and you know,
the airport, then you can

87
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.120
normally get away with perhaps
the computer kiosks that will

88
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.730
give you the ticket. And
they're, they're quite convenient, but

89
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.640
for airlines that you're not
very familiar with. It's best

90
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.380
to go ahead and see
if you can check online

91
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.040
because sometimes you get caught
up in some nasty lines

92
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.380
because they haven't got the
kiosks. Are they a certain

93
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.900
airport you're traveling from? So
make sure you check in

94
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.520
online, either print out your
boarding pass or get, like

95
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.000
you said, Scott, the new
kind of mobile device version

96
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.460
of that, where they just
scan it off the phone

97
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.370
And with international flights, sometimes
now you can put your

98
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.880
passport information in online. Exactly.
And make sure you've got

99
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.880
all of your visa. Yeah.
Well that's a story. Yeah.

100
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.130
So I was advised that
I didn't need a visa

101
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.760
to get into Australia. And
so I land, I went

102
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.970
up to the checking desk
in Shanghai as we were

103
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.240
leaving. And there was advised
by the nice smiley lady

104
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.100
who was serving me that
I needed a visa and

105
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.650
I didn't have one of
course, Scott was a very

106
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.770
pleased with himself because he
had a visa for Australia,

107
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.560
but I didn't. So it
wasn't too much of a

108
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.810
traumatic process. I just needed
to go around the corner

109
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.030
and buy one. It could
have been though, but it

110
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.480
have been. So make sure
you plan ahead, make sure

111
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.300
that you know, all of
the constraints on the place

112
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.630
you're traveling to And when
you're doing visas like that,

113
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.730
remember that there's a difference
between a visa that allows

114
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.040
you to enter a country
and a visa. It allows

115
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.190
you to transit through one.
And this is really interesting

116
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.230
when you're doing EU countries
and you're not an American

117
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.750
citizen because I was traveling
with my wife and my

118
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.790
sister in law. My sister
in law has a green

119
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.390
card and she was trans.
We were transiting. So we

120
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.510
were going from Johannesburg to,
I think we went to

121
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.130
Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Paris and
then Paris back to Portland.

122
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.680
Well, we entered Europe at
Frankfurt. She did not have

123
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.840
an EU visa. She did
not have a Schengen visa

124
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.870
or a bit, but somehow
we got in and I'm

125
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.660
not saying, and to be
clear, we didn't know. We

126
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.550
just walked through a door.
And the next thing we

127
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.290
know we were here, but
we didn't really go into

128
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.840
Europe. We were just going
to go from Frankfurt to

129
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.200
Paris. Then we were in
Paris getting ready to leave.

130
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.140
And the person at the
passport counter says, how are

131
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.860
you here? You're not even
supposed to be here. Yeah,

132
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.810
no, of course we were
leaving. And they realized that

133
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.190
it was a mistake, but
it turns out it was

134
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.520
the, we never should have
been allowed to have left

135
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.880
Frankfurt. That could have been
a very, very sticky situation.

136
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.220
So be aware of your
visas, be aware. There are

137
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.490
some very subtle things. A
us citizen didn't need a

138
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.250
transit visa, but a us
green card holder did. And

139
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.320
then of course, when you
do show up and you're

140
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.480
ready to stamp your passport,
make sure you have enough

141
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.130
pages. And some countries have
specific South Africa requires at least

142
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.850
two pages of blank area.
Otherwise they'll kick you out.

143
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.060
And what happens then in
that scenario, Lance Armstrong had

144
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.620
this problem about a month
and a half ago, Lance

145
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.400
Armstrong, the famous American cyclist
showed up in South Africa with

146
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.770
a full passport or he
had a single page free.

147
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.830
And then the embassy got
involved and all this kind

148
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.960
of VIP stuff happened and
it became a big problem.

149
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.390
I had the same exact
situation happened. What would the

150
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.060
VIP status? And the episode
of VIP status Have a

151
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.310
bit of a back and
forth with the, the visa

152
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.980
folks and immediately, but very
easily could have been sent,

153
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.650
sent back through lack of
planning on my part. Right?

154
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.140
You typically typically nine times
out of 10, it's your

155
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.230
fault for not doing your
research, right? So this is

156
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.560
all stuff before you go
before you, you know, on

157
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.600
the day of departure, but
what about actually getting to

158
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.120
the airport? Any tips there,
Scott? Well, I definitely try

159
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.400
to avoid taking the car
if I can, if you

160
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.870
can take the bus or
take the train, you're going

161
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.320
to save big, big money,
especially a short term or

162
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.140
medium term parking. You're looking
at 20, 30 us dollars

163
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.220
a day. Yep. Take the
light rail or the train

164
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.680
directly there. But also when
you get there, it is

165
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.810
so expensive. If you just
decide to hop in a

166
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.600
black car, hop in a
taxi and get to the,

167
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.940
get to the hotel. Yeah.
I mean, going to the

168
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.550
airport, I travel a lot
from Seattle and obviously being

169
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.430
based there and you know,
I started out getting the

170
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.500
cat because when I first
moved there, I didn't really

171
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.660
know the public transport system
at all. So I was

172
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.450
getting taxis to the airport
and that was roundabout 40

173
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.490
to $50 a time. And
that really adds up if

174
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.140
you're traveling, traveling frequently. So
shortly after I realized I

175
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.910
was spending a lot of
money on cabs, I was

176
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.580
saying, okay, how do I
cut this back? And the

177
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.000
bus going to the airport
is not only very, very

178
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.490
efficient in terms of time,
takes 30 minutes from Seattle

179
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.820
downtown to Sea-Tac airport. But
it's also very cost effective.

180
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.100
I think it's around two
and a half to $2

181
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.320
50 for it, for a
ticket. And now we have

182
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.390
the new light, new and
improved light rail, which is

183
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.090
even more clean and pristine,
et cetera. But like you

184
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.050
said, getting from the airport
to your destination, again, look

185
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.200
into local transport. If you
can get some advice, perhaps

186
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.690
visit the information desk, find
out what the best deals

187
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.240
are, the best way of
getting to your final destination.

188
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.350
I think that people who
aren't doing that, they're paying

189
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.210
for the convenience, but they
need to realize how much

190
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.690
they're paying for the convenience.
I mean, two bucks versus

191
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.500
50 bucks is a big,
you're paying $48 for convenience.

192
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.120
A perfect example is coming
back from a PDC. This

193
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.470
last October, everyone was taking
taxis to the airport from

194
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.920
the, from the Sheridan. And
you're looking at 45 $55.

195
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.790
Yep. But our business manager
Shaunti and I ended up

196
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.840
just taking the train from
downtown LA. It was $2

197
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.060
to get to the airport
and it only required one

198
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.310
train change. And the only
reason to not do that

199
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.100
would be the fear of
the unknown. Yeah, exactly. But

200
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.940
your hotel concierge knows this
stuff, ask them, take advantage

201
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.250
of your concierge. When you're
moving from place to place.

202
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.250
We showed up in Sydney
today, you had a car

203
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.010
scheduled and we can't So
that we canceled it before

204
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.890
we left Shanghai, just because
we felt we were more

205
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.130
comfortable in the English speaking
country. We felt like we

206
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.900
should be able to get
around. And sure enough, we

207
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.250
got a train ticket for
15 Australian dollars. And within

208
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.340
20 to 30 minutes, we
were in downtown Sydney, two

209
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.620
blocks from our hotel. Exactly.
And it would have been

210
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.190
$95. Yeah. Had we kept
the taxi. So we saved

211
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.320
60 bucks between the two
of us. And that was

212
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.350
pretty, pretty nice. Your boss
will be happy. My boss

213
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.510
will be thrilled. One of
thing to remember is that

214
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.640
when you're parking or when
you're going to the airport,

215
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.950
if there's, and this is
just a personal chip, I

216
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.070
actually learned this from Scott,
Kate. He said, take pictures

217
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.960
of everything that you need
to remember. If you're going

218
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.180
to be gone for 27
days park, take a picture

219
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.490
of where you parked your
car, take a picture of

220
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.950
receipts, take a picture of
baggage, claim, receipts, anything at

221
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.770
all that you could lose
remembering that, that your phone

222
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.570
is probably the one thing
you are the least likely

223
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.480
to lose. Take a picture.
And myself, when I do

224
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.420
take a picture, I take
it with Evernote, which actually

225
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.730
synchronizes the data into the
cloud. So even if I

226
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.270
do in fact, lose my
phone, I'll still have pictures

227
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.500
of my documents that Scott
takes pictures of wifi passcodes,

228
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.580
A hotel room numbers. And
I, it's funny, I've taken

229
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.770
pictures. Have I not? You
actually need that to find

230
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.020
your way around. Take a
picture of the front of

231
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.690
my hotel room. So I
don't forget the hotel room

232
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.510
number. That's a good one.
It it's simple pick something

233
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.150
that works for you. So
once you get to the

234
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.220
airport, what are some things
that we can do to

235
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.290
what are some kind of
tips to make sure that

236
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.070
you're effective at the airport?
Well, there's some available that

237
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.580
I would thoroughly recommend. I
live and die by these

238
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.910
tools. Things like TripIt, for
example, trip, it helps me

239
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.190
to manage all of my
itineraries for months, Our IP,

240
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.250
I T trip it don't
call it. Yeah. And so

241
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.200
they have a work grade
website where you can go

242
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.200
and manage all of your
itineraries. And they also have

243
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.810
a really cool Email Seat,
feature functionality, where you send

244
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.080
off to them, your itineraries
and your receipts for your

245
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.350
travel bookings. And they will
interpret them. They will scan

246
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.860
them and figuring out what
exactly you're doing and then

247
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.320
add it to their system
laminate and create a new

248
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.540
itinerary for you. So you
didn't, you don't even have

249
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.580
to do data entry. You
can be really lazy. You

250
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.490
can get your receipts from
kayak or from American express

251
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.350
travel or whatever it is,
and then forward it on

252
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.780
to TripIt and then bang,
you've got a new itinerary

253
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.760
created in TripIt and the
reason why TripIt it is

254
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.560
useful and why the reason,
the reason why you have

255
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.630
that itinerary is useful is
because it helps you to

256
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.700
navigate around and make sure
you're not missing flights, et

257
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.280
cetera. Exactly. There's really no
excuse to miss a flight.

258
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.000
And the great thing about
TripIt is that if you,

259
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.780
maybe you listener have an
itinerary in your inbox right

260
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.070
now, pause this podcast forward
that itinerary just literally go

261
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.870
into your email and forward
it to plans@tripit.com. You don't

262
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.270
have to sign up for
anything they'll automatically make an

263
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.790
account for you based on
your email address, they'll parse

264
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.100
it. And if you have
a, this is great for

265
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.980
if you've got a significant
other or a partner that

266
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.780
you need to keep up
to date on all of

267
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.480
your travel plans. You just
forward all this stuff. It

268
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.290
can be a hotel reservation
from American express. It can

269
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.710
be a flight reservation from
Expedia, they'll parse it all.

270
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.380
They parse hundreds of different
kinds of docs, even attachments

271
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.780
they'll even do PDs. They
will look inside your emails

272
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.630
and look at PDF status,
And it will make a

273
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.910
nice clean one pager that
you can hand to your

274
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.460
spouse and say, here's what
I'm going to be. Yup.

275
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.970
It is unreal. It's almost
like having a virtual And

276
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.830
the other cool things it
does is track you all

277
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.870
with your trips. So if
you're a frequent traveler, you

278
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.990
can kind of get statistics
on how far you've traveled,

279
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.410
where you've been. You can
find out who's going to

280
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.230
be nearby, so you can
have a contact list to

281
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.330
say, Hey, Scott Hanselman is
going to be in Sydney

282
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.460
at the same time as
you, and you might want

283
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.500
to get in touch, go
for a drink or whatever.

284
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.780
And the other, the other
funny thing is it has

285
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.170
league tables of who in
your group of friends has

286
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.210
traveled the most. So if
you're kind of competitive and

287
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.040
you want to have the
most miles, or you want

288
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.750
to have been to the
most cities or shoveled to

289
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.360
the most countries, and you
can track that too. And

290
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.970
having that extra information allows
you to take action when

291
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.280
it, when it's appropriate. Right?
And that's a really good

292
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.390
tip when you're at the
airport, PA pacivity being passive

293
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.730
will kill you. And that
means that if you're on

294
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.530
a flight and you're waiting
for the flight to board,

295
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.770
and then maybe it's delayed
and it's delayed again, and

296
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.260
people are starting to mill
around, this is where you

297
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.020
as the savvy traveler take
action. And there's been a

298
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.050
lot of times when, when
I've found that the information

299
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.480
I've been given, and this
is information that goes to

300
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.880
the masses, who at the
airport by agents is perhaps

301
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.420
in accurate in sometimes some
cases. And I found that

302
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:00.740
whilst checking on my device
with services like TripIt and

303
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.740
other services that I can
find more accurate information, more

304
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.720
up to date information. So
I can step one. I

305
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.320
can say one step ahead
of the mob. People are

306
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.300
looking on their documents to
find out what the next

307
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.840
flight is, where the next
terminal is. But with SMS

308
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.980
alerts and smartphone applications, you
already know the layout of

309
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.550
the airport, which would determine
when you get out and

310
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.990
what the most effective way
to get to the next

311
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.940
gate is, which is tough
when you have really tight

312
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.350
connection. Yeah. And there's an
example where I was flying

313
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.100
from New York to Moscow and
I had arrived into JFK.

314
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.990
My flight was a little
bit delayed getting to the

315
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.260
gate. And my transfer time
was around about 20 to

316
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.020
30 minutes, which is not
a lot of time. And

317
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.520
the airline assistant on board
didn't know which terminal I

318
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.070
was going to for my
flight to Moscow. When I

319
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.150
got out of the aircraft
onto the gate, the agent

320
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.610
didn't know which terminal I
needed to go to. So

321
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.530
this is a problem. They
said, I'll go to the

322
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.780
customer service desk right down.
The other end of the

323
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.930
terminal. Jeff Case is a busy,
big airport. I don't want

324
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.060
to do that. I click
quickly get on to trip

325
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.480
it. I find I click
on the get flight status

326
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.600
button for my next flight.
And it tells me automatically

327
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.910
what terminal I am at
what symbol I need to

328
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.920
be at. And so then
I hopped on the bus,

329
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.720
got there and I was
like five minutes before the

330
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.240
doors close, which is I
would have missed that flight.

331
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.630
Had I not had that
time? Exactly. There's been many

332
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.460
times where I've been on
flights that looked like they

333
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.260
were going to get canceled,
but we kept being kind

334
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.230
of shined on by the
gate agent saying, well, we

335
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.300
know it could take off.
It could take off. This

336
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.100
is where you take action.
You pick up the phone,

337
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.380
you call, if you're, if
you're an MVP or if

338
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.440
you're a, a premier with
a particular airline, like I'm

339
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.950
premier with Alaska airlines, call
them up and say, it's

340
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.140
looking like this is going
to be canceled and I

341
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.170
need to get moved on
to something, something else. And

342
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.210
this is where you want
to speak the language Of

343
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.610
the sky. What is, what
do you mean by that?

344
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.670
You can, again, the whole
goal here is to save

345
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.890
time, right? If you're going
to save time, you need

346
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.650
to speak the language of
the agents. And by, by

347
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.900
the, by that, I mean,
being able to pick up

348
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.660
the phone and say, you
know, I'm on delayed United

349
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.000
six 86 from an LGA
to Chicago. Can you get

350
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.550
me on standby United six
80? Wow. That sounds like

351
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.400
you've, you know, it's talking
about, I'm not saying you

352
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.580
need to be at a
flight agent, but I'm saying

353
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.970
that you can say, hi,
you know, how's it going?

354
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.740
I'm on this flight. What's
your name, sir? What's your

355
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.980
flight. If you can talk
to them in the same

356
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.140
way that they're talking to
each other, it makes their

357
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.090
lives easier. And those small
shortcuts can move you forward

358
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.520
in your, in your travel
experience. I think a lot,

359
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.420
a lot better. The other
thing is that when you're

360
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.700
trying to jump around from
flight to flight, you never

361
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.850
want to give up a
guaranteed seat for the chances,

362
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.300
Right? So if you're trying
to get on a flight,

363
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.880
which is earlier on, perhaps
in the day, you don't

364
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.760
want say, well, I'm going
to give Up my seat

365
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.150
and move to this other
fight. Maybe at the chance

366
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.850
of a seat, you can
put yourself on standby and

367
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.340
make sure that you always
kind of keep your finger

368
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.410
on the chest piece before
you make your move. Cause

369
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.260
you never really want to
give up an actual guaranteed

370
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.320
seat at all points Be
pleasant. Yep. Don't be that

371
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.560
guy. Don't be that guy
because that guy never gets

372
00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.910
upgraded. You will, your life
will be a living hell

373
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.560
they can make. They have
the power to do that.

374
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.080
Hey, it's alternate universe, Scott
Hanselman going to thank our

375
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.630
sponsors for making this free
show possible. We've been doing

376
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.730
Hansel minutes for almost four
years now and we really

377
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.650
couldn't do it without tolerant.
So I want to tell

378
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.510
you about some of the
stuff they're working on. If

379
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.660
you've already started developing with
Silverlight, then you'll probably need

380
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.030
a solid testing tool to
do your several at UIs.

381
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.730
Unfortunately, though, a lot of
the tools available today only

382
00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.010
help you with unit testing.
There's not really a good

383
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.500
way to simulate the actual
behavior of those end users,

384
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.420
unless you spend days and
weeks doing a lot of

385
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.000
manual testing. But the guys
at Telerx, you've got a

386
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.210
new point, click UI testing
tool for server line called

387
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.880
web UI test studio. And
the beauty is that you

388
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.120
can quickly record your tests
with a cross browser recorder,

389
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.460
and you can enrich them
with code. If you've got

390
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.160
really complex scenarios. And on
top of that, it supports

391
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.070
all the standard controls as
well as the Tellerik enhanced

392
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.800
controls. You can verify not
only server life, but even

393
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.300
complex Ajax applications, best part
web UI test studio lives

394
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.340
in visual studio. So you
don't have to leave your

395
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.260
favorite development environment. You check
it out at telerik.com/web hyphen

396
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.380
testing, hyphen tools, and be
sure to thank Tellerik for

397
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.190
supporting the show on their
Facebook fan page at facebook.com/tellerik.

398
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.930
Now, when you're going through
security, what are some things

399
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.480
that you do James to
get through? So if I

400
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.780
haven't already done this before
getting to the airport, perhaps

401
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.400
I've done this on the
light rail or on the

402
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.430
bus whilst I'm waiting in
line, I'll be taking off

403
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.950
all metallic items. I'll be
taking my watch off. I'll

404
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.320
be putting it in my
bag, my carry on bag.

405
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.420
My rucksack has a nice
pouch at the top for

406
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.760
these kind of items. I
take my belt off that

407
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.220
goes in there. Any coins
I might have just getting

408
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.800
ready, just getting ahead of
the curve. And then by

409
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.860
the time I'm at the
place where you put all

410
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.650
of the items into your
tray and everybody's, they're frantically

411
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.440
stressing and sweating because they're
trying to get all of

412
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.650
their items out. You know,
you're just gliding through karmas

413
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.260
can be one fluid motion.
It's just, it's just so

414
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.580
simple. And if you've got
no items that you have

415
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.370
liquid, for example, or like
I have my carry on

416
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.500
my roll on and it's
all I have. I just

417
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.450
flip it open and I
have my wash bag then

418
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.400
on the top, which I
get out and I put

419
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.830
that in the tray. Another
thing that I've found is

420
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.990
that you don't need to
have these plastic bags. I

421
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.960
mean, officially you do. But
in my experience, when I've

422
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.210
been going through many, many
airports all around the world,

423
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.750
my wash bag is perfectly
fine to have all of

424
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.210
those items in, you know,
there's a hundred milliliters max

425
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:42.590
kind of thing. And you
just put them through as

426
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.630
long as they're separate, as
long as they're separate, they

427
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.980
seem to be fine with
it. Exactly. Getting all that

428
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.130
stuff through security. And then
also being prepared to explain

429
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.950
yourself if there's some particular
thing that's going to be

430
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.310
difficult. If you have a
pacemaker or whatever, You got

431
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.190
a great example in China,
right? So I can say

432
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.160
I'm diabetic and I have
an insulin pump that's attached

433
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.440
to me and I've got
a continuous glucose meter. That's

434
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.070
literally implanted in my gut
with a big old piece

435
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.840
of tape. And it's kind
of a funny looking thing.

436
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.930
And this is something that's
unusual to see in the

437
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:17.490
States. And it's extremely unusual
elsewhere. And I was in,

438
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.830
I was actually in Tanzania
and I spent about an

439
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.230
hour having tried to explain
this to the guys at

440
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.080
the Kilimanjaro airport. And I
said, I'm never going to

441
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.930
do this again. So instead
I always try to learn

442
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.150
how to say, you know,
I'm a diabetic or I

443
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.330
need some help or whatever.
In the, in the local

444
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.510
language, they always say to
get phrase books and learn

445
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.640
about things like how to
order food at the restaurant,

446
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.070
don't waste your time on
that. You can always point

447
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.500
in the menu, but when
you're going through, you know,

448
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.680
China airport and they've got
Beijing airport, like we were

449
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.620
earlier this week and I
can say, well, y'all Tonya

450
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.350
being and say, I'm a
diabetic. Or if you're in

451
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:57.630
Germany and you need to
say, <inaudible>, They have to

452
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.330
do more working out. But
Point is though no blood

453
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.400
sugar is low. I actually
did that. I, that was

454
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.470
just one example of a
phrase. I was in Munich

455
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.240
and my blood sugar was
low. And I went into

456
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.320
an Apple tech into a
pharmacy and just announced my

457
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.440
blood sugar is low and
boom, all the German pharmacy,

458
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.750
people jumped to my aid.
You know what I mean?

459
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:20.100
So I've learned to say,
I'm a diabetic, this is

460
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.100
an insulin pump. You know,
it's one of <inaudible>, you

461
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.610
know, in like 15 different
languages because you need to

462
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.770
do that. I remember watching
you coming through the Beijing

463
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.790
security gate and the horror
on the face of the

464
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.580
girl who is kind of
waving a magic wand over

465
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.710
in you and go BBB
over your side. And then

466
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.210
all of a sudden you're
gonna have showed off this

467
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.400
device in your hand. And
then it was wide up

468
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.350
to you. And she was,
you know, the worst things

469
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.700
are running through your mind.
And then as soon as

470
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.070
you mentioned this magical phrase
in Chinese, she was like,

471
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.190
Oh, no problem, mr. Handsome.
And it comes through you.

472
00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.070
Why didn't you say so
before Exactly say probably saved

473
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.580
me 10 minutes. Well, 10
hours probably Anabel. Well, certainly

474
00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.560
it saved me a slight.
Certainly it saved me secondary

475
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.860
screening. I think that's the
point is be prepared of

476
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.410
what's what, what might happen.
And in my case, it's,

477
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.600
you know, if I'm traveling
through Europe or traveling through

478
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.570
Asia, learn how to say
the things, I'm an asthmatic.

479
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.880
I have a pacemaker I'm
a diabetic or whatever in

480
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.920
the five or six languages.
And one of the things

481
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.750
that you and I did
as we were wandering around

482
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.380
China was we got the
lonely planet, a phrasebook and

483
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.550
we completely ignorant. So the
Chinese language Chinese is really

484
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.950
horrific, frankly. But when we're
getting around, you know, we,

485
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.250
we brought a little lonely
planet application. So we can

486
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:35.700
ask things like, where is
the toilet essential, essential? You

487
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.120
know, I'd like a taxi.
Well, that's one of the

488
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.850
things, A bit of a
tip if you're in Beijing

489
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.800
and you're trying to get
a taxi at night, it

490
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.740
seems to have been a
bit of a, we were

491
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.080
standing by the edge of
the road and we're just

492
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.670
trying to hail a cab
or half an hour for

493
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.500
about half an hour. Some
guy was telling us the

494
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.390
most strategic place to stand
on the side of the

495
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.620
road. He was kind of
helping us out, but it's

496
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.350
still, you know, taxi. So
actually it turns out the

497
00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.160
Metro in Beijing isn't too
bad. So It's funny. So

498
00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.590
we actually didn't take our
own advice initially and then

499
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.510
said, wait a second, we're
sitting here trying to get

500
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.090
a taxi. Let's take the
Metro. And we were home

501
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.310
in about 15 minutes just
by, just by taking the

502
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.060
local subway. Now that's a
long flight. We were flying.

503
00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.400
We flew into Beijing and
that was about a 10

504
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.280
hour flight. We just got
off a flight, literally a

505
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.060
couple of hours ago coming
from Shanghai to Sydney. And

506
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.040
that was about a 10
hour flight. Yep. And then

507
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.870
I've got a 14 hour
flight coming up to San

508
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.960
Francisco soon. What do you
do to break that flight

509
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.580
up on a long haul?
What do you do for

510
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.400
16 hours? I know that
you've got multiple devices that

511
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.910
serve different types of content
and media. Well, I mentally

512
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.730
chop the flight up into
two hour segments. Cause I

513
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.180
think there's a certain psychological
barrier there. I mean, that's

514
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.100
a long time. Like, what
am I going to do?

515
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.570
Yeah. Just read magazines, Try
and aim to sleep on

516
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.000
a flight. I mean, that's
my main goal is to

517
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.520
try and get as much
rest as possible, but failing

518
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.370
that you need to have
things to keep your self

519
00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.790
busy and you know, sometimes
the airline content they have

520
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.310
on the video screens, isn't
exactly what you want. So

521
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.310
perhaps having movies available that
you've brought along when your

522
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.040
laptop, perhaps a little bit
of work, if you need

523
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.040
to get that done as
well. I find that being

524
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.640
on a plane is great
efficient work time personally, because

525
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.480
it's, there's no distractions from
being connected to the incident

526
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.420
internet. There's no emails coming
in and some of my

527
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.520
best work, some of my,
kind of the most solid

528
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.470
pieces of work like that.
I've had three hours to

529
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.630
work on from start to
finish. I find that I've

530
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.000
done it in Arabic, Nothing
like locking yourself into a

531
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.910
giant steel tube, 30,000 feet
up in the air to

532
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.920
really get some work done.
So you put it like

533
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.490
that. Yes. Yeah. It's brilliant.
But I always assume the

534
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.470
worst. I always assume I
won't be able to sleep

535
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.530
and I'm going to need
to entertain myself for 10

536
00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:48.850
solid hours. So I bring,
I bring DVDs. I bring

537
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.340
videos. I think I brought
nine movies on this, on

538
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.630
this side. That's an aggressive
schedule of movies. Well, and

539
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.180
here's the thing. I've only
watched three of them, but

540
00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.950
I know that they're there.
And again, this is a

541
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.350
psychological trick, a lot about
traveling and be effective at

542
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.440
traveling, especially not going insane.
And the giant steel tube

543
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.970
and this guy is knowing
what works for you. And

544
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.820
for me, just the fact
that I've got my Kindle

545
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.980
with a hundred books on
it or whatever, you know,

546
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.630
I think I've actually got
like 10 or 15 books.

547
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.660
I've got the magazines, comic
books. I've got the videos.

548
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.090
Let's me know that. At
least I won't be bored.

549
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.100
I may have other things
going on on the flight,

550
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.430
but I won't be bored.
So definitely break your flight

551
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.690
up mentally And also keep
hydrated during the flight. That's

552
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.980
I can't stress that enough
for me. It's very important

553
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.260
that you take on lots
of water. And then if

554
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.940
you're on a long flight,
also take the time to

555
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.420
stretch, walk around the cabin,
you know, wiggle your toes,

556
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.800
get the circulation going. Someone
told me that the humidity

557
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.840
out In the world is,
you know, the average place

558
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.360
in the world is like
60%, 70%, but on a

559
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.500
plane it's like 30% and
you just, just seep water

560
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.570
out of your system. So
you should go through, you

561
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.460
know, a leader or two
over the course of a

562
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.340
big, long flight length. And
before I get on the

563
00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.740
plane, I often try and
buy a big bottle of

564
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.110
water to take on with
me. Obviously you can't take

565
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.790
it through security, but as
soon as you hit the

566
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.730
newsstands, pick up a paper,
get a bottle of water.

567
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.190
Chewing gum also is nice.
So when you get off

568
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.200
the flight, you've got fresh
breath and you don't feel

569
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.940
like you've got in your
mouth as long a dog.

570
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.360
So that's nice. How much
do you think that those

571
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.210
Bose noise canceling headphones are
worth it? Do they really

572
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.620
make you feel more refreshed
when you, You got off

573
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.080
a flight? So I support
myself about two months ago

574
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.850
and I bought myself these
new nice Bose headphones. And

575
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.130
prior to that, I had
the in ear ones that

576
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:34.700
you use. And I use
the Etymotic sure headphones on

577
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.010
there, but I found for
long flights, if they, if

578
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.560
they were in for maybe
five, six, seven hours, then

579
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.750
they started to hurt a
little bit. I think they

580
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.360
expanded and contracted in my,
or whatever, according to the

581
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.270
pressure. And so then the
Bose ones fit over my

582
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.450
ears and much more comfortable
for longer. It's worth it

583
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.830
though. I mean, do you
feel that the, the not

584
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:55.790
hearing the deep humming of
the engine more Relaxed? I

585
00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.520
would say so. Yeah, definitely.
And what do you use

586
00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.170
to get there? Best seats
on the plane? I think

587
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.080
that, you know, getting exit
row seats or failing, getting

588
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.510
exit row seats, getting a
really good seat that reclines

589
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:10.250
not getting 36 G Yeah,
yeah. Infamousy that nobody wants,

590
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.200
right, right in the butt
of the plane. Well, there's

591
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.640
this site called seat guru.com,
which I use religiously to

592
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.020
help me find the best
seats on the plane. And

593
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:24.560
that tells you using a
heat map visually where in

594
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.600
the different classes of the
cabin, you're going to find

595
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.970
the best seats. And there's
some hidden gems on there.

596
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
There really are seats, which
you wouldn't expect to be

597
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.310
very good because they're located
in certain areas of the

598
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.710
plane. For example, the back
sometimes has some really good

599
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.340
seats and various other places.
And it will show you

600
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.670
according to not only the
aircraft, but also the airline,

601
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.540
because also remember airlines have
different configurations for different aircraft.

602
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.720
So it depends on those
two factors. So check it

603
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.630
out and you'll get really
good advice on where to

604
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.450
try and get a seat.
You would think that a

605
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.490
flight would be the same
just based on the name,

606
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.880
the, the kind of airplane,
but for example, on long

607
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.850
haul flights, sometimes they'll take
a number of rows in

608
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.680
the back on the right
side of the plane and

609
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.500
they'll cordon them off so
that the flight attendants can

610
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.020
have a private space exactly.
Then that prevents the seats

611
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.720
in front of them from
reclining. So if you, if

612
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.970
you're not careful, you can
certainly end up with a,

613
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.510
a very bad or worse
than normal flight yeah. Seat.

614
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.030
Exactly. And there's no excuse
really for not using this

615
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:29.240
tool in, in concert with
your checking online, because online

616
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.000
checking now features the ability
to pick a seat. And

617
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.040
so you should have this
window open where you're picking

618
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.410
your seat and also seat
guru open to find out

619
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.080
if you're actually getting the
best one Best way to

620
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.350
get a good seat, of
course, is to have some

621
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.810
status on the airline to
have flown enough, to build

622
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.320
up some miles and either
upgrade them or have enough

623
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.750
miles that they'll see you
coming and upgrade you. Yep.

624
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:54.190
You're pretty obsessive about this.
I know both with hotel

625
00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.700
points, we're both Starwood people.
Starwood is a hotel point

626
00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.200
system. And then also with
airlines. Yeah. Well, let's talk

627
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.650
about airlines first. I think
that one of the golden

628
00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.930
rules is where you live,
where you can have your

629
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.800
home hub is match that
up with the airlines home

630
00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.430
hub. So for example, I
live in Seattle, that is

631
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.820
the home hub for Alaska
airlines. So therefore it makes

632
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.750
sense that most flights that
I take or majority of

633
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.820
flights, I'll be able to
get out of Seattle with

634
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.340
Alaska going to various destinations.
And this varies, you know,

635
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.130
Atlanta will be Delta. I'm
not sure what Portland is

636
00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.800
or if it has a
hub burns Alaska. Right? So

637
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.870
that would, that's kind of
a golden rule. The other

638
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.750
thing to think about when
you're choosing which airline to

639
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.790
bank with, because it really
is a choice, you know,

640
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.070
you need to go whole
hog with one airline to

641
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:49.140
make maximum efficiency. The other
consideration is to having the

642
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.720
kind of the ones with
the biggest airline partners. So

643
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.330
I know that star Alliance,
for example, is an example

644
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.260
with an umbrella program where
it has lots of airlines

645
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.780
involved. So that's another thing
to think about. So try

646
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.360
and book with that airline
also make sure if they

647
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.670
have a credit card that
you can use to accrue

648
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.310
points, use that, make sure
you're taking all of the

649
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.760
advantages from that. And then
when it comes to hotels,

650
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:16.410
I think the industry recognizes
as, and that Starwood that

651
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.230
you mentioned has been like
the best hotel chain for

652
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.990
the last five, six, seven
years, Whatever it is, Starwood

653
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:26.010
includes Western and Sheridan and
a loft. And yeah, The

654
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.560
great thing about Sheraton, sorry.
The great thing about Starwood

655
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.050
is they have kind of
high end hotels and Regis

656
00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.820
is kind of their flagship
brand, but they go all

657
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.160
the way down to kind
of a loft and four

658
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.800
points, which have much, much
more affordable. So they've got

659
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.560
a great scale and these
points all accrue to the

660
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.870
same program. And then you
can use the points to

661
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.350
book, nice trips. You can
use the points to book

662
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.410
flights. You can use them
points to get money off

663
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.770
of hotel, stays, pay for
entire stays, et cetera, Business

664
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.990
traveler. This really makes your
life easier. And I'm only,

665
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.590
I think, regular silver this
year. I didn't go gold.

666
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.770
You're platinum though this year,
I really paid attention to

667
00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:03.480
it last year. You and
I are paying to be

668
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.390
clear the same price we
will. I've been traveling all

669
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.370
over the world with James
and we both walk into

670
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:11.370
hotels. We both pay the
same price, but what, what

671
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.950
are you getting that I'm
not okay. Well with platinum,

672
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.550
you get automatic upgrades. If
they're available, you get, I

673
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.310
think the latest perk is
that you get free wireless,

674
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.450
free internet access in the
hotels, 2,400 Australian dollars a

675
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.120
day for wifi. Yep. Which
I'm unfortunate, the company you

676
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.280
have to pay for, but
you're getting free wifi. And

677
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.190
we're sitting in a, in
a multi-room suite, you're paying

678
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.140
the same price I'm paying
for. And you've got a

679
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.600
fax and you've got a
view. You've got multiple paths

680
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.460
And oftentimes the hotel will
have a club and you

681
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.890
get access to the club
level where they have free

682
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.780
refreshments, free dinner. That's I
think that's where we're going

683
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.610
to go for food later
on. And of course, good

684
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.440
place to work and a
good place to work. Yeah.

685
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.500
So it's kind of a,
a great way to kind

686
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.200
of make the most of
your stay and getting that

687
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.570
platinum level is, is really
worth it. And I really

688
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.760
focused on making sure that
all of my stays no

689
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.430
matter where I was in
the world, I was hitting

690
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.330
a sh a Starwood property.
That's the trick. You would

691
00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.210
think that, wow, you guys
must travel a lot, but

692
00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.940
it's less about traveling a
lot more about the discipline.

693
00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.760
For example, I was at
mix In Vegas, right? So

694
00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.520
next conference in March, and
the difference between my stay

695
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.290
and your stay was that
you were staying in the

696
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.960
Mandalay Bay where the conference
was and you think, well,

697
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.720
that's a smart move because
it's conferences local. But I

698
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.570
was staying in the Western,
which is just down the

699
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.110
road, down the strip, maybe
five minutes away. But instead

700
00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.720
of not getting points like
you, I was getting my

701
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.410
points, which recruiting to my
platinum status. Exactly. And now

702
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.930
I'm kicking myself because if
I just had that five

703
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.840
minute walk, I would have
got these points. The point

704
00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.270
system is a nice way.
Also as a business traveler

705
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.220
to kind of give yourself
a perk in a very

706
00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.970
ethical way. Yep. The company
is paying for the room

707
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:51.220
because we're here on business.
But then a couple of

708
00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.200
times a year, you can
cash that in for weekends,

709
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.840
with the, with the wife.
Right? Exactly. And let's, let's

710
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.730
be, let's be Frank here.
I mean, this is work.

711
00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.770
I mean, we go around
the world, but we're away

712
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:03.490
from friends, family loved ones.
And, you know, whilst you're

713
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.830
traveling around the world, it's
kind of a lonely place.

714
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.200
But the great thing is
that whilst I'm away from

715
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.680
my girlfriend, I can also
treat her thanks to the

716
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.470
perks that I've picked up
with my stays to maybe

717
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:18.040
a weekend away, somewhere in
a nice hotel. All right.

718
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.040
So kind of wrapping it
up. There's tips on getting

719
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.040
to and from the airport,
remember carry on only don't

720
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.460
panic. If you forget anything,
use local trains and buses

721
00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.450
at the airport yep. At
the airport, make sure that

722
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:34.930
you're kind of fast and
efficient getting through security. Also

723
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:37.240
there's a, we didn't mention
there's a priority club. You

724
00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.110
can join to get into
airport lounges $99. I think

725
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.930
it is for the card.
I already task priority, pass.com

726
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.420
and that's 600 lounges around
the world. A very, very

727
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.160
good by making sure that
you make sure that you

728
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.800
check in online and get
the seat that you need.

729
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.280
You're using all of the
tools available to you on

730
00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.380
your laptop and also on
your mobile device. When you're

731
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.770
actually traveling around the airport,
speak the language of the

732
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.430
sky. As Scott said, make
sure that you're talking as

733
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:11.590
succinctly as possible. And also,
you know, there's important foreign

734
00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.410
phrases That will get you
out of scrapes. Right? Definitely

735
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.830
specific phrases to your situation
when you're on the plane,

736
00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.200
if you're in a long
haul, mentally segment that flight.

737
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.380
So you don't go insane
drink, lots of water helps

738
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.120
to know your flight attendants
to if you fly the

739
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.460
same segments, make sure you
know, the names, your flight

740
00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.850
attendants, you'd be surprised. The
benefits that that will accrue

741
00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:35.770
and then speaking of benefits.
Yeah. So speaking of benefits

742
00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:39.780
using miles for upgrades, I
w I'm a Starwood member.

743
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.550
I use all of those
things to make sure that

744
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.680
I get my upgrades. When
I go to hotels, I

745
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.740
can get free nights, money
off nights when I stay

746
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:53.130
for pleasure, making sure that
it's, you're using your airline

747
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.470
miles points system, making sure
that you've got the credit

748
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.590
card that's associated with the
program. So you've, you're building

749
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.260
up points and making sure
that you've taking full advantage

750
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.900
there and then tools that
you might want to use

751
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.680
