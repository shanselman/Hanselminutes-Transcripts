this is Scott Hanselman. This

13
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.140
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And today I'm talking

14
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.470
with gene yang. He is
an author and a writer

15
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.300
and a computer science teacher.
How are you? Good. Good.

16
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.400
Thank you for having me.
It's exciting to be here.

17
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.350
Absolutely. My pleasure. It's funny.
When you reached out to

18
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.900
talk to me about your,
your book that you're working

19
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.740
on, you, you were very
kind, you introduced yourself and

20
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.260
told me about your, I
knew all about you already,

21
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.170
because I was a fan
of a, of your book

22
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.100
and perhaps your most famous
book, American born Chinese. Yeah.

23
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.160
American born Chinese came out
in 2006. Now, when I

24
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.190
started that book, I'd been
doing comics for about five

25
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.250
years, but American born Chinese
was really the life changer.

26
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.280
It, it it's the reception
of that book was well

27
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.850
beyond anything I had imagined
possible. And it really, it

28
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.980
really changed things For me.
Is this one of those

29
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.340
examples of an overnight success
in a half a day?

30
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.590
Yeah, I guess so. I
guess so actually, you know,

31
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.110
cause I had been doing
comics for five years when

32
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.690
I started American born Chinese.
It took me five years

33
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.280
to do that book. So
by the time it came

34
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.920
out, I'd been in comics
for like 10 years. So

35
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.860
had been a full decade
before, before that book came

36
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.290
out, When that book came
out, was it something where

37
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.230
it happened organically? Because I
wonder sometimes like, are their

38
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.510
press people telling everyone about
your book or it's just

39
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.060
one of those things where
word of mouth happens? You

40
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.490
know, I am not totally
sure. So American born Chinese

41
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.770
was the very first book
that was published by my

42
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.400
current publisher. First second books,
which is a subset of

43
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.520
Macmillan. It's like an imprint
of Macmillan, one of the

44
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.070
major book publishers in the
world. And, and they are

45
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.670
very connected in to these
three different markets for comics.

46
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.130
So comics traditionally in America
have always been sold through

47
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.820
comic book stores. And then
within the last couple of

48
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.480
decades, they've started getting sold
in, in regular bookstores and

49
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.210
also to the library market.
So because of, of, of

50
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.050
where for second sits within
the marketplace, they have connections

51
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.360
to the comic book stores
to the regular bookstores until

52
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.730
the library market. And I
think that really helped me.

53
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.780
I think that helped me
tremendously. The, one of the

54
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.630
things that I've noticed, that's,
it's fairly obvious within the

55
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.630
themes of your book and
the, in the cover art

56
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.980
there's this sense of the,
and people will see this,

57
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.130
they can look in the
show notes, you see half

58
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.820
of the protagonists face, one
of the covers for American

59
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.440
born Chinese. You just see
the one side of the

60
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.980
person's face and another, but
two books, series, boxers and

61
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.050
saints. You have you, can
you see the half of

62
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.830
their face what's going on
there? Yeah, well I have

63
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.260
to be honest, that was
not my decision. I did

64
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.340
work with the designer on,
on those book covers, but

65
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.800
I am a terrible designer,
you know, I think I'm

66
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.710
okay at cartooning. I am
terrible as a graphic designer.

67
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.200
So for American born Chinese,
I worked with his very

68
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.650
talented designer named Danica Gorbachev.
Who's also a cartoonist herself.

69
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.050
She can do both, whereas
I can't and it was

70
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.660
her idea to do, to
do half the face. And

71
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.580
I think the idea behind
that was the book is

72
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.660
really about a negotiation of
identities and, and, and for

73
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.060
a lot of immigrants, kids,
it's, it's about taking two

74
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.790
halves of yourself and trying
to mesh them together, especially

75
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.670
when those two halves don't
always fit together. Well, you

76
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.600
know, and, and for, for
boxers and saints, because American

77
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.180
born Chinese had been so
well received. The idea behind

78
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.020
that book was to have
some kind of a recall

79
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.750
to American born Chinese so
people could see it and

80
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.880
tell that it was from
the same author. The, the

81
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.430
woman who designed that book
is named Coleen F Annabelle.

82
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.160
And she's the, both of
them, both Danica and Coleen

83
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.550
are absolutely amazing designers. I
was very lucky to have

84
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.590
them on my project. Yeah,
it's, it's a, it's a

85
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.100
very evocative way of expressing
what's going on here. You

86
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.960
know, it makes it really
clear that this is a

87
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.050
story about, you know, about
really that kind of a

88
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.410
number two it's it's there's,
there's multiple, there's two tales.

89
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.700
There's the second generation, there's
two halves, you know, it

90
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.430
was very dramatic in, in
boxers and saints and you

91
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.860
were kind enough to send
me a copy of that.

92
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.740
I've been sharing with my
sons. Thank you for reading

93
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.030
it. Yeah, absolutely. The, the
boxers boxers and saints tells

94
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.980
two sides of the boxer
rebellion during the Ching dynasty.

95
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.710
And I noticed that you
started to explore historical themes

96
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.320
in order to kind of
better understand yourself. It seems

97
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.740
like. I think so. I
mean, I first gotten interested

98
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.290
in the boxer rebellion in
the year 2000 that year,

99
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.680
Pope John Paul, the second canonized,
a group of Chinese Catholic

100
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.530
saints. And I grew up
in this Chinese American Catholic

101
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.690
community in the Bay area,
in the San Francisco Bay

102
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.660
area. My home church flipped
out about this cause this

103
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.540
is the first time, you
know, that the Roman Catholic

104
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.950
church, this deeply Western institution
had acknowledged Chinese citizens in

105
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.310
this way. And when I
looked into the lives of

106
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.560
these canonized saints, I discovered
that many of them were

107
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.520
murdered during the boxer rebellion
during this war that was

108
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.520
fought over a hundred years
ago in China. And I

109
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.060
barely remembered about the boxer
rebellion from high school history.

110
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.040
You know, I remember just
bits and pieces. I think

111
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.410
that's true for most American
students. We don't hear much

112
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.750
about the bucks rebelling, but
the more I studied this

113
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.450
war and the more I
realized that it really, it

114
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.350
really embodied this tension between
Eastern and Western ways of

115
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.170
being and thinking that I
felt in my own life

116
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.630
as a, as an Asian
American. And that's what I,

117
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.880
I just think that all
of my projects are kind

118
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.530
of ways of exploring my
own neuroses or the tensions

119
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.780
within my own life. That
may be, I think that's

120
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.300
probably true for every artist.
You know, that's part of

121
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.990
the reason why we do
our self therapy. Yeah. I

122
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.170
think every good artist is
neurotic and that drives them.

123
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.090
And it's also, but it's
also a sense of self

124
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.400
exploration. Yeah. Yeah. It is.
It is. Yeah. What exactly

125
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.830
am I doing here? And
it's interesting that this is

126
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.030
a Chinese Catholicism versus the
kind of traditional Chinese that

127
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.920
there's a duality there. Yeah.
There's the immigrant story and,

128
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.090
you know, being, how can
you be fully 100% American

129
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.660
and fully 100% Chinese at
the same time. Yeah. Yeah.

130
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.790
I think that is, I
also think, you know, in

131
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.020
the modern world, this tension
between identities is becoming more

132
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.240
and more of a thing,
not just for immigrant kids,

133
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.750
but, but just in general,
I think, I think computer

134
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.020
technology and social media have
really introduced this idea. You

135
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.570
know, most of us have
at least two identities. We

136
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.120
have the identity that we
are when we interact with

137
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.280
people face to face. And
then we have this other

138
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.290
identity that is often separate
that we maintain online. And

139
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.330
unfortunately, I feel like these
days people have forgetting who

140
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.880
they are because they are
so focused on trying to

141
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.320
be someone else, whether it
be Facebook likes or someone,

142
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.310
someone told me about this,
very, but not, not what's

143
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.770
the not neurotic, isn't the
word, but it's very narcissistic

144
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.590
idea of, you know, I've
gone to the top of

145
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.680
the mountain, I'm at the
top of the Himalayas selfie

146
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.350
and then, you know, hashtag
peaceful. And it's just like,

147
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.250
wow, what, what a horrible
way to be? How do

148
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.060
we teach our kids about
the past and not, not

149
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.440
focusing on that kind of
quick. Yeah, I have to

150
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.410
tell ya. I agree that
it's horrible, but I also

151
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.700
deeply feel that temptation, you
know, I think, I think

152
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.100
I have to force myself
these days to be present,

153
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.620
to be present in my,
in my body, as opposed

154
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.680
to just in my mind,
in the screen. I I've

155
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.420
noticed when I hang out
with my kids, you know,

156
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.600
sometimes I'll like have the
impulse to take a picture

157
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.280
of them as opposed to
just look at them with

158
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.280
my own two eyes. It's
kind of a thing. I,

159
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.140
it's kind of a thing
that I struggle with nowadays.

160
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.690
Yeah. That is a challenge.
And, and I think it's,

161
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.260
it is only going to
continue the more, the more

162
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.810
computerized the things get. And
you probably see this because

163
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.770
now, even though you are
a successful and a very

164
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.000
well thought of artist and
writer, you are still teaching

165
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.450
high school. Is that true?
I am. I am. I

166
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.520
teach at Bishop O'Dowd high
school, which is a Catholic

167
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.810
school in Oakland, California. I've
been there since 1998. So

168
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.820
I've been there forever. I've
been there a long, long

169
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.400
time. I started off as
a, as a full time

170
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.360
teacher. I've taught mostly computer
science there. I've taught a

171
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.890
little bit of math and
a little bit of art,

172
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.010
but mostly computer science. And
nowadays I'm down to just

173
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.830
one class. I have one
class of introductory computer science.

174
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.560
I used to also teach
the AP class, but as

175
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.510
my life has gotten busy,
I've had to give that

176
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.960
up. So you've got an
interesting perspective kind of if

177
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.170
historically, you've been doing this
now, what, how many years

178
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.110
is that? 16 years. Yeah.
It's a long time. 16,

179
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.590
17 years. Yeah. It's been
kind of crazy. Yeah. When

180
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.040
I started teaching, I was
teaching Pascal Pascal. I liked

181
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.640
turbo Pascal or Delphi. It
was, I think it was

182
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.680
turbo. I think it was
turbo. It was, I only

183
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.060
did it for a year.
I only did it for

184
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.030
a year. And then we
switched over to C plus

185
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.470
plus I did that for
a number of years and

186
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.400
now we're on Java. And
so you've got a, an

187
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.040
interesting historical context cause you've
watched a bunch of different

188
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.510
high schoolers change technologies. You've
watched the technology world change.

189
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.360
You've watched the rise of
social media. You could probably

190
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.360
tell what was a 15
year old, like in 98

191
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.230
versus a 15 year old
today. Very different concerns. Yeah,

192
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.300
it really is. It really
is. When, you know, one

193
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.420
of the big differences I've
noticed with my students is

194
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.680
their desire to drive. You
know, when I first got

195
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.630
there, the kids were like
me, when I was a

196
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.350
teenager, they desperately wanted their
driver's licenses. And now I

197
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.960
feel like that desire has
kind of a rapper rated.

198
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.240
And I wonder if like,
like most of my students

199
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.140
now, they don't mind not
getting their driver's licenses as

200
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.480
soon as they turn 16,
you know, some of them

201
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.360
don't ever want it ever.
And I wonder if that

202
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.380
has something to do with
the internet and how available

203
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.350
things become through the internet
for us back in the

204
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.940
day, if I wanted comic
books, I had to drive

205
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.560
the little complex store. Now
it is, I can just

206
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.040
download a comic book from
Comixology. Yeah. That, that, you

207
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.410
know, it's interesting. You're the,
you're now the second person

208
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.320
in two weeks to say
that. And the first person

209
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.500
said that I was like,
no, that can't be right.

210
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.070
And now it's been confirmed
scientifically because you've said it

211
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.800
to people because two people
have said it. So it's

212
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.340
now it's a thing. And
that's really true. All I

213
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.970
wanted to do in the
late eighties was drive because

214
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.020
it being anywhere, but here.
Yeah. And it's a freedom,

215
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.510
but I feel like maybe,
maybe the internet gives us

216
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.880
that same sort of freedom
as, as driving used to.

217
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.370
And I used to drive
to the comic book store

218
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.900
and I used to have
a box at the comic

219
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:48.110
bookstore. That's right. A pull
list. That's right Now you're

220
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.540
working on a new book.
I gotta understand that you're

221
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.370
just getting started and it's
still going. It's going to

222
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.550
be awhile before this comes
out. It's called secret coders.

223
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.480
It'll be out next September.
And the way the book

224
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.240
world works is you finish
a book and then almost

225
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.660
a year later it'll come
out. So I finished writing

226
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.020
it. I'm working with this
amazing cartoonist named Mike Holmes. So

227
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.730
I have some books where
I do both the writing

228
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.890
and the drawing. This is
a project where I'm only

229
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.100
doing the writing and Mike
is doing the drawing. He's

230
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.700
probably most well known for
his work on bravest warriors.

231
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.190
Have you ever seen that
show? Yeah, there's a comic

232
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.590
that goes along with it.
And Mike was the primary

233
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.830
illustrator on that comic for,
for awhile now. That's great.

234
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.280
The bravest warriors was a,
was a three, three seasons

235
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.130
of bravest Wars. I think
so I think so it

236
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.080
was the same guy who
it was created by the

237
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.590
same guy who did a
adventure time. Pendleton ward. Yeah,

238
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.290
that's right. Andy and Mike
worked with Pendleton on, on

239
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.530
this comic, but he's, he's
just, he's phenomenal. He's phenomenal.

240
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.760
Secret coders kind of represents
the coming together of my

241
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.080
two worlds. I began drawing
comics and I began programming

242
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.650
both in the fifth grade,
you know? And then in

243
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.900
college I majored in computer
science and I minored in

244
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.020
creative writing. My creative writing
minor was all about eventually

245
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.170
writing comic books and all
the way through. I've always

246
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.480
wanted to bring these two
things together, but they never

247
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.600
quite fit until now. So
secret coders is a, is

248
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.530
a, is a series of
graphic novels meant for middle

249
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.980
school kids, kids in fifth,
sixth, seventh grade, all about

250
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.370
coding. And the way we're
pitching it is we're saying

251
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.160
that it's a lot like
Harry Potter, you know, in Harry Potter,

252
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.500
a bunch of tween kids
find this secret school that

253
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.140
teaches the magic zone. Our
story, a bunch of twin

254
00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.510
kids find the secret school,
but the secret school, instead

255
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.990
of teaching magic teaches coding.
And we're hoping that as

256
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.320
the readers follow our protagonists
through their journey, into becoming

257
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.490
coders, that they themselves will
become coders as well. I've

258
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.540
always thought that people who,
who never learned to code,

259
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.280
whether it be, you know,
I don't know if you

260
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.580
have this situation where maybe
your neighbors aren't a hundred

261
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.590
percent sure what you do,
but they know that you're

262
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.510
kind of a nerd. So
you may be at like

263
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.230
the local homeowners association and
then you'll have a conversation

264
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.020
with someone you've just met
and they'll go, Oh, you're

265
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:06.120
a computer person. And then
immediately you've become Other. Yeah,

266
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.260
yeah. Yeah. Well, you know,
gene knows the mysteries of

267
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.720
secret coding and I, I'll
never be one of those

268
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.530
people and they've simultaneously set
you apart, but they've also

269
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.070
basically disempowered themselves because they've
just declared that they'll never

270
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.490
be a programmer. They'll never
understand computers. Yeah, that's right.

271
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.890
That's right. And what they
don't realize is that the,

272
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.120
the, the building blocks of
coding are very, very simple.

273
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.360
You know, it's really all
about building these incredibly complex

274
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.800
things with very simple pieces.
And, and I really, I

275
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.900
firmly believe, I don't believe
that everybody should be a

276
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.410
professional coder, but I do
believe that every single human

277
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.590
being ought to learn a
little bit of coding sometime

278
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.340
during their education. I just
think it's no matter what

279
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.340
you do as an adult,
you are going to come

280
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.710
into contact with coders. You
know, you're going to have

281
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.740
to learn to communicate with
coders and having a basic

282
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.600
understanding of that discipline is
just so important. Right. And

283
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.510
it's not necessarily going out
to the command prompt. I

284
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.090
think it's, it's four loops
and it's the basics. It

285
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.020
might be an Excel macro.
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Just

286
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.890
mastering those three basic control
structures and figuring out how

287
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.590
to, I mean, it's really
about logic, right. And I

288
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.530
think when I was in,
when I was in fifth

289
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.650
grade and I first learned
coding, it was in logo.

290
00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.810
You remember logo? I went
on an Apple too. I

291
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.150
think you and I are
the same age. Yeah, that's

292
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.740
right. I learned them on
an Apple too as well.

293
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.430
And that's actually the language
that, that they learned in

294
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:37.660
secret coders too. I'm using
logo, not just because I

295
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.420
have a deep, you know,
pre logical love of it,

296
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.990
but also because nowadays it
has this weird ancient mystique

297
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.320
to it, you know, it's
kind of slightly forgotten. You

298
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.050
just said we were ancient.
Yeah. We kind of are

299
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.480
though. We kind of are,
especially in computer years, we

300
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.250
absolutely are. But what fascinated
me about logo is it

301
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.840
was like magic. You take
these very simple commands and

302
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.700
you get a picture out
of it, you know, and

303
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.080
there's something magic about translating
words into something visual or

304
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.780
into, into something that's active.
I don't know if you

305
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.150
have this in your logo
class, but in the, in

306
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.130
the eighties, when I was
doing that, just like we

307
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.100
have Arduinos and robot kits,
you know, today they would

308
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.340
give us a big, giant
long 25 pin ribbon cable.

309
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.730
That was probably, Oh gosh,
you know, 10, 15 feet

310
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.560
long. And we would plug
in a robot and a

311
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.780
Sharpie and we would take
our logo and we'd drive

312
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.330
it around on a piece
of butcher paper. And really

313
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.330
the only thing that's changed
in 25 years is Bluetooth

314
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.320
and wifi. But it's fundamentally
the same idea is there.

315
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.920
Yeah. I was not lucky
enough to have a mechanical

316
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.770
turtle. The turtles that I
used were all on screen,

317
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.470
all on screen, but I
saw pictures, you know, they

318
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.020
had photos of the mechanical
turtles in our textbooks and

319
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.820
I was always very jealous
of the kids that kind

320
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.520
of, We only had the
one and we were told

321
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.020
to be very careful. We
also only had the one

322
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.930
Apple two as well. Yeah.
One of the things that

323
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.000
I think is an interesting
parallel, you pointed out that

324
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.930
secret coders is kind of
like Harry Potter is I feel

325
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.400
that it's these themes of
growing up and feeling disempowered.

326
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.300
I mean, Harry started out
feeling like all power was

327
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.180
taken away from him. His,
his adoptive parents took all

328
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.320
his power away and then
he discovered his power. Yeah.

329
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.990
Yeah. What I, what I
tell my students is that,

330
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.280
you know, often the best
coders are people who are

331
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.760
kind of control freaks because
when you're, when you're knee

332
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.160
deep in a program, you
have full control over it.

333
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.600
You have control over the
design and the execution. And,

334
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.270
and there's something very empowering
about that. I see that

335
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.600
with my students as well.
I think, I think coding

336
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.690
has a way of bringing
out a certain aspect of

337
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.790
personality with some of my
students. Some of my students

338
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.260
who are very quiet, who
may not necessarily feel engaged

339
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.570
in their other subjects. When
they sit down in front

340
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.520
of a computer, when they're
in this environment where they

341
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.010
have full control, it really
brings out something in them.

342
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.350
And it's great to see.
It's really empowering to see

343
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.960
there's that programmers high that
you get, right? When you,

344
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.270
when you crack a program,
when you, when you figure

345
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.420
out a very elegant way
of, of, of solving a

346
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.420
problem, you get this little
rush. And, and that's what

347
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.520
I like to see as
a teacher in my students.

348
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.350
I, I, A little frustrated
sometimes when I meet kids

349
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.810
that I, I, I feel
like if you would just

350
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.500
listen, maybe this is for
you. And, but they've already

351
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.140
decided at some point in
their growing up that not,

352
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.110
I'm not a computer person,
like we've already determined this

353
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.320
at age eight or age
nine. They it's, the whole

354
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.800
kind of math is hard
myth. The first time a

355
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.870
kid says that you've got
a couple of minutes to

356
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.730
get in there and say,
no, no, no, we can

357
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.640
make this fun for you.
But if, if they've internalized

358
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.420
that tape and started replaying
it, then they'll never get

359
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.120
back Then it's yeah, it's
kind of harder. And I

360
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.830
think what they don't realize
is there are lots of

361
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.200
different ways of being a
computer person. There's not just

362
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.130
one way, you know, there's,
there's, there's hardware, there's software.

363
00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.860
There's. I mean, you can,
you can be a computer

364
00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.830
person and only be into
Photoshop. It's Photoshop is such

365
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.860
a deep tool, you know?
And, and there are so,

366
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.640
so many ways of applying
a programmer's mindset to what

367
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.400
you do in Photoshop. And
the same can be said

368
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.270
of almost any other application
out there. There's lots of

369
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.340
ways of being a computer
person. I think you just,

370
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.370
you just totally opened my,
you just totally opened my

371
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.500
mind there for a second,
because it's one of those

372
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:30.140
amazing and obvious statements that
you just said, like, you

373
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.270
could be a computer person,
you could be a programmer.

374
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.900
And the app that you
program is Photoshop. You're, you

375
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.900
know, making a cause you
can make in Photoshop, you

376
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.300
know, effects that are layered
on top of each other,

377
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.100
you can program it and
then built and then hand

378
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.650
them to someone and say,
here's my effects pack. Or

379
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.120
even simply building actions within,
within a photo And distributing

380
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.170
actions. I actually, for this
podcast, when we're done, I

381
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.230
will ask you for a
headshot that I'll put on

382
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.780
the website, and then I
will run an Instagram of

383
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.670
fi action in Photoshop that
I didn't write. And even

384
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.830
though I've been programming for
20 years, I have no

385
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.470
idea how it works And
it doesn't matter. It's a

386
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.350
black box to you. It's
magic. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

387
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.540
It's magic. But it is
going to give me a

388
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.820
level of power that I
did not have before I

389
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.990
learned how to do actions
in, in Photoshop. So you

390
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.240
said that you are teaching
only a class now, is

391
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.460
that something that you're going
to give up or are

392
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.470
you hanging on to that
last class? Cause you don't

393
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.800
want to give it up?
I love, I love education.

394
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.720
You know, I think I'm
just as much of a

395
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.300
teacher as I am a
cartoonist, if not more so,

396
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.320
so I hope to be
involved in education for as

397
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.910
long as I can, you
know, for all of my

398
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.330
career that could change that,
that the format of that

399
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.470
could change. But I hope
to be involved at least

400
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.770
in some way, the program
class, isn't the only place

401
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.230
where I teach. I also
teach creative writing through Hamlin

402
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.260
university, which is based out
of Minnesota. I teach through

403
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.890
their online program. It's an
MFA program focusing on writing

404
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.100
for children and young adults.
So most of the faculty

405
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.800
are novelists and poets and
picture book writers. I'm the

406
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.190
only comic book guy, but
it's, I've been doing that

407
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.440
for three years. Most of
my teaching there is online

408
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.800
and it's been amazing. Do
you think you would self

409
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.940
identify primarily as a teacher?
Maybe, I guess it depends

410
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.370
on who I'm talking to.
You know, I guess when

411
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.470
I fill out what I
felt at legal forums, I'll

412
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.600
always write down on my
teacher. I think writing down

413
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.340
that I'm a cartoon, this
is a little bit harder

414
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.700
to explain. That'd be pretty
cool to be able to

415
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.530
say to the IRS job
cartoonist. And there are people

416
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.600
who do that. There are
people who do that. Yeah.

417
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.970
Yeah. I, I kind of
came to terms with this

418
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.190
idea that I was a
teacher and I went and

419
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.930
updated my resume and all
that kind of stuff a

420
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.840
couple of years back because
well, people see me as

421
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.040
a programmer. Ultimately, whether I
am actively teaching, I either

422
00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.620
wish I was teaching, you
know, hope I was teaching

423
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.510
aim to teach at some
point in the future or

424
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.790
in everything that I do.
There should be an element

425
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.550
of teaching. Yeah. I think
I see that with Lister

426
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.800
joining with the, with this
podcast and with your blog,

427
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:05.760
I think there's definitely a
teaching element to all that.

428
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:10.080
Yeah. I definitely felt like
particularly the book, boxers and

429
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.300
saints while my wife was
a fellow was a little

430
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.210
violent for the kids. My
kids are seven and nine.

431
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.500
Well, we skipped over a
few, a few headings, but

432
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.560
what was interesting about it
was it really started to

433
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.900
bring up a conversation with
my nine year old, particularly

434
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.830
about fiction versus nonfiction because
he had decided in his

435
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.800
mind that fiction was the
only good thing in the

436
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.680
world because it was, you
know, kind of infinitely interesting.

437
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.960
And you could always do
things, but he didn't really

438
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.600
get a sense of the
scope of the past. So

439
00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.210
then we started talking about
the boxer rebellion and how

440
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.330
long ago it was and
how this was fictional story

441
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.050
about a nonfiction thing. That
duality was really interesting and

442
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.810
it got him very interested
in history. Oh good. That's

443
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.800
great. That's great. I have
a son he's 11 now,

444
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.750
but he was nine when
I finished the book and

445
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.430
I didn't let him read
it because of the violence,

446
00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.890
but he snuck it away
from me. You know what?

447
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.330
I had my proof sitting
on my desk and he

448
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.620
just stuck the whole thing
away from me. You read

449
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.450
the whole thing. He's like,
dad, it's not that bad.

450
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.140
What's wrong. But, but I,
you know, historical fiction is

451
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.410
something that I'm very interested
in nowadays. And I think

452
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.400
it really can serve as
this on-ramp to, to just

453
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.030
plain old nonfiction, which is
also something I think most

454
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.140
of my reading nowadays is
the nonfiction. But, but I,

455
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.400
I think that's something very
important for kids to realize

456
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.910
is that often the best
stories actually happen. They actually

457
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.390
happened in the past. Yeah.
I think that that's so

458
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.930
important for kids to understand
that, that historical context. And

459
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.430
I have tried to apply
that in everything that I

460
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.390
do, you were saying how
you taught Pascal for a

461
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.940
while there, maybe you don't
teach it anymore, but I'll

462
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.300
that when you do talk
about computer science, from what

463
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.940
I've learned about you today,
you probably talk about the

464
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.480
historical context and, you know,
see an assembler come up

465
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.460
and like, well, why did
they do that in the

466
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.150
sixties? And Yeah, we do
talk a little bit about

467
00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.360
that. About like, in my
introduction to Java, we talk

468
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.390
about what the reasoning behind
the Java virtual machine is

469
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.320
and what, what problem that
was supposed to solve. I

470
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.450
don't know how that goes
across with the students, but

471
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.180
It's funny, like when you
do end up talking to

472
00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.400
kids about the, you know,
the history, their eyes kind

473
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.160
of glaze over, but I've
always had this theory that

474
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.280
if I can just get
that one or that two,

475
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.870
like I'll be in a
room of 30 kids. I

476
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.440
do an exploring engineering class
at the local community college.

477
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.990
And I just keep looking
for a face to light

478
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.700
up because even though I'm
not going to get all

479
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.390
30 of them. Oh, he,
he got it. Oh, she

480
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.370
got it. Okay. Now I'm
going to look at YouTube

481
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.340
because something just clicked and
you're going to go home

482
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.800
and take apart your toaster.
Yeah, that's right. That's the

483
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.940
teacher's high right there. That
little click is the teacher's

484
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.710
high. You know, now in
talking to you, I wonder

485
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.590
if I should, I should
put my discussion on the

486
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.250
push my discussion on the
Java virtual machine a little

487
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.160
bit further back, because I
wonder if, I think what

488
00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.730
interests us is when we
talk about history in relation

489
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.520
to ourselves, you know, and
the Java virtual machine and

490
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.620
the problem that that's supposed
to solve, that's something that

491
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.440
maybe you need to experience
as a coder before you

492
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.110
can really appreciate what sun
was trying to do. Well,

493
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.470
I've always believed that when
teaching there needs to be

494
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:19.300
an element of, of suffering,
not capital. That's great. Yeah.

495
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.600
That's a great, great way.
You know, before, like I'll

496
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.980
give you a couple of
examples that I use in

497
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.670
my class. My son wants
a digital watch. You can't

498
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.230
have a digital watch until
you learn to do an

499
00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.840
analog watch because you're going
to suffer first. And then

500
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.370
I will tell you what,
and it does digital watch

501
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.790
works. When he learns how
to drive presuming he does

502
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.410
want to learn how to
drive. He will drive a

503
00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.100
stick because you got to
drive a stick because you

504
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.050
learn how the car works.
Otherwise you're going to be,

505
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.720
and I always make my
dad said, otherwise, someone's gonna

506
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.250
break their leg. You're gonna
have to drive them to

507
00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.190
the hospital. The only car
available is a stick. It's

508
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.340
going to lose his leg.
Yeah, that's great. I have

509
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.290
to tell you, I learned
on an automatic. My wife

510
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.390
taught me how to drive
a stick. Do you know

511
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.010
though? And that's good. I'm
glad that you finally learned

512
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.350
how to do that. And
I think that, you know,

513
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.960
if you're going to get
memory management and a virtual

514
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.240
machine, well, you need to
first tidy up your own

515
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.250
memory, you know, before we
get someone to clean your

516
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.530
room, you need to clean
your own room. Yeah, that's

517
00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.690
right. That's fine. I like
to say that we are

518
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:18.190
abstracting on this show on
the shoulders of giants. Yeah.

519
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.810
That's a, that's, that's a
great way of putting it

520
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.700
too. I think that, I
think that knowledge has kind

521
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.830
of just built that way.
Right? Everything that, you know,

522
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.870
everything that you come up
with is built on the

523
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.810
work of somebody else. And
I feel like that's true

524
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:32.320
of programmers and cartoonists that
the language that we use

525
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.680
in modern cartooning is built
on things that people invented

526
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.100
a century ago. Do you
explore that with him? Wasn't

527
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.630
there a really, there was
a, there was a book

528
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:44.250
about cartooning. It was it's
of like considered like the

529
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.770
book, Understanding comics by Scott
McCloud. That book I read

530
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.670
when I was just finishing
up my teenage years. And

531
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.680
I feel like if I
did not read that book,

532
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.080
I would not be drawing
comics today. That book blew

533
00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.530
my mind. Yeah. It, it,
I, I kind of suspected

534
00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.590
as much because there's, there's
elements that I wouldn't say

535
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.130
tropes because that's trope is
become a negative word, but

536
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.130
there are, there are thematic
and dramatic elements and how

537
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.310
you use white space and
the edge of the frame.

538
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.250
And I'm assuming this is
a collaboration with you and

539
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.110
whatever artists that you're working
with on the book that

540
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.350
you're working on, because there's
an evocative sense of like,

541
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.660
this is what this frame
needs to make the person

542
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:29.510
feel. Absolutely. Absolutely. And you're
drawing on, on established language,

543
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.960
right? So we we've had
over a century of modern

544
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.160
cartooning and, and like what
word balloons mean? What certain

545
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.050
fonts mean, what certain colors
mean? All of that is

546
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.860
sort of an established tradition.
So when I make a

547
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.920
comic, I am both trying
to respect things that have

548
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.890
come before me and hopefully
maybe pushing into some new

549
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.530
territory as well. I think
that's true of any modern,

550
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:56.720
cartoonist understanding comics by Scott
McCloud. Scott McCloud is like,

551
00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.090
I, I feel like for
him, he sort of sits

552
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:02.150
in that in between space
to between computers and, and

553
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:07.100
or technology and comics. His
dad was a physicist and

554
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.710
he has a very, very
technical mind. Scott has a

555
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.040
very technical mind. He approaches
comics in this very technical

556
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.410
way, which I think really
appealed to me too, as,

557
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.420
as a computer nerd and
a, and a comic book

558
00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.550
nerd. Why do you think
that what he's done with

559
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.390
exploring comics is easy. He's
pulled out all of the,

560
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.910
kind of the, the, the,
the essence of it. He's

561
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.550
nailed it down to like,
this is modern 20th century

562
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.540
comics A little bit. Yeah.
He's begun the discussion on

563
00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.840
it. I think, I think
that, you know, in the

564
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.530
same way, in the same
way that a language, a

565
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.080
programming language is defined by
these very, very basic commands.

566
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.450
And that's what he did.
He, he came up with

567
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.600
the very basic commands that
make up the comics line.

568
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.240
Right. Right. I think that,
I don't know if this

569
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.250
is a weak parallel. What
I also think about like

570
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:56.270
how, when Joseph Campbell kind of
pulled out the hero's journey,

571
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.120
and then you say, look
at star Wars. This is,

572
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.090
this is the Greek mythology
here. Here's the hero's journey.

573
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.030
And this is again, the
word trope gets overused, but

574
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.040
these are the tools that
we use to tell a

575
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.340
compelling narrative. Yeah. Yeah. I
think it's exactly that. I

576
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.980
think it's exactly that. And
I think that that's maybe

577
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.130
why that's one of the
things that attracts me to

578
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:20.060
both of these disciplines, to
both comics and coding is

579
00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.490
that in both of these
disciplines, you take very simple

580
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.150
pieces and you build, you
can build very, very complex

581
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.270
things with them to the
point where, when you're looking

582
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.400
at the final complexity, it's
very difficult to see the

583
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.360
simple pieces that underneath, right.
That's something magic. Think of

584
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.900
that, that comics. And also
people say graphic novels as

585
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.460
a way of somehow like
legitimizing comments, You know, what

586
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.080
do you say to a
parent who might be listening?

587
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.610
Who's like, you know, I
don't really want my kid

588
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.830
reading. X-Men. I mean, this
is not really a legitimate

589
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.800
art form. This is not
a book. Well, I have

590
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.470
to say that that graphic
novel the term, it's a

591
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.530
very clunky term. It's not
awesome because it's a lot

592
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.290
of the things that we
call graphic novels these days

593
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:04.120
are not actually novels. We
call collections of short stories,

594
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.630
told in comics form graphic
novels. We call nonfiction comics,

595
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.180
graphic novels. But at the
same time, that term graphic

596
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.150
novel has done its job.
The legend is that it

597
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.600
was come up with, by,
by a guy named will

598
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.320
Eisner, a cartoonist who did
a, a strip called the

599
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.310
spirit in the 1940s. Well,
Isaiah is incredibly incredibly influential

600
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.770
within American comics. He's one
of the first guys to

601
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:31.030
bring cinematic storytelling techniques into,
into American comics. In the

602
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.580
1970s, he came up with
these short stories that were

603
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.530
based on his own childhood.
He grew up in this

604
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.290
Jewish neighborhood in New York. And
when he tried to sell

605
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.660
it, he would tell publishers,
you know, I have this

606
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.380
collection of short stories about
these Jewish kids and it's

607
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.140
told in comic format and
nobody wanted it. And then

608
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.840
he started saying, you know,
I have this graphic novel

609
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.240
about this, these Jewish kids
growing up in New York. And

610
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.210
he was able to pick
up a publisher. So from

611
00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.180
the beginning, graphic novels has
been this way of separating

612
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.190
comics from like the, the
biases and the stereotypes that

613
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.730
the American audience has of
the, of the medium and

614
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.700
will Eisner is who the
Eisner award was named for.

615
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.360
And exactly American born Chinese.
If I remember correctly won

616
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.480
the Eisner award and yeah,
that's right. That was, it

617
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.490
was a crazy night. It
was a crazy night. I

618
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.740
got to shake Neil Gaiman's
hand. He was the one

619
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.050
that presented it to me.
It was awesome. That's amazing.

620
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.180
Yeah. Yeah. It was, it
was pretty amazing. It was

621
00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.050
pretty amazing. So people can
go to gene yang.com. They

622
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.330
can learn about your comics
events. You do go to

623
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.180
comic con. Sometimes people can
meet you. I go almost

624
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.390
every year. That's right. That's
very exciting. And people may

625
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.460
see you in places that
they might not expect. Like,

626
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.300
for example, you did the
comics continuation of the Nickelodeon

627
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.150
cartoon avatar. So if your
kids love avatar, this could

628
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.300
be an OnRamp into the
world of gene yang. Have

629
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.210
you seen that show avatar
last Airbender? My kids love

630
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.660
it. They're absolutely obsessed. Yeah.
It's been a thrill to

631
00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.280
work on that. I was
just a fan. When the,

632
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.050
when the show was airing
on Nickelodeon, I was just

633
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.720
the fan, you know, and
I remember the very last

634
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.980
episode, Zuko confronts his dad
and goes what happened to

635
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.470
my mother? And then the
scene cuts. And I freaked

636
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.570
out, like, why don't you
tell us? And to think

637
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:12.040
that, you know, three years
later, I'm part of the

638
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.290
team that's answering that question.
It's been, it's been a

639
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.520
really amazing, that's amazing. That's
amazing. Folks can also keep

640
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.490
an eye out for secret
coders. It's coming out next

641
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.980
year. And if, if you'll
come back on the show

642
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.770
closer to the release in
September of 2015, I would

643
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.080
love to have you back.
I would love to be

644
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.230
back. Thank you, Scott. This
has been another episode of

645
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:41.100
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week. <inaudible>.
