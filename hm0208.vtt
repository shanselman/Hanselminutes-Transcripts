7
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.390
East strategy development manager, Jade
Bailey. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.400
Hanselman, and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes, and

9
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.750
I'm here in the beautiful
wind Las Vegas casino. And

10
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.670
I'm sitting down and in
fact, with Jade Bailey, who

11
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.460
is in charge of social
media for, for the, the

12
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.190
resort, is that, is that
true? Yes, that's correct. So

13
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.110
yeah, this is interesting to
me in a couple of

14
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.020
levels, you have a social
media strategy because you're not

15
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.320
just a PR person. Your
title is what is it?

16
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.960
Director of sales, It's East
strategy development manager Development manager.

17
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.860
And how does one get
a job like that? It

18
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.380
was sort of an evolution
for me. I started off

19
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.140
with when as a, in
a, in a public relations

20
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.790
capacity and sort of grew
into this role. And originally

21
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.980
it was a lot more
broad than social media. It

22
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.550
was all online strategy development.
So it included some of

23
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.780
the analytics for our website
and also our mobile strategy.

24
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.240
And then social media was
a component of it, which

25
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.580
was a really, really good
fit. And we saw that

26
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.770
there was a need for
more and more social media

27
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.960
activity. And that's how I
ended up spending most of

28
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.930
my time. So this role
sort of was a natural

29
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.680
progression for me. When did,
when as an organization start

30
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.870
to realize that social media
was going to be something

31
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.330
and we didn't when we
realize it or did it,

32
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.090
was it a kind of
a grassroots We knew, we

33
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.890
realized that there was a
need for it for a

34
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.060
long time. However, we're, we're,
we're a big brand, we're

35
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.880
a luxury brand. And the
way that we were, the

36
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.950
way that you have to
communicate in social media, it

37
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.610
was a departure for the
way that we were, nor

38
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.730
we normally communicate with our
guests. So because it was

39
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.350
new and, you know, the
brand has a lot of

40
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.680
equity. It was, it was
something that we proceeded with

41
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.800
caution. So we spent a
lot of time looking at

42
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.780
whether I was really doing
and monitoring and sort of

43
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.140
eyeing the pool before jumping
in. So I'm hearing kind

44
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.720
of underneath that, that, that
there might've been some concern

45
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.600
that with, with a brand
of, of the stature and

46
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.370
of the quality of the
guests that you expect, that

47
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.850
it might cheapen the brand
by introducing, you know, Twitter

48
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.360
or Facebook, these kind of
young hip and unproven things.

49
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.480
Exactly that. And also there
was, there was a fear

50
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.060
of, because, because of the
immediacy of social media, you

51
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.580
know, for example, we have,
we have a four nightclubs

52
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.090
or three nightclubs at when
an Encore and people wait

53
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.250
on people, wait on line
at the nightclubs to get

54
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.530
in until two in the
morning. And what would happen

55
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.350
if an angry club goer
sent a tweet at one

56
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.300
o'clock in the morning and
was like, this place stinks.

57
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.340
Like I can't get in,
you know, how would we,

58
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.930
how would we see that?
And how would we fix

59
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.660
it with the level of
service that we are accustomed

60
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.860
to, and that we have
promised to our guests, And

61
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.320
do you run multiple Twitter
accounts and is Twitter your

62
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.950
primary way of using social
media? We run, we currently

63
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.980
run two Twitter accounts because
we have two hotels. So

64
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.170
one for win. And one
for Encore, which is the

65
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.290
sister hotel and the wind
collection. We have Facebook fan

66
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.710
pages for both Wynn and
Encore. We have a YouTube

67
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.730
channel for wind resorts, and
we, we are active participants

68
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.220
in a lot of the
user generated content sites, such

69
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.790
as Yelp and TripAdvisor, which
are, which are very important

70
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.030
for our business. Can you
juxtapose, like how you would

71
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.340
use a fan page on
Facebook with how you use

72
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.370
you use Twitter? Is it
is a fan page. I

73
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.180
mean, someone clicks I'm a
fan, so what, right. How

74
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.460
are they engaging with it?
It is engaging with the

75
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.950
brand there's engaging between with
the customer service and the

76
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.850
personalities behind the brand. What
kind of communication goes out

77
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.620
on a fan page versus
what kinda communication goes on

78
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.830
on Twitter? It's actually really
interesting that you asked that

79
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.260
because I often think how
are Twitter and Facebook different?

80
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.200
And they, I know that
they distinctly are, but something

81
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.170
really interesting happened to us
on Facebook recently that had

82
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.020
hasn't yet to happen on
Twitter. And I posted a,

83
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.270
I posted a picture of
a shoe from one of

84
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.430
our, one of, one of
our boutiques here. And we

85
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.950
have a lot of very
expensive things that win. And

86
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.170
so this was a very
expensive shoe and a couple

87
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.090
of guests have written back,
Oh, it's so beautiful. It's

88
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.370
so beautiful. And then one
woman wrote, Oh, this is

89
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.830
a great shoe. I'm coming
to win this weekend. I'm

90
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.290
going to call Troy who
I know works there. And

91
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.420
then I, I, I, you
know, I looked away for

92
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.010
a little while and then
I checked back a few

93
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.460
hours later in Troy, the
employee saw it and he

94
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.290
remembered this gas and he
was like, hi, I'll be

95
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.660
there from this hour to
this hour. This is a

96
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.150
limited collection shoe. We only
have 12 of them. Ladies,

97
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.880
if you want a pair
call, you know, call me

98
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.430
and I'll ship them to
you. And I was flabbergasted.

99
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.200
I was like, this is
the best example of an

100
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.620
employee actively engaging in, in
social media. Yeah. Well, and

101
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.350
was this just something, it
was Troy and empowered to

102
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.900
do that as an employee?
Is there like a blog

103
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.820
smart policy or is there,
I mean, what is your

104
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.770
policy for letting someone like
that engage directly with a

105
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.620
guest bypassing all the usual.
We have a social media

106
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.560
policy and very technically speaking
that wa that was not

107
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.320
in accordance with our policy.
However, it was, it was

108
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.050
such a great example that,
you know, it's things like

109
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.690
that, that I, then I
then use as data points

110
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.360
for saying, we need a
more open social media policy,

111
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.030
But you didn't of course,
go to Troy and get

112
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.670
him in trouble for doing
that. No, not at all,

113
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.860
not at all. It was,
it was a, it's one

114
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.090
of my favorite stories of
employee engagement That is going

115
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.540
on. Now. That's something that
he wouldn't have been able

116
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.110
to do using Twitter, because
I assume that you controlled

117
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.790
access to Twitter and you
probably use a Twitter management

118
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.130
suite of some kind to,
to manage that. And you

119
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.500
do tweet yourself. You're the
person who tweets behind the

120
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.380
yes, yes. And patrol does
not. So he was in,

121
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.540
it was enabled. He was
enabled to do that. He

122
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.420
was paying attention. He saw
it happen. He was empowered

123
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.790
as a Facebook user to
simply comment and say, Hey,

124
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.060
it's me. Is that the
way that you would have

125
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.040
expected a fan page to
be used? Or do you,

126
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.860
do you post like videos
and promotional things on the

127
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.110
fan page? Is it more
of like a portable press

128
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.690
release? Wait, it's definitely, it's
definitely a viable Avenue for

129
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.570
us to communicate with, with,
with media. We also upload

130
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.300
videos that we've posted on
our YouTube channel. It's really

131
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.100
a place for us. It's
really a place for us

132
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.940
to communicate with our guests
and our fans about relevant

133
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.450
things that are going on
in Vegas and things that

134
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.210
are going on with the
hotel. One of the things

135
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.690
that I've always wondered about
is how much the, the

136
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.360
number of followers that someone
has affects their customer service.

137
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.700
And I've got into a
number of arguments with some

138
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.920
of my followers on Twitter.
Who've said that I'm getting

139
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.330
an unreasonable amount of quality
service. Let's say because of

140
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.660
my follower account recently I
tweeted to American to United

141
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.450
airlines. Rather that I left
my Amazon Kindle on a

142
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.380
plane. And within about 12
to 17 hours, that was

143
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.200
back in my hands. Someone
had made the right call

144
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.240
and it was empowered to
make change and got me

145
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.310
my Kindle back. And a
lot of people were like,

146
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.580
great, that's awesome. Social media,
United airlines, you all rock.

147
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.010
And everyone else like, well,
yeah, you have 25,000 followers.

148
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.590
That's totally artificial. I have
12 followers and he would

149
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.600
never do that to me.
What is, how do you

150
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.430
make those kinds of decisions?
And do you even pay

151
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.380
attention? I definitely do pay
attention because unfortunately the number

152
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.520
of followers is, is a
widely used indicator of how

153
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.310
influential you are on Twitter.
But I try not, I

154
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.490
don't let that influence my
decision. Basically, we are looking

155
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.980
for, we're looking, we use
Twitter and social media as

156
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.830
an extension of our guest
service. And if you are

157
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.870
a guest, regardless of how
many followers you have, if

158
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.330
you have some sort of
problem or some question, and

159
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.300
it's legitimate, we can, we
can usually tell and immediately

160
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.820
we'll respond to you. Okay.
I think it's pretty clear

161
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.950
for people to pay attention
to Twitter and Mashable and

162
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.010
dig that, you know, it
only takes one tweet and

163
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.800
that person could have one
follower for something to turn

164
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.740
in, you know, turn into
a problem. That's exactly right.

165
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.990
And of course, one of
the things that's always frustrating

166
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.390
to me is that once
something bad has been said,

167
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.600
once someone has taken some,
I call it giving bile

168
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.810
a permalink, you take some
negativity and put it out

169
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.470
there. That's going to always
be out there. Do you,

170
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.330
do you ever like say
to a guest after they've

171
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.970
said something negative and you've
resolved their problem, do you

172
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.780
have them go back and,
and tell their friends, or

173
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.860
you say, can you remove
that negativity? Or do you

174
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.840
just keep it out there
as part of the conversation,

175
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.140
I go back and forth
about that. Sometimes if it's,

176
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.510
if it's really, really negative
and we've fixed it and

177
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.330
the guest is wowed, and
it's very clear that they're

178
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.840
wowed, then I'll sort of
ask them offline and say,

179
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.460
Hey, you know, do remind
removing that. But some, if

180
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.850
it's, if it's sort of
neutral, then, then we'll usually

181
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.730
leave it because I don't
believe that you should have,

182
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.610
they should have all positive
content out there. I think

183
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.970
that negative gives all of
the content a little bit

184
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.990
more of a realistic factor.
Yeah. You definitely want to

185
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.960
make the conversation authentic, but
at the same time, you

186
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.930
don't want to feel like
you've got your, you know,

187
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.930
your, your thumb on the
roulette wheel, right. You don't

188
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.690
want to make it artificial.
And that seems to be

189
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.090
a balance because I think
also that if you were,

190
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.910
if the person took offense
at that, they might, in

191
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.150
fact, that could backlash. Right.
And if the guests said,

192
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.410
wow, I can't believe we
did that. And that could

193
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.540
turn into a whole thing
as well. And you guys,

194
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.000
speaking of follower count, you
have a lot of followers

195
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.710
on Twitter. Where are you
at the time of this

196
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.400
recording? We're at about 335,000
or the most valid hotel

197
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.530
in the world on Twitter.
And, and how does something

198
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.930
like that happen when you're
a hotel? You don't, I

199
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.210
assume someone at some point
launched a browser and said,

200
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.240
create new accounts. Was that
done by you? And you

201
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.220
said, when and went on
Gore, did you go and

202
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.340
call the folks at Twitter
and verify that account and

203
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.900
make that happen? The initial,
when Las Vegas account I

204
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.560
believe was, was being held
by a squatter. So we

205
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.290
were able to have a
release to us. Huh. So

206
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.300
you're able to go and
say, we verify this and

207
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.690
is that verification process via
kind of phone calls and

208
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.670
Skype? I mean, how do
they tell that you're really

209
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.310
who you are? You could
build a whole thing. What

210
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.100
would you, I wasn't involved
in that, that was, that

211
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.710
was done before, before my
time in social media. Yeah.

212
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.400
And I understand that that,
that Twitter gets involved with,

213
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.290
with kind of large accounts
and sometimes people will get

214
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.930
added to what's called the
suggested user list. And what

215
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.300
does that, and has that
played a role in your

216
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.300
success? Sure. So when, when
was added to the suggested

217
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.950
users list in October, it
was a tremendous surprise. It

218
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.290
wasn't something that we asked
for nor was it something

219
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.520
that we really wanted, but
it happened. And we were

220
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.590
in, you know, we've reaped
the benefits in terms of

221
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.200
number of followers. We grew
at, you know, a few

222
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.140
thousand followers per day for,
for quite some time. And

223
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.820
you said you ran two
accounts, though. You have one

224
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.650
for wind and one for
wind Encore. Does that one

225
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.140
have a similar number of
followers or is that growing

226
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.430
more organically? No, the Encore
account grows organically. And how

227
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.190
many does that have right
now? A little over 4,000.

228
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.910
So how, how, as someone
who is honestly answering these

229
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.340
tweets, if someone who opens
up tweet deck or a

230
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.130
coach wheat and says, alright,
I've got two accounts that

231
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.010
I'm going to manage. One
has 4,000 clearly highly engaged

232
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.560
followers because they chose to
follow you, which, you know,

233
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.910
4,000 is a nontrivial number
as well as 300,000, who

234
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.000
may be slightly less engaged
because they were suggested, do

235
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.480
you find a difference in
managing two different accounts of

236
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.290
a similar type with dramatically
different follower counts? Two accountants

237
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.640
are, are interesting. They are,
they're fairly similar comments that

238
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.530
come in. I don't prioritize
which, which one I'll respond

239
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.740
to more because of the,
the variants and follower count.

240
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.810
However, I, I do notice
that because Encore has less

241
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.300
followers and because it is
not as high profile as

242
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.550
the wind account, that's the
one that I can experiment

243
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.350
a little bit more with.
That's the one I use

244
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.340
to respond a little bit
more to, to folks on,

245
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.680
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman
from another parallel universe, got

246
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.330
to tell you about some
of our things our sponsors

247
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.930
are doing. They make this
free podcast possible. If you're

248
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.750
developing a new line of
business application, you've probably tried

249
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.030
the latest version of server
light. Now you can get

250
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.760
even better results by combining
the functionality and server Lite

251
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.100
for beta, with some of
the richness or the third

252
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.220
party controls from our friends
at Tellerik, they're the first

253
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.860
vendors to offer native support
for the server Lite for

254
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.500
beta and their rad controls.
They've got a new Silverlight

255
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.530
for CTP suite of these
controls. They let you tap

256
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.050
into the frameworks, great potential.
You've got native, right mouse

257
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.330
click and all the new
features, a server line there's

258
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.780
38 controls that give you
all these features. You can

259
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.450
start building those compelling line
of business applications right away.

260
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.070
I encourage you to check
those products out at tellerik.com/silverlight

261
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.940
and, you know, thank Tellerik
for supporting Donald rock, supporting

262
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.200
Hansel minutes on their Facebook
fan page at facebook.com/tellerik. Now

263
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.410
back to the show, do
you find that having 300,000

264
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.560
people following you creates a
lot of noise and just

265
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.170
a lot of nonsense by,
by, by some fraction of

266
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.480
the followers who might be
not engaged, or if those

267
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.090
people find that, that they're
not interesting. Once you have

268
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.860
to say they simply unfollow,
I'm trying to get a

269
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.780
sense that if the difference
between you, you have a

270
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.870
very interesting opportunity from an,
from a social media experiment

271
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.360
perspective of like two similar
accounts, one on the, on

272
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.300
the, what they call the
stool or the suggested user

273
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.050
list. And what not do
you have 300,000 deeply engaged

274
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.870
users? And that does that.
Now that you're, are you

275
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.160
still on this tool at
this point? Are you still

276
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.400
on the streets? So you're
growing a lot on that

277
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.460
particular account. Do you find
that they may not even

278
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.530
be familiar with the wind
date? They may not have

279
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.650
followed you as a, as
an intense fan, but now

280
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.160
that they have, you know,
they're more likely to, to

281
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.920
come here. Right? Well, I
feel, I feel both ways

282
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.610
about that question. I feel
that social media is a

283
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.430
longterm strategy, so because you're
not a fan of us

284
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.480
and because you don't know
of us now, that doesn't

285
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.460
mean that, you know, you,
you know, through reading our

286
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.010
tweets because you follow us,
it gives us an opportunity

287
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.150
to, to passively, you know,
be, be in the followers

288
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.860
mind. And do you have
a way to attach that?

289
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.610
Like I assume that there's
someone, some older gentleman or

290
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.700
lady, some boss type in
a suit up in, you

291
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.070
know, I always think of
the Las Vegas television show

292
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.920
when there's like, you know,
the boss, right. Do they

293
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.920
want to know Jade? How
many people have come here

294
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.170
because of you and the
work that you're doing is

295
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.360
that, is that what it's
about attracting new people or

296
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.550
is it about just maintaining
a level of satisfaction and

297
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.060
quality? I would say first
and foremost, the goal is

298
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.790
to provide the same level
of service that we're known

299
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.670
for throughout the resort in
person to provide that, that

300
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.340
level of service online, I
would say the goal would,

301
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.870
would then be to increase
or to drive incremental revenue.

302
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.720
And by that, I mean,
utilizing Twitter's geo geolocation services

303
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.940
and talking to highly relevant
followers, or they might not

304
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.010
even be followers, but folks
that are just tweeting about

305
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.370
Vegas and tweeting about restaurants
who, you know, are in

306
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.350
town and they're relevant. And
they're looking for a place

307
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.390
to have dinner tonight where
it would be, it would

308
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.400
make sense for when to
jump in and say, Hey,

309
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.970
have you tried our buffet?
Yeah, that was interesting. That's

310
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.160
my next question is that,
you know, were you using

311
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.020
a tool like tweet deck
or Seesmic or one of

312
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.530
these things that has like
multiple columns there's people who

313
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.450
are following Lynn. And then
there are people who talking

314
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.330
about the, when, how much,
how much do you find

315
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.030
people replying to you versus
people just talking about you

316
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.220
and you kind of butt
in, because you know, Twitter

317
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.070
is kind of a cocktail
party where it's okay to

318
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.630
interrupt someone talking about a
particular subject. A lot of

319
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.930
ICS actually usually see more,
more people talking about win

320
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.660
than actually including our handle.
So I see a lot

321
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.630
of my, my main search
is just the word win.

322
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.490
And I see a lot
of, I see a lot

323
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.820
of people talking about that
and the responses is usually

324
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.240
positive. It's always sort of
funny for me. I get

325
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.460
my sort of nerdy giggles.
This one, You kind of

326
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.650
lit up when I told
you that, because obviously this

327
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.270
is a part of your
life. This happens all the

328
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.090
time. Yeah. So I, I
see people in there they're

329
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.940
so surprised that the hotel
writes them back. Yeah. I've

330
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.690
seen, I see people say,
ah, tweeting, you know, I'm

331
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.640
coming to Vegas next month
with my friends. Should I

332
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.960
stay at Bellagio or city
center? Or when, or, you

333
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.450
know, what buffet should I
go to tonight? And I'll

334
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.730
see their followers write them
back. And then that's usually

335
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.430
how I see the mention
of when. And then I

336
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.280
often jump in and there,
and they're like, Oh my

337
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.380
gosh, the hotel tweeted me.
I can't believe it. And

338
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.280
I know you were telling
me as we were getting

339
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.470
ready to set up here,
that you even tweeted about

340
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.600
like what you would think
of as being fairly banal

341
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.790
things like, Oh, the weather
is great in Vegas right

342
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.760
now, which one might even
think of being kind of

343
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.730
cheesy, but you're getting people
excited about that. They're engaged

344
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.560
about like, Oh, we're in,
we're in New York. Is it

345
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.860
really nice over there? Yeah.
That actually that works well.

346
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.810
I was, I was sort
of on the fence about

347
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.720
that, about that recently. And
then I, but then I

348
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.760
was thinking that, you know,
the vast majority of our

349
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.750
followers are not in Las
Vegas. People visit like Vegas

350
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.210
between three and four times
a year. So the majority

351
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.040
of the time they're not
here, but they're still following

352
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.470
us. So it's a way
for us to keep our

353
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.560
content relevant and keep our
followers up. So it's not

354
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.050
like, Oh, when it's only
talking about the special that

355
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.150
they have for Vegas this
weekend, like, I'm tired of

356
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.430
hearing about that. So I
know that the East coast

357
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.560
has been pounded with bad
weather lately and you know,

358
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.240
we're letting you know in
a nice playful way that

359
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.390
the weather is great in
Vegas. Yeah. And now currently

360
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.250
you're as understanding that the
only person who's tweeting on

361
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.500
behalf of the wind, but
potentially you could build a

362
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.050
team if this became a
larger, larger situation for you.

363
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.010
That's the goal. And as
you're doing this, since you're

364
00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.350
the single pair of eyeballs,
we'll say that's looking at

365
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.980
least at Twitter. Although we
know Troy is looking at

366
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.930
Facebook that, do you have
certain followers that you you're

367
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.060
actually having an ongoing kind
of like month by month

368
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.100
conversation with you? Like, Oh,
what's that guy again? And

369
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.500
he's like, he just really
is into talking about the

370
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.060
wind We do. That was
one of my first favorite

371
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.840
things about Twitter within, I
think within the two weeks

372
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.990
we started engaging with his
follower. His name is Brian

373
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.340
Fe and he is a
die hard wind fan. Every

374
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.200
time he comes to Vegas,
he usually stays at the

375
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.950
hotel. His daughter's middle name
is Wynn named after the

376
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.670
hotel. You'll see such a
big fan. This is exactly

377
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.280
why we need to be
on social media. Why? Because

378
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.330
there are these hardcore evangelists
and that's the thing he's,

379
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.010
you know, he's a, he's
a, he's a, he's a

380
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.050
regular guy. He wouldn't, you
know, he's not a hot

381
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.880
and a by regular, I
mean, you know, he's not,

382
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.610
he's not a high roller,
so yeah. So he wouldn't,

383
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.250
you know, he wouldn't, you
know, sort of like, He

384
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.930
wouldn't like call you and
roll in, like I'm coming

385
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.640
to the wind, get the
limo ready in the suite.

386
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.340
Right. Right. And, you know,
and in a casino that

387
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.760
those are usually the, what
are considered the VIP guests.

388
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.310
So it was, it was,
it's been great to find

389
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.830
fans like that As a
VIP guest in the sense

390
00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.690
that you know him and
that he's excited. So he's

391
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.080
just as important. The, I
would assume as potentially someone

392
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.330
that's for sure. Apparently because
you know, those followers, I

393
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.980
have women, we've got a,
we've got a handful of

394
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.340
highly engaged fans and the,
and they're, they're great because

395
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.200
I can always count on
them for things. If someone

396
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.620
writes a, you know, occasionally
we get, we get negative,

397
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.200
negative tweets about, you know,
some of the fees, for

398
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.930
example, it's everywhere in Vegas,
it's four 99 to use

399
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.540
an ATM. That's fine. That's
a standard, that's a Vegas

400
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.040
thing. Not a wind thing,
Not a Vegas thing. It's

401
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.710
not a wind thing. Yeah.
But people that are staying

402
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.780
at the hotel will attribute
it to win. And they'll

403
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.390
say you're nickel and diming
your guests by charging a

404
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.430
four, nine, 10 ATM fee.
So then I can, you

405
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.790
know, privately ask are one,
you know, one of our

406
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.190
highly engaged followers to, to
write back to this person

407
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.780
and tell them that it's
a Vegas thing, that it's

408
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.510
not just a wind thing.
That means so much more

409
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.770
than, you know, the hotel
writing back. Right. How, how

410
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.110
often has someone actually giving
you a legitimate suggestion you

411
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:53.780
had never thought of, and
you've actually implemented at the

412
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.280
wind like, wow, that would
be great. If we had

413
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.230
a little placard that said
this in the rooms, or

414
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.970
maybe if we said this
to the guest, if you

415
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.090
have, you actually changed how
you do the hotel business

416
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:07.550
based on Twitter as suggestion
box, We haven't yet. But

417
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.010
I think that we will
in the future, Really, you

418
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.650
think that the, that your
relationship now that you've built

419
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.020
up this, this, and I
say your relationship with the,

420
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.400
with the higher ups is
such that you've proven that

421
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.460
this is a valid customer
service and, you know, starting

422
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.150
point, I would certainly say
so, do you, do you

423
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.670
ever find yourself directing people
to like standard customer service?

424
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.160
I mean, you can't really
solve a person's problem in

425
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.390
140 characters, or, I mean,
are, can you, I can't

426
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.540
usually solve the problem in
one tweet that is 140

427
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.320
characters. It usually takes, it
usually takes a while. Last,

428
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.200
last night I was tweeting
with a guest who was

429
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.640
a potential guest from Scotland
who had, he had a

430
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.640
specific offer that he had
received by email for us.

431
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.280
And the offer was for
a room with one bed,

432
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.920
a standard room, because we
don't have very many rooms

433
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.050
with two beds. So he
wanted to book four of

434
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.910
these rooms and they all
needed to be this double

435
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.640
room that did not, that
was not included in its

436
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.090
promo that he received. And
I was telling him, unfortunately,

437
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.620
the best way that he
had to do this was

438
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.230
to book this online and
then call the hotel and,

439
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.880
and switch the rooms. It's
a very specific requirement. Yeah.

440
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.780
It was very specific, but
the entire exchange was happening

441
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.540
at, you know, one o'clock
in the morning, his time

442
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.970
in Scotland. And Well, you
were, of course you were

443
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.970
enabling that guy Wired five
or six, five or six

444
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.690
DMS, and sort of get
to that. So it's, it's

445
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.070
really hard to answer it
in one in one post.

446
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.890
That's interesting though. You said
DMS. So you were actually,

447
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.720
what is the ratio of
direct messages that you'll send

448
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.850
to people and try to
solve their problem versus solving

449
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.790
it in a, in person?
Do you, as a, as

450
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.000
a representative of this organization,
take it to dynamic, direct

451
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.220
message quickly and say, follow
me and I'll handle it.

452
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.680
Or do you try to
have the conversation in public?

453
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.010
I try to keep the
conversation private, if I can,

454
00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.280
for the sake, for the
sake of not clogging up

455
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.040
our stream with a bunch
of out replies to one

456
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.020
person. If I know it's
going to take, if it's,

457
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.940
I know if it's something
that I can't fix immediately,

458
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.490
or if there's any sort
of customer information. So if

459
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.680
a guest tweets us and
says, I want to come

460
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.590
to Vegas in two months,
what what's special? Can you

461
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.870
offer me? And if it's
something that if they're, if

462
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.670
they're a casino player and
I need their red card

463
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.190
information, which is our frequent
player card, I wouldn't want

464
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.020
them to send that information
publicly. I would want it

465
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.530
privately. Or if it's someone
that wants to reservation confirmed,

466
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.710
I'll ask them to send
me that information privately. Do

467
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.720
you think that a, you
know, five years, 10 years

468
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.270
down the road, that this
is going to be considered

469
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.670
as acceptable as like a
one 800 number, or is

470
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.100
it always going to be
slightly different from, I think

471
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.220
it will get to be
more mainstream in time. One

472
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.650
of the things that I've
noticed a more kind of

473
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:48.240
more sophisticated Twitter accounts doing
is when they do a

474
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.420
reply and an at reply,
they'll add a dot or

475
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.610
they'll add an R in
front of it, so that

476
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.320
it is a reply it's,
but it's more of a

477
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.080
mention. So here's something that
I'm sending to you directly,

478
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.660
but really the larger group
would like to hear that.

479
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:06.840
Have you implemented that here?
Not too often. I have

480
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.620
once in a while, but
not, not too often. Do

481
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.120
you give much thought into
that kind of stuff that

482
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.400
let the idea that there
are people who are watching

483
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.490
in the sense of they're
they're following you. And of

484
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.080
course, if you reply to
someone they're not going to

485
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.180
see it, unless they follow
that person too. And with

486
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.960
so many followers, it's probably
very rare. Do you like,

487
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.630
do you find yourself retreating
things? I do. I'm an,

488
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.170
I'm an active re tweeter.
I believe in that, you

489
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.710
know, we're all members of
this community and I, I

490
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.500
really believe in re-tweeting. So
I retweet, you know, guests

491
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.670
who have taken great pictures
of themselves around the resort

492
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.280
or any sort of really
great feedback. I also retweet

493
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.160
some of our partners, for
example, Delta vacations. It's one

494
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.900
of our sales travel partners,
and they participate in travel

495
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.060
Tuesday a lot. And they,
they often tweet about when

496
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.160
an Encore and then I'll
usually retweet them when possible.

497
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.550
Also <inaudible> is the, when
internet address just w Y

498
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.060
N n.com. Hey, it's when
Las Vegas, when Las vegas.com

499
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.340
it would be interesting to
get like a tiny URL,

500
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:13.000
like a wind custom, tiny
around like WWI dot Y

501
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.040
Ana, or like, if there
is a dot N and

502
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.590
implement something like that, that
would be cool. Yeah. Do

503
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.440
you track things like you
use, like Bitly and keep

504
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.420
track of stuff, and then
use that in reports? Do

505
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.820
you have to justify things
to people and say, look,

506
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.060
we tweeted this and the
link to a particular online

507
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.820
property was visited X number
of times. Do they pay

508
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.210
that kind of attention to
your metrics? That specific question

509
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.870
about the click-throughs? No, but
I, I certainly watch it

510
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.680
on my own for my
own growth purposes. It helps

511
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.620
me see that perhaps the
tone of the message or

512
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.490
the way I'm phrasing it
is, is not conducive to

513
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.550
a lot of throughs. Do
you give much thought to

514
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:53.860
time zones? Sometimes I find
myself because I have a

515
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.630
lot of followers on the
other side of the world.

516
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.460
I'll do a tweet at
eight in the morning, and

517
00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.810
then the same tweet a
day to the night just

518
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:04.240
to get good coverage. No,
I haven't. I'm not sure

519
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.100
if I'm not sure if
I would do that, because

520
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.880
for, because I wouldn't want
to be repetitive. Right. And

521
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.930
you have a lot of
followers, I suppose someone could

522
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.880
say, I'm tired of hearing
about these things, and then

523
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.430
it would start feeling like
an advertising. Right. Right. I

524
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.310
mean, we're, it's, it's very
important for us. As I,

525
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.980
as I have been mentioning
the entire interview as is

526
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.080
luxury brand, we don't want
to be standing out on

527
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.170
the street with our microphone,
broadcasting, the specials that we

528
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.540
currently have going on. We
really, we know that our,

529
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.240
we know that we have
customers in this channel and

530
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.820
we want to be here
as a support network for

531
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.110
them and an information network.
Well, I really appreciate you

532
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.940
sitting down with me today
because one of the things

533
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.350
that I, that I kind
of get from you is

534
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.710
that you're, you're interested in
protecting your brand and, and,

535
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.850
and helping your brand be
successful online, but not in

536
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.970
that kind of overly corporate
way. You know what I'm

537
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.160
saying? I mean, I feel
it, that, that, it sounds

538
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.070
like since you were in
charge of this, this East

539
00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:00.430
strategy, that there's a, there's
an authenticity. Cause it sounds

540
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.490
like the wind is beginning
to understand that, you know,

541
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.250
you can be real and
still be, you know, a

542
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.400
high end brand and position
yourself as such. And it

543
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.620
does. And does, does anyone
question that, did they feel

544
00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.130
that you've cheapened the brand
by, by doing this foray

545
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.580
into online a YouTube channel,
a Twitter? I don't think

546
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.820
so. I mean, there were
certainly skeptics in the beginning

547
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.270
as there always are when
you're, when you're our work

548
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.780
in the new media and
emerging technology space. But I

549
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.150
think that the success that
we've had with Twitter has

550
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.930
been, has been great because
it has, it has confirmed

551
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.960
like the sign off or
the buy in from most

552
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.180
of our key executives, which
is really what we need

553
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.610
to get the type of
freedom to explore this space

554
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.030
even more. So what are
the Twitter accounts that listeners

555
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.720
should follow to, to see
your work? Our, our Twitter

556
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.480
accounts are at Wynn Las
Vegas and at Encore Las

557
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.030
Vegas. Very cool. Thank you
so much, Jay. Really for

558
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.460
chatting with me today. Thank
you very much. This has

559
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.800
been another episode of Hansel
minutes and I'll see you

560
00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.580
again next week.
