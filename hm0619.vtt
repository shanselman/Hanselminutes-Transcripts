<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.420
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.990
I'm talking with Ryan Kazanjian.
He's the chief security architect

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.320
at Tanium. How are you
sir? Doing great. Thanks. Glad

11
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.200
to be on. Yeah, this
was exciting for me because

12
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.450
you not only are the
chief security architect at a

13
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.750
security firm, but also for
a time worked as a

14
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.620
technical consultant alongside the writers
of mr. Robot. How long

15
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.590
did you do that? A
little over two years, I

16
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.200
joined during the preproduction phase
of season two, a couple

17
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.230
episodes in to the production
efforts there, and then continued

18
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.350
to work with the team
through shots for a few

19
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.320
different scenes in season two.
And then when season three

20
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.250
started, which was in pre
production work and writer's room

21
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.940
sessions, I think were in
late 2016, actually it was

22
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.810
much more involved from the
inception stages of the storylines

23
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.990
and how technology wove into
them during the start of

24
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.140
the planning phases for season
three, continued to work with

25
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.100
the writers and production team
all the way through the

26
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.000
production of the shots we
conceived and even helped out

27
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.910
onset with some of the
filming and scenes that we

28
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.360
had thought through earlier on.
So that lasted all the

29
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.650
way until about mid summer
through 2017. When we wrapped

30
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.160
up and stuff started to
air. Nice. I worked as

31
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.460
a technical consultant on a
movie very early on, and

32
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.950
my job was primarily to
go through the script and

33
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.650
I was told, make sure
none of the technical stuff

34
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.590
would make the writers look
stupid, but it sounds like

35
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.340
your involvement is much deeper
than, than that, that simplistic

36
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.460
work that I did. So
it's really a function of

37
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.050
the show creators and especially
core Adana, the writer and

38
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.440
producer that I worked most
closely with really having that

39
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.500
attention and care for detail.
When I joined in partway

40
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.290
through season two, a lot
of the storylines and seeds

41
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.600
had already written, been written.
And so a lot of

42
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.580
my role is what you
kind of described there, where

43
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.780
it was about executing the
onscreen details to fit the

44
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.750
scene and making a few
tweaks and changes around the

45
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.170
edges so that everything stayed
accurate. But yeah, when season

46
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.990
three rolled around, we really
had a, a great time

47
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.270
getting to sit back and
think a little bit about

48
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.060
how technology and real world
tax could actually fit and

49
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.180
shape the direction of the
narrative that the writers and

50
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.940
show creator Sam Esmail were
going for. And so that

51
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.030
gave me a really cool
opportunity to have a bit

52
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.330
more insight and an influence
into the direction of the

53
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.700
season. Are you like me
in that over the last

54
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.880
20 years of watching movies
and TV, you've been disappointed

55
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.230
in the quality? Yeah, absolutely.
And I say that as

56
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.310
someone who grew up watching
and chuckling at movies like

57
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.200
hackers who depicted computer hacking
and technology on screen in

58
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.040
some ridiculous ways, and you
had exceptions to the norm,

59
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.580
right? Like I also grew
up watching war games, which

60
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.960
for all of the things
that were kind of outlandish

61
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.930
about the storyline, there were
little bits and pieces of

62
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.570
technology. You'd seen it that
were realistic and cool. So

63
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.420
like I remember seeing an
acoustic coupler in that movie.

64
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.370
And then I think in
sneakers, and that was the

65
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.470
thing where before there were
modems that plugged into the

66
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.980
phone line, you'd literally put
the handset on this device

67
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.770
and it would play the
modem tones through the receiver

68
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.920
of the handset. And so,
you know, those movies like

69
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.100
kind of gave me a
glimpse of that world and

70
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.260
did at least a fairly
good job of depicting parts

71
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.890
of it accurately. Then you
go to hackers and movies,

72
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.820
like a scorpion just went
completely in the opposite direction.

73
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.000
And a lot of those
movies in the nineties just

74
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.120
captured hacking in a ridiculous
way. And that unfortunately continued

75
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.930
through to most of the
movies and TV shows over

76
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.640
the past decade or so.
Yeah, the juxtaposition between the

77
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.540
two kind of two people
on one keyboard and CIS

78
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.440
kind of style of hacking,
which is, is painful to

79
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.260
the kind of the minority
report, like trying to give

80
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.410
you a sense of moving
your hands and waving as

81
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.560
being legitimate hacking to the
other side of the spectrum,

82
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.680
which is real legitimate use
of real hacks on, on

83
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.160
mr. Robot. It makes me
feel like the only thing

84
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.650
preventing us from getting that
level of narrative is just

85
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.210
for lack of a better
word, organizational willpower, someone enabled

86
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.150
Cora Donna and folks, mr.
Robot, to hire you and

87
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.660
to do it for real.
Yeah. I think, you know,

88
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.450
the, the prevailing assumption for
so long had been that

89
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.560
anything realistic in terms of
depicting technology and computers let

90
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.040
alone hacking in the entertaining
medium was always going to

91
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.760
be just intrinsically boring. And
it's true that like, no

92
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.790
matter how realistic you make
a scene, there needs to

93
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.450
be something relatable that anyone
watching can grasp onto and

94
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.330
understand the motivations of the
characters and why the scenes

95
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.490
important what's going on. And
so you can't lose that.

96
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.390
But I think mr. Robot
and the, you know, Sam

97
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.670
and core and the rest
of the production team realized

98
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.170
that by making it realistic,
they didn't have to lose

99
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.780
that. They still could make
a incredibly compelling and relatable

100
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.640
narrative. They can make scenes
exciting and they could layer

101
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.510
it so that a nontechnical
viewer could watch and enjoy

102
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.450
it and understands the outlines
of what's going on. But

103
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.370
if you were really technical
and if you were for

104
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.130
example, a security practitioner or
one of our fans that

105
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.250
likes to freeze frame and
analyze every little bit of

106
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.500
everything on screen, you had
a lot more that you

107
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.770
could even enjoy. And then
that even goes a layer

108
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.800
deeper with the alternate reality
game that the show has.

109
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.160
And so that's sort of
layered approach where no matter

110
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.260
what your level of experience
is, there's something you can

111
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.600
get out of it. And
some more technically you are

112
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.300
the kind of deeper appreciation
you can get for some

113
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.210
of it, I think is
what made the show successful

114
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.240
and inspired some of the
fans that it's got. I

115
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.500
think that's a tall order
though Say, well, like for

116
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.960
example, my wife is a
nurse and she can't watch

117
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.450
ER, or the good doctor
or any of these shows

118
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.370
because it just causes her
to roll her eyes back

119
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.380
in her head so far
that she can't even stand

120
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.230
it. And I understand that
people like pilots that watch

121
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.440
shows where there's an airplane
being flown, they can't handle

122
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.540
it as well, but you're
saying that to be able

123
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.600
to actually hold up to
people who are screenshotting it

124
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.020
and discussing it on Reddit,
Tall order, it is. And

125
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.690
it's also a continuous source
of stress for us. I

126
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.560
mean, especially in season three
where I was a lot

127
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.510
more involved in pretty much
every onscreen depiction of hacking

128
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.120
or use of a security
or computing tool for a

129
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.970
shots that the pressure as
we were creating, it was

130
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.430
isn't going to stand up
to that scrutiny. And, you

131
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.970
know, we always have to
make certain adaptations and take

132
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.220
creative license to make things
fit into the show. And

133
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.810
so we really worked hard
to minimize those wherever possible

134
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.260
and make sure that we
could hold up to that

135
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.200
audience because in the end
that's the most critical group,

136
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.580
but they're also the most
passionate fans of the show

137
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.700
and the most vocal in
supporting it. And so getting

138
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.560
it right for that group,
even if it is a

139
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.130
minority of the viewers has
always been really important. And

140
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.610
it's been really tremendously gratifying
to see how the security

141
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.540
community, which is an incredibly
critical group. I mean, by

142
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.580
virtue of the work that
we do in this community

143
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.720
industry to get them behind
it, something we're really proud

144
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.510
of. Yeah. And they seem
to be generally pretty positive.

145
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.190
It makes me think about
the computer people, myself included

146
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.820
tend to be the most
well actually people ever. I

147
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.400
could imagine that you might
be afraid that you're gonna

148
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.590
put a great episode out
there and then a medium

149
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.970
post tearing apart. Your work
appears the next day. Well,

150
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.400
and the funding is I
had a series of medium

151
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.240
posts called mr. Robot, this
assembled this past season where

152
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.760
I kind of provided a
behind the scenes of how

153
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.220
core. And I created all
the hacks in each episode

154
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.130
and what behind that. And
sometimes some of the things

155
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.710
that went on before and
afterwards and the way we

156
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.960
planned it, or even designed
it, that didn't end up

157
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.870
making its way onto the
screen. And for every time

158
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.910
I post one of those,
I'd get great comments and

159
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.560
feedbacks and messages from people
who were domain experts in

160
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.680
the specific areas of security
that we are highlighting and

161
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.020
whatever that scene might be.
And they're the ones who

162
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.270
definitely noticed, well, why'd you
do this instead of that?

163
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.630
Or was this a mistake
or intentional? And, but it

164
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.330
was always with a like
positive sort of appreciation that

165
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.330
look like we got, it's
a TV show, everything can't

166
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.990
be done in real time,
but getting that sort of

167
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.110
feedback means people are paying
attention and care. And that

168
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.950
was really fun. That's nice.
One of the things that

169
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.250
I've noticed is on TV
shows in general is that

170
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.730
people always seem to use
IP addresses that are out

171
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.440
of range. You know, as
soon as an IP address

172
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.660
is greater than two 55,
you go, Oh, okay, well,

173
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.210
that's just like, you know,
when they dial a number

174
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.060
and it's five, five, five
something, something, something, that's just

175
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.060
their way of saying, Hey,
we're in a movie, but

176
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.300
it seems like IP addresses
in mr. Robot all resolve

177
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.550
to something. Yeah, that was
a credit to cor long

178
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.860
before I got involved in
realizing that there was a

179
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.220
tremendous opportunity to not just
do that for realism sake,

180
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.590
but to then start to
build in this alternate reality

181
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.430
game and the way the
ARG works is just about

182
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.610
any IP address that you
see on screen phone numbers,

183
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:10.370
email addresses, QR codes, all
are sort of hidden glimpses

184
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.490
at this story behind the
story that you can follow

185
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.950
on line. If you go
to an IP address, there

186
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.290
might be a puzzle or
a sort of a emulated

187
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.950
hacking challenge. That's inspired by
something from the episode, if

188
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.990
you message one of the
email addresses, you might get

189
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.760
a response back. And that
sort of puzzle world drives

190
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.440
a tremendously passionate following of
mr. Robot RG fans who

191
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.580
spend lots of time on
discord and on Reddit talking

192
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.280
about the puzzles working their
way through, and a core

193
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.380
has another separate team that
he had worked with that

194
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.020
really did a tremendous job
of building out that side

195
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.480
of the universe and making
it a really interesting compliments

196
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.550
to what's onscreen. So how
are the Invented reality game

197
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.610
screens? Why couldn't you use
those in the show? For

198
00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:00.560
example, I visited one 92,
two 51 68, two 42,

199
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.880
which is it's got the
evil Corp background. It's got

200
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.680
a whole shell. I mean,
it's a, it's a very

201
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.680
nice simulacrum of, of what
happened on screen and I

202
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.990
can actually follow and type
in what Elliot typed on

203
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.530
the show. Could you use
them at the same time

204
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.090
that could you use that
for the game, for the,

205
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.860
for the show or did
you have to mock those

206
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.330
up differently? So it depended,
some of the ARG sites

207
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.840
are actually designed around the
mockups that were made for

208
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.330
scenes where the same sort
of thing, as apparent on

209
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.180
in the episode, there are
some steps in the ARG

210
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.700
that go outside or beyond
the scope of what you

211
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.440
ever see in any of
the episodes. And so those

212
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.840
were done separately, but yeah,
there were more than a

213
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.360
few cases where the same
things that were used to

214
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.020
design, what was shown on
screen ended up being used

215
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.430
there, the way it worked
is after writing out and

216
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:54.010
designing the scenes I would
in virtual machines actually set

217
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.090
up the software. We were
going to show to function

218
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.790
almost as if it was
an actual operator, hands on

219
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.210
keyboard. And so, for example,
there's an episode where Elliot's

220
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.960
using volatility, which is a
memory forensics tool to look

221
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.790
at some malware that's infected
his laptop. And he's actually,

222
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.970
when we created that, I
was actually using volatility with

223
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.510
a memory image that I
captured from a Linux system

224
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.750
that was actually infected by
me with the malware I

225
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.900
was seeking to emulate. And
so all of the screens

226
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.540
that we put together for
every single shot are produced

227
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.250
like that. I try to
mimic as much of it

228
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.710
in a real system as
possible. I take lots of

229
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.980
screenshots, a lot of copying
and pasting so that the

230
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.470
text can be provided to
the design folks. And then

231
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.790
core works with the animator
that the show uses to

232
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.090
turn that into. What's actually
a flash animation, one of

233
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.700
the last places on earth
where flash is still used

234
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.870
and the flash animation is
actually what gets played in,

235
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.220
in real time on set,
as the actors are interacting

236
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.940
with their computers to pretend
as if they're actually typing.

237
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.280
So they're typing the keys
and it's actually advancing an

238
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.810
animation of what we designed
and kind of prerecorded. That

239
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.240
was my next question, how
they sync up their keystrokes.

240
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.750
So it's like hacker, typer.com
where they're, they, they hit

241
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.790
the keystroke and it moves
you forward one keystroke. So

242
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.050
they really can't type them
incorrectly. Yeah, that's exactly right.

243
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.810
It's a essentially allowing the
actor, not to have to

244
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.800
worry about the hitting the
right keys or even necessarily

245
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.500
the precise timing of everything.
It allows it to auto

246
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.290
advance in a way. It
also ends up looking a

247
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.810
lot better. Like if you
ever see something where they've

248
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.870
green screened in a computer
screen, it always looks a

249
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.510
little bit off like the
lighting and the style, whereas

250
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.380
actually filming the screen, displaying
the contents looks a lot

251
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.080
better. The flip side of
this is that means that

252
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.140
when we do production, the
shots have to be done

253
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.780
before they film. And so
I remember during a production

254
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.400
scene season, week after week
core would email me with

255
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.140
the chunks of the script
that we had worked on

256
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.030
before and said, Hey, remember
when we'd come up with

257
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.670
this scene, like three months
ago, we're going to be

258
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.740
filming these 10 blocks in
the next week. So I

259
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.230
need all of these ready
a week in advance, so

260
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.720
the animators can create it.
And so that's sort of

261
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.220
scheduling and blocks mints a
really intense couple of months

262
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.490
of putting those shots together
in batches, so that they'd

263
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.360
be ready for when cameras
rolled. Wow. And you were

264
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.360
doing all of this work
with mr. Robot independent of

265
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.320
your day job at, at
10:00 AM at the security. Yeah,

266
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.820
that's right. This was sort
of my second night job.

267
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.780
So I'm a night owl.
So after dinner, I'm almost

268
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.600
always tending to some work,
especially since I live on

269
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.780
the East coast and the
DC area, but my company

270
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.240
is based out in the
Bay area. So I'm up

271
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.430
late as it is. And
then on top of that,

272
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.570
yeah, during a production work,
usually late at night, I'd

273
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.120
start getting to a working
on that and then on

274
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.300
weekends as well. But it's,
you know, it was a

275
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.880
lot of fun. It kind
of scratched an itch. That's

276
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.860
very different than my day
job, but at the same

277
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.460
time, I look at it
as complimentary because my day

278
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.190
job has me doing a
lot of work thinking about

279
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.460
defending against attackers and applying
what I learned in my

280
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.170
past life to building defenses
and helping companies detect and

281
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.430
respond to attacks and working
on the show, kind of

282
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.500
puts me back in the
mindset of how I first

283
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.750
got involved with security, which
is thinking about how to

284
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.860
break security controls and how
to hack in. And so

285
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.370
keeping that sort of offensive
side in mind of your

286
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.490
brain working is, is really
productive. I think in security,

287
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.340
you can't just be pure
defense or pure offense. You

288
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.740
need to have sort of
a balance working on the

289
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.340
show gave me that yin
and yang. Well, and in

290
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.820
the first episode of season
three, even though your job

291
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.670
at 10:00 AM is your day
job, you are able to

292
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.000
work 10:00 AM software into it
because it was a natural

293
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.150
opportunity for Elliot to put
a firmware patch on AUPs.

294
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.930
Yeah, that it's, it's actually
in the second episode of

295
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.380
season three, there's this opening
montage of Elliot at work

296
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.040
and evil Corp and ended
up being really a really

297
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.530
fun scene where in like
the first six or so

298
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.920
minutes of the episode, it's
just really fast cutting. And

299
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.590
there's about I think, four
or five different shots that

300
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.440
we worked on. And one
of them is a glimpse

301
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.760
at Tanium and it was
a fun opportunity to actually

302
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.010
take some of the software
that I work with everyday

303
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.430
and have a role in
helping create and design and

304
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.010
actually inserting it into the
show in a spot where

305
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.940
it made sense, which is,
yeah. As you said, deploying

306
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.060
a patch to a bunch
of Linux servers that were

307
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:45.340
then managing uninterrupted power supply
devices. It wasn't an attempt

308
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.770
to give Tanium a gratuitous
plug. It was just a

309
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.550
mattress. Yeah. But I, what
I actually tried to do

310
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.650
throughout the season and even
in the prior season was

311
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.610
also not just showcase Tanium,
but also showcase like a

312
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.680
lot of the great open
source software, that security researchers

313
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.440
that I admire and respect
and I followed for a

314
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.710
long time built. So we
have Mimi cats in there.

315
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.150
We have elastic search in
there. We have volatility framework.

316
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.880
As I mentioned earlier, it
was really fun to just

317
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.620
think about all the tools
that I love using, or

318
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.840
I've learned so much from
and think about how to

319
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.670
weave them into a show
in a way that would

320
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.360
both fit the story and
also give the creators of

321
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.240
those tools. Some deserve it
recognition for their work. Did

322
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.580
you? I remember when the
people that worked on the

323
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.690
tool for the matrix saw
Trinity in the matrix using

324
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.830
their tool, and there are
a lot of, you know,

325
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.260
the, the screenshots on Twitter,
like, Oh my God, this

326
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.810
just happened. Did you give
people a heads up in

327
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.160
the open source community that
you were going to do

328
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.780
this? Or did you just
wait for the tweets to

329
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:48.160
happen the night after the
show? Eric, generally I gave

330
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.040
folks a heads up are
a few cases where I

331
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.580
just in the crazy schedule
of things forgot to do

332
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.520
so. But yeah, I did
give a few folks a

333
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.800
advanced notice, like right before
to say, Hey, you may

334
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.380
want to watch tonight's episode
and make sure to check

335
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.450
out, you know, minutes 34.
Yeah. That, that was a

336
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.230
lot of fun. That's awesome.
Well, one of the things

337
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.440
that I think also makes
the use of software, a

338
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.900
compelling piece of drama on
mr. Robot, more so than

339
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.020
I think other other shows
that try to use computers

340
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.050
in a dramatic sense is
the idea that Elliot is

341
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.380
almost always interacting with hardware
in some way, whether he's

342
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:29.090
working on Linux machines that
talk to ups is, or

343
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:33.140
the early episodes when he's
using raspberry pies. Is, is

344
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.830
that because of any concerns
you have around IOT or

345
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.010
just because there's such a
proliferation of hardware that can

346
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.720
change the world alongside the
software that runs it. So

347
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:47.210
two we've actually tried to
just have a really wide

348
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.960
variety of the types of
hacks that Elliott and others

349
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.170
perform in the show. And,
you know, if, if we

350
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:59.150
just did exclusively like enterprise
O S windows style hacks,

351
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.240
that'd be really dull. Cause
they all end up looking

352
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.280
kind of the same at
a certain layer. And so

353
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.050
weaving in some attacks that
have kinetic potential, like the

354
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.730
ups stuff, some things that
are IOT based like the

355
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.750
car hacks and season one
are. And even in season

356
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.560
three, when we have some
social engineering like with the

357
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.950
OnStar hack where Irving calls
up the emergency support number

358
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.010
so that he can pretend
that he's law enforcement and

359
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:36.950
get a OnStar engine cutoff
to the vehicle, that's chasing

360
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.020
them. All of that is
an attempt to introduce as

361
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.440
much variety as possible into
action. It's another fun way

362
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.740
that the need for a
creative and exciting story pushes

363
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.290
us. So that that car
hack, I just mentioned the

364
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.380
OnStar one came from in
the writer's room, you know,

365
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.590
request to figure out a
way to have an automotive

366
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:59.540
hack that would allow Irving
to lose their tail. And

367
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.940
what we didn't want to
do is a kind of

368
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.390
Hollywood nonsense hack or, you
know, just magically at that

369
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.030
moment, he has the right
tools to remotely hack and

370
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.640
stop a car over the
air. Cause that, that just

371
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.980
simply does not exist in
a way that would be

372
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.990
a believable. And so when
you're posed with a challenge

373
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.870
like that is as writers
and consultants for the show

374
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.430
we think about, okay, well,
you know, how do we

375
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.440
meet this in the middle
and create something that's fun

376
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.310
and exciting, but still has
enough basis in reality. And

377
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.890
that actually drives a lot
of the variety. And I

378
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.200
think some of the interesting
and creative hacks that have

379
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.230
made their way into the
show, One of the hacks

380
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.660
that took me, I'm like
cook me a back. Like

381
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.290
I had to pause and
just think hard about that

382
00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.760
was the one where the
FBI is looking at at

383
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.570
Elliot system, they're doing remote
access and you know, a

384
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.360
simpler, and this is trying
to give you a complimentary

385
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.140
phrase, simpler technical expert would
have said, Oh yeah, they're,

386
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.420
they're running, you know, VNC
or RDP, or they're sending

387
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.060
screenshots with F you know,
with PNGs of what's going

388
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.640
on in the screen. Can
you maybe explain what you

389
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.280
ended up doing on a
bleeding edge hack to allow

390
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:10.230
someone to see Elliot's machine
remotely? Yeah. So that was

391
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.070
a based on research called
the monitor darkly, which was

392
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.630
presented at black hat and
Def con in 2015 or

393
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:23.490
2016, I think. And the
basis of it basically involved

394
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:28.830
finding that the display controller
hardware that is present in

395
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:33.990
millions and millions of monitors
is vulnerable to a hardware

396
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:39.780
layer attack whereby basically implanting
a device into the display

397
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:45.450
port and USB interfaces. I
believe you could essentially manipulate

398
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.720
the contents of the screen
and, or read the contents

399
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.330
of pixels on the screen.
We took a bit of

400
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.420
creative license and adapting the
ease with which that could

401
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.760
be performed combined, the hardware
implant with like a small

402
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.390
cellular enabled PC on a
stick so that the images

403
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.500
could be transmitted to a
FBI receiver. But yeah, that

404
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.140
was an, that was driven
by one, the need to

405
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.170
show something cool. But two,
we also had a storyline

406
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.200
reason where it needed to
be a hardware implant rather

407
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.740
than a software implant. And
so we got to thinking,

408
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.260
well, do we have a
hidden camera in the room

409
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.890
that didn't work out? What
about something in one of

410
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.770
his devices, key logger? No,
that wouldn't work well. What

411
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.110
about in the monitor? That
was kind of the thought

412
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.020
process that led us down
that path. Have you ever

413
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.170
bumped into a story requirement
or where a hack suddenly

414
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.540
didn't exist and you had
to really make something fictional?

415
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.050
We've almost always found a
way the, the OnStar hack

416
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.410
I mentioned earlier with stopping
the car was one of

417
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.650
those where at first read,
we're like, when, how are

418
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.000
we, how are we going
to make this work? And

419
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.100
then Cora and I went
back and forth on a

420
00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.690
few different ideas with Sam
Esmail and eventually landed on

421
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:05.460
Irving doing that social engineering
call to OnStar, which I

422
00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.550
was worried about how it'll
be received, but we actually

423
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:13.530
found documentation on the protocol
used in terms of making

424
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.200
the phone call, talking with
the emergency reps, the sequence

425
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.140
of things that happens when
you ask for a ignition

426
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.920
cutoff, the confirmation light, like
blinking of the brake lights.

427
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.200
And we replicated that on
the scene. And so we

428
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.720
made it work and it
was, it was well received.

429
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.550
There were some others where
likewise, we made adaptations. The

430
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:37.050
ups hack that starts in
season two and then continues

431
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.210
on, of course at the
season three was one with

432
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.720
a firm basis. In reality,
there have been hardware hacks

433
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.120
like that, where the, of,
or the bypass of digital

434
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.290
signature validation allowed for malicious
firmware to be introduced into

435
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.620
industrial control devices. There was
a hack of the Ukrainian

436
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.630
power grid a couple of
years ago, where that was

437
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.810
one of the techniques you
used. There have been data

438
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.200
center explosions caused by leaking
batteries. One of the other

439
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.590
consultants first provided that bit
of inspiration when the hack,

440
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.850
the ups hack was introduced
in season two. So there,

441
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.250
like I said, there's, there's
always been ways to weave

442
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.310
enough reality and to take
an initial concept and run

443
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.830
with it in a way
that we all find acceptable

444
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.500
Myself and the people who
listened to the show here

445
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.920
are largely, you know, application
developers. And I think that's

446
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.460
probably fair to say that
security folks would feel that

447
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.370
most application developers are blissfully
ignorant of a lot of

448
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.830
stuff. You know, we do
our best to avoid SQL

449
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.320
injection and kind of the
basic stuff. But I always

450
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.260
hear from the most paranoid
security people, like if you

451
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.960
really knew what was going
on out there, you'd never,

452
00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.050
you'd never sleep. I'm curious
on a personal note, like,

453
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.200
is that, is that true?
Is there, can you even

454
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.450
walk through your house without
feeling like you're looking for

455
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:57.370
exploits in your fridge? You
know, I'm, I'm jaded at

456
00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.460
this point after being in
the security industry as a

457
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.500
practitioner for 14 or 15
years now, I just intrinsically

458
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:10.120
assume that just about anything
can or will be broken

459
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.020
at some point. And I
mean, you know, the, the,

460
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.050
the headlines in the news
week after week kind of

461
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.890
bear that out. If it's
not a retailer being hacked

462
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.980
and losing millions of credit
cards, it's a healthcare company

463
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.280
being hacked and losing a
ton of patient data, or

464
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.130
it's an industrial control system
being hacked because something was

465
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.320
exposed to the internet in
a way that it shouldn't

466
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.620
have been. And so I
think that that general awareness

467
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.490
is, is not just limited
to security practitioners anymore because

468
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:43.390
enough of these make the
headlines week after week, we're

469
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.870
in an interesting place where
there are in some places

470
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.740
better security technologies than have
ever existed. Like, you know,

471
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.380
often will say that the
computer in your pocket, if

472
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.830
you have a, an iOS
device, for example, is many,

473
00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.400
many orders of magnitude more
secure than any general computing

474
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.930
device that we've previously engineered.
And so we've, we've clearly

475
00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.120
come a long way in
learning how to build secure

476
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.660
things. The problem is that
while that may be the

477
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.500
case, the rate at which
other computing devices that don't

478
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.680
have that degree of due
diligence into their engineering and

479
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.150
are thrown online at an
incredible pace, just vastly out

480
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.840
seeds exceeds rather the pace
with which we can continue

481
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.650
to build and design and
enforce good security practices. And

482
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.890
so the scale at which
that's happening is, is frankly

483
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.790
terrifying, but we'll probably continue
to inspire really entertaining fiction.

484
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.970
I hope so. I'm curious
though, without getting too much

485
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.560
of the specifics or trying
to pick on iPhones versus

486
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.970
whoever, but is it because
of smart people at Apple

487
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.670
designed the iPhone to be
more secure, or is it

488
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.610
because of the walled garden
that it lives within versus

489
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.060
all the different Kickstarter things
where someone decides to make

490
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.220
a light bulb that runs
a version of Linux and

491
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.130
then puts the IOT device
out there in the world

492
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.380
and then goes out of
business, you know, is this

493
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.260
a matter of the architecture
of the iPhone or a

494
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.580
focused way of securing that
Apple is applied to it?

495
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.770
Well, I think the architecture
comes from that focus and

496
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.500
there's obviously a business focus
also in having a walled

497
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.910
garden, but I think iOS
and on, on the Google

498
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:27.350
side, chromo S are examples
of operating systems where security

499
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:32.420
begins at the hardware layer
of trust that is isolated

500
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.630
from the software and the
underlying operating system. And that

501
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.600
alone is a very different
design decision than kind of

502
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.740
the way general purpose computers
and PCs that we grew

503
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:49.310
up with work. And from
that point every time the

504
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:52.430
system has opened up a
little bit more to allow

505
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.910
for applications to run, to
allow those applications, to share

506
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.720
data with one another, to
add extensions, they're all being

507
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.920
added incrementally after a lot
of scrutiny about how to

508
00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.770
make sure they still work
with that underlying foundation of

509
00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.820
security that the, the operating
system was initially designed for

510
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.340
the device was initially designed
for it. So it's kind

511
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.830
of the opposite approach of
starting with something that's completely

512
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.470
open and unrestricted, and then
trying to cordon off activity.

513
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.090
That's kind of the ongoing
struggle of enterprises now with

514
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.840
your classic windows and Linux
PCs. And I mean, even

515
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.920
we see that with OSX
on the desktop where I'm

516
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.980
taking an open operating system
and then constraining and securing,

517
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.260
it is far more difficult
than starting with something very

518
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.230
closed off at the hardware
layer even, and then adding

519
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.150
incremental features to, to make
it do more things. And

520
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.340
it seems like also even
really, really close systems like

521
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.970
the Nintendo switch, as an
example, if they wanted to

522
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.730
make the Nintendo switch, able
to get onto a captive

523
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.330
portal into, onto hotel wifi,
they needed a web browser.

524
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.760
They put in WebKit and
the first exploits ended up

525
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.690
being that exploiting that, that
crack in the door. Yeah,

526
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.990
exactly. And I'm glad he
brought that up. I'm also

527
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.600
in my limited spare time,
a gamer and I have

528
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.590
in love, love my Nintendo
switch. I wish it had

529
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.330
access to game saves in
the cloud. And yes, please.

530
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.140
The reason that it doesn't
have game saves in the

531
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.410
cloud is because of concerns
over ease with which they

532
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.750
can be used to load
malicious code. And that's been

533
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:28.940
a pathway for, for hacking
gaming devices in the past.

534
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.820
And so obviously Nintendo is
trying to I'm sure engineer

535
00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.130
around that carefully, but, you
know, the same thing goes

536
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.100
with like the iPhone. For
example, I was a pretty

537
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.090
early adopter of the iPhone.
And I remember there was

538
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.730
early, early days where it
didn't have an app store

539
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.540
and everyone was kind of
just amazed that they could

540
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.200
even release the device without
supporting apps. And sure enough,

541
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.110
they incrementally added the feature
when they were comfortable doing

542
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.420
so in a way that
was secure. And of course,

543
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.230
conveniently also way they could
monetize really nicely. So the

544
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.150
say the same thing I
suspect will happen with, with

545
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.550
the switch and game saves.
And, you know, again, when

546
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:07.300
you incrementally add features after
putting the engineering thought and

547
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.100
how do I do that
securely you just end up

548
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.190
with a much different product
than when you take the

549
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.780
opposite tack. I sure hope
I fix that soon because

550
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.920
I've got like 85 hours
and goes Xenoblade blade. And

551
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.280
I'm, I swear if I
freaking lose that save, I'm

552
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.740
going to be, Yeah. I
didn't know what I do

553
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.780
if I lost my breath
of the wild save after

554
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.470
all those hours. Yeah. So
my last question is how

555
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.010
close is his company reality?
Like if you look at

556
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.340
the company that you work
for Tanium, is that company

557
00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.550
similar to the security and
endpoint systems management companies that

558
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.450
you see in shows like
mr. Robot? So it's interesting

559
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:47.460
because we, we joke at,
at work that evil Corp

560
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.790
would be a great real
world customer for the technology

561
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.030
like Tanium, because we really
specialize in doing security and

562
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:58.380
operations at massive scale environments
that sometimes have hundreds of

563
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.480
thousands of computers. The kind
of flip side of that

564
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.850
is in the entertainment world.
And even in mr. Robot,

565
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.850
the sort of day to
day functions of it ops

566
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.860
like patching systems is not
really something that is terribly

567
00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.290
exciting. And so, you know,
we have that glimpse of

568
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.600
that in that one episode
of mr robot, but then

569
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.410
most of where, you know,
interest in television and media

570
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.440
around computer security, isn't showing
the hacking or showing people

571
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.520
catching and detecting and stopping
the hacking. We do plenty

572
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.220
of that, attaining them, but
from a software perspective, in

573
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.140
other words, equipping companies to
fish for themselves and detecting,

574
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.660
responding to attacks. And so
depicting that in a show

575
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.110
is hard because it's really
like a internal operations and

576
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.650
internal security function. The other
company that I kind of

577
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.950
analogized to my past life
is all safe in the

578
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.240
beginning of mr. Robot. That's
where Elliot works. And that's

579
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.060
a lot like my prior
employer, I used to work

580
00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.200
at Mandiant, which is now
part of a FireEye, and

581
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.720
that's a consulting firm that
does incident response work. And

582
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.470
so having worked with a
lot of other consulting firms

583
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.010
that sort of day to
day job of having a

584
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.800
fire alarm from a customer
and having to respond to

585
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.600
a breach and investigate is
something that is really compelling

586
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.790
to see on screen. I
think mr. Robot did a

587
00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.790
great job in season. One
of, of kind of capturing

588
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.200
that little bit of industry.
Yeah. I think, you know,

589
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.620
again, the cool thing is
more and more people touch

590
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:34.800
technology as part of their
day jobs than ever before.

591
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.130
And so just as you
have, as you mentioned before,

592
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.120
shows that highlight bits of
the medical industry like hospital

593
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.110
dramas and shows that illustrate
bits of the legal industry,

594
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.750
like the myriad of courtroom
dramas, I think you're going

595
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.240
to continue to see more
and more shows that show

596
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.950
bits of what it is
to be a day in

597
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.470
the life of people involved
with technology and the corporate

598
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.530
world. That's going to be
true from a consulting perspective

599
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:02.500
or internal, like it options
security. Very cool. Well, thanks

600
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.440
so much, Ryan. Kazanjian for
chatting with me today. I

601
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.960
really appreciate it. No problem.
Thank you, Scott. It's great

602
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.420
to talk to you. And
this has been another episode

603
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.850
of Hansel minutes, and we'll
see you again next week.
