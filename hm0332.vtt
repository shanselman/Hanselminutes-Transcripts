10
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.900
Taylor Mullen about how he
interviewed and joined Microsoft. Hi,

11
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.870
this is Scott Hunter and Daniel
and Taylor mullet. And we're

12
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.110
filling in for Scott Hanselman
this week because, and I

13
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.050
walked down the hallway and
we couldn't find Scott and

14
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.160
we saw it was getting
to the end of the

15
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.470
week. And we're like, where's
Hanselman. It's going to come

16
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.200
from this week. And we
thought, heck, we'll just record

17
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.340
it ourselves. So the topic
we thought we'd do today

18
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.300
is what is it like
to join Microsoft? What is

19
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
it like to come out
of college and join the

20
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.770
board? So we've got in
Taylor Mullin here today, and

21
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.860
he's gonna tell us about
how we joined Microsoft. So

22
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.490
how did you get here?
So it all started off

23
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.590
in college. And one day
senior year we had an

24
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.380
evangelist from Microsoft come in.
Her name was Lindsey Lindstrom,

25
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.790
and she came in and
said that the imagine cup

26
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.150
would be a really great
opportunity to go ahead and

27
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.720
get us introduced to the
whole Microsoft world and potentially

28
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.180
show what we've been working
on through college and what

29
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.010
we could do. So started
working on our magical projects

30
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.000
and we ended up so
first off, what were you

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.510
doing at college when you
know, this Vangelis came to

32
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.340
Microsoft or Microsoft? So at
the time again, the beginning

33
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.230
of senior year, and we
mean, my teammates, Matthew was

34
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.280
snacking. He there's, we're just
programming, trying to get through

35
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.090
classes and basically just doing
a little side projects. So

36
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.850
we had been working on
this game called math dash

37
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.970
and it was a mobile
game for guess what? The

38
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.630
windows phone seven. And when
we heard about this, imagine

39
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.010
cuff ended up working perfectly
to fit into the whole

40
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.850
magic of goals. So we
started on this whole process

41
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.170
of doing imagine, how long
have you actually been here

42
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:08.650
now? Taylor, how long have
you been here? So I've

43
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.120
been here for around a
month and a week now.

44
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.420
So yeah, it's been great
experience so far. And so

45
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.330
you said you were first
introduced to Microsoft by this

46
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.660
evangelist talking to you about
how can you tell the

47
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.670
listeners what you imagined companies?
Cause I imagine a lot

48
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.260
of people haven't actually heard
of it. So the magic

49
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.040
cup is a Microsoft run
competition and technology competition, where

50
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.250
they challenged students to create
some sorts of technology, to

51
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.920
really help better the world.
And you can do things

52
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.520
from making a website to
make me gain that could

53
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.070
really make a difference to
the world. And you can't

54
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.280
get mad at States as
a whole to me, education

55
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.650
or health or the son
asked better. So what are

56
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.370
some of the topics that
they've chosen previous years? Imagine

57
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.500
cops is an example of
the pocket thing you're talking

58
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.950
about and what was the
topic of the year that

59
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.760
you were involved? So the
theme of this year's magic

60
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.180
was that imagine a world
where technology helps solve the

61
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.510
world's toughest problems and they
give you like three main

62
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.610
categories of what you can
choose from. So there's a

63
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.210
software design category, there's a
game design category, which has

64
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.540
two other categories in it,
which is Xbox and windows

65
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.610
phone. So you have the
chance to be in these

66
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.820
three categories. And I decided
to go ahead or my

67
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.650
team. And I decided to
go ahead and do the

68
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.080
windows phone game category. That's
interesting. I actually worked with

69
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.440
someone who won the imagine
cup in Australia back when

70
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.930
I worked at Readify, we
had recently just launched in

71
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.200
Australia as well. So did
you have any success once

72
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.400
you actually got involved? So
the whole thing started out

73
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.040
with just the national magic
cup, where we had to

74
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.010
go ahead and compete against
everyone in the United States. And

75
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.260
we ended up being really
successful. We got into the

76
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.420
finals and the next thing
we knew it, we ended

77
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.320
up winning the national imagine
forcing windows game design windows,

78
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.890
phone category. So we then
ended up going ahead and

79
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.380
going further and saying, well,
we'd really like to do

80
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.440
this on an international level.
So we then ended up

81
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.260
competing in the international competition,
which for the game design

82
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.500
foam category was complete, completely
different. We had to recompete

83
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.720
and all go through all
the rounds. We ended up

84
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.740
again becoming finals and we
actually could first, just like

85
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.010
in the nationals for the
international competition was out in

86
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.490
Australia. So that was a,
it was a very, very

87
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.300
fun experience and obviously helped
me get into Microsoft and

88
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.120
really kind of showed me
how awesome Microsoft is and

89
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.260
how diverse it really is.
So after you guys won

90
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.650
the imagine cup, did we
come out and ask you

91
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.900
to join Microsoft? Or what
was the next step there?

92
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.050
How did you, how you
end up here? So through

93
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.850
the whole process, please see
everything we did had Microsoft

94
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.990
somewhat attached. And so he
couldn't really help us kind

95
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.220
of view the how awesome
Microsoft really was. So Lindsey,

96
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.280
our Vangelis, she came up
to us and said, guys,

97
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.610
why don't you try buying
from Microsoft? This could really

98
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.090
work out. And so at
the time I applied to

99
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.220
Microsoft, this was actually before
I had won the national

100
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.330
competition and before when the
international competition, but I'm like,

101
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.880
this is worth a shot
and I'm really, really liking

102
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.990
what I see. So went
ahead and applied and Hey,

103
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.580
here I am now. So
when you say you applied,

104
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.370
does that mean you went
to careers.microsoft.com and fill out

105
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.510
a resume there? Or how
did you actually apply? So

106
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.420
it was kind of a
mix of both. At first

107
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.550
we had talked to Lindsey
and she said, Oh, well,

108
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.710
I'll get you in touch
with someone. But then they

109
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.180
said, you know what? You
should really go through the

110
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.190
proper route with this and
go ahead and fill out

111
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.120
something on careers.microsoft.com and see
what comes about. So we

112
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.340
did that when I say
we I'm talking about me

113
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.370
and my other teammates were
on the team he imagined.

114
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.760
And so we went ahead
and filled that out and

115
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.030
we got contacted. We went
through interviews and next thing

116
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.160
you know, I was flying
out to Seattle to have

117
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.490
my onsite. So I've heard
all these crazy stories about

118
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.370
these Microsoft interviews being tough
and brutal and stuff like

119
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.350
that. So can you tell
us a little bit, Hi,

120
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.330
I have to say there's
definitely a lot of talk

121
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.240
out there of Microsoft interviews
might not be as hard

122
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.960
as other ones, but I
interviewed at Google, I interviewed

123
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.540
a lot of other top
notch companies and Microsoft was

124
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:34.270
definitely an equal caliber and
very difficult, enjoyable, almost. It

125
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.730
was, it was enjoying, but
nerve wracking at the same

126
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.100
time, because when through the
interviews, I'm like, Oh, did

127
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.770
I answer that well? And
was that the correct answer?

128
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.530
Is there a better answer?
And you're just constantly doubting

129
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.990
yourself and kind of checking,
but it was a great

130
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:54.100
experience. It's interesting to hear
people's experiences about, cause I

131
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.230
don't think a lot of
people talk about it openly

132
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.990
for one reason or another
on myself. I mean, I've

133
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.700
been here nearly three years
now. I was what we

134
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.000
call an industry hire. And
I know Scott has talked

135
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.710
about this on the podcast
before the ratio between industry

136
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.680
highs and Microsoft versus college.
And I'm assuming that you're

137
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.200
classified as a college high
because you hang straight out

138
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.170
of college. So I'm wondering
if the types of things

139
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.600
that they were testing were
a little bit different. Also

140
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.810
you apply for a developer
role. And I obviously interviewed

141
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.940
for a program management role.
So I know when I

142
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.420
interviewed, I interviewed with a
bunch of different program managers.

143
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.370
I think new Scott, I
interviewed the old boss at

144
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.490
the time Calvin, I needed
you move a bunch of

145
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.650
people from the team. I
was going to join my

146
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:42.130
immediate bosses, bosses boss six
in the day, the topics

147
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.380
weren't about programming. This substrate
is always going to be

148
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.490
a program manager. It was
more about product development. What

149
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.490
type of things did they
talk about the developers? Actually,

150
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.780
I like to interject as
well. I think when, when

151
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.320
you and I interviewed, we
both interviewed knowing what we

152
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.240
were going to go in
as well. And that's something

153
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.550
I'd love to hear. If
Taylor knows, knew what team

154
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.770
he was going to join
or are, he was just

155
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.040
interviewing broadly across Microsoft and
just kind of landed over

156
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.740
here. So I'd love to
know. As I said, we,

157
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.890
we both interviewed specifically for
the AFL team or the

158
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.550
visual web developer team. So
what, who did you interview

159
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.330
for? So when I first
started, they give you this

160
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.940
little sheet and they say,
what would you like to

161
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.590
be a part of? What
team would you like to

162
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.020
be a part of? Because
being in college higher as

163
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.870
I am, you don't have
to have as you don't

164
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.330
apply for a specific team,
they really try and place

165
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.510
you in a team that
really works for you. So

166
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.780
I am really into new
technology, finding stuff that is

167
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.310
basically bleeding edge and really
making it, making a difference

168
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.060
in the tech industry. So
I ended up interviewing for

169
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.150
them and designer team as
here I am now. And

170
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.800
it was just one of
these things where I'm like,

171
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.430
how this is perfect cloud
computing. What could, could be

172
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.900
less impactful? Is this, so
this was, is absolutely enormous

173
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.940
to kind of get this
opportunity to interview for a

174
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.840
team, which was exactly what
I wanted. And I'm asked

175
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.280
for naming your question of
like the questions I was

176
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.340
asked or how was it
like in my experience with

177
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.530
it, I kind of came
in after reading a lot

178
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.460
of the interviews online thinking
there's not going to be

179
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.730
too much. COVID maybe it'd
be 50 50. Well, it

180
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.690
ended up being just one,
see a program question per

181
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.390
interview with multiple interviews in
a single day. And as

182
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.790
they went through, we got
harder and harder and harder.

183
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.270
So it was just a
progressive thing where I'm like,

184
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.220
Oh, the next interview, they
want to ask me a

185
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.610
programming question. And I eventually
ended up getting to the

186
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.620
very last question, our very
last interview. And usually Microsoft

187
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.400
use the very last one.
It means that you've done

188
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.120
pretty well so far. So
I'm sitting there and I

189
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.730
am interviewing with basically my
two bosses bosses boss, and

190
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.690
he's asking me really, really
difficult questions, hard to wrap

191
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.270
your head around. And then
he also then goes ahead

192
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.400
and says, alright, you need
to program this right now

193
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.950
on the computer. So usually
you might be able to

194
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.610
get away with, okay, I'll
whiteboard it and abstract some

195
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.010
ideas out. Then I had
to sit down there and

196
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.370
really kind of work this
out. And it was absolutely

197
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.610
nerve wracking doing this for
my boss's boss's boss. And

198
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.740
then on top of that,
trying to figure out this

199
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.800
almost seemed like impossible question,
but it ended up working

200
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.530
out in the end. I
somehow hello, absolutely fantastic experience.

201
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.790
So after that day was
over and you walked away,

202
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.070
how long was it till
you got an offer from

203
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.400
Microsoft? Did you, when you
left or was it when

204
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.080
you got home? How did
that work out? Well, after

205
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.440
having gone there, I was,
I heard it usually is

206
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.390
like around like a week
and a half or so,

207
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.520
but I ended up walking
out and I think I

208
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.940
got it the next day.
So they really had a

209
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.660
fast turnaround around, you hear
all these horror stories about

210
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.600
how it can be really
difficult for a recruiter, really

211
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.890
keep on touch with people
where they're recruiting for Microsoft

212
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.180
experience. It was almost instant
turnaround for everything that I

213
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.490
did and instant feedback. So
I knew what I had

214
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.130
bright, what I did wrong,
where I was going and

215
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.640
what I could potentially have
in the future. So after

216
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.780
all of that, you get
an offer in Microsoft. And

217
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.950
I'm curious, what's the experience
like when you first come

218
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.750
up here the first day
at work, what is, what

219
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.320
is that like at Microsoft?
Well, I went ahead and

220
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.540
I guess for the first
day of work, any Microsoft

221
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.740
employees, you have something called
Neo new employee orientation. And

222
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.040
first thing we realize is
that you're not alone. There

223
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.150
is around three, 400 people
sitting in one enormous room

224
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.600
with you. I think Microsoft
hires something like 12,000 brand

225
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.450
new employees a year and
being a company of only

226
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.460
a hundred thousand people. That's
absolutely enormous. So seeing all

227
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.500
these other people around you
for as I feel like,

228
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.080
wow, there's a lot of
people. The next they go

229
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.630
ahead and ask everyone a
question. So where is everyone

230
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.790
from? What countries are you
from? And we ended up

231
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.510
having like 35 different countries
from around the world and

232
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.310
it really showed how diverse
Microsoft really is. You aren't

233
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.890
just all from America or
all from this in one

234
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.100
given country, you're from all
around the world. And you're

235
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.330
interacting with people who have
different cultures, different skillsets. And

236
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:27.070
it was absolutely exciting. You're
basically shaking the whole day.

237
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.710
You're so excited to be.
There was like, wow, I

238
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.290
can't believe this is actually
happening to something I've dreamed

239
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.540
of my entire life. And
next thing you know, here

240
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:38.410
you are, and you're actually
doing your dream. I'll be

241
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.360
curious to ask this around
the entire room here. I

242
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.670
remember when I would do
the same process. And I

243
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.790
remember the first day we
went through this Neo process,

244
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.990
new employee orientation. And the
second day, I think you

245
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.370
could, you can leave early
and go to your office

246
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.840
and check out your office
for the first time. And

247
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.540
I've worked at a few
places in my career and

248
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.700
I'm like, okay, I'm going
to walk in. And there's

249
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.350
going to be like a
desk set up with all

250
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.750
my stuff. And I remember
I walked in and there

251
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.240
was just a pile of
boxes with computers and monitors

252
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.030
and stuff like this. And
I'm like really Microsoft. I

253
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.210
mean, we've got a hundred
thousand employees and it's build

254
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.160
your own. Was that, was
that your experience? That's exactly

255
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.230
what happened to me. So
again, they said early, you

256
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.520
can leave early and go
out of your office. A

257
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.370
lot of people won't do
that. So we got out

258
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.150
at five at three o'clock
or something, and I found

259
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.030
the building, you learn how
the shovels work, how to

260
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.620
get on with the campuses
and all of this, obviously.

261
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.600
So as a new company,
you're trying to figure out

262
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.970
how do I get from
where Neo is in this

263
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.390
particular building over to wherever
it is ongoing. And at

264
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.560
that point it was building
out the office. And then

265
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.840
I was like, Oh, there's
a desk with a box

266
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.730
with a mini tower in
it. And two monitors and

267
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.680
you've offices in a box
with a keyboard and a

268
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.200
box of the mouse. And
it's like, build your computer.

269
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.280
I'd love to mention of
Oxford. I am in a

270
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.500
box with an extra hard
drive. So I had to

271
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.750
actually take the computer or
pot, put extra bits in

272
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.220
it. And they were made
for me, that was fine.

273
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.530
I've been working computers since
I was 15. I've built

274
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.580
hundreds of thousands of computers
before, but it was jarring

275
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.290
in some way. I was
like, Oh, I texted them.

276
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.720
This it, or whoever would
just take care of this,

277
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.080
but it was actually kind
of empowering too. So entail.

278
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.870
Or was it the same
for you? Or what was

279
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.110
it called? It was absolutely
during for me too. Yeah,

280
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.120
I got there, there was
a big pile of boxes

281
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.460
and I'm like, wait, did
they forget to set my

282
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.340
stuff up? So your reaction
we all had, I don't

283
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.140
know why we expect, I
don't know why we expected

284
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.700
it because at the end
of the day is if

285
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.640
Damien said, you know, in
some ways it's your computer,

286
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.750
you want to own it.
You want to set it

287
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.220
up your way. You want
it to be your way.

288
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.200
So I mean, it's, in
some ways there's a lot

289
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.940
better. If I came into
a machine that was already

290
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.950
set up, I probably would've
just paved it down anyways

291
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.230
and set it up my
way. But it is funny

292
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.330
to go, okay, this huge
company and your first day,

293
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.510
it's like a stack of
boxes. The other funny thing

294
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.050
I remember was my boss
at the time, walking into

295
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.600
my office and I knew
how to walk to his

296
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.150
office and back to my
office. And then later in

297
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.860
the day, I found myself
in a corner of the

298
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.780
building. And, you know, as
Damien said, the campus is

299
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.610
huge and these buildings are
huge and they've got winding

300
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.280
hallways and stuff like this.
And I'm like, here's my

301
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.960
first day. And I'm not
sure I can find my

302
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.670
office again. And I'm like,
that's the worst thing to

303
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.120
just say your first day
is like, Hey, you just

304
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.950
hired me. And I can't
find my own office. And

305
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.200
I remember walking around for
about five minutes to find

306
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.560
my office. You know, I
had a similar experience and

307
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.220
I also distinctly remember recognizing
faces in the hallway, like

308
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.700
the who's, who of the
Microsoft technology elite. And then

309
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.980
my first office was literally
on the other side of

310
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:36.140
the kitchen. And then I
ran the other corner was

311
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.540
Scott Guthrie's boss at the
time. So he was the

312
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.970
head of head of dev
here. And I remember getting

313
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.670
a coffee on the second
day and the kitchenette and

314
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.220
I was standing in line
behind Soma to get my

315
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.020
coffee. And I just couldn't
help myself. I said, Oh,

316
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.040
you know, you also Mirage
because I know, Oh, you

317
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.350
know, I just thought it,
I it's funny. Cause we

318
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.750
talk about interviewing. We do
have bosses, bosses, boss, and

319
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.570
it gives you this. Maybe
gives people the idea that

320
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.670
Microsoft has this huge hierarchy.
It was one of the

321
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.230
first things you do when
you get your computer running

322
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.330
is you get outlook open.
You do have any gal

323
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.790
surfing and you go off
to see how many levels

324
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.620
it is until you hit
a bomber over the top.

325
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.440
And it really isn't that
many it's less now than

326
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.660
it was now than it
was back then. And so

327
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.260
even on a day to
day basis, it's actually incredibly

328
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.260
flat. A lot of the
times we end up having

329
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.380
conversations with your boss's boss's
boss as well. So you

330
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.710
might be Palmer or whatnot,
or, you know, two levels

331
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.380
away. It's pretty flat to
spot the fact that you're

332
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.830
HR wise, NYP, if you
level in you and really

333
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.880
know, well, another funny aspect
of that too is is,

334
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.370
you know, you think this
huge company, a hundred thousand

335
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.410
people that you would never
see the Steve Wallner's, the

336
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.400
Somas, the Scott Guthrie's, the
Jason's Andrews and the campus

337
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.380
is pretty amazing that on
a regular basis, you're going

338
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.240
to run into all those
kinds of people. So you're

339
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.880
going to run into your
boss's boss's boss and have

340
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.310
a chance to have a
conversation in the hallway. My,

341
00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.510
my funniest rendition of this
was I was in the

342
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.440
parking deck one day and
someone was behind me and

343
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.510
some I had lost, I
love this badge at home

344
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.300
that day. And we had
this policy that you're not

345
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.670
supposed to ever let somebody
in the door unless they

346
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.340
have a badge. If they
call it tailgating here, if

347
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.170
you, if you let somebody
follow this all in with,

348
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.560
at heart, I remember someone
was behind me and I'm

349
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.960
like, I just held the
door open. Oh yeah, I'm

350
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.400
going to that. I'm going
to leave. Someone was standing

351
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.170
in the parking garage and
making what walk up to

352
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.340
reception to, I forget a
badge to get in the

353
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.310
building. So I've got a
question for Taylor again, you

354
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.780
know, we kind of talked
about how you got here.

355
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.100
What are you working on?
So right now I'm focusing

356
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.610
on open source technology, more
specifically called signal and signal.

357
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:56.000
It's basically allowing asp.net applications
in any application in general

358
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.550
to really be real time.
Right now there's a huge

359
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.270
trend in the market going
towards having real time applications

360
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.630
where a certain person does
something, then your friend or

361
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.440
somebody else will also see
exactly what you do. And

362
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.370
a signal are, is kind
of the framework to really

363
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.090
allow developers and allow people
to make their applications, have

364
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.990
this ability. And we're really
working on getting signal arts,

365
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.770
just make that an easier
process than it already is

366
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:27.120
today. So obviously I'm very
excited about this because it

367
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.690
is something I've been involved
in since the very beginning.

368
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.590
And I fact, I was
just thinking about it yesterday.

369
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.560
I trying to think back
to where it all started

370
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.230
the inception point. And there
was a presentation I did

371
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.740
at, at the mics, which
unfortunately no longer around and

372
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.140
my favorite conferences, but it
was a year ago, a

373
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.480
year and a half ago.
It was last April and

374
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.070
it wasn't even cold signal.
Or at that point, I

375
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.440
think we'd given it a
card name of Q or

376
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.870
something. I've had an example
of how to do Ajax

377
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.940
long polling in asp.net asynchronously
using SQL server notification services,

378
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.020
Curry notification services to get
the updates from a, from

379
00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.760
a background store and how
far we've come since then.

380
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.490
So it's great that we've
got a new developer on

381
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.650
the team now working full
time on signal. What type

382
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.200
of things that we actually
caught you doing other than

383
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.240
just I'm working on signal
all the specifics if you

384
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.370
work on. So we just
did a release yesterday. So

385
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.860
we were involved in that
role. So always most of

386
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.530
the year from love you
like, Oh, I don't work

387
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.220
on anything that is potentially
used to a certain application

388
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.400
here at Microsoft. That's not
the case I just started.

389
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.080
And I, and two features
shipping the latest version. I've

390
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.260
already gone ahead and built
for the next version and

391
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.060
obviously fixing bugs and really
just making sure that everything

392
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.100
that is built up to
beat and really getting a

393
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.130
product out so that all
users can really enjoy the

394
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.490
exactly what you do. So
you get this really gratifying

395
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.870
feeling of, wow, I'm doing
something that now is going

396
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.520
to affect thousands of people.
So, yeah. So I'm curious.

397
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.360
I mean, you always hear
outside of Microsoft, is this,

398
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.040
this huge door with layers
of management, stuff like that,

399
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.260
and you can't get stuff
done quickly. I'm hearing the

400
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.360
opposite. I'm hearing that you
joined and within a few

401
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:09.220
weeks, you're adding features already.
Yeah. Actually signal R is

402
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.550
complete based on GitHub. And
I've had multiple requests with

403
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.120
multiple features involved in them.
And I'm just doing a

404
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.500
part of the team already.
I feel like I've been

405
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.510
here for a year, even
though I've only been here

406
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.180
for just over a month,
just because of what they're

407
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.400
having me do. And really,
I guess they call it

408
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.870
Microsoft drinking from the fire
hose where there's so much

409
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.140
to learn if you're willing
to learn it, which most

410
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.320
people, if not all people
here are, and there's so

411
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.970
much to gain. Do you
have any pet projects you're

412
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.860
working on at the moment?
They'll do a signal or

413
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.750
anything else? Is that something
that like when you get

414
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:49.090
in <inaudible> and you're in
the team room, what are

415
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.780
you working on before anyone
else ends up being a

416
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.160
developer in loving radio, definitely
have side projects right now.

417
00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.340
I'm actually working on a
demo and again, ignores real

418
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.520
time. So making games, making
a game that will actually

419
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.300
allow players to play against
each other, have little ships

420
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.160
through each other and to
have as many players as

421
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.970
there. So that something like
this might seem like it

422
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.420
takes years for some of
these games that you see

423
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.780
for multiplayer games, I've gone
ahead and done it around

424
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.100
two hours. So it's just
a little project that has

425
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.610
made so much easier by
simplification. So once I started

426
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:32.560
working on it, I couldn't
help them make something. That's

427
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.690
cool because I know David's
working on a game as

428
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.050
well. I wanted you to
use the name cause I'm

429
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.140
sure it's probably riff off
of a real game today,

430
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.550
but I know he's been
working on a game as

431
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.630
well. So hopefully you two
together working on different games,

432
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.820
samples can land on a,
a really good example that

433
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.080
people can use to build
HTML five based real time

434
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.260
games. That'd be fantastic. I
mean, working on your cricket

435
00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.040
as well, of course, you
know, I've got this little

436
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.340
hallway and you turn around
the hallway and see two

437
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.720
things. First is this awesome
cricket setup. And I guess

438
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:14.530
I'll leave the other one
out for now. The average

439
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.550
five o'clock cricket in the
hallway. It's this something that

440
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.560
you have to do? Every
is team building right here.

441
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.470
We have fun yesterday. We
went in, it was two

442
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.180
days ago. We were playing
cricket and those by five

443
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.180
30, I think it's part
of the building. I will

444
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.850
say that it's only many
people over there. And I

445
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.710
think Val was batting and
I was in an office

446
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.530
fielding because occasionally the bowl
come into the office and

447
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.310
I came out of the
office. Yeah, right in front

448
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.530
of me. And I was
like, Oh, don't hit girls.

449
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.190
He comes down the office.
And he found that quite

450
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:55.060
funny that we were in
the afternoon. <inaudible> Because I

451
00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.880
want to thank Taylor for
kind of explaining to us

452
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.270
what it's like to interview,
join and start programming at

453
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.570
Microsoft. We might be back
next week. I don't know

454
00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.150
if we don't find Hanselman.
This crew might be back

455
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.090
next week doing another one
of these podcasts. So thank

456
00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:17.770
you very much. <inaudible>.
