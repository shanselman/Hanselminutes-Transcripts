00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.580
tables and interviews. Scott. Hi,
this is Rob Connery, and

10
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.730
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. I'm sitting in

11
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.290
for Scott today. My guest
today is Scott Hanselman. Scott

12
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.280
Hanselman, as you might know,
has the blog of hanselman.com

13
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.040
where everything is all about
Hanselman. So Scott, I want

14
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.950
to jump right in. I
know your, your show is

15
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.270
all about keeping on a
straight tight rail. And I

16
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.300
want to start and just
talk about you, cause we

17
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.310
don't really talk about you.
You talk about you on

18
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.980
the show, but no one
else talks necessarily about you.

19
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.280
I know that Moe interviewed
you once, but I think

20
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610
it's time for someone to
interview you who might possibly

21
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.970
not be your spouse and
might actually ask you some

22
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.060
difficult questions. Let's start with
you. I'm reading here on

23
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.840
the about me page of
your blog. And it says,

24
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.480
you know, my name is
Scott Hanselman, web technologist, and

25
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.480
teacher. I work out at
my home office on the

26
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.950
web platform team at Microsoft.
What does that mean? What

27
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.070
do you do? I work
out at my home office

28
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.880
with web platform team at
Microsoft doing what? So, okay.

29
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.380
So I work for Scott,
Hunter, Scott Hunter, who manages all

30
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.870
of asp.net and he's our
program manager lead. So he

31
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.870
manages all the guys that
work on asp.net. So the

32
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.000
people that work for you,
you know, Scott, Hunter, I

33
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.970
do. Okay. So my peers
and the people who work

34
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.010
for Scott Hunter are Damien Edwards,
who does web forms, Daniel Roth,

35
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.730
who does web API, Eric Porter,
who does web pages and

36
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.900
MVC myself. Let me see
what else works for Scott.

37
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.730
And Scott's getting more and
more people working for him

38
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.280
now. So I need to
remember everyone because I know

39
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.490
we've moved a couple more
people under him, Howard. Yeah,

40
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.340
Howard Durking now works for
us. And Howard works on

41
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.290
new kid, Rowan Miller from
entity framework, Robbie solder, who

42
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.530
just moved over from.net framework.
Anton does PHP and myself,

43
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.810
and I think myself as
The PM of getting everything

44
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.170
to work together. So if
Damien is the PM of

45
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.080
web forms, right, his focus
is web forms and he

46
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.890
makes web forms. Awesome. And
I feel like my job

47
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.310
is like the PM of
one asp.net, trying to get

48
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.050
all the parts together, try
to make sure that the

49
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.620
scenarios run end to end.
I'm the guy that wants

50
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.810
to make sure that from
file new project up until

51
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.540
the moment you deploy, whether
you're deploying to Azure, because

52
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.880
we're now in the Azure
group or whether you're deploying

53
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.940
to something via, you know,
I don't know, FTP, that

54
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.920
that was a smooth experience.
So I'm looking at the

55
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.880
entire life cycle. I talked
to the entity framework guys,

56
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.680
if something breaks in migrations
and I talked to the

57
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.500
new get guys, if something
breaks a new kit and

58
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.700
I talked to the optimizations
and you know, like Mads

59
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.880
Christianson who works on an
HTML five and CSS three

60
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.050
and all those things, I'm
kind of the, the PM

61
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.330
of miscellaneous or the PM,
The remainder. So if you

62
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.180
and I were in an
elevator and we're only going

63
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.420
up two floors, and I
said, what do you do?

64
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.680
What's your elevator pitch? I
would say, I'm an architect

65
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.350
on The asp.net team. And
I focus a lot. Yeah.

66
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.150
Community. Okay. So you see
yourself as maybe coordinating all

67
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.110
the pieces, putting it together
and basically providing a nice

68
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.200
story for.net developers. Is that
about right? I wouldn't say

69
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.180
providing well, providing a nice
story. I mean, that, that,

70
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.970
that gets close to marketing
and then we have a

71
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.120
marketing department, they make up
the story. Yeah. And we

72
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.400
ignore it. So We, you
know, we don't need a

73
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.160
story because we run things
a little differently and asp.net.

74
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.980
Cause it's open source. And
we have been open since

75
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.500
before Phil got there, you
know, and Phil just kick

76
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.200
the door open and I
continue to keep my foot

77
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.390
in the door. And you
think about the team, right?

78
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.420
I mean, Howard and Eric
and Rowan, and these are

79
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.660
everyone on the team is
interested in open source. And

80
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.060
we show you guys by
you guys, that would be

81
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.630
the set of all people
who are Not us. We

82
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.300
show you guys like daily
builds of stuff. Can we

83
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.900
brainstorm stuff? There's, you know,
there's nothing secret So that

84
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.540
I feel like people who
do stuff in secret need

85
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.660
a story. We, we have,
we kind of avoid having

86
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.570
a story. What I find
interesting is, is when I

87
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.500
asked you what you do,
you, you, you immediately involved

88
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.990
the rest of the team
and then you came around

89
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.670
to telling me, and this
is my role in the

90
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.720
team. That's psychologic. You're like
analyzing me psychologically. I guess

91
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.570
I didn't realize that. Well,
I mean we, yeah. I

92
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.460
mean, no one is in
charge of ESPN net except

93
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.620
all of us as a
team. So I think of

94
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.700
us As a unit. Well,
the interesting thing is we

95
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.770
also started talking about marketing
and a lot of people

96
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.290
have asked, you know, aren't
you, aren't you an evangelist,

97
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.590
which I know you bristle
at, But no, I'm not

98
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.260
in a vacuum. I would
say I'm an enthusiast, like

99
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.020
an evangelist job is to
sell and evangelize. And like,

100
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.210
have you heard the news?
Have you heard the good

101
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.620
news? Let me invite me
in and let me sit

102
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.760
on your couch and I'll
tell you all about the

103
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.110
news. I'll do that, but
not because it's my job

104
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.880
because I'm totally jazzed about
it. You know what I

105
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.350
mean? But I also stay
inside and by inside, I

106
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.960
mean, inside Microsoft, because I
think I can still fix

107
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.500
stuff. And I've said before
publicly that I would quit.

108
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.670
If I thought I couldn't
fix it anymore. One thing

109
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.980
that I know from working
with you for a short

110
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.770
amount of time, and then
also from talking to you

111
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.750
after leaving is the amount
of meetings that you go

112
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.540
to. And the amount of
times that you flat out

113
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.050
said no. And you know,
most people, when they go

114
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.210
to conferences, they see you
standing on a stage, you

115
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.950
go and Hey, look at
this, look at that, watch

116
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.710
this, watch that. So a
lot of people listening right

117
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.810
now might say, well, no,
Scott, that is what you

118
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.480
do. Who would they know?
And see that what you

119
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.030
do is the evangelist thing.
Hey, look at this. Hey,

120
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.460
wow. Wow. I see, I
think of that more as

121
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.940
a side gig, like the
getting out and talking to

122
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.340
people, thing is something that
we like doing, because we

123
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.060
feel that it's not just
the doing the little, you

124
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.570
know, Northwind database demo. It's
more about the, the conversation

125
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.510
you have afterwards. Right. And
the other thing is that

126
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.550
the, again, look at the
team that we've got here.

127
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.790
I mean, Daniel and Howard
and Damien are all really

128
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.510
good presenters, you know? So
I don't have to go.

129
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.550
And I'm like, people used
to say like on the

130
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.790
face of asp.net, but that's
totally not true anymore. I

131
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.920
mean, Damien got like two
out of the top 10

132
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.770
talks at tech ed this
year. That's not asp.net talks.

133
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.310
That's like talks in general.
So we have the people

134
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.500
who can do the talks.
You know, I don't need

135
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.470
to be the guy that
talks about asp.net because someone,

136
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.510
so many other people like
Mads, Christianson's going to be

137
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.300
doing some talks in Philadelphia
next year. You know? And

138
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.710
he's his, his reputation, his
reputation. Like These guys don't

139
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.710
fill a room like you
do. And I disagree. Damien

140
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.440
Edwards had 800 people at
his web form socket ticket

141
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.410
this year. Oh, that's web
forums. I'm just kidding. I'm

142
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.630
just saying the point I'm
making is that, let me,

143
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.610
let me put it this
way. I am, I don't

144
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.010
have anyone working for me
anymore. I used to have

145
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.500
a team and those guys
have gone on to do

146
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.110
other things and spread to
the winds. But my job

147
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.970
when I had, when I
had a team to manage

148
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.960
was to make those guys
look good. And now I'm

149
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.210
a peer on a team.
And I still feel like

150
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.850
my job is to make
them look good. So we're

151
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.860
grooming bigger, better, faster, stronger
presenters. And I think we're

152
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.650
achieving that. And those guys
are going off and doing

153
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.600
stuff. I mean, look at
Glenn block, right. You know,

154
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.690
doing his thing and the
node industry, you know, by,

155
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.970
by, you know, by himself.
So making more Hansel people,

156
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.150
if that's not too egocentric,
I think, I think it

157
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.670
is by definition. But you
know what I'm saying, make

158
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.940
making more people who are
jazzed in the right way

159
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.070
and my jazz, not just
going out and presenting about

160
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.770
it, but the taking the
information back and then beating

161
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.470
the bosses over the head.
Well, that's the thing that

162
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.160
I find interesting too, is
how many times I hit

163
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.640
people over the head Community
in presentations and meetings. Yeah.

164
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.690
Cause people, when, when they
People go to these conferences

165
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.120
and sit in the audience,
they just see you talking

166
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.490
about the neat new stuff.
What they don't know is

167
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.940
what you had to go
through to make that presentation

168
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.750
happen or to make that
technology happen. And the reason

169
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:15.000
I'm bringing this up is
your blog lately has been,

170
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.320
let's just call it, gaining
some spice. And I think

171
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.560
what people are starting to
see is that you're letting

172
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.040
out that tenacity, if I
can use that word that

173
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.850
you use internally, you're starting
to let it out publicly,

174
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.710
which is something that, you
know, as your friend, I've

175
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.590
always been on you about,
you know, get some teeth

176
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.400
on that blog and you
have been, and it's, I

177
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.920
want to ask you about
that. How is that going

178
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.220
in terms of public perception
of you? Because as we

179
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.080
keep saying, you are the
guy who stands up in

180
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.660
front of people doing the
demos, and it's always been

181
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.270
very polished and people think
of you as, as a

182
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.930
sales guy. I hate to
say that, but, sorry. I'm

183
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.620
sorry. Oh, I know. I
mean, this is the thing

184
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.690
though, right? You can't go
and talk to anyone about

185
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.060
anything without them saying, Oh,
you're a sales guy. Like,

186
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.430
you know, Google IO was
a couple of days ago.

187
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.780
And I was like, okay,
I don't get it. Is

188
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.450
this, this Kindle fire? And
it was an honest question

189
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.940
and like 20 people, like,
are you trolling? Oh, Microsoft,

190
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.770
You know, remove your butt.
When you say, remove your

191
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.840
mouth from the boss's bot
or whatever. It's like, no,

192
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.820
I was an honest question,
you know? Yes, I did

193
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.340
the research. It's a powerful
device, but I mean, I

194
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.090
crap on every Equally. Yeah.
Anytime you say anything about

195
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.060
Microsoft, they always assume that
you're like, I don't know,

196
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.390
like I get money based
on how many copies of

197
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.040
windows I sell, which is
the other reason I like

198
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.850
working for this team because
everything we sell. Right. Yeah.

199
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.440
But I like, I would
go back to what you

200
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.300
were talking about before you,
you had a comment about

201
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.730
the meetings. Wouldn't you say
that one of the reasons

202
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.500
you left the company was
you just got sick of

203
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.890
trying to convince people of
your position. Absolutely. And that's

204
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.810
like, and that was the
argument. Like when you quit,

205
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.470
I was like, dude, you
need to like, try harder.

206
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.610
It didn't I say something
like, you need to play

207
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.760
the game and you were
like, no, screw it. Yeah.

208
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.220
I didn't have the wherewithal.
And I remember the conversation

209
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.170
that we had. It was
a, it was a, it

210
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.210
was a good one. And
we were in your garage.

211
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.210
I remember. And we, you
just said, what's up with

212
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.410
you, you know, don't you
have don't you have the,

213
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.120
I forgot the term you
used, but it was basically

214
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.730
the spiritual tenacity. Don't you
don't you have the ability

215
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.100
just to weather the storm.
And I said, no, man,

216
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.140
life is short. And I
don't want to, I don't

217
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.930
want to give up that
much. Yeah. And also I

218
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.150
think there's some people who
really look for conflict. And

219
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.190
despite what people think of
my presence on Twitter and

220
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.070
my blog, I actually don't
seek it out. I'm not

221
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.290
very good at it, but
there are other people who

222
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.860
actually are not necessarily good
at it, but they are

223
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:42.770
deft at dealing with a
public negativity. And I want

224
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.260
to bring this back around
to your blog because you

225
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.990
have been dealing with a
lot of negativity lately, but

226
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.580
for seemingly completely innocuous reasons,
I have to bring up

227
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.240
the floppy disk post. And
the floppy disk post was

228
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.860
Epic. Yeah. Between, between that
and the cloud icon, you

229
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.320
just don't mess with people's
iconography. They don't like it.

230
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.740
No, you, I remember someone
said you needed to shove

231
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.840
a screwdriver into your eyeball
or something. What was that

232
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.540
comment? I don't know. I,
you know, as much as

233
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.820
it does affect me, you
do have to intellectually like

234
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.490
emotionally, it affects me. It
makes me super sad as

235
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.770
why I always retweet. Like,
it's so funny. I've gotten

236
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.950
into this habit of retweeting.
When people unfollow me, people

237
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.770
get it's like people get
to people, get to psychologically

238
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.510
involved in that stuff. But
you know, it does hurt

239
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.490
if someone sends you a
mean email. Yeah. And then

240
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.150
I don't like that. But
in this particular case, the

241
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.180
case you're talking about this
post wasn't even that good,

242
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.420
you know, we'll talk about
it on an episode of

243
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.180
this developer's life, because it's
the definition of it is

244
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.650
drama. I mean, criticism is
one thing and being mean

245
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.780
is one thing we've talked
about those things before, but

246
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.750
drama, drama has no reason
to even exist. You know

247
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.630
what I mean? There's like,
dude, we're arguing about like,

248
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.690
what is it called? Bike
shedding. Yes. The term bike

249
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.520
shedding is like, when you
worry about the color of

250
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.520
the bike shed of the
nuclear power plant that we're

251
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.670
building, it's like, Hey guys,
we're building a nuclear power

252
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.400
plant. Pretty sure the color,
the bike shot doesn't matter.

253
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.800
But that's the thing that
you fight about, you know

254
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.310
what I mean? Like, okay.
Yeah. Some of the icons

255
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.720
were lame and it wasn't
really that good of a

256
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.300
post that would explain. I,
you know, I wrote it

257
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.820
while I was eating a
bagel. It took five minutes

258
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.270
to write that post. Do
you have any, do you

259
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.920
have any page views? No.
I don't want to take

260
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.900
a guess half a million,
1.2 million. Oh my goodness.

261
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.500
That is ridiculous. So here's
the question. Here's the question.

262
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.200
And I actually, I was
giving a presentation at a,

263
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.750
a blogging conference a couple
of weeks later, just as

264
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.850
a true story. I was
giving it with my friend,

265
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.090
lovey, who is a branding
and social media expert. And

266
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.390
the talk was about your
personal brand. So in the

267
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.850
talk I brought up the
issue of this post and

268
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.670
you know, 1.2 million page
views is insane. Right? That's

269
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.430
ridiculous. It's really, It was
for a number of reasons.

270
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.190
One, it's an obscene number
and most people would just

271
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.900
love to have that kind
of numbers on their blog.

272
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.320
Second reason is it wasn't
a good post. So when

273
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.060
you have something go viral,
that's one thing when you

274
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.160
have something that can go
viral and it's stupid, that's

275
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.430
even worse. But then in
the branding discussion, Can we

276
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:13.260
said, if that happens, if
your blog pops, do you

277
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.240
lean into it and chase
the page view right. And

278
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.840
start blogging up. Oh, okay.
Wow. Cloud icons that got

279
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.900
a lot of hits, you
know, blog about fonts, design.

280
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.040
I could change the entire
direction of hanselman.com and start

281
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.870
blogging about icons and an
Apple and complaining. And you

282
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.750
know, then I would be
somebody else who, I won't

283
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.020
say his name and wouldn't,
you know what I'm saying?

284
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.240
It's just like I could
go and just make declarative

285
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.240
statements about stuff that people
care passionately about. Or I

286
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.690
could just keep from my,
So let me, let me

287
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.010
just ask you really quickly,
because this is something that's

288
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.670
on my mind in the
past four or five Years,

289
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.880
I think you've had, you
know, I dunno how many

290
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.970
posts on hacker news omitting
the last, let's say the

291
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.150
last eight months over the
last eight months you are

292
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.860
on hacker news constantly. What's
changed. That's a, if that's

293
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.450
a, I don't know if
that's a source of success,

294
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.270
that's a representative number of
success. I don't think being

295
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.790
on hacker. I mean, before
hacker news, I was on

296
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.130
slash dot all the time.
And before that I was

297
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.050
on Reddit. I mean, I
just think hacker news is

298
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.990
like the thing that people
are reading. Now, at some

299
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.030
point I was on slashed
out a bunch and bunch

300
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.040
in the early two thousands.
It doesn't really matter. You

301
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.840
were like a blogging cat,
you know, and someone like

302
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.710
drilled cat nib on hanselman.com
and he relate. It almost

303
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.600
seemed to me like you
were having fun. Like you

304
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.300
had gained a bit of
attention, a lot of attention

305
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.090
from the internet, you know,
general internet. No, no, I

306
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.430
wouldn't say that. I would
say that. What, what I

307
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:46.490
would say is I had
a time in 2011 where

308
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.830
a lot of people at
Microsoft kept asking me to

309
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.860
blog about stuff I didn't
want to blog about. And

310
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.910
I don't like reminding my,
my, the people that worked

311
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.970
for Microsoft that the blog
is my blog. I just

312
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.220
don't like doing that, but
I continually kept doing it.

313
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.730
Then I went to work
for Hunter. Who's my current

314
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.920
boss and one of the
six Scott's between me and

315
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.990
Scott GU. And, and he
has no qualms of like,

316
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.630
I get that. It's your
blog blog about what you

317
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.050
want to. So anytime someone
wants me to blog about

318
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.930
something, I'll just CC Hunter,
and then he'll just shut

319
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.990
it down. You see what
I'm saying? So it's totally

320
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.570
awesome. Like, here's the scary
part. Actually. He's such a

321
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.850
good boss that I don't
know what he's hiding from

322
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.240
me anymore, which is concerning
because if I ever worked

323
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.040
for anyone else, I'm going
to be concerned that like

324
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.990
all the times that I've
gotten in trouble for blogging

325
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.740
about stuff like the windows
seven boot VHD thing, that,

326
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.710
that he's been shielding me.
And I'm going to discover

327
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.300
that he's been chilling me
from a lot of things.

328
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.790
You know what I mean?
So the point is though,

329
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.640
in 2011, I got tired
of that. And I called

330
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.020
Hunter and I was like,
dude, you know, if I'm

331
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.250
working for you, I'm going
to do my own thing.

332
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.840
And he's like, yeah, absolutely.
That's why we want you

333
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.880
to work for me, for
you. If you like, don't

334
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.510
blog about Azure until you
think it's useful. And you'll

335
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.430
notice that I've worked with,
here's a little news flash

336
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.110
actually for you, Rob, you
know that I've worked for

337
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.740
the Azure team since October.
The first time I mentioned

338
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.050
Azure was June 7th of 2012.
And you know what I

339
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.260
call the title of the
blog, post windows, Azure. No

340
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.500
kidding. I saw it. And
I was like, because I

341
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.380
want people to know that
it's what I care about.

342
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.270
Like I'm not going to
just blog about random crap.

343
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.680
Well, do people know this
about you though? And people

344
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.840
don't care? I don't know.
Funny to hear about, Oh,

345
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.470
I unfollowed him after he
blogged about, you know, whatever

346
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.020
people, just, people are fickle.
They blog, they follow it

347
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.980
unfollow and they unsubscribed, you
know, for whatever reason they

348
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:40.900
just, you know, it's, I'm
not the center of the

349
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.240
universe. They just float away.
I found out, yes, I

350
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.280
found it yesterday. One guy
thought that I haven't had

351
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.670
a podcast in two years.
You know why? You know

352
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.080
why? Cause, cause I broke
the RSS feed that he

353
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.370
was subscribed to. And he
literally hadn't thought since November

354
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.330
of 2010, he was like,
you know what happened in

355
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:03.620
2010? That's when I reg
Hansel minutes.com. So apparently I

356
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.710
screwed up a redirect and,
and he's like, Oh wow,

357
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.690
you have been. But then
another guy, yeah, a couple

358
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.180
of weeks ago was like,
your bog is lifeless. Your,

359
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.510
your, your podcast, his life
wasn't boring. And he's like,

360
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.920
you don't blog about technical
stuff anymore. Right. Or that

361
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.710
you don't blog or that
you don't talk about technical

362
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.440
stuff. So I go to
the archives and I go,

363
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.340
Oh wow. I haven't like,
yeah, he's right. You know,

364
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.740
I haven't really talked about
anything technical since like April.

365
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.890
So like Holy crap. I
have actually blogged like the,

366
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.480
you know, the last nine
podcasts have been decidedly untechnical.

367
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.270
So that, that gets to
your point I'm I guess

368
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.790
I'm digging other stuff. That's
like, you know how to

369
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.760
be black with Barrett Tuneday
Thurston relationship hacks with my

370
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.540
wife, Hansel minutes is maybe
only half technical. Now. Some

371
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.030
people totally love it. Other
people are like, yeah, whatever

372
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.990
he's jumped the shark. Well,
you know, it's funny that

373
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.880
I keep wondering about this
with you. I mean, as

374
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.810
your friend and being in
social circumstances with you, I've

375
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:04.160
seen you, you know, let
out that more tenacious side.

376
00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.760
You know, I wrote that
post a long time ago,

377
00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.920
Scott Hanselman is not a
whatever. And I recounted a

378
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.560
story, you know, when we
were in Vegas and it

379
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.370
was very funny, but you
basically took down a guy

380
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.980
who was heckling you. And
I think everybody in the

381
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.160
room just about fell off
their chairs because it's, this

382
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.130
is Scott Hanselman. You don't
see. And well, yeah. Remember

383
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.560
the time I talked to
Atwood and I swore, you

384
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.830
know, how many people who
I lost. I said like,

385
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.110
I think I said the
S word and people went

386
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.000
nuts. And I got goes
from like, I don't know

387
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.270
who, I don't know who
you are anymore. Yeah. And

388
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.780
I don't, we don't like
to swear on the show,

389
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.790
but it was a mistake
or whatever to, I don't

390
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.350
know. I didn't. And then,
and then I, then I

391
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.930
added in some bleeps and
then everyone, all the Australians

392
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.490
were like, well, you bleed
it out. What's wrong with

393
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.980
you, right? Yeah. You just
can't win. You know, who

394
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.920
knows? But like, here's the
thing too. The blog posts,

395
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.310
I love the ones that
I think rock, no one

396
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.130
cares about like the nerd
parent's guide to star Wars

397
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.580
that totally should have gone
viral. Nothing. You know what

398
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.830
I mean? Like crickets, you
can never plan these things.

399
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.370
And it's like, Oh man,
I love that one. And

400
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.180
visual basic six and Ruby
one, you know, again, a

401
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.210
couple of good comments, largely
ignored as a blog post.

402
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.250
And this is the point
that I make to people.

403
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.180
You just can't blog for
anyone but yourself, because I

404
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.000
don't want to blog about
cloud icons and floppy disks.

405
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.100
But that seems to be
what brings the traffic. Here's

406
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.100
the other thing that I'll
show you the chart of

407
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.220
my traffic. You know, how
many of those people stuck

408
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:36.080
around zero? Yeah. It's a
big Sawtooth kind of coming

409
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.730
back. I mean, dude, when
was the last time you

410
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:44.450
visited a funny viral website
and then returned never no

411
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.730
one stuck around. I didn't
get a single new subscriber

412
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:52.150
from that nonsense. So Whatever
dude, another interesting post he

413
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.940
wrote was about visual basic
and Lord. Yeah. That's the

414
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.340
one we just talked about.
Yeah. Getting off my lawn.

415
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.700
You were comparing VB six
to Ruby. And I remember

416
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.280
talking to you in London.
I was over in London

417
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.390
and we were talking about
the post and I was

418
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.640
reading some of the Twitter
comments that were coming in

419
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.510
and I was utterly shocked
at what people were saying

420
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.820
to you. And I remember
saying to you on the

421
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.990
phone, Scott, you've got to
put these people in their

422
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.500
place. You're Scott Hanselman. And
they're talking to you as

423
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.370
if you don't know anything.
And I, you know, you

424
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.410
respond, it was pretty temporary
and you sent me out,

425
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.850
they have a right to
explain what they want to

426
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:34.050
explain. And I remember thinking
to myself, if the.net community

427
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.540
had a Silverback, if I
could use that term from

428
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.140
gorilla gorilla, yes. Like the
head of a pack or

429
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.450
the head, like someone that
you respect and that, you

430
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.580
know, if you don't respect
the silver back, you get

431
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.890
a cuff, you know, across
the head. I remember thinking

432
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.380
to myself, if Scott reared
up and put someone in

433
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.860
their place, I think it
would be a natural pack

434
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.720
dynamic, if you will. And
I remember saying that to

435
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.380
you and you just kind
of said, well, you know,

436
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.040
what's the point. And I
wanted to ask you about

437
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.740
that again. And now in
retrospect, thinking about this post,

438
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.990
it's been out there for
awhile. Okay. Have you ever

439
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.730
had that feeling, just reading
the comments that come in

440
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.160
and the negativity that comes
in and some of your

441
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.360
posts and just saying, I
am Scott Hanselman, give me

442
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.460
some respect here. Have you
ever said that to anybody?

443
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:23.520
You know? No. You know,
keeps me from doing that

444
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.150
and you want to take
a guess who? My wife,

445
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.260
Oh, bless her soul. I'm
being totally serious. It's like,

446
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.740
that comes up. You know
what I mean? Like if

447
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.570
we are really in the
thick of it, like if

448
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.330
we're actually, you know what
I'm saying, Scott Hanselman. No,

449
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.940
I'm not saying that. But
she, before that even gets

450
00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.640
close, right. Like I think
like, I, it's not like

451
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.760
an argument. It's not like
people, huh, man. God. And

452
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.890
that is not on the
tip of my tongue, but

453
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.190
there'll be times when I'll
be like, I don't know,

454
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.030
rewiring the house's network or
whatever. Right. Or I think

455
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:03.900
I redid the baby cams
and the DNS wasn't resolving

456
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.570
internally. So she couldn't go
like HTTP call and whack,

457
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.450
whack child's name. She had
to know the IP address.

458
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.590
And she didn't want to
know that. And I was,

459
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.480
I didn't, I didn't know
why that DNS was. And

460
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.980
she was like, do you
need me to call someone?

461
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.840
Yeah. You know, you can
think what my very, I

462
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.050
was like, my very first,
you know, you want to

463
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.390
talk about a silver back
and I'm thinking like, no,

464
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.120
I'm pretty sure I've got
this. You know what I

465
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.760
mean? Like I'm kind of
familiar with, I could just

466
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.770
see Mo's face, you know
exactly what you said, you

467
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:37.050
know? She's like, yes, slick,
don't ya? You know, you

468
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.610
may take it. And I
think she said it for

469
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.870
me. I mean, I didn't
say a word. She she's

470
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.310
like, you know, you, maybe
he's got a handsome man,

471
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.530
but I do not need
you to talk to me

472
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.040
like that. You know, you,
you, you, this is not

473
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.190
on Twitter. This is this,
this is the children's cameras,

474
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.930
you know, fix it or
whatever. I did something similar

475
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.680
to that with you. I
think you had, you had

476
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.630
called me and asking me,
asking me for Ruby help

477
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.090
or something about comparing Ruby
to C sharp. And I

478
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.130
was showing you something and
I ripped you a little

479
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.840
bit. And I'm like, Oh,
you know, and Ruby there's

480
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.950
well, there's, it's it's dynamic.
So there's no, you know,

481
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.890
typing necessarily. And you were
just silent for a second.

482
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.200
And I just kind of,
I gritted my teeth and

483
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.040
like here and it never
came. And you're like, I

484
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.470
think I know. Cause I
don't, I don't, I just,

485
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.950
I, to avoid doing that.
I mean, Have you ever

486
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.920
had a moment though, where,
I mean, I would have

487
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.100
gotten comfortable with this podcast.
It's I'm sure it's kind

488
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.480
of like to be on
the other side. Cause you're

489
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.760
making it about, you're making
it about me. Is this

490
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.830
what Dave ward felt like?
When I talked about how

491
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.140
cool he was yesterday when
I talked to him most

492
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.830
likely, well, I'm curious though,
it's the floppy disk post

493
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:46.180
1.2 million views. You've moved
to the internet right there.

494
00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.250
How do you be? That's
the thing? Not that much,

495
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:51.580
very small varies. A little
bit more views than I

496
00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.000
could ever dream of having.
But you must've, at some

497
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.060
point wanted to just jump
out and rip these people's

498
00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.020
heads off and say something
like don't you disrespect me.

499
00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.060
I want it first. I
went, no, I would disagree.

500
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.340
I wanted to do the
opposite. I thought about just

501
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.570
deleting it. That was my
first impression. Then I thought

502
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:15.550
about adding something like adding
a comment that this is

503
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.000
not that big of a
deal guys. This is a

504
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.330
small thing. This is stupid.
I'm just, you know, I,

505
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.750
then I thought about maybe
just writing, I don't know,

506
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.200
like an update or some
kind of a little postscript

507
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.000
to say, yeah, I was
just playing, you know, no

508
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.850
hard feelings, but then it
got, Oh, it got way

509
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.280
too large. And just people
were like, I, what was

510
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.290
that one email I got
where someone called me an

511
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.650
ages little. Yeah. You know?
And he was just like,

512
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.160
it was an older guy
I presume, you know, which

513
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.810
makes me like, not want
to use the word neck

514
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.350
beard anymore, which I think
is an awesome word. But

515
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:54.520
it is ages to say
that, but it's also extremely

516
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.130
visible visual. Like yeah, I'm
reading your blog right now.

517
00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.910
The comment when there's one
comments is retarded article and

518
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.440
he goes on to rent
in the very end. It

519
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.230
says, why should we change
it? You know, the icons

520
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.260
is what he's talking about.
What's wrong with young people,

521
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.440
having a clue about their
past and knowing what I

522
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.820
know about you and your
geek trading cards is hysterical

523
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.880
to me. And my first
reaction, if this was my

524
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.310
blog would be, I'm gonna
put this guy in his

525
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.550
place, but you don't see
the point. I mean, you

526
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.520
never see me argue on
the internet. No, I know,

527
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.220
dude. Why bother? Why are
you arguing? Let me ask

528
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.500
you, do you think it's
wrong to stand up or

529
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.790
do you think it's just
something you don't want to

530
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.610
do? Oh, I have no
problem standing up. My point

531
00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.890
is what are you going
to, what is your goal?

532
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.390
Are you going to like,
get that guy to go

533
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.000
fuck you. And then you
get to go and do

534
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.960
little dance. Like, Oh, I
won the internet today. No,

535
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.740
that guy doesn't care. He's
never gonna, why put all

536
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.320
that work into changing his
perspective? I'd much rather take

537
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.960
the guy to lunch and
figure out why he thinks

538
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.760
that and then worry about
it later. But nah, he

539
00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.530
doesn't care. He's not, you're
never going to change that.

540
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.970
Guy's opinion. Put your stuff
out, respect their opinion. I

541
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.820
always say that I respect
your opinion. It freaks them

542
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.320
out. Frankly, if you tell
them that you respect their

543
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.800
opinion, it's interesting. It comes
down to a leadership thing

544
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.580
too. When you are considered
a community leader, a lot

545
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.670
of leaders out there in,
you know, in various communities,

546
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.740
military or whatever, when the
leadership has challenged, they have

547
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.190
to think very carefully about
the response. Of course, some,

548
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.320
some responses, you know, the
coldest one, the best one

549
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.380
often is just ignore the
person. Yeah. But there are

550
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.560
some responses where you definitely
have to rear up and

551
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.970
basically backhand a person and
I've never known the difference.

552
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.250
I just kind of fly
off. Whatever comes off the

553
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.900
top of my head and
tell people what I think

554
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.440
I don't have the same
as throttle you do. And

555
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.220
I'm always curious when people
have the ability to pull

556
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.690
it in, how much do
you regret it though? Don't

557
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.460
you regret it afterwards? Don't
you like? Aren't you go

558
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.140
off and be mean, and
then you're like, Oh man,

559
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.750
that was the wrong thing
to do oftentimes. Yeah. But

560
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.730
other times, you know, I
can look back and say,

561
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.100
well, that's, that's what I
was feeling at the time.

562
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.080
The times where it's the
worst for me is when

563
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.560
I completely misunderstand what someone
said. And then, then I

564
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.950
have to apologize later, but
we all do that. But

565
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.340
there are times where, yeah,
I've I've this just happened

566
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.550
with Pluralsight and, and in
tech pub and you know,

567
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.560
I was actually having a
little fun with them on

568
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.350
my blog and they didn't
understand it. It blew out

569
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.770
of control. Next thing I
know feelings are hurt and

570
00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.640
I'm on the phone with
Aaron Skynard and of course

571
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.170
we had a good yuck
over it. You know, when

572
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.000
I was in Europe, I
met the guy and we

573
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.340
had a good time, but
we both had to do

574
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.960
a little dance and say,
I didn't mean it. I

575
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.640
didn't mean it. I didn't
mean it. Yeah. And that

576
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.090
was bad that played out
for me. If you hadn't

577
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.010
said anything on Twitter that
way and just called in,

578
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.440
then you would have avoided
all that. And it wouldn't

579
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.600
still exist on the internet.
The question for me at

580
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.490
the time was I have
a company that I'm trying

581
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.340
to defend, you know? And,
and I felt like I

582
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.280
needed to defend it, but
T this is the thing

583
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.740
you don't need to defend
it. If you called him,

584
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.320
then he would have figured
it out and he would

585
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.600
have defended it for you.
It would have done the

586
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.340
tweet and then no one
would have, you know, it

587
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.230
would have just looked like
he came to Jesus on

588
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.780
his own, you know, see
then people wouldn't have the

589
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.760
drama. Drama is unnecessary while
you were, I would argue

590
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.920
that while you guys were
fighting about drama, I was

591
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.960
getting work done. That's true.
I mean, I throw this,

592
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.480
I mean, I do these,
these seminars and I have

593
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.490
a whole other life that
people don't know about what

594
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.160
I'm doing, blogging conferences and
social media conferences and stuff.

595
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:31.680
And this is nontechnical people
who don't know anything about

596
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.950
what I do in my
day job. And I've talked

597
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.470
about this a little bit
in my talks on productivity.

598
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.870
If you've ever seen my
talk, I didn't want to

599
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:41.620
code match, which I think
was the first time that

600
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:45.610
I'd done that Kind of
publicly was saying that, you

601
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.150
know, if it's not moving
your goal, if it's not

602
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.160
either making you money or
having you spend more time

603
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.880
with your kids, then don't,
don't do it. Like it's

604
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.580
not moving you forward. Arguing
on the internet does not

605
00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.770
put money in your pocket,
nor does it make your

606
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:04.050
code compile better. Absolutely. So
stop it. Although it sent

607
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.810
1.2 million hits to your
blog, although that wasn't really

608
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:10.320
arguing. So, so Here's the
thing. One of the guys

609
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.620
said on hacker news, this
is actually pretty good. He

610
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.100
says, you know how you
make $3 on the internet,

611
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.610
right. Make a declarative statement,
get hacker news. You know?

612
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.860
So, but this is the
other thing that I found

613
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.550
a little bit offensive, which
was the, that I, that

614
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.920
was like a goal, like
a master plan. Ah, yes.

615
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.320
Now I have made $3.
You know what I mean?

616
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.010
Exactly. Yeah. I've caught you.
You've seen my blog. Yes.

617
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:41.220
$6 People are jaded because
they read articles. Like, you

618
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.880
know, Atwood's infamous please don't
code, or please don't learn

619
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.850
to code. I mean, it's
impossible to move past that.

620
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.510
Well, but see the thing
is, I mean, maybe he's

621
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:55.230
making actual money blogging. I
don't know, but I would

622
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.890
be more concerned about blog
posts that say Fort, you

623
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.430
know, top 10, 14, 14,
ultimately, whatever, dah, dah, dah,

624
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.180
and then make you click
like multiple pages. Like if

625
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.840
I did my tools list
and it required one click

626
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.350
per, per tool, then I
think you could accuse me

627
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.320
of like page view farming.
You know what I'm saying?

628
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.950
Yup. Okay. So I think
what it's safe to say

629
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.820
is we can expect to
see maybe a little more

630
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.240
spice regularly on your blog,
but you're not going to

631
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.180
fight no one in the
comments. Cause you are, you

632
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.420
are so polite in the
comments. That's the thing. I

633
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.060
don't get trolls in my
comments. Like I get one

634
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.240
troll out of a thousand,
out of a thousand comments.

635
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.400
I get one troll and
I usually shut the guy

636
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.440
down just by being pleasant.
There's just no reason. It's

637
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.050
a community. Like it's like,
why are people jerks on

638
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.540
YouTube? Because there are no
moderators to be, to be

639
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.180
nice to them and get
them to chill out. You

640
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.090
know, meta filter has fewer
trolls than so then slash

641
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.750
dot does. And stack overflow
has fewer trolls than Reddit

642
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.020
does. Hacker news. You people
get shut down for being

643
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.960
mean. So just don't be
mean it's nice and easy.

644
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.080
Actually, If I put my
comments back on or my

645
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.500
blog, will you a moderate
and do the comments from

646
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.200
me? I don't think I
have the time to, To

647
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.660
pull the weeds that you
have happening at your blog.

648
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.650
My friend. All right. Well,
we have come up on

649
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:23.130
time. Scott, it's been a
pleasure interviewing you on your

650
00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.590
own show and letting me
take over for today. I

651
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:29.610
feel honored. Are we going
to test this out? All

652
00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.070
of this have an hour
and maybe it would just,

653
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.270
you know what, if you
don't want it, we'll stick

654
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.950
it in this developer's life.
I'll just take it with

655
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.250
me. Oh, that's great. So
you're saying, you're saying, you're

656
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.400
saying so kindly, Oh, if
you don't like this content,

657
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.780
I'll find another way to
release it. That's right. You

658
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.670
know? Thanks God. It was,
it was great talking to

659
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.440
you as always. Don't forget
the ending part of the

660
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.960
podcast. Oh, by the way,
say, this has been another

661
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.120
episode of Hansel minutes. We'll
see you again next week.

662
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.680
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes. Thanks for

663
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.260
listening. We'll see you again
next week with some more

664
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.720
content free content. So kind,
Hey, you know, that's me.

665
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.540
Bye. See you.
