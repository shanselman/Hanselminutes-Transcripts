9
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.890
build discussion with Richard Campbell. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

10
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.080
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. In fact, he does

11
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.930
an episode of Hansel minutia
with Richard Campbell. How are you?

12
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.600
I'm well, sir, how are
you? I am a, you

13
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.960
know, frankly, I'm pretty tired.
Yeah, well you got little

14
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.180
boys, man. It takes a
lot of energy. It does

15
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.740
take a lot of energy,
but also what takes a

16
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.260
lot of energy as little
boys plus a week at

17
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.710
build plus two conferences before
build. I basically spent the

18
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.680
last two weeks, not, not
on the road. Like some

19
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.450
people say they're on the
road for two weeks, but

20
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.730
I was basically like four
days in a day back

21
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.770
in two days in a
day back. And there was

22
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.680
one day where I got
one day I was sitting

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.230
at an after conference party
at midnight, feeling sad. And

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.950
I had a flight the
next day at 8:00 PM. And

25
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.100
so I had the entire
Sunday in New York to look

26
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.530
at and I was like,
well, you know, I could,

27
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.910
and this is the thing.
This is why I'm such

28
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.660
a mess. I could do
all these things in New York

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.700
and see all these people.
And I just, you know

30
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.580
what I did right there
as I'm sitting there, I

31
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.500
changed my flight to 4:00 AM
and went directly to the

32
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.930
hotel, got my bag, got
in a cab and went

33
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.350
to the airport, got the
4:00 AM flight and was home

34
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.320
for lunch. Yeah. Now you,
you made the right call.

35
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.930
My friend go home. And
I'm a big believer of

36
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.570
the 24 hour flip. It's
better than not going home.

37
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.570
You think so? Am I?
My kids found it vaguely

38
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.160
music. The only one who
was distressed by it really

39
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.190
was my dog is he
get very angry that I

40
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.980
would get home, unpack, do
laundry repack leave the next

41
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.140
day. But it was better
than not going home. Yeah.

42
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.120
I mean, I just like,
there's a bunch of people

43
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.440
that would have loved to
have seen in New York and

44
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.090
a bunch of stuff I
would like to, but I

45
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.420
don't live in New York and
me wandering around New York, thinking

46
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.060
about the New York that could
have been is not as

47
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.240
interesting as hanging out with
my kids. Yeah. Well, and

48
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.090
especially now they're just so
much fun. It's such a

49
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.180
ton of energy. Yeah. They
are totally in wacky Lego

50
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.640
mode right now. So that's
awesome. I want to explain

51
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.800
that as much as possible.
So now he loves it.

52
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.470
We, we bookended ourselves a
build. I saw you at

53
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.480
the airport on the way
in and on the way

54
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.680
out. Yeah. It was the
weirdest thing I, I checked

55
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.050
in on Foursquare on the
way into build in San

56
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.810
Francisco. And there you are.
And I'm like, Oh, let's

57
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.790
share a cab. And you're
like, Nope, I'm gone. I'm

58
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.130
on the train. Yeah. So
I go to the train

59
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.070
When you're on the train
and there you are on

60
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.050
the train. So we rode
the train together. We did

61
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.480
not hang out at all
for a week. Nope. Didn't

62
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.850
see. I think we saw
each other briefly once or

63
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.240
twice, but literally like in
passing, you had a mob

64
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.030
around you or I'm engaged
with someone, something like that.

65
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.190
And then we get to
the lounge at the end

66
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.010
of build flying home and
there you are in the

67
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.630
lounge. That's bizarre. Yeah. So
then we said we need

68
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.030
to do a show. Yeah.
Yeah. It's just so funny

69
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.310
how those things work out
and you know, the more,

70
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.170
more and more, I don't
know if it's the kids

71
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.630
as well, but I don't
do the whole go to

72
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.810
a conference and then hang
out as much anymore. I

73
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.210
want to pack it full
of stuff. So it's useful

74
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.880
to people. Yeah. Cause if
I go and do one

75
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.980
talk and then sit around
for four days, somehow that

76
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.490
just makes me uncomfortable. No,
you'll go home. And I

77
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.500
like working, if I'm at
an event I want to

78
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.780
work. But when we did
some great stuff, I was

79
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.810
on channel nine live. I
hosted like three or four

80
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.000
hours of live TV and
I did a talk and,

81
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.420
and I did the keynote
demo, which went pretty well.

82
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.560
And yeah, there wasn't a
lot of downtime. Nope. I

83
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.530
was doing nonstop interviews, talking
to the developers that were

84
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.830
attending bill, just finding out,
collecting their stories, what they

85
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.050
were interested in, so forth.
And one of the questions

86
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.330
I asked them fairly often
was who that bill would

87
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.340
you like to hang out
with? And your name came

88
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.130
up more often than not
yours. And Steve bombers were

89
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.860
the top names of the
list. Really? That means Palmer.

90
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.570
And I need to hang
out Italy. I've shaken his

91
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.510
hand twice. Yeah. That's that's
funny. Yeah. That's, it's, it's,

92
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.790
it's one of those things
I thought it was, you

93
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.960
know, a really good conference.
And I know that as

94
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.030
a Microsoft employee, I'm not
supposed to think that about

95
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.300
any conferences that are our
conferences. Like I'm only supposed

96
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.990
to compliment other conferences. Right.
But you know, just to

97
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.570
be really Frank, our conferences
have a tendency to be

98
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.210
a little bit bland and
by bland, I mean like

99
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.310
your tech EDS, and you're
kind of like your big

100
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.670
sprawling conferences, you know what
I mean? I've done a

101
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.970
million tickets and they're just
kind of like, you know,

102
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.270
Hey, we're a ticket, but
this one, I don't know

103
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.980
who I gotta call and
find out whoever was in

104
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.970
charge, but it was so
personal. Yeah. And I think

105
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.920
it was a little bit
smaller, you know, the biggest

106
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.230
problem I have a tech
ed is that 11,000, 12,000

107
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.920
people, it is just sprawling.
Yeah. And this was a

108
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.440
few thousand, it was enough
that there was a real

109
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.380
energy, but not so much
that you just couldn't even

110
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.870
find anybody. Right. You know,
with tech ed, you have

111
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.330
that sense of like, well,
this talk is in hall.

112
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.700
A and this other talk
is in halls. See a

113
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.690
short train ride away. Yes.
I'm changing time zones because

114
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.790
I want to go to
a different talk and with

115
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.610
build. Yeah. You know, you
kept seeing people over and

116
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.570
over again and they had
the big room and that

117
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.010
what was so great about
the big room and what

118
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.030
I just really can't get
over being so cool was

119
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.910
that, you know, Nokia, which
is huge company had a,

120
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.930
a plywood box that was
their booth. And they were

121
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.520
next to secret labs. The
agent watch smartwatch guy who

122
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.690
had a plywood box and
on the top of the

123
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.510
box, they had a big
giant piece of butcher paper

124
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.680
attached to a role. So
the person giving the demo

125
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.560
could scribble on the top
of the box and then

126
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.690
rip it off and then
clear their table. And it

127
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.830
was just, that's so cool.
It was just geeks and

128
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.700
pencils and gadgets and demos.
You know what I mean?

129
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.190
Like everyone had the same
booth and I just, yeah.

130
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.280
And that was over. I
was at the other end

131
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.330
of that. One of the
things I noticed with the

132
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.970
big hall, it was busy
all the time. And there

133
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.340
were lots of areas. You
know, the thing about bill

134
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.340
is that it was quite
focused on developers building apps.

135
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.980
And so a lot of
this where I was at

136
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.130
around the studio group and
the Azure group, they were

137
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.780
in conversations with developers all
day. Folks came there with

138
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.510
stuff they needed to figure
out and they got help.

139
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.190
Yeah. We went out of
our way to make sure

140
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.820
that everybody was, was at
the booth at some point

141
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.640
that all the speakers did
their booth time, which, you

142
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.190
know, sometimes you'll send the
speakers, we'll go and put,

143
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.250
then we'll have like someone
who's a non speaker go.

144
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.540
We try to mix it
up. We wanted to give

145
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.360
everyone a chance to work
the booth. And these boos

146
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.580
were great. Cause there was
no front like, you know

147
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.950
how a booth is usually
like a, you know, a

148
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.070
curtain and a bunch of
plastic piping. And then there's

149
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.280
some sad people who sit
at the booth and you

150
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.560
know, the only difference between
a successful booth and a

151
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.140
non-successful booth is whether or
not people show up. But

152
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.750
with here it was just
a box, you know, like

153
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.400
a table, like it was
almost like a work bench,

154
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.430
wasn't it? Yeah. Your dad
was work bench. Everybody had

155
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.460
seats or they all stood
and there was a sign.

156
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.250
This is what the topic
is here. Right. And sometimes

157
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.440
people modify their signs. Oh.
And we're also talking about

158
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.830
this, but Yeah. And then
people just hung out and

159
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.830
you couldn't even really tell
who was the, who was

160
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.590
the person who was in
charge there. I loved it.

161
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.160
I think that like, there's
some conferences like code mash,

162
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.340
you know, out there in
Ohio that have the hallway

163
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.530
track down solid. As we
sit at, we call it

164
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.830
the hallway track. They've got
fun games and they have

165
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.880
a keynote. And then there's
some conferences in Australia that

166
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.610
have a keynote that opens
the conference and then a

167
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.750
lock note that closes the
conference. Nice. I love that.

168
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.590
And then there's this, this
idea of these tables and

169
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.080
this kind of the great
equalizer, I think at the

170
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.620
next angle brackets conference, the
one that we're doing, me

171
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.490
and John Papa and you
and surely brothers and folks

172
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.010
that we did want a
course in, in March, we're

173
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.530
going to do another one
in October. I think we

174
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.500
gotta to talk about that
because it just changed the

175
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.200
feeling of the entire conference.
And I was so stoked

176
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.330
about it. And then the
open space as you come

177
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.830
down the stairs, it was
just all lounge chairs and

178
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.920
Oh, and the power adapters.
This was so great. You

179
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.440
know, how you're always hunting
for power to conference. They

180
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.080
had a, again, a piece
of plywood with a classy

181
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.740
sign and each piece of
plywood had four count them

182
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:14.580
four, six outlet, adapters. So
you had like 24 power

183
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.680
adapters just sitting in the
middle of nowhere. It was

184
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.210
fantastic. And, and, and every
time there was a cluster

185
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.370
of power, there was a
cluster of people around it

186
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.580
talking and they ended up
talking every time. That was

187
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.220
really, I mean, I was
really impressed because I have

188
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.070
a tendency to be a
little jaded with these, with

189
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.430
these big conferences and Into
a lot of shows and

190
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.130
do a lot, a lot.
I have, and I hate

191
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.650
to be jaded, but I
think people who listen can

192
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.690
understand that after a while
it gets a little tedious,

193
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.440
but this I was totally
geeked. And then, and then

194
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.640
Richard, the hotel that I
chose, you know, what was

195
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.980
next door to the hotel,
but Chipotle is the best

196
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.350
all you need. No, I'm
telling you the best part

197
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.440
about going to a conference
on a, on a work

198
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.450
expense account, chip portly, man,
morning, noon, and night. I

199
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.460
had my wife won't let
me go more than once

200
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.070
a week because she's like,
Oh, would you pull that

201
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.110
again? So maybe once a
week or once every two

202
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.870
weeks I had your Portland
at least twice a day

203
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.760
for an entire week. It
was so awesome. Oh, just

204
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.280
the burrito bowl. I presume
The guy who was coming

205
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.470
to this was actually, we
could, should keep rolling here

206
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.230
because the guy who mowing
my lawn is now here.

207
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.420
Okay. No, of course. So
I'm going to step over

208
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.940
to, and I'm going to
grab my portable vocal booth

209
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.070
and we'll see if we
notice a difference in the

210
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.140
quality. So yeah. Cause I
can hear, I can hear

211
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.090
the rumble from you talk
while I get the both.

212
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.400
All right. Well, I, my
whole experience working on the

213
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.310
build was collecting all these
interviews. And I did literally

214
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.810
hundreds of them talking to
regular developers about that kind

215
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.520
of software they were building
and the things they were

216
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.620
really interested in. It was
a lot of fun ton

217
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.960
of work for me. We
worked really hard, but I

218
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.000
can't tell you how many
conversations I had. It was

219
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.390
really staggering. All right. So
now got me all excited

220
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.790
about it. I'm glad now
I'm in the, I'm in

221
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.970
the portable vocal booth. This
is from real traps. We'll

222
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.740
see if it lays down
differently. Now I'm talking to

223
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.140
you on the phone. Yeah.
But of course I've got

224
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.750
the booth here in front
of me. So we'll see

225
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.260
if that covers the, The
lawnmower guy. See how that

226
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.390
works out. It's also funny
because I can't see the

227
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.470
screen anymore, which means I
have no notes. No, you'll

228
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.810
have to wing it from
here now. Yeah. I'm speaking

229
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.350
of notes, the little notebook,
a note taker deal. What

230
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.910
did they give us and
not give us, I didn't

231
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.430
get anything. They gave it
me. I didn't get anything.

232
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.560
We were both staff. Right.
Who went to build, got

233
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.610
a surface pro and they
got an eight inch Acer.

234
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.580
Was it? Yeah. Yeah. It
was a little Acer. And

235
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.480
I got to look at
one, you know, I'm always

236
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.260
worried about Acer tablets. I've
never been terribly impressed with

237
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.740
when I have one of
their w five tens, but

238
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.830
it just seems like it
was a little early and

239
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.270
they tend to be a
little plastic-y. Yeah. But were

240
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.280
they the one that they
gave out at bill was

241
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.770
the w three, which is
the eight inch screen that

242
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.920
comes with when eight. And
it's sort of in the

243
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.810
Kindle HD form factor style,
Eight inch. It's such a

244
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.970
tough thing. Like I went
and looked after, after I

245
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.980
saw the Acer I went
to at and T and

246
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.560
looked at the iPad mini
and I showed it to

247
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.800
my wife and I was
just thinking, this is perfect.

248
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.230
She'll love this. She'll love
a tiny little tablet. She's

249
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.360
like, no, she says the
screen's too small. And then

250
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.300
I said, well, what's the
problem? And she says, well,

251
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.180
there's less information. So then
I said, well, what do

252
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.880
you mean? I showed her
the inbox on a iPad

253
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.400
and an iPad mini. Right?
And I said, no, no,

254
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.140
it's the same number of
dots is, you know, it's

255
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.630
not really cause the iPads
retina, but the point is

256
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.170
that it is effectively the
same amount of information. The

257
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.090
same amount of information was
on the screen. She didn't

258
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.810
believe it. Doesn't be perceived
as different. Yep. She perceived

259
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.270
that. I won't be, Let's
see as much. So I

260
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.860
said, but it'll fit in
your purse. And she's like,

261
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.160
no, that's fine. So I
don't know who does it?

262
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.040
Who wants an eight inch
tablet people with John? John's

263
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.620
always said, don't make, we're
not going to make this.

264
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.320
But the mini is the
bestselling iPad. Now, you know,

265
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.570
for kids, it's really beautiful.
I mean, it's a great

266
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.020
size for sure. Children or
for someone who has a

267
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.770
purse or a giant inner
pocket, Right. For actual work

268
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.930
getting done. I don't know.
But my mom has a

269
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.900
Kindle fire and she is
obsessed with this thing. Like

270
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.360
for her an eight inch
tablet is the perfect size.

271
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.390
Yeah. I think that's part
of it. I do love

272
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.720
my Kindle and, and have
that's the one thing that

273
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.670
always goes with me, even
if I'm going to, I

274
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.340
will flex on whether I
going to a tablet or

275
00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.040
my ultra book, you know,
that'll change. But the is

276
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.740
always there always, always Kindle
HD or is it a

277
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.440
Kindle? Black and white. It's
a Paperwhite. Yeah. See, I've

278
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.550
got the Paperwhite touch with
the, with the cover. Yeah.

279
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.190
Cover makes all the difference.
Like I hated my Kendall.

280
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.340
I have that head, that
Kindle 3g, right? The last

281
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.620
one with the keyboard and
it was a great device.

282
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.410
It was almost perfect. Then
I got the Kindle Paperwhite.

283
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.460
Screen's great. But the, the
size of the bezel is

284
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.010
too small. Right. And there's
no one to put touching

285
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.170
it. There's nowhere to put
your thumb. Yeah. So I

286
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.500
wrote this scathing review on
my blog and then I

287
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.380
got the cover that snaps
around it and adds another

288
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.110
eighth of an inch around
the bezel. And it also

289
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.630
turns on and turns off
when you, when you close

290
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.900
it. Yeah. A little magnet.
It's a whole different device.

291
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.440
It's changed it. It's perfect.
It is a glorious, highly

292
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.080
recommended checkout. Go to my
blog and search for Kindle

293
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.860
Paperwhite. I've got an extensive
review as well as an

294
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.590
update where I do an
about face. And I say

295
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.540
it is a great device.
If you have the cover,

296
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.760
If you have the cover,
that's important. I take that

297
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.260
everywhere. I hate, I cannot
read A Kindle book on

298
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.840
an LCD screen. I just
can't do it. I've got

299
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.060
it on my, my windows
RT, but I don't even

300
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.820
bother. And once you've had
paper white, you're ruined. We

301
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.370
just know how pleasant digital
reading can be. Well, yeah.

302
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.330
And once you've had, like,
I could Maybe suffer through

303
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.150
it on retina, but this
is the thing. This is

304
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.220
like, this is the next
year or two as retina.

305
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.160
Cause you know, I like
my X one carbon touch

306
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.400
laptop, but I can see
the dots. It's so funny.

307
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.550
Retina turns you off of
like all other screens. Well,

308
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.350
and you should bring that
up because I'm currently shopping

309
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.800
for an ultra high resolution
monitor for at least one

310
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.040
of my machines. My secondary
workstation has one of the

311
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.480
original 24 inch, 1920 by
1200 screens. So it's, it's

312
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.180
gotta be eight years old.
Yeah. I've got a 30

313
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.420
inch monitor and I think
it's 96 DPI. Yeah. That's

314
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.540
a, the 25 60 by
1600 dual DVI type. Right,

315
00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.790
exactly. Right. And it's run
by a, I actually have

316
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:38.230
Three monitors and I've got
an Nvidia seven 40, I

317
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.780
think, GTX or something, you
know, it's a pretty expensive

318
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.570
Nvidia, at least it was
at the time. Yeah. But

319
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.940
it's pushing it. You know
what I mean? Yeah. And

320
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.580
I, I have a 25
60 by 1,630 inch on

321
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.460
my dev machine with 20
inch wings on it in

322
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.490
portrait mode so that you
get 49, 68, 1600. So

323
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.520
I think the 1600 high
is really important when you're

324
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.460
coding. It's it's those few
more lines of code that

325
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.980
help. Yeah. Yeah. So you're
saying that I will be

326
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.000
able to buy a 30
inch, 200 DPI water. Yeah.

327
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:13.360
So ASIS just announced their,
the PQ three, three 21

328
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.050
and that's a four K
UHD monitor. So that's 38,

329
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:21.160
40 by 2160 in a
30 inch display. So four

330
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.590
times the resolution of a
1920 by 10 80. So

331
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.680
then the question is, do
you simply scale it double

332
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.040
and then you get a
smooth display with the same

333
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.080
amount of general relative visual
space, or do you go

334
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.790
and do what people did
back in the day and

335
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.940
run thousand 24 and a
13 inch monitor, right. Just

336
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.370
because you want more dots.
Right. You know, do I

337
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.460
run it small fonts and
have like a non-visible start

338
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.120
menu? Well, and I saw
a guy on one of

339
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.240
the retina display, Mac pros,
running a native resolution with

340
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.550
studio and it turns out
none of your lines of

341
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.610
code are long enough anymore.
He could actually open up

342
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.340
three code windows side by
side and still see the

343
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.220
full length of any of
the lines of code. But

344
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.590
it is, you know, we're
all 40 ish now. I

345
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:10.600
couldn't see Like, yeah, It's
just too high Rez. I'm

346
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.820
sad about that. Cause I
used to love my 15

347
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.030
inch, 1920 by 1200 that
most people couldn't see. But

348
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.490
now even I'm like, Oh
man, that's tough to see,

349
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.550
You know, I, somebody was
showing me the surface pro,

350
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.120
which is what a 13
inch screen. Yup. And it's

351
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.780
10 80 P I'm like,
Holy crap. That's really small.

352
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.210
And like, Oh I love
my surface pro like, I

353
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.600
can't understand how you could
do any coding, like without

354
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.880
an external monitor and a
surface pro. And I don't

355
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.410
yet have old guy eyes.
Yeah, it's coming. Yeah. I

356
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.380
know it's coming. But I
just know that there's an

357
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.120
amount of mental effort that
is required to get engrossed

358
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.450
code. It is only 11
inches wide. And you know,

359
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.540
people who have MacBook air
is an 11 inch or

360
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.700
13 inch Mac who cares
are the same way. But

361
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.310
you know, if the thing
is, I was talking to

362
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.300
Pete Brown about this, we
love our Lenovo w five

363
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.800
twenties. Right. It is a
giant glorious rock, solid workstation

364
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.790
replacement tank machine. Oh, it's
a tank it's glorious. But

365
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.350
what I want is I
want it to fold up

366
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.500
into the size of an
X one carbon touch. Yes.

367
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.890
You know, every time I
use it, I'm like, Oh,

368
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.410
this is so nice and
so fast. And why do

369
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.030
I not use this again?
Oh, it's 10 pounds. Yeah.

370
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.590
So you put it in
your backpack and then you

371
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.780
look at the welts on
your shoulder afterwards. Yeah, Yeah.

372
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.570
Or, yeah, exactly. Or, yeah,
my, my bones are growing

373
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.810
the wrong way. Cause I've
been carrying this thing around.

374
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.100
Yeah. We call it Lenovo
shoulder. It's awful. Of course.

375
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.640
I fill up the Lenovo.
I fill up my bag

376
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.560
with other crap though. I
was joking about this, but

377
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.860
it's true. The Lenovo X
one carbon touches three pounds,

378
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.960
which is nice because it
frees you up for three

379
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.540
pounds worth of dongles that
you have to carry around

380
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.570
That you would need. Right.
Because you don't have every

381
00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.200
kind of plug like the
Lenova Saurus has where every

382
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.880
single plugin you want is
on the back of that.

383
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.640
And then you see people
carrying their three pound surface

384
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.680
and their three pounds and
their two pound iPad or

385
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.470
whatever, just because they can't
just, you know, no one

386
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.990
wants to go on a
trip and Oh, I don't

387
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.920
have my tablet. You know,
I dunno. Somehow Netflix is

388
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.650
less, is less compelling when
there's a keyboard between you

389
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.940
and the screen. Yeah. It's
interesting how that is. And

390
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.250
I'm looking, looking at upgrading
my ultra book and thinking

391
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.300
about looking at the new
ASIS transformer, which is that

392
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.630
same super slim aluminum chassis.
But the screen literally pulls

393
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.470
off the keyboard. Everything's in
the screen, Damien Edwards was

394
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:40.370
showing me the Cura book,
that Toshiba Cura book. And

395
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.070
we looked at that it
was on the floor at,

396
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.000
at bill. Then it's a
retina display ultra book, but

397
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.450
he said that a Samsung
act, I want to say

398
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.430
ACTV or something like that.
But I know that's Yeah,

399
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.020
it's a yogurt that now
they, the new one, the

400
00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.360
COVID Yeah, something like that.
I'm satisfied, but it's a

401
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:04.490
brand new Haswell processors, 12,
a two, 10, 12 hours

402
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:08.270
of battery life and a
retina display. That might be

403
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:12.230
what I need. And I
fear for arm in the

404
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.690
window stack. Well, yeah, it
does bring up the question

405
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:19.250
like was what is the
point of Two years ago?

406
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.500
I think it made a
lot of sense to sort

407
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.990
of make that shot at
Intel. We will go arm

408
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.720
if you don't get your
power consumption down And they

409
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.780
did, but you know, they've
done it. But the question

410
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.160
is then did does this
just lower arm pressure, like

411
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.250
this arm need to not
be in the market because

412
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.840
Haswell is going to be,
you know, that's pretty high

413
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.890
end, right. But maybe we're
talking about a hundred, $900

414
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.980
tablets. Right. And this is
the real question. You know,

415
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.730
everyone says Android the day,
but you know, if you

416
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.620
go to Fry's electronics or
any of these kinds of

417
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.780
mid-level discount, electronics type places,
these hundred $99 tablets, and

418
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.140
even in some cases, nine,
$9 tablets they're crap. I

419
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.000
mean, there is no way
to, there's no other way

420
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.730
to put it. The only
tablet that's any good for

421
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.390
199 bucks is the Kindle,
you know, and that's clearly

422
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:12.450
subsidized, But it's also a,
still a specific purpose machine.

423
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.730
You're not loading anything you
want on that machine. And

424
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.590
I think that's the biggest
thing. People break down, People

425
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.780
break their Kindles and there
are, it has, the Kindle

426
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.760
has a lovely app store.
So, you know, my mom's

427
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.820
got words with friends and
stuff. So maybe it's not

428
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.520
running word in Excel, but
it is a fully competent

429
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.410
machine. I would say the
Kindle HD, I just don't

430
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.480
see the programming suites for
it. Like they don't see

431
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.690
people writing as much software.
Well, but it's, it's Android

432
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.820
though. Right? Don't any Android
apps run on a Kindle

433
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.260
Theoretically, but actually no. Hmm.
Right. Because they branched away.

434
00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.990
Hmm. Well that's Android is
kind of fragmented, isn't it?

435
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.810
Yeah. Well, not only that,
but I mean, that's the

436
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.920
ultimate fragmentation. They they've left.
They're not coming back. They're

437
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.250
doing their own thing. Well,
speaking of fragmentation, it seems

438
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:06.450
like we can finally see
the opposite of that fragmentation

439
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.210
coming, which is, and this
is just speculation, but it

440
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.910
looks to me like it
may be a year from

441
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:16.260
now. I could have a
tablet, a desktop, a laptop,

442
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.160
a phone, and an Xbox
all with this live tile

443
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.800
kind of windows 8.1 vibe,
theoretically sinking all my apps

444
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.150
between machines. Right? Yep. And
you know, all my files

445
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.480
are everywhere. You know, it's,
it's a kind of the,

446
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.070
of course of the marketing
guys will paint it as

447
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.130
a utopian future, but it
certainly they've, they've tied everything

448
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.990
up. I mean, windows phone
eight is the windows eight

449
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:44.460
Colonel right. There's speculation about
Xbox being windows eight, somewhere

450
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.620
in there as well. That
team, I would think that

451
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.320
would make things simpler for
them. And presumably that means

452
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.860
I can develop on even
more devices with the languages.

453
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.590
I know how to do.
Yeah. And, and with a

454
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.290
UI paradigm, you understand, you
know, we get back to

455
00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.030
this whole idea of back
in the old days when

456
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:04.080
Microsoft came up with those
distinctive UI guidelines for file

457
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.990
and help and so forth,
the MDI interface, it was

458
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.860
so that anybody using a
desktop knew where to find

459
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.350
stuff on any app. Right.
Right. And now you're seeing

460
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.230
that same sort of rule
set coming by creating this

461
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.960
fluid metaphor that comes everywhere.
So the question is then

462
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.300
is it, is this a
good idea, right? Is this

463
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.270
UI good enough where we're
just going through growing pains

464
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.020
and mom and dad and
my kids and everybody will

465
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.480
be able to go, Oh
yeah. You know, tiles and

466
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.360
small tiles, big tiles lifetime,
or are they going to

467
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.170
reject it? You know, fully
Well. Yeah. And then I

468
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.370
don't know the answer to
that, but if it was,

469
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.230
if it was so obvious
one way or the other,

470
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.210
then we'd already be doing
it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you

471
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.070
know, I'll tell you, I
put iOS seven on my

472
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.240
iPhone and I I've had
a lot of people hollering

473
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.830
at me over the years.
Cause you know, I came

474
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.600
to Microsoft five ish years
ago with an iPhone, you

475
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.160
know, I never was like,
why didn't you switch? I

476
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.130
was like, well, I'm like
my iPhone, it's perfectly fine.

477
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.170
Competent phone. I don't need
a new phone every 20

478
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.530
minutes. And it works fine.
You know, I've invested in

479
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.080
the ecosystem and they want
to know why I don't

480
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.930
switch over. Well, I put
iOS seven on my iPhone

481
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.840
and it started heating up
cause it's a beta. Right.

482
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.560
And apparently they're going to
scale it up and down.

483
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.230
So I have a four
S which is the, I

484
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.990
think the I four processor,
it's not the fancy new

485
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.600
<inaudible> for him. And so
all the three D and

486
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.060
the translucency is apparently working.
It's so hard that it

487
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.060
is getting hot and it
kept rebooting. It would even

488
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.920
reboot and say, I'm too
hot. I need to cool

489
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.470
down. And I was going
to New York, I needed a

490
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.380
break. I needed a phone
that would work. So I

491
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.860
threw the SIM card into
the Lumia. I've got an

492
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.210
Lumia nine 20 that I
use for development, you know,

493
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.890
and I'm not a windows
phone guy, but I tried

494
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.960
it out. So I basically
spent a weekend in New York

495
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.840
with a Lumia. And when
I switched back to my

496
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.850
iPhone, the thing that bugged
me the most was that

497
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.940
the tiles on the iPhone
don't update like other than

498
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.910
calendar and clock, everything else
is just so kind of

499
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.640
just going to sit in
there. Like the weather is

500
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.800
always in 72 and sunny,
you know, But the question

501
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.470
is why don't the tiles
update? Why didn't Apple do

502
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.390
that when they redid this
UI? Well, I mean, I

503
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.050
assume it's either a legal
reason or they would get

504
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.900
yelled at for looking like
us. But I would like

505
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.950
my iPhone where I could
make the icons different sizes.

506
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.110
You know what I mean?
So like say what you

507
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.920
will for the windows ecosystem.
But man, I, I pinned

508
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:34.840
my hotel. I pinned subway
instructions. I pinned restaurants. I

509
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.220
penned my boarding pass. You
know, I pinned deep links

510
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.560
to information in a natural
way. And then when I

511
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.830
left New York, I just deleted
all those pins. Right. I

512
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.260
wonder if people even know
how to do that. Like

513
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.990
my wife, Well, people are
starting to think like, like

514
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.680
the way you're thinking is
really interesting. It's the configuration

515
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.560
for this trip is the
stuff, You know, these things

516
00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.250
I'm going to need. Yeah.
Right. Exactly. I, I changed

517
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.130
the configuration, not based on
aesthetic or my sense of,

518
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.640
I wanted to look pretty
today, but I filled up

519
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.410
a whole section of it
with all the stuff that

520
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.990
I needed to move my
way around the city. Yeah.

521
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.680
And I use this transit
application called here transit. It

522
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.660
comes with no, Oh my
goodness. You turned me on

523
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.010
to that. And I loved
it. It's so good. It's

524
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.800
so, And it's just got
such a brilliant user interface

525
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.890
paradigm that I was moving
her. I swear. And I

526
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.960
know I'm to sound like
a fanboy. I'm more of

527
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.120
a fan of this one
app. So to be clear

528
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.690
for the listeners, but here
transit is so good. I

529
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.780
was moving around New York, like
a, like a native. Yep.

530
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.180
No, I've been in New York,
you know, a dozen times.

531
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.560
And I know my way
around subway system for the

532
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.370
most part, but it was
giving me alternatives. I hadn't

533
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.420
even thought about. Yeah. And
it, and it actually checks

534
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.910
the data. So we had
an a, I was using

535
00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.180
it in San Francisco during
bark on the Bart and

536
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.150
Bart had a station breakdown
and it was on here

537
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.190
transit and said, yeah, don't
go to that station, go

538
00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.230
to the station. So I
showed it to you As

539
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.760
we met up on the
train. So you used it

540
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.800
over, I use it for
the rest of the, you

541
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.960
showed it to me on
the train, going to the

542
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.760
show. The rest of the
week is I was staying

543
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.280
in Berkeley. So I took
the train every day in,

544
00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.040
I would fire it up,
even though I knew where

545
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.260
I was going and it
would, and it would one

546
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.030
day it came up and
said that there was a

547
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.580
red bar, the way this
thing presents itself. As soon

548
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.660
as you start, it says,
if you want to leave

549
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.250
right now, and then it
sort of steps down rather

550
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.540
than ask you, when do
you want to leave it?

551
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.730
That it does the right
thing. Just here's your data

552
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.410
now, when do you, you
know, now you can figure

553
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.970
out when, Oh, and on
the one that was right

554
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.500
now, there was a red
bar in it. And when

555
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.390
I clicked on the red
bar, it showed the station

556
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.290
shut down because of a
police incident, 50 minute delay.

557
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.040
And then I, I, and
then if you want alternate

558
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.840
shell Dalton, it's get off
of this station, take this

559
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.020
other train. You'll avoid it.
That's fantastic. It was brilliant.

560
00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.180
Yeah. It's ridiculous. It's a,
it's a crime that it's

561
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.580
not an every man. I
see why Nokia did it,

562
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.010
but it's a crime of,
and every phone it's, it's

563
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.960
that good of an app.
If I lived in New York,

564
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.480
that might be enough reason
for me to switch because

565
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.780
I download all the time.
I downloaded three different MTA,

566
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.770
you know, New York style, subway
apps, and they were garbage

567
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.010
on the iPhone. I just
could not find a decent

568
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.600
app. I mean, I know
that there are apps, but

569
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.550
you know, and I realize
that after, after a while,

570
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.370
you just figure out which
trains go uptown and et

571
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.040
cetera. But yeah, man, this
was great. And did you

572
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.320
do the pinning? Did you
pin different locations and then

573
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.110
it will tell you how
to get there? Yes. Fantastic.

574
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.570
Even the walking directions. So
once, you know, as I

575
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.400
come out of that station,
take this exit on the

576
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.710
station, then walk down, you
know, then go this way

577
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.500
to get to, to a
stop you want to get

578
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.000
to. But you know, you're
hitting on a really, I

579
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.400
think key point and it
relates to the live tiles

580
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.280
too, which is I get
that these companies are competing

581
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.260
and they want our business
did that, that didn't. So

582
00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.900
they're denying others, their features.
But at some point you

583
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.450
got to look at like,
the live tile is just

584
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.810
a good idea, right? Why
wouldn't everybody do that? It's

585
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.660
just a good idea, right?
Like, Yeah, like right now,

586
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.900
if I want to look
at what my next appointment

587
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.020
is in my iPhone, I
either launch my calendar app

588
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.800
and go to today and
scroll around or I have

589
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.070
to lock the phone and
then look at the lock

590
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.790
screen or I pull down
the notification thing. But the

591
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.280
notification center only shows like
the next six hours of

592
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.130
appointments. So, you know, there's
all these limitations and all

593
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:16.430
of these problems would be
solved by just putting my

594
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:20.060
next appointment right there. Right.
Yeah. Where it's supposed to

595
00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.980
be when I feel the
same way about this here

596
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.050
transit app, it's like, I
would pay for this app.

597
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.320
This app is astonishing. So
sell to me on everything.

598
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.020
Why wouldn't you, They want
you to buy Nokia phones.

599
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.480
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know
the, the, the fragmentation of

600
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.660
like all the, all the
phones look the same. Right.

601
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.710
I mean, I saw a
bright blue windows phone and

602
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.690
I said, Oh, what's that?
And it was an HTC.

603
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.020
I just assumed it was
a Nokia. Right. Right. And

604
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.200
then I saw a, kind
of a bright, a bright

605
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.360
white phone. And it was
like a, what was it?

606
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.390
It was a Samsung galaxy
note. You know? I mean,

607
00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.220
they're just slabs there's labs
with screens. Yep. So, I

608
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.270
mean, I think, I think
we're moving towards a, some

609
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.090
kind of a, of a
convergence, right? With Google things

610
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.760
like Google now, trying to
give you that idea of,

611
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.710
we know where you are.
We know where you're headed.

612
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.540
Here's kind of the information
you need right now in

613
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.050
your life. Everybody's trying to
do that. You know, lifestyles

614
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:18.370
are kind of random. They
sit there and they kind

615
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.770
of spin a little bit,
tell you your next appointment.

616
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.540
The iOS notification center kind
of, kind of works. Google

617
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.780
now is extremely location and
time focused, but they're all

618
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.270
trying to give us the
same idea, which is why

619
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.490
did I pull my phone
out of my pocket just

620
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:38.200
now? And that's I think
the next great user interface

621
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.870
problem to solve. He, you
know, Scott, Scott is in,

622
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:46.210
in, in San Francisco on
the street. He doesn't live

623
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.090
in San Francisco. It's nine
in the morning. We know

624
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.520
he had a flight, he's
picked his phone up. He

625
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.540
is either looking for food
or a taxi. You know

626
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.020
what I mean? Like that,
yeah. That kind of anticipation.

627
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.160
I also think that an
agent model could easily, as

628
00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.190
you're getting ready for a
trip know, Hey, he likes

629
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:09.960
to have his, his boarding
pass, pinned his subway directions

630
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.110
pinned his hotel information pinch.
So let's just generate those

631
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.960
blah, blah, blah, blah. We're
getting there. We're getting there.

632
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.540
The beginnings are happening via
the iPhone. Has the, you

633
00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.450
know, rarely used passbook feature,
which is where you add

634
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:25.620
your boarding passes and your
coupons and stuff. Yeah. The,

635
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.560
the, if I understand correctly,
I may get these reversed,

636
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.070
but when you pin your
United boarding pass for the

637
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.730
airline, it will pop up
on your lock screen and

638
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.960
allow you to see your
boarding pass even without locking,

639
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.570
unlocking your phone based on
time. Well, you're the Alaska

640
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:45.660
air boarding pass will do
geo fencing. So it notices

641
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.270
that you're near the airport
and then we'll pop itself

642
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:52.290
up. That's the beginning of
an agent style. And really

643
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:55.760
agents actually assisting you all
the time. Yeah. And, and,

644
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.190
and it has time to
think, to actually anticipate all

645
00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.610
that. Yeah. Nope. I think,
I mean, I think you've

646
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.050
given me a blog post
here. I'm going to go,

647
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.390
right. We are definitely, you
know, the balancing act here,

648
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.860
there was an app that
came out briefly for the

649
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.650
iPhone. That was it. It
started out just trying to

650
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.540
figure out where to get
you the best price for

651
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.910
gas. So you'd turn it
on. It would monitor your

652
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.820
GPS data and fairly quickly
figured out where you lived,

653
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.880
where you worked and what
gas stations you normally went

654
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.920
to, and then started making
recommendations as you should be

655
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.920
about out of gas. Now
the gas station over here

656
00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.380
has the best price and
it fell into that uncanny

657
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.340
Valley. Yep. It's awesome. Cast,
buddy. I love that. But

658
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.430
you also, you're heading towards
this sort of creepiness factor

659
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.580
that once your machine starts
anticipating more about you than

660
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.650
you realize exactly right. That
because it, where you are

661
00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.180
and it figures Out all
these things about you, then

662
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.890
it starts making suggestions where
you get this sort of

663
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:45.740
chill of my phone knows
too much about me. Well,

664
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.800
and then that's where things
like Google now blur that

665
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.570
line. And it's like, well,
does my phone know a

666
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.910
lot about me? Or does
Google know a lot about

667
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.480
me? I don't trust Google
or Siri, like, wow, Siri,

668
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.900
that was effectively creepy. You
know? Like, it's like, it's

669
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.340
like when you meet this
friend and they're like, they

670
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.140
ask you how your kids
are by name and they're

671
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.570
not really your friend. It's
like, Whoa. You know, I

672
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.870
don't know you like that,
Siri. Yeah. We don't have

673
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.960
that relationship. Yes, exactly. We're
still working there. I think

674
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.850
it's important for UX designers
to think about those kinds

675
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.820
of things. Ah, yeah. The,
that agent design has to

676
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.660
learn slowly. Yeah. And maybe
even may even communicate, even

677
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.980
though I already know the
answer to this, I'm going

678
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.670
to communicate you this question
so that you feel like

679
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.910
you gave me permission to
know something. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

680
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.760
Actually, there's an interesting feature.
I just got called out

681
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.600
in iOS seven Siri. Now,
if it thinks it's pronouncing

682
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.780
something wrong, we'll ask you
how to pronounce it and

683
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.900
kind of give you, give
you that idea of, you

684
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.550
know, there's some information I
don't really have, but I

685
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.680
want to make your experience
better. So, you know, I

686
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.560
pronounced this and you can
actually say to Siri, no,

687
00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.290
that's not how you pronounce
this and she'll apologize. And

688
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.870
then remember how to do
it next. I think that

689
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.360
they could, you know, that's
no different than we, you

690
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.120
know, if somebody told me
something about you that was

691
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.360
relatively pride, I would never
come at you and say,

692
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.340
Hey, I know about this.
I would rather ask you.

693
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.110
And if you chose to
tell me now it's out

694
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.300
in the open, it's fine.
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You know,

695
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.630
maintain people's privacy. I think
agents maintaining a sense of

696
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.240
privacy is important. You know,
that's a great point. Google

697
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.330
now has decided that the
bagel shop that I eat

698
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:23.150
at is work. Okay. This
is true. So I go

699
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.490
to Google now and it's
like 20 minutes to work

700
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.120
and I'm like work. Oh,
we're really wow. Okay. And

701
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.040
of course that didn't make
me feel good. Cause it's

702
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.570
like, well, right, because the
alternative was up at the

703
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.640
airport. It's either. Yeah. It's
like when I eat at

704
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.460
the bagel shop way too
much of Google now. So

705
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.770
it just kinda changed my
relationship with Google. Now. I

706
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.320
think I would have preferred
that they ask, Hey, you

707
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.120
know, you're going by here
a lot. What if some

708
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.690
poor schmuck, his mistress's house
is like Google now is

709
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:50.660
size of word. It's work.
You know, that's not the

710
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.510
correct question here. Hey, this
location seems important to you.

711
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.190
How would you categorize it?
You can give you a

712
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.370
list. Right? Maybe sort the
list of the first three

713
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.020
things of the things you
think is most likely to

714
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.160
be. Right? Yeah. Cool. It
was always so fun to

715
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.650
talk to you, Richard, we're
onto something here, man. I'm

716
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:08.810
excited about this. We can
make agents, right? Let's do

717
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:13.040
it. Let's let's quit our
jobs right now. Think about

718
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:17.090
this. Make a project out
of it. Very cool. Well,

719
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:20.690
this has been another episode
of Hansel minutia with Scott

720
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.850
and Richard. I won't see
you again next week. Bye

721
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:23.030
bye.
