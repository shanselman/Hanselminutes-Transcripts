From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
our weekly discussion with web

9
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.200
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.580
number 505. In this episode,
Scott talks with I fix

it CEO and co founder.
Kyle Weems about the importance

12
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.500
of fixing your own consumer
electronics. This is Scott Hanselman.

13
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.290
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. We're talking

14
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.420
with Kyle Wiens, he's the
co founder and CEO of

15
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.810
I fix it.com and a
big fan of not wasting

16
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.310
technology, fixing it being empowered.
Aren't you? Absolutely. I, our

17
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.290
goal in life is to
make everything that you've got

18
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.140
last as long as possible.
Yeah, so I fix it

19
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.350
is it's a, it's a
free repair guide. It's a,

20
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.680
it's not quite the Wikipedia
of repair, but it is

21
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.020
the place that I go
when I have a device

22
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.610
that it needs to be
fixed. I've gone there to

23
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.970
find, you know, which capacitor
burned out in my Nintendo

24
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.300
three DS I've replaced screens
on Android phones. How did

25
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.240
this start? And we're getting
pretty close to being the

26
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.300
Wikipedia. We are working our
way incrementally. We're adding, I

27
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.630
mean, thousands of new, new
things every year. So we

28
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.510
got started when I was
trying to repair my book.

29
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.030
I dropped it on the
power plug and I had,

30
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.160
I knew I just had
a cracked solder joint. If

31
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.540
I kind of held the
power plug just right. I

32
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.730
could get in and fix
it. And so I started

33
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.920
trying to take it apart
and I realized very quickly

34
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.070
that the process of pulling
the thing apart was much

35
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.960
more challenging than I was
expecting. There were lots of

36
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.930
little plastic tabs and latches
and just the process of

37
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.810
taking this thing apart was
complicated. And so I did

38
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.270
with anybody would do I
Googled it and I couldn't

39
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.660
find a repair manual or
repair information for available anywhere.

40
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.270
And I thought this was
crazy. And so I went

41
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.220
ahead and I kinda muddled
my way through the repair.

42
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.660
And then I said, there's
gotta be a better way.

43
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.270
There's gotta be, you know,
somebody has to do something

44
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.460
and I realize nobody was
going to do anything about

45
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.770
it. So I took it
apart again. I took pictures

46
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.920
and we posted them online
and that was the beginning.

47
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.480
And then I did a
little bit more research and

48
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.050
I learned that Apple has
proactively been sending cease and

49
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.830
desist letters to anybody that
shares their repair manuals. So

50
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.260
once we realized that it
kind of turned into a

51
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.350
bit of a religious crusade
where we said going to

52
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.670
make sure that there's repair
information online for everything Wow,

53
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.310
does has apples and you
nasty grams asking you to

54
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.120
stop. We're very good at
copyright law. And so we

55
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.940
haven't really pushed the envelope
with them on that. We

56
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.160
make sure that everything that
we do, we own the

57
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.550
copyright to our community owns
the copyright. And so there's

58
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.470
nothing they can do. It's
just like, you know, lifting

59
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.650
the hood on your car,
Taking pictures. And that's an

60
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.290
interesting analogy, like lifting hood
and lifting the hood of

61
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.990
your car and taking pictures
that that is our right.

62
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.140
Like, it should be our
right as consumers to open

63
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.270
a device up and mess
with it. Should it not?

64
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.020
I absolutely think so. And
there's something about society moving

65
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.410
away from an engineering culture
where we, we shifted from

66
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.800
being a culture Makers to
where we're just consumers. And

67
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.530
so, you know, they hand
us a shiny iPod or

68
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.660
a new galaxy and they
say, this is it. It's

69
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.600
pristine. It's going to work
until it stops. And then

70
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.860
you'll come to us and
we'll give you a new

71
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.350
one or we'll sell you
a new one. And I

72
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.770
don't think that that teaches
the right kind of societal

73
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.550
structure that we want. I
think that if we understand

74
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.040
how to get inside thinker
with things, we're going to

75
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.010
be better people we're going
to be better consumers. You

76
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.860
know, some people have taken
me to task and said

77
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.950
that it's not necessarily in
the personalities of everyone to,

78
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.300
to know that one additional
layer of abstraction, right? Like

79
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.390
I always talk about like
driving an automatic versus driving

80
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.300
a stick shift, you know,
of course the U S

81
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.120
this is speaking kind of
ethnocentric leave the U S

82
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.540
is becoming a, a country
of people who drive automatics,

83
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.840
right? There's still everyone else
on the planet drives manual

84
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.870
shift. But when I got
a car, you know, in

85
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.590
the, in the eighties and
early nineties, it was part

86
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.870
of the requirement that I
also know how to change

87
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.790
the oil. Like that was
how I was taught. My

88
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.310
mom and dad said, you
won't drive a car until

89
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.160
you can successfully, you know,
change the oil. And, and

90
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.330
just literally just today, my
wife had a flashing light

91
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.990
on her car, had a
low tire, you know, and

92
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.300
I fixed it and I,
and she didn't understand how

93
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.100
to do it. And I
realized that it wasn't in

94
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.650
the culture that she grew
up in to, to know

95
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.650
that, right. How far, how
far down should people go?

96
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.270
Like, I mean, I don't
think everyone should necessarily know

97
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.130
how to solder, but they
should be able to pop

98
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.770
something open. There's a spectrum.
We find once you get

99
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.510
inside and you do a
repair, it, you kind of

100
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.910
get hooked and you start
to understand things. I mean,

101
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.130
you imagine being stuck on
the side of the road,

102
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.470
the road, it's amazing how
many people can't change a

103
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.000
tire if they're stuck on
the side of a road.

104
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.860
And so you see somebody
stuck and you pull over

105
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.330
and you're like, Hey, can
I change your tire for

106
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.980
you? And they're like, Oh,
that'd be amazing. I don't

107
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.770
have any idea how to
do this. Well, you've put

108
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.870
yourself in the position where
you're helpless. And I think

109
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.060
as consumers, we get in
a situation where we don't

110
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.160
know how to say, change
the battery on the phone,

111
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.540
and we're allowing the manufacturers
to make us helpless. It

112
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.060
seems like They're not just
trying to make us helpless,

113
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.970
but they are going out
of their way to like,

114
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.240
are there engineering reasons for
them to make these things

115
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.530
so hard to open? There
are always designed constraints when

116
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.860
you get, get into these
things. So if you're a

117
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.910
product designer, industrial designer, just
like in software, we start

118
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.680
out with our requirements. And
then we set out to

119
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.620
build the best product that
meets the requirements. Product designers

120
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.100
are given business requirements. They
say, this is approximately the

121
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.050
battery life that we're going
for. This is the thickness

122
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.270
that we're going for. This
is whether we care or

123
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.960
not about repairability at Dell.
Their designers are given the

124
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.480
clear mandate that the products
must be designed to be

125
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.080
easy, to disassemble, easy to
repair, easy to recycle. And

126
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.100
that's part of the design
process. You know, that's interesting

127
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.530
that you call out Dell
because at least 15 years

128
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.660
ago, when every machine that
I had was a Dell

129
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.880
desktop, you know, they were
always known for being easy

130
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.630
to open. They had the
easy finger, nuts and bolts.

131
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.550
You know, you didn't even
need a screwdriver to open

132
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.590
up a Dell and write
and do stuff with it.

133
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.670
Right? Well, and Dell has
serviceability engineers who have veto

134
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.090
power over product designs. So
they'll get a design from

135
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.220
the industrial design team and
they take a look at

136
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.370
it. And if, if things
are too challenging to open,

137
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.740
they get, they get the
pushback and say, no, you

138
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.680
need to try again. And
on the other side, Dell

139
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.980
actually takes their designers, their
industrial design team to recycling

140
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.410
facilities. And they pull apart
their products. At least once

141
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.000
a year, they get a
feel for what the end

142
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.980
of life of these people.
It looks like she, that

143
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.080
seems like a really good
thing and really responsible thing,

144
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.320
but not to get too
political, but one could argue,

145
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.220
Dell is not winning, right.
Certainly on the tablet front,

146
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.400
they're not winning. And I'm
not sure that it's the,

147
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.320
that it's the products that
are the challenge for them,

148
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.250
or, or if it's a
marketing thing. Yeah. I recently

149
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.770
went and bought some stuff
from, I fix it. And

150
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.620
I went to the repair
guide and I replaced the

151
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.360
screen on an Android S3.
I realized that that this

152
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.860
is probably pretty simple. You
know, this is maybe in

153
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:44.560
the lower to middle difficulty
thing, but it did involve

154
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.650
a heat gun, which I
must admit. And I apologize

155
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.600
for admitting this publicly. I
did not know that that

156
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.690
was a thing until I
did this, you know, like

157
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.440
there's a thing And it
sets your hair on fire

158
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.360
Sets your hair on fire,
but it was so harrowing.

159
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.550
It was so scary to
take the screen off of

160
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.530
this thing, because the, I
didn't realize, but there's an

161
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.010
optically bonded glue behind the
screen. And I had to

162
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.110
pull the thing off with
a, with a wire. I

163
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.300
felt like I was like
a, like an assassin. I'm

164
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.230
trying to Garrett someone, but
it was so powerful. I

165
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.310
actually replaced it. And it
looks really good, right? This

166
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.900
is something, you know, w
we come out with our

167
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.420
repairability scores when the product
comes out. And sometimes people

168
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.910
give us a hard time.
And specifically the display and

169
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.660
optical and a digitizer being
bonded together was something where

170
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.730
people said, Oh, well, you
know, you didn't get the

171
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.250
whole point for that issue.
And we say, well, you

172
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.100
know, we just spent six
hours taking the cell phone

173
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.650
apart. And we have the
like cuts and bruises to

174
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.110
show for it. Like if
it got a low score,

175
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.380
we worked very, very hard
in the process of figuring

176
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.750
out how to pull apart.
Honestly, the lower the repair

177
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.990
score, the harder the tear
down is Yeah. I ended

178
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.780
up spending probably two on
that. You gave the S3

179
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.670
a repairability of eight out
of 10, because for the

180
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.830
most part, the back pops
off and it's pretty easy

181
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.690
to get. Right. But when
you get into the front

182
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.920
glass, you know, it says
difficulty difficult. Yeah. When, and

183
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.370
the repair score was assuming
that Maybe replacing the entire

184
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.880
display assembly, which is a
much more expensive to repair

185
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.820
than what you did, where
you just replaced. Yeah. Valid

186
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.340
point for me, the phone
was only, it was like

187
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.630
I said, it was an
S three. So it was

188
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.940
worth about a hundred dollars.
And the screen was going

189
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.140
to cost me about a
hundred dollars. So I put

190
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.920
15 bucks into it, right.
Not counting the, the repair

191
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.020
stuff that I got from
you guys, which I use

192
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.480
now all the time, every
day. Right. And this is

193
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.610
the case across most funds.
You have that you have

194
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.530
the digitizer, which is the
touch screen that you, you

195
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.140
touch. And then you have
the LCD and they are

196
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.590
bonded together. Sometimes they're not
at all at just set

197
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.120
on top of the other.
And there's a, there's an

198
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.550
air gap. And then on,
on a lot of the

199
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.390
newer devices, they're extremely tightly
fuse together. And you can't

200
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.730
even do it with, with,
I mean, what, what you

201
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.640
did with the galaxy S
three, with just a small

202
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.160
wire, with the newer devices,
you have to have an

203
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.980
even finer molybdenum wire to
be able to get it

204
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.210
apart. Why are we moving
in this direction of things

205
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.780
being not fixable? Is it,
is it laziness? I mean,

206
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.060
like, if you look at
like the surface book or

207
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.860
the surface pro, they really
just, aren't easy to fix,

208
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.510
are they when you tear
them down and they're not

209
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.750
going back together? Yeah. Microsoft's
design team has really decided

210
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.910
that it's not a priority
for them, which I think

211
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.180
is fascinating because the Xbox
team has really decided that

212
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.700
repairability is something that matters
to them. And both the,

213
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.950
both the new Xbox one
and the, the Sony PlayStation

214
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.830
are, are pretty easy and
straight away Repair the controllers

215
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.530
are straightforward and easy to
repair. The surface team is

216
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.160
kind of off doing their
own thing. Yeah. I think

217
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.590
an interesting case study right
now are the two new

218
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.890
nexus phones. You've got the
five X that's made by

219
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.810
LG, and then you have
the six P that's made

220
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.630
by Walway and they're, you
know, two nexus phones or

221
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.360
the two flagship phones right
now from Google side. And

222
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.400
they both came out at
the same time. One is

223
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.550
very, very easy to repair
the LG phone. That's very

224
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.250
straight, got the great repairability
score and the Walway is

225
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.640
terrible. So what's, what's the
deal. How do we have,

226
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.070
I mean, this is a
tale of two phones. I

227
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.830
think, I think that there,
it just comes down to

228
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.590
the design philosophy of, of
the team and whether the

229
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.380
constraints that you have going
into it. LG has won

230
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.530
some awards recently for how
easy to disassemble their devices

231
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.510
are. And their design team
has made it a priority.

232
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.140
It's always easier to glue
things together. It's cheaper to

233
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.370
manufacture them. It's easier to
get, get durability, but I

234
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.620
think it's almost the lazy
way out. I don't think

235
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.840
if you're looking at the
quality of the five X

236
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.450
and say, Oh, it's, it's
a lower quality phone, or

237
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.300
it's thicker than the six
P it's just the design

238
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.480
team. I think tried harder
on the five pack. I've

239
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.790
heard that some of these
phones, when you open them

240
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.660
up, they are literally just
swimming in glue. Like they

241
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.460
are, they're filled with glue
almost like it's an, a

242
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.540
kind of, well, And that's
an easy way to put

243
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.150
things together. If you think
about, you know, you have

244
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.250
a case, you can, you
can have a robot squirt

245
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.920
glue and you can slap
the battery in it's. It's

246
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.090
very straightforward to accomplish a
lot of things. It improves

247
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.890
Thermal stability and clear clearers
torsional rigidity. It makes the

248
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.170
device hold together better. If
you drop it, it's easier

249
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.260
to pass some of the
drop tests. So glue absolutely

250
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.740
is, is an easy way
out. It's just, I think

251
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.490
it's, it's a little bit
design laziness. It's a, it's

252
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.810
kind of like having a
function. That's a thousand lines

253
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.970
long. Like you can do
it, but it's not necessarily

254
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.660
a great idea. Is it
easy for them? Like I

255
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.320
know when I go take
my iPhone in to the

256
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.500
Apple store and a genius
looks at it, they disappear,

257
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.170
you know, into the back
somewhere and they do something

258
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.630
and they always come back
faster than I know I

259
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.970
could. Do they have some
special suction cups or something

260
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.070
back there? Or are they
like, yeah. Yeah. So the

261
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.350
iPhone is an interesting case
where the iPhone scores really

262
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.810
highly in our, in our
scores. And you'll note, they're

263
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.120
not going to take a
iPad with a cracked screen

264
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.580
back and show a backup
very quickly. So they don't

265
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.060
have any fancy fast way
to repair iPads. So Apple's

266
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.010
kind of the same thing.
The iPad design team has

267
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.320
decided to make a product
that is very challenging to

268
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.510
repair the iPhone design team
has decided to make something

269
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.090
that's very easy to repair.
So in the case of

270
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.860
the iPhone is it's two
screws on the bottom. They

271
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.020
do have a fancy suction
cup thing, but we sell

272
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.900
something that's pretty similar. And
you suction cup. The thing

273
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.230
open, you can swap the
screen, crack screen, replaced the

274
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.780
display assembly in life on
six or six S in

275
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:27.840
five minutes, easy Was the,
the six a departure. Like

276
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.820
I seem to remember iPhones
in the four and five

277
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.400
range being hard to open.
Yes. So they went through

278
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.590
some kind of transitions where
the question is, is it

279
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.660
more important to be able
to swap the battery or

280
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.800
the screen on the device?
So on the four you

281
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.540
pop the back off and
it was very straight forward

282
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.400
to get the battery. But
then the screen Mine was

283
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.100
really, really hard to get
to. Okay. And then on

284
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.420
the iPhone five, they, they
flipped it around and, and

285
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.460
they actually made it easy
to get both the screen

286
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.050
and the batteries you pop
the screen up, and then

287
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.900
you can access both then
with the five S they

288
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.340
added a, a touch sensor
and they add a little

289
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.410
cable that made it hard
to pop the screen open

290
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.640
without excellently breaking that cable.
And then what, the six,

291
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.620
they said, Oh, this was
a problem. And they actually

292
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.440
went and rather than around
to make the repair easier,

293
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.900
and they kept that design
with the success. So what

294
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.360
we have seen is that
they have been incrementally making

295
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.590
the iPhone. Well, it seems
like probably because the longer

296
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.010
it's been around people, are
they realizing that this thing

297
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.330
going to live a while,
this is certainly not a

298
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.080
disposable thing. It's a pocket
supercomputer. And I know for

299
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.150
a fact that after a
year, if you charge these

300
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.140
things every day, battery life
suffers. Like I am one

301
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.660
of the people who doesn't
think about battery conditioning. I

302
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.550
plug the thing in at
night and I unplug it

303
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.510
in the morning. Right. Totally
reasonable thing to do 400

304
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.480
battery cycles later. And I
have an iPhone that shuts

305
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.530
off at 30%. Right. And
I want to go in

306
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.150
there and I'm going to
say, you guys better fix

307
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.990
this, fix this battery. Right.
And they say the battery

308
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.770
is not covered under warranty.
So, so, you know, they

309
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.280
have a battery replacement policy.
I think they say $79

310
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.720
and we'll do it on
our schedule. Or you can

311
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.310
mail it to us and
pay us for shipping and

312
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.550
handling. We say, Hey, here's
a battery. It's 20 bucks

313
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.740
or 25 bucks and solid
your own your own time.

314
00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.350
It's not going to take
that long. So that's certainly

315
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.140
a better experience. And I
mean, battery life, people don't

316
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.340
realize lithium batteries generally last
about 400 charge cycles. If

317
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.470
you have kind of more
thermal leveling on it. And

318
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.450
some of the Mac books,
they'll, they'll last a thousand

319
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.030
charts cycles, but that's it
at the, at that point,

320
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.830
it's, it's worn out. It's
just like the tires on

321
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.770
your car, whereas out you
need to replace it. And

322
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.110
they were out like when
they were out, they were

323
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.130
out, you know, I, I
was running around Europe a

324
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.960
couple of weeks ago and
it happened to be really,

325
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.200
really cold. And I had
the weirdest thing happened. I'm

326
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.500
looking at my iPhone, the
battery's at 31%. And then

327
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.480
I looked down and it's
at 1% and I looked

328
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.840
down and it's off, off.
Yeah. But yesterday and sitting

329
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.030
in front of my fire,
sitting in front of a

330
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.160
firearm, I ran that thing
all the way down to

331
00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.490
one. And it sat at
1% for almost an hour.

332
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.420
Yeah. What was the deal?
Well, batteries are very thermally

333
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.580
sensitive. And you hear about
this with, with the Tesla

334
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.500
model. S if you, if
you see anybody that has

335
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.630
problems with the model less,
they're probably in a Northern

336
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.800
climate, the batteries do not
do as well in, in

337
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.060
cold weather. And that's just
a electrons move slower in

338
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.990
a material that, that you
know, is less conductive and

339
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.420
the colder, these things get.
It's just more of a

340
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.830
challenge chemically. I had my
iPhone four S I had

341
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.170
it for 11 months and
I, you know, was charging

342
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.390
it like twice a day.
And after 11 months, the

343
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.430
battery was just done, the
phone would go into a

344
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.400
boot loop and it just
would never charge enough to

345
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.530
be able to power the
phone. So 11 months in,

346
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.200
like I'm within the warranty,
but the battery isn't covered

347
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.000
under warranty. So battery is,
is something it's, it's, it's

348
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.390
regular maintenance. It's like changing
the oil in your car.

349
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.370
Of course you should be
changing the batteries on these

350
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.340
things every time. Indeed. And
that's the other thing that

351
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.940
makes me think about the,
the longevity of these devices.

352
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.520
I went and got a
couple of speaking spells for

353
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.610
my kids. And when I
opened them up, the only

354
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.740
thing I had to do
was clean 'em out. Cause

355
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.230
they were full of battery
acid, had a couple of

356
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.720
etches in the, you know,
that weren't good, you know,

357
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.070
and I just tied it
up a little bit. It

358
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.320
was mostly a cleaning operation.
Then I popped in some

359
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.500
C batteries and then my
kids are off, but then

360
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.680
fast forward and I found
some devices that were had

361
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.560
internal batteries. They were NiCad
batteries, but they had just

362
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.890
been sitting there forever. And
it seemed like there was

363
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.430
something that needed to have
power to receive power. You

364
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.350
know, like some of these
devices you'd get them. I

365
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.710
remember what it was. It
was a remember that HP

366
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.470
$99 tablet, that everyone was
freaking out about that. Right.

367
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.300
Turns out if you run
that thing dead, that's it?

368
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.080
Because it has to have
power to charge. Wow. That's

369
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.030
a, that's some bad power
engineering. It should be viable.

370
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.320
I mean, a lot of
the times they'll put a

371
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.700
little capacitor in there that
you can charge. I'm sure

372
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.380
that there's a way to
open it up and jumps,

373
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.430
you know, give it a
jumpstart. Right. But it, it,

374
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.940
it gave me this idea
that like, gosh, there must,

375
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.520
there are some devices out
there, especially ones that have

376
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.580
that kind of wireless charging
that, that really don't want

377
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.420
to charge. I've got an
old Microsoft spot watch. That

378
00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.160
was one of the first
watches that would sit on

379
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.500
something and in charge. Is
that, was that the word

380
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:21.190
capacitively Yes. Well, Simply inductively
rather. Pardon me. And it,

381
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.180
it won't charge anymore. Like
I would need to give

382
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.610
it a little bit of
a CPR if I want

383
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.560
to bring it back. Right.
Well, and so I think

384
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.470
this is a question for
either the engineers of the

385
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.130
world is how do we,
we, as consumers are really

386
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.620
bad at making these kinds
of decisions upfront, like no

387
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.080
one who was thinking about
buying an HP web boss

388
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.930
tablet was thinking about these,
these end of life battery

389
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.700
issues at the time. I
mean, I bought one and

390
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.100
I didn't know about it
at the time. So w

391
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.860
but it's clearly in the
best sensors of society, it's

392
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.900
in the best interest of
the environment for us to

393
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.840
be making these decisions at
purchase time and really factoring

394
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.330
these things in. But none
of the product reviewers know

395
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.490
about it. The only people
that really might know are,

396
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.770
are some folks in the,
in the engineering test departments

397
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.690
at these companies, and they
aren't going to say anything.

398
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.930
So we have to make
a decision upfront on whether

399
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.330
to buy something, whether the
support manufacturers that are doing

400
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.880
the right thing or the
wrong thing, and we don't

401
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.020
have the information to make
that decision. And moreover, as

402
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.010
I end you upgrade to
the next iPhone, it's I

403
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.540
think just not environmentally irresponsible,
just regular irresponsible to put

404
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.140
the old iPhone in a
drawer. Right? Yeah. So if

405
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.570
you look at globally, the
number of phones that we

406
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.630
manufacture, it was about 1.6
billion phones. Last year, it's

407
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.770
going to be close to
2 billion phones for, for 2015.

408
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.660
And the question is, how
many phones should we be

409
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.920
manufacturing? So I, I, I
would like to limit, you

410
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.990
know, to have that plateau
and say, we're going to

411
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.610
make a certain number of
phones every year. This is

412
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.700
the environmental footprint that we
expect the electronics industry to

413
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.130
have, but also let's think
about all the people around

414
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.960
the world that sure would
love to have an iPhone

415
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.400
and just are never going
to be able to afford

416
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.800
a brand new phone from
Apple. The best way to

417
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.320
make the iPhone affordable to
folks in Africa is to

418
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.150
make sure that all the
funds that we have now

419
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.470
are still functional six or
eight years from now. No,

420
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.320
certainly in that case, you're
using Africa in the metaphorical

421
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.390
sense. There's people all over
the world that don't have

422
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.150
these smartphones. I like to
actually, when I have a

423
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.330
phone replace the battery and
then I give it to

424
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.330
somebody. So if I have
an iPhone for us, it's

425
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.970
a perfectly good phone. I
spent the 20 bucks, I

426
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.280
swap it out. I replaced
the battery. I literally refresh

427
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.950
the phone and then I
pay it forward. Right? Give

428
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.370
it to a relative. You
know, it was running around

429
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.100
wherever you, wherever your, your
travels are. If someone can

430
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.650
use a phone like that,
you know, definitely pass it

431
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.710
on. Exactly. Exactly. I think,
I think that's a great

432
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.290
perspective and getting a new
battery into these things frequently

433
00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.270
is the most important part
of it. Well, and this

434
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.250
would be a good challenge,
a challenge for the listeners,

435
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.360
right? So if you're listening,
right, people who are listening

436
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.800
to this podcast, both of
you go to iFixit click

437
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.830
on devices, pick your phone.
And this is an opportunity

438
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.780
for you. If you've, if
you've never opened up a

439
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.650
phone, do this now after
this podcast go and get

440
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.050
those two or three phones
that, you know, you have

441
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.230
an S3 in your, in
your kitchen. Pop that thing

442
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.210
open. Those are easy to
get an iPhone, get an,

443
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.700
get an iPhone, pop it
open, get a sponger. What's

444
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.000
a sponger. Why do I
need a sponge, Small blast,

445
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.270
plastic pry tool. It's just
a nice non-metal tool for

446
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.170
practice. Yeah. I learned that
the hard way, tried to

447
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.620
use a screwdriver to open
up an iPhone and you

448
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.270
don't take your iPhone, take
your iPad. You know, I

449
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.290
actually gave an a, an
original iPad to my 94

450
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.650
year old aunt. It is
her most favorite device ever,

451
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.260
you know, and, and, and
with, with a good battery,

452
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.540
it's going to run for
a very, very long time.

453
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.770
She loves it. Right. Still
browse the net. Great. Absolutely.

454
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:50.340
Yup. And she just likes
random stuff on Facebook. That

455
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.100
is great. Good for her.
Yeah, no, I completely agree.

456
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.990
And this is something, I
mean, we have, we have

457
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.110
repair guides for so many
things that, I mean, we

458
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.100
have over 500 different Android
devices, complete this assembly procedures,

459
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.110
how to change the display,
how to change the battery,

460
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.480
how to fix a headphone
Jack, you name it Across,

461
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.450
across a huge variety of
products. Now I know that

462
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.690
you, you don't, you won't,
you know, sell your nails

463
00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.390
by talking about how great
your story is, but I

464
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.180
will, because I am an
actual fan. This is not,

465
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.780
not sponsored. But if you
go to <inaudible> dot com

466
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.290
slash store, they've got these,
these toolkits you can get,

467
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.320
there's like the smartphone repair
kit, which is one level.

468
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.030
And then there's the ProTech
toolkit. And it moves its

469
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.610
way up to this. Like
if you run a repair

470
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.700
business, like I've got a
good friend named brother tech,

471
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.360
it's Terrence gains, brother, BR
O T H a tech

472
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.700
for the tech.com. Check him
out. He's got like the

473
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.100
toolkit, right? It's the complete
everything you need to fix

474
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.730
tech stuff. Now I went
and got the ProTech toolkit,

475
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.840
which has got half dozen
spongers and it's got, you

476
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.150
know, tiny little tweezers and
all the things that I

477
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.170
need to fix stuff around
the house, but my most

478
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.260
favorite thing, and I'm gushing
about it because it's so

479
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.230
cool. Everyone comments on it,
it's sitting right here. It

480
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.560
is the magnetic project mat.
So it's basically like a

481
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:13.500
magnetic whiteboard with gridded, with
gritted, with lines, with a

482
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.860
grid line. So then you
just take the, take the,

483
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.590
a screw off of the
thing you're taking apart. You

484
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.780
put it onto the mat,
it's magnetic. It sticks to

485
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.120
it. And you just scribble
what the thing is. I

486
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.080
use this thing all the
time. It is brilliant. The

487
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.110
magnetic project mat was something.
When we first started making

488
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.270
it, I was thinking, Oh,
that's nice. That'll be useful.

489
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.470
Every once in a while,
if you have a hard

490
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.170
project, it is amazing. When
you get into these small

491
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:41.820
devices, organization is like 90%
of the battle. There are

492
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.100
so many tiny screws and
you might not even be

493
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.400
able to visibly see the,
between a millimeter and a

494
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.550
1.5 millimeter screw. But that
can be the difference between

495
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.650
putting it back together and
having it work or not

496
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.410
at the tolerances. And these
things are tiny. So you

497
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.030
have to have a repair
guide and you have to

498
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.400
be very methodical about it.
And the cool thing about

499
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.260
the grid on the mat
is you can have each

500
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.380
grid can be a different
step in the guide. You

501
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.250
just number the grids as
you go. You put the,

502
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.990
all the screws from step
two and box two. Yep.

503
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.840
There's a really great under
the product images. When you

504
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.410
click on the pro magnet
project mat, there's like this

505
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.510
really great image, and it's
very realistic because it's clear

506
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.430
that you're using it. And
it's like, this part goes

507
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.030
in first. You know, I
do this all the time

508
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.930
taking apart like old Dell
laptops, old Dell laptops are

509
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.480
really great devices. Like the
ones they made in the

510
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.660
last five to 10 years,
you can always fix them,

511
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.690
but they've got a million
screws and they're all different

512
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.620
sizes. This has saved me
a number of times. When

513
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.620
did you all move from
repair guides to parts and

514
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.870
tools store? Was that just
the next obvious step? Yeah,

515
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.670
it kind of was. Cause
we had the, we had

516
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.380
the manuals and then people
were saying, well, I can't

517
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.030
fix it. It's, it's great
that you told me how

518
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.040
to fix it, but I
can't get the part. And

519
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.080
so then we started searching
around And then, I mean,

520
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.930
when we were starting at
Wikipedia, it, I mean Jimmy

521
00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.330
Wales and the folks that
are running Wikipedia, really my

522
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.280
heroes. And so we were
saying, well, we need to

523
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.980
run. The world, needs a
repair manual for everything. How

524
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.410
can we fund it? And
I know that in December

525
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.750
of every year, Jimmy puts
his face on Wikipedia and

526
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.970
that works for them. I
was trying to figure out

527
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.470
a way I didn't have
to put my face on

528
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.290
my, fix it every December
and bank for donations. And

529
00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.120
so we said, well, maybe
we can sell parts and

530
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.640
tools. And so we, we
kinda turned it into a

531
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.460
complete solution where the repair
manual is free. Creative commons.

532
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.730
Licensed will always be that
way. And then, and then

533
00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.950
if you want, you can
buy the parts and tools

534
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.350
from him. And that helps
us pay our programmers and

535
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.140
keep the lights on. That
is a really good, really

536
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.330
good solution. And it's almost
like the open source solution

537
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.370
where you charge for one
thing, but you give lots

538
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:41.380
away. Right? So the repair
guides are creative comments. And

539
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.720
how many of them are
written by your folks versus

540
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.000
the community? Yeah, It's mostly
the community of the last

541
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.640
time I looked we'd written
something like 15% of the

542
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.800
guides on the site, but
people are constantly coming to

543
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.450
me and saying, Hey, do
you have a repair manual

544
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.700
for a toilet or for
an oscilloscope? And I say,

545
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.250
I don't know. I learned
because I used to say,

546
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.780
no, we don't have a
repair manual for that. And

547
00:25:58.780 --> 00:25:59.950
then I would look on
the site and I said,

548
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.870
Oh, shucks, we actually do
have in this whole scope

549
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.620
guide. So I just tell
people to Google it. Cause

550
00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.110
I don't even know. I
mean, we've got instructions on,

551
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.500
like somebody puts out like
a real helicopter, there's some

552
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.650
component of the, of the
rotary assembly and they put

553
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.250
repair guides for that on
there we have for a

554
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.510
certain Mercedes chassis, our service
manual now is more comprehensive

555
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.470
than the OEM. Wow. So
what would I went to

556
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.380
repair guides? You know, I
saw the things I expected,

557
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.460
you know, tablet, phone, PC,
then I saw car and

558
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.700
truck. And then if you
go even farther down, you've

559
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.930
got 140 different appliances down
there. You've got household stuff.

560
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.710
So you're not, you know,
music that whole on musical

561
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.590
instruments, you're not intending to
just be about phones and

562
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.130
stuff. You got everything. It's
mission is to teach everyone

563
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.960
in the world, how to
fix all of their things.

564
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.230
And we take that very
seriously and we're comprehensive across

565
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.020
the board. We have, we
have a, I mean, all

566
00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.140
kinds of vehicles, there's a
specific moped. I think it's

567
00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.340
a 1978 moped and somebody
took it apart post to

568
00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.230
the guide and then other
people came on and started

569
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.480
asking questions about it and
it's evolved. And now we're

570
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.100
the number one place that
you go. If you have

571
00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.920
this 1978 moped, all the
people on the internet trying

572
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.710
to fix these things are
on. I fix it. So

573
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.010
you've got tear downs, you've
got fix it guides, but

574
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.660
you've also got kind of
a support question. It's kind

575
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.750
of a stack overflow for
repair kind of thing. So

576
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.990
this is stack overflow for
repair. I know Jeff Atwood

577
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.270
very well. And as we
were building this, I was

578
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.950
talking with him and I
said, Hey, you know, I

579
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.660
was going to build up
my own thing. But what

580
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.910
you guys did is so
amazing. Can I like flat

581
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.220
out, copy it and tweak
it for repair? And he

582
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:42.030
said, yes, absolutely. Please do.
Oh, wow. So answers is,

583
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.210
I mean, it's a, it's
a Q and a forum

584
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.820
it's device centric. So we're
stack overflow is organized around

585
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.270
tags. I fix is organized
around products. So I'm pretty

586
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.940
sure there is no question
about an iPhone five that

587
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.920
you're going to have that
is not already answered on

588
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.610
the site. Very cool. And
it goes across the board.

589
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.850
We have people they've Atari
2,600, Hey, you know, my

590
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.100
Atari 2,600 stopped working. Can
I fix it? Like people

591
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.680
are actively still repairing these
things. There are new questions

592
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.930
that come in all the
time, even on vintage hardware

593
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.960
like that. Yeah. There is
a I'm looking here right

594
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.600
now at the Atari 2,600
repair and you've got tear

595
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.550
downs. Now, who does the
tear downs? Is that also,

596
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.820
is that also the community,
The most high profile tear

597
00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.500
down? So the ones that
you usually see on the

598
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.720
news are done by us,
but the latest tear down

599
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.120
that's on the site is
a Sony experience. <inaudible> that

600
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.210
was written by a community
member. We were so busy

601
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:33.320
getting ready for the iPad
pro this week, Lanka beat

602
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.530
us to it. So that's
great. How often I'm just

603
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.480
curious. Cause I think we
all see these tear down

604
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.490
things and we're like, Oh
no, I can't believe they

605
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.220
took apart. That expensive thing.
How often do you get

606
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.020
them back together again? And
how often do you just

607
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.910
have to throw them away?
It depends on if it's

608
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:51.380
a Microsoft surface or not.
Most of the devices, we

609
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.080
definitely get back together and
we use like, in our

610
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.600
tear down room, we have
an Amazon echo. That's the

611
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.280
echo that we use for
the tear down. And that's

612
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.980
our, that's our music device.
So absolutely. We get most

613
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.190
of the things back together.
Some stuff that's super challenging.

614
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.950
Like the surface, you know,
Humpty Dumpty might not be

615
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.410
a look at the surface
back together again. So you

616
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.930
failed to reassemble the surface
in somewhere. They were just

617
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.140
surface parts, The surface principle
and around, I mean, one

618
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.900
of them, I mean, even
I think the surface three,

619
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.940
we got back together when
we were, we were using

620
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.680
it. I don't know that
we tried to put the

621
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.320
surface Back together. That was
just a, that was just

622
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.870
last week. So there's the
surface pro and the surface

623
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.850
book, the book is the
one with the fancy hinge.

624
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.250
Correct. And that's a pretty
elegant machine. And that, that

625
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.140
was a long tear down.
That was a long day.

626
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.190
Yeah. That look it's, there's
like a, some looking here

627
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.110
as step 30. Yeah. 30
different steps. And I assume

628
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.890
that that was pulling both
of them apart. Really? Yeah.

629
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.650
Now, Now one thing to
note. So even though our

630
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.330
tear downs and our repair
guides are in the same

631
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.630
format, we listed 30 steps
for the tear down, but

632
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:51.550
that's more like telling the
story of how we took

633
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.650
it apart. It's not a
good idea to follow a

634
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.990
tear down, to do an
actual repair. So when we

635
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.320
go to actually write the
surface book repair manual, it

636
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.390
will be far more 30
steps long. Have you ever

637
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.540
not been able to get
something open without breaking it?

638
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.590
Yeah, we break stuff. Absolutely.
I mean the original iPad

639
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.500
while the iPad two, we
broke, we broke the first

640
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.630
like five or six iPad
twos that we took apart.

641
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.050
I think the original couple
surfaces, I don't know. Did

642
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.360
we, did we break this
in the process of pulling

643
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.910
it apart? I'm looking at
the surface book. I don't,

644
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.040
I don't think we, so
this one we managed to

645
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.500
get intact. It really depends
on the product. Like the,

646
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.560
so the iPod shuffles are
a disposable product and I

647
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.630
don't think it's possible that
this was assemble those without

648
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.800
breaking them, the new apples,
new keyboards and mice have

649
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.930
integrated batteries. And I don't
know that it's possible to

650
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:47.550
pull those apart without irrevocably
damaging them. We've gotten pretty

651
00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.190
good at it, but it's
really the design that we're

652
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:53.010
up against more than anything
else. If it's possible to

653
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:57.330
disassemble it, usually we can
do it the first. Do,

654
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.410
do you buy the items?
Yes, we do. So no.

655
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.860
One's giving you these things
to tear apart. Yeah. Almost

656
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.410
all the time. We're we're
going out and buying them

657
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:12.750
sometimes like the pebble. I
think they wanted the us

658
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.030
to get in early. So
they sent us one early,

659
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.190
but I'll almost all of
the time we're out there

660
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.350
buying them ourselves. We don't
get help from the manufacturer.

661
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.190
Very cool. And kind of
my final question is I

662
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.040
suggested repairing a battery on
a phone, but what's a

663
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.830
good starter fix. If you've
never really taken something apart,

664
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.250
I think fixing a battery
or swapping out a screen

665
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.750
on the phone, this is
a great start. It really

666
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.370
depends on the phone. Like
I wouldn't do that on

667
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.190
an HTC one, but on
life, on there, a Samsung

668
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:41.010
as five, like absolutely get
in there. I, as for,

669
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.380
as for the S not
the S the S five

670
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.680
got harder. There's a lot
of things. I mean, sometimes

671
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.690
it's like, just pick something
that you have that doesn't

672
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.400
work. So I would look
around your house and pick

673
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.880
something that's broken and do
that because it doesn't really

674
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.610
matter if it's already broken
and you take it apart

675
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.140
and you try to fix
it. And at the end

676
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.240
it does, it still doesn't
work. You didn't really lose

677
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.170
anything. That's a good attitude.
That's I mean, that's ultimately

678
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.360
how I think most of
us started. I think the

679
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.280
first thing I ever took
apart was a remote control.

680
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.370
And then I went up
to the, the legendary clock

681
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.970
radio telephone. Right. And once
I got that working, then

682
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.310
I was like, I can
take apart anything. Right. Kind

683
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.230
of work your way through
it. And I mean, that's,

684
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.210
I mean, there's a joy
of tinkering and getting inside

685
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:24.450
these things, we'll do events
with middle schoolers and we'll

686
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.980
say, Hey, do you want
to take this iPod apart?

687
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.410
And they look at us
like, we're crazy because every

688
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:30.210
adult in their life has
been telling them, don't take

689
00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.430
things apart. And we say,
no, it's okay. Take it

690
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.010
apart. Once they get past
their fear, they start to

691
00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:36.660
get inside their eyes just
light up and they can't

692
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.040
stop and they never leave.
So that's, we need to

693
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.500
Get back to a society
where we, where we understand

694
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.050
and enjoy tinkering. I think
it will lead us to

695
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.110
make better purchasing decisions up
front. And it'll also, I

696
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.390
think probably lead to better
public policy down the road,

697
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.540
you know, and I usually
will echo that and suggest

698
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.590
that one of the things
that I do with my

699
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.200
kids all the time, and
I recommend to all parents,

700
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.910
if you've got a few
good kids, or if you're

701
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.180
an uncle or an aunt
go to a Goodwill or

702
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.300
a, a, you know, anywhere,
a swap meet that you

703
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.840
can find broken stuff, get
your kid a Leatherman tool,

704
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.030
find an item and just
let them take it apart.

705
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.370
Right. Just let them literally
just rip the thing apart.

706
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.980
Even if they have to
break the plastic and just,

707
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.330
just, you know, just destroy
it, then work your way

708
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.820
up to taking it apart
gracefully and then fix the

709
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.180
thing. Exactly. That's exactly right.
And it's such an amazing

710
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.690
experience for kids and to
be able to get inside

711
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.560
and understand, Oh, that's how
it works. Oh, there's a

712
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.270
battery inside. Wow. I didn't
know idea. It's, it's a,

713
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:33.260
it's a wonderful process. It's
a lot of fun and

714
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.060
it develops skills that will
save you money down the

715
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.360
road. Very cool. Kyle Wiens
thanks so much for talking

716
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.780
to me today. Thank you.
This has been another episode

717
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.940
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
