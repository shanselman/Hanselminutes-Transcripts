Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.360
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

9
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.540
talking with Laura, Labon the
CEO co founder and chief

10
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.490
Aviatrix at infinite flight. How
are you? Hi, I'm very

11
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.160
good. How are you? I'm
fantastic. I am looking on

12
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.100
your Instagram and seeing all
kinds of pictures of you

13
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.840
flying around the world. I
see airplanes. I see locations.

14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.340
I see you with a
air airliner's headset on, but

15
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
I'm having trouble telling what's
real. And what's not. I

16
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.390
can't tell if you're really
near a plane or if

17
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.730
this is a render from
your game, how much of

18
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.270
your Instagram is real and
how much is fake? I

19
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.010
would say it's about 50%.
I'm not sure. I would

20
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.090
have to look at you
map, but we do have

21
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.150
pictures that are really convincing
now, but yeah, usually people

22
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.160
will just look at the
comments. They will, they will

23
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.320
call the shots and say,
if it's real or not

24
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.320
really. So like I'm, I'm
looking at a picture of

25
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.800
a coast guard, see one
30 and people are saying,

26
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.220
well, you know, this isn't
real. I'm going to unfollow

27
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.020
you now. I'm guessing that's
not real. That's not real

28
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.720
now. And we actually had
people, we thought like a

29
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.080
lot of people thought this
one was real. Really, this

30
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.130
was taken on a PC,
but it just runs just

31
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.230
as well on the Mac,
as on an iPad, even

32
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.440
like we have air to
air, this runs at this

33
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.360
quality, which is absolutely amazing.
Yeah. I remember when I

34
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.520
talked to your team, Felipe
on your team in 2013,

35
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.860
were you just getting started
at that point? In 2013?

36
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.460
We had been out on
iOS since 2012. So about

37
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.820
a year. It we're just
about a year and we

38
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.000
were putting the app on
Android at the time. Oh,

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.740
I remember. Yes. Right, right,
right. And we showed there

40
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.560
was like the like flash
sessions or something. And we

41
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.470
showed the app running on
Android and iOS to like

42
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.230
kind of showcase what does
that mean was able to

43
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.630
do. And yeah, so that's,
that was a long time

44
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.890
ago. I would not, not
no disrespect intended, but I

45
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.940
would say that in 2013,
it was a pretty game,

46
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.220
but it was not something
that I would mistake for

47
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.220
reality. Right. So that's, that's,
that's why, like with this

48
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.790
next update, we're really focusing
on quality. And we knew,

49
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.740
like we had made a
lot of progress on, on

50
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.910
the airplane rendering. We've using
like events, techniques, like PBR,

51
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.150
like physically based rendering. So
the planes looked nice in

52
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.710
the PR like in the
current data, if you get

53
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.020
it on store today, the
planes are really nice. They

54
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.540
look super real, but the
ground does not look as

55
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.680
nice. So that's the issue
that we're trying to solve

56
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.030
with this new update, basically
fixing this disconnect between the

57
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.450
tool. The issue is it's
very difficult to actually have

58
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.960
a rendering like this on
mobile and also have the

59
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.360
entire planet and satellite imagery.
So there's a lot of

60
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.900
things that we had to
other technical challenges we had

61
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.700
to overcome, but we're getting
there. What is the technical

62
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.720
challenge primarily about making the
ground like look better? I

63
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.670
don't mean to use the
word just, but I think

64
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.580
people sometimes do that to
make them understand that don't

65
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.730
you just take the highest
resolution tiles from Google earth

66
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.730
and lay it out on
the floor Surface. So that's

67
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.940
what most people think that
would just talk to Google.

68
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.060
Most people don't know that
it's not possible. Google doesn't

69
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.360
actually allow you to query
their tiles from outside of

70
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.360
their SDK. So there's multiple
challenges. One is actually getting

71
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.290
the data, getting the satellite
imagery or getting some kind

72
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.030
of Victor based data to
render forest and row roads

73
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.230
and cities where they should
be. We opted for this

74
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.540
because we could find a
source that was acceptable for

75
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.240
us at a price that
we could, it was a

76
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.310
little pricey, but we could
afford it. And at least

77
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.100
for some reasons the planet.
And so there's this aspect.

78
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.580
And also there's the, the
elevation that we have to

79
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.180
take in, in consideration because
we have to find elevation

80
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.200
maps for the entire planet.
And the third aspect is

81
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.760
making this all fit on
a device. So that was

82
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.030
basically the three big challenges.
And on top of this,

83
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.640
we have the rendering because
you could have the most

84
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.560
beautiful planet. If your atmosphere
rendering does not look good,

85
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.640
it just looks cartoonish and
not realistic. So there was

86
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.730
a lot of effort to
one of our engineer spent

87
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.140
on making sure everything looked
as real as possible. Hmm.

88
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.840
Yeah. I mean, I know
that initially when you look

89
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.080
at an early flight simulators,
it is just that it's

90
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.780
a tile on a flat
surface. And then when they

91
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.420
start to add some geo
data to get elevation, if

92
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.040
you're not careful, you'll end
up getting sharp, you know,

93
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.000
like pointy, pointy mountains, right.
That don't look like mountains

94
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.490
just looked like someone stuck
a traffic cone underneath The

95
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.880
ground. So there's, there's, that's
something that we had to

96
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.510
work a lot on because
you know, if you run,

97
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.430
like we develop, most of
our engineering is done on

98
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.770
PC. So we have a
lot of memory without a

99
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.070
lot of processing power. But
when you have something that

100
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.080
you're happy with, you put
it on the iPad and

101
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.210
you realize you were running
at five frames per second.

102
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.110
So we have to make
a load of improvements, optimizations,

103
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.530
and to make sure we
don't have those pointing out

104
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.220
nuns, but we still have
an acceptable level of quality

105
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.760
and for everything to load
in the background, because you

106
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.100
could fly. I just did
a flight yesterday, reproducing one

107
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.590
of the Boeing flights, like
a, some kind of demo

108
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.660
flight they did with, they
drew an airplane in the

109
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.090
air across the U S
and I was flying for

110
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.330
17 hours. So you have
to have this wasn't on

111
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.290
the iPad. So you have
to have a device that

112
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.480
doesn't load all the time
that it doesn't pause to

113
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.980
load. And that runs and
loads data from our servers

114
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.580
for 17 hours without crashing.
So there's a lot of

115
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.720
technical challenges with that. So
just to make sure I

116
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.740
understood that, like you personally
were flying your application for

117
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.370
17 hours, More or less.
There was a section of

118
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.850
it, which I time scaled,
but overall I think it

119
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.140
was from like 11 in
the morning to about six

120
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.410
in the afternoon. Oh my
gosh. Like I just, you

121
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.030
need a copilot that's when
you have to take a

122
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.290
break, That's why we have,
we have an autopilot. This

123
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.170
was actually a flight plan
that I loaded from flight

124
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.150
aware. You know, those sites
that you can find out

125
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.610
where the planes are going.
I just took the flight

126
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.370
plan, put it into the
app and I pressed enough

127
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.310
button and the planes just
fluid on its own. And

128
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.830
we had live weather and
the fuel consumption, all that

129
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.710
was actually running as well.
So it was a pretty

130
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.310
fun flight. So this is
also a good stress test.

131
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.720
Of course you find out
whether you have a memory

132
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.860
leak after 17 hours of
flying. Exactly. So that's also

133
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.070
one aspect, one thing that,
because there's memory leaks, and

134
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.160
then also like just general
memory that you're using would

135
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.500
this update, we're probably going
to have to drop some

136
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.740
devices. Those that I have
less than one gig of

137
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.480
memory are getting us into
a trouble because as much

138
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.110
as we would like to
support them, you know, it's

139
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.440
a lot of textures to
load and we have planes

140
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.690
that are in high quality.
We have this multiplayer mode

141
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.320
where other users are flying
with you. So we have

142
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.100
to load their plane textures.
So there is a point

143
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.170
where we were like, we're
really waiting, dropping supporters for

144
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.570
all the devices with this
update. Yeah, that was my

145
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.390
next question was like, what
exactly is in memory? Is

146
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:46.240
it primarily textures? So most
of it is textures. We

147
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.200
do compress it for the
platforms. So we have for

148
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.830
each aircraft, you download, they're
not stored in the app

149
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.130
itself in the package. We
actually download most of the

150
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.680
planes. And most of like
all the scenery from our

151
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.160
servers and we have multiple
versions. So we have three

152
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.870
versions of the database for
other ground, the textures of

153
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.740
the ground we have for
Android and iOS and for

154
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.830
PC. So that takes a
lot of time and memory

155
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.130
for us to compile everything
and even store it on

156
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.180
the servers and for the
airplanes, it's the same. We

157
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.090
have three versions and we
also have a lot of

158
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.140
additional textures because we have
just a plain texture and

159
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.890
then we have normal maps
and specular maps on top

160
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.320
of it to make sure
that all the shiny parts

161
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.230
are shiny and all the
brush metal parts look like

162
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.110
they're brush metal. So there's
a lot of textures that

163
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.410
actually are loaded at a
single point in time. And

164
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.790
I would say most of
it is actually textures. So

165
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.280
forgive, forgive my ignorance, but
why would you need three

166
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.770
different versions of the world?
Why can't everyone just load

167
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.830
up? I don't know, a
JPEG The issue with that.

168
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.280
So this is what we
had initially during the beta

169
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.070
testing phase or the alpha
testing phase, and we're using

170
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.180
a different service called Mapbox.
So we're accessing their tiles,

171
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.450
which I think were in
JPEG. And Daysha with that

172
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.410
is that they're compressed until
they get to your computer

173
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.020
and then to render them
on the graphics card, you

174
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.140
have to and compress them
and send them in compress

175
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.210
to the, to the graphics
card. And that's a big

176
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.380
issue because we could get
into a situation where a

177
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.150
single view would like with
the one you have with

178
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.960
the <inaudible> would take maybe
150 max just of textures.

179
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.240
And that was getting us
kicked, basically killed by iOS

180
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.190
because we were using too
much memory. So we have

181
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.980
to compress those textures before
we get them to the

182
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.390
graphics cards. So the numbers,
I remember Felipe told me,

183
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.490
we go from 150 megs
of uncompressed, RGB textures. Why

184
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.870
would you be textured depending
on the format to about

185
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.350
16 megs total? Oh, wow.
So that's a big improvement.

186
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.910
We lose some quality obviously,
but it's, it's worth it.

187
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.800
The performance is much better.
Interesting. It seems like this

188
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.350
is the, like, I think
infinite flight is a good

189
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.170
example of a new generation
of game where in the

190
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.420
past we would receive a
game on a DVD or

191
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.750
a CD. It would be
massive. It would be offline

192
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.770
and it would include all
assets. And now due to

193
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:26.390
a combination of constraints on
the client and lots of

194
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.270
different clients, there's this new
generation of game that has

195
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.640
a cloud service on the
backend. And there's a balance

196
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.730
between a, for lack of
a better word. Who's doing

197
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.090
the chewing. Like you have
the cloud chewing, you know,

198
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.720
upfront during the build, you
have the cloud chewing when

199
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.300
assets are requested and then
you have the client chewing

200
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.730
and each has their own
responsibility. Is that, is that

201
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.870
a fair statement? Yeah, I
mean, in our case, I

202
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.130
mean, there's, there's little. We
do, even if it were

203
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.290
on PC right now, like
if you had to store

204
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.770
all this database, I think
the last numbers I had

205
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.410
was about 200 to 300
gigs for the entire dataset.

206
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.720
And this is only for
the 15 meter imagery we

207
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.800
have and we're planning on
adding a lot more imagery

208
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.950
at higher quality, so it
can really quickly get into

209
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:21.640
the terabytes. So it's definitely
a better technical solution and

210
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.580
embedded practical solution for most
people that have it downloaded

211
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:30.150
on the fly. Interesting. And
does it cash that up

212
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.710
to a certain point and
then is there like a

213
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.920
viewport where you're keeping this
information local until it's no

214
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.100
longer needed and then you
just, Yeah, we do. We

215
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.150
actually do have a cache
locally. I wouldn't know the

216
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.760
technical details of how long
we keep it in cash,

217
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.980
but we do store some
data. There's multiple levels of

218
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.790
caching. There's one on our
servers using the CDN and

219
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.180
there's one on the client.
So we don't request the

220
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.410
same tiles multiple times. And
this is configurable. It's configurable

221
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.020
by us. We might make
it configurable in the future

222
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.800
for the user, but for
now, it's just for us,

223
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.230
I think it's set to
about 25 bags of cash.

224
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.530
So you have an update
that's coming though, that you

225
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.360
said is going to change
the way you deal with

226
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.490
the ground. And it's not
going to look like right

227
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.680
now, I'm on my iPhone.
I can see that it's

228
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.950
buttery smooth. I can see
that the, the models of

229
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.410
the airplane are amazing, but
if I get really close

230
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.470
to the ground, I can
tell that it's blurry. It's

231
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.240
like Jay Peggy, you know,
when you move up, but

232
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.330
you've got something new coming.
So this no data is

233
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.770
the one that you were
talking about, like with the

234
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.810
<inaudible>. So that is not
going to solve the problem

235
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.130
of low altitude, mainly because
it's expensive to get a

236
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:50.820
very precise satellite imagery. We're
kind of aiming for 10,000

237
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.600
feet and above, but the
experience is still like pretty

238
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.300
good below 10,000, you still
get, you see the Rose,

239
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.580
you see the forest, you
see like experience is pretty

240
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.850
good still below. And the
good thing is that the

241
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.360
system is pretty configurable. So
if one day we decided

242
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.260
an area has higher quality
imagery, we can just put

243
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.100
it on the server as
another, like a level of

244
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.850
quality and then the clients
will automatically get it. So

245
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.590
we don't have to have,
like, this is what we

246
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.220
didn't buy. You know, it's
millions and millions of dollars

247
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.770
if you buy high quality
imagery for the entire world,

248
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.100
but that's what we might
at some point get like

249
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.160
just, you know, the Seattle
area, the San Francisco area.

250
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.100
So you just have some
key points of interest in

251
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.340
high quality, but not the
entire world. Yeah. That makes

252
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.170
sense. And that's kind of
how Google does it now

253
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.870
in the sense of you
can go to Paris, but

254
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.610
if you go to Nebraska,
it's not going to be

255
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.010
the highest, Right? There's no
point in paying like a

256
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.770
million dollar for a place
nobody's going to fly into

257
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.480
<inaudible> I'm on, I'm on
My iPhone here, which is

258
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.060
just a, an iPhone six.
It's not even the latest

259
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.140
one. It seems like there's
never any jitters. It's like

260
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.650
it's buttery smooth is frame
rate really important in the

261
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.030
flight simulator space. It is.
I mean, if you go

262
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.320
on most websites, there's always
TRAPed tips and tricks. And

263
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.800
to find out how to
optimize your, your PC rig

264
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.800
and have the opera. And
as soon as, as, as

265
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.840
fast as possible for us,
it's really important, especially until

266
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.360
now, because we had a
lot of older devices that

267
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.220
people were still using. We're
still like every new development

268
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.120
we do. Like there's, there
was a internal battle. And,

269
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.530
you know, in the company
between how the amount of

270
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.900
features where we're shipping and
how fast we're going and

271
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.500
how fast we were iterating,
versus how careful we were

272
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.100
with like caching techniques and
making sure that everything run

273
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.180
as fast as possible. But
now, like all new features

274
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.570
have to go by some
standard of performance. So we

275
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.410
can't, you know, object oriented
programming is great, but sometimes

276
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.380
like it's not good for
performance, especially on those devices.

277
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.530
So we have to be
careful with the way we

278
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.710
access data, to make sure
that everything is close and

279
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.490
super optimized, and we've done,
like we've done some, some

280
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.080
good progress on, especially airport
parsing and storing all the

281
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.360
data for the airports and
that age to make sure

282
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.780
that we can query things
as fast as possible. Yeah.

283
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.370
I would think that you,
you were saying that you

284
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.130
can't be super perfect at
low altitudes, but I would

285
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.050
assume that at the, at
least the airport level, when

286
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.790
you're landing, you're gonna want
that to be as high

287
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.880
quality as possible all the
way down to zero. Right?

288
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.260
So for the airports, we
actually have a database that

289
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.370
our users are contributing to.
So they're using, there's a

290
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:48.340
GitHub repo, and people post
their airport updates to that

291
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.420
repo. And we process that,
put it on the database.

292
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.570
So that's just for now,
it was for the update

293
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.180
you have on your phone.
The previous version, we actually

294
00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:03.970
were manually shipping things as
we're updating the app, but

295
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.060
with this new version, we'll
be able to just update

296
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.040
a database and validate all
the cash on the clans.

297
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.800
So they get new data
without them doing anything. Oh,

298
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.660
okay. So I won't even
have to do a big

299
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.820
update. Cause if I remember
correctly, when I downloaded this,

300
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.320
it wasn't even that big,
it was maybe a hundred

301
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.860
megs, 150 megs. Smaller than
that. Actually the, the package

302
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:29.170
I send to iTunes connect
is about 50 megs. And

303
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.170
it's going to get yeah.
Available over cell phone. Right.

304
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.880
This is why we wanted
to make it lower than

305
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.100
that because we were wanting
to make sure that everybody

306
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.920
could get it over a
three G LT or whatever.

307
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.560
Interesting. Why is, what, what
do you think about as,

308
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.100
as a pilot? How long
have you been a pilot?

309
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.970
About 17 years. 15 years.
Okay. So I would, I

310
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.610
would assume that a flight
simulator person or someone who

311
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.950
is a pilot who also
wants a flight simulator would

312
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.570
be one of those people
that would go into their

313
00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.200
garage, like find an old
front end on a plane

314
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.370
and install one of those
like fake airplane chunks in

315
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.650
their garage and turn it
into a flight simulator. What

316
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.650
is the market for a
mobile flight simulator? Like, isn't

317
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.980
it don't I want to
like take over my, my

318
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.170
den or one of my
extra rooms and get like

319
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.280
the most perfect controls and
build multiple screens and all

320
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.320
that kind of stuff. Why
would anyone want to fly

321
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.000
on their iPad? So there's
a, there's a big debate

322
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.970
in the community. And, and
something that I see, like

323
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.050
I was at this air
show in Wisconsin, in Oshkosh,

324
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.860
Wisconsin, Clara venture. And I
was there to talk to

325
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.670
people and introduce the application.
And there was always this

326
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.100
stigma associated with mobile games
and, you know, they don't

327
00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.540
like, Oh, well, you're just
doing, like, I work on

328
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.420
this mobile flight simulator and
I can see their face

329
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.340
kind of like, yeah, sure.
Okay. So one of those

330
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.030
like arcade games, so I
have to, like, I have

331
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.280
to force them to look
at what it looks like.

332
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.610
And then they're convinced, cause
they're like, Oh, it looks

333
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.610
so real. And it runs
on iPad. That's crazy. So

334
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:06.320
we have this, this stigma
with the mobile world, because

335
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.530
there's so many low quality
games out there that people

336
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.540
just assume that it's not
going to be worth using,

337
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.760
but we think that there's
a different, there's different profiles.

338
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.180
There's of course, somebody who
really wants to go deep

339
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.850
into the technical details. Like
they really want to fly

340
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.810
the airplane to the maximum,
you know, quality and start

341
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:31.040
the engine, you know, with
every single parameter and, and,

342
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:35.270
and checklist items. Of course,
we can't do that on,

343
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.460
on mobile now. Like at
least we can do it.

344
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.600
Some others might do, but
we're trying to solve a

345
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.220
different problem. We're trying to
solve the problem where your,

346
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.700
you know, what's your family,
you're at your grandmothers or,

347
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.420
you know, something that your
mother-in-law and you know, there's

348
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.660
a boring discussion. There's some
timeout you're not at home.

349
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.550
You don't have all your,
you know, your big PC

350
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.270
rig. You can just pop
your iPad off your bag

351
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.380
and you can start playing
multiplayer with your friends. It's

352
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.830
like, it's, it's I see
it as I'm getting my

353
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.430
flights in fix. And I
realized that since I started,

354
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.310
I actually don't play the
other simulators because it gets

355
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.730
me my fix. And it
doesn't matter. Even when it

356
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.780
was like really, really early
Virgin would just went in

357
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.030
a, in a runway to
land on it was enough

358
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:31.070
to get me satisfied. And,
and there's also another aspect

359
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.240
of this is that many
people, especially in the developing

360
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.150
countries do not have those
big PC rigs. They can't

361
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.750
afford that. What they have
as a, is a, an

362
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.420
iPad. They have an iPad
mini. They have, you know,

363
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.330
they have things that before,
like, I guess you, when

364
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.310
I, when, when we were
younger, like the first time

365
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.880
we got into, I guess,
like we could get into

366
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.560
flight simulation where it was
the time where we can

367
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.110
get a PC. But now
when you're like from eight

368
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.110
to like 13, 14 years
old, what do you have?

369
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.560
You don't have a PC,
you have a tablet. So

370
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.230
this is what people discover
the app on. They might

371
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.580
jump later, but it's, it's
a, it's a, it's a

372
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.780
different market. And I think,
you know, we're with, with

373
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.950
all the advances we've been
able to do some people

374
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.770
actually don't feel the need
to actually go on a

375
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.680
PC and install everything. And
like, cause every time you

376
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.810
want to fly, there's you
have to boot the PC

377
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.110
takes five minutes, windows updates,
blah, blah, blah. It's just,

378
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.380
it's a lot of friction.
Whereas you can just take

379
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.000
your phone and start playing.
Interesting. Well then how do

380
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.460
you find that balance between
an arcade game? Like you

381
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.410
said, like a pickup and
play and playing in the,

382
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.370
in line at the DMV
and you know, accuracy where

383
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.910
as a pilot, you expect
a certain amount of, of,

384
00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.560
of correctness and accuracy. Like
if the move, the flaps,

385
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.700
it needs to behave appropriately,
physics are important, Right? So

386
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.420
we actually don't dumb down
the system as much because

387
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.190
we're for like enlightening society.
I guess we do simplify

388
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.240
some systems, but the physics
is what the physics is.

389
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.300
Right? So if you want
to take off from a

390
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.630
place where, you know, it's
super warm density, altitude is

391
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.570
super high on an overloaded
plane. You're going to crash

392
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.240
just like in real life.
We don't actually make it.

393
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.160
It's not an arcade game.
It's not made to be

394
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.530
an arcade game. We don't
have, we just have sensitivity

395
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.010
settings on the controls because
some people prefer it's more

396
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.590
sensitive, but we don't have
like an easy simulation or

397
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:36.000
an arcade simulation mode. So
some people might play and

398
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.230
you know, you can just
do a couple of touch

399
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.080
and goes, if you're in
line at the DMV and

400
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.720
some people also do like
just, you know, you can

401
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.060
start your flight, turn on
the autopilot and put in

402
00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.660
your pocket where you're dealing
with a DMV person. And

403
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.310
then when you were out,
just resuming your flight. So

404
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:57.000
What does that mean is
touching goal. So just like

405
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.440
lending practicing lendings so it's,
you can do like a

406
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.110
lending every two, three minutes.
So you can do like

407
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.560
maybe five, six, seven, lendings
where you're in line, the

408
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.230
DMV. And then, you know,
you end your fight. Your

409
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.420
score is like your, your
time of flight or your

410
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.170
LinkedIn count is, is, is
a total old and you

411
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:20.250
know, you've made some progress.
Oh, okay. One of the

412
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.320
other things that you do,
which is unusual for a

413
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.780
mobile device, if I understand
correctly is you have, is

414
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.440
it true? You have air
traffic control. Yes. So that's

415
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.760
something that we added in
2000. There's two more to,

416
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.970
to kind of like big
milestones. First one was just

417
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.300
adding multiplayer mode where people
would talk to what we

418
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.730
call the union, come frequency.
When you go to an

419
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.950
airport, that's uncontrolled, everybody broadcast
their intentions on the, so

420
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.560
this is what we had
initially, but it's not voice

421
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.130
based. It's, it's a set
of predefined commands or which

422
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.650
are like pretty much close
to what you could do

423
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.070
in real life. And then
about a year later, we

424
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.850
added the ATC mode where
you can be a controller

425
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:08.840
in this system. So there's
people that actually play more

426
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.870
as controllers than us pilots.
And that's the really fun

427
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.980
part. What is that? What
does that mean though? Are

428
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.410
you hearing them talk? Are
you seeing texts? What is

429
00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:21.670
the experience? So it's text
and text to speech. So

430
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.710
basically if you're a controller
or you see an airplane

431
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.890
that's on the ground asking
you for pushback. So he's

432
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:30.400
going to show up in
your little, a little list

433
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.870
on your, on your ride.
You mean, and click on

434
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.350
that plan and you say
pushed back approved or, you

435
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.010
know, maintain position or stand
by. And for them, it

436
00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.770
shows up as a, you
know, the communication in a

437
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.280
little ATC box and they
have different options to respond

438
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.210
as they can say, you
know, push back and pushing

439
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.740
back or something that can,
you can ask all their

440
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:57.220
messages. And it's, it is
not the best because I

441
00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.130
mean, we, we would like
to have people talk because

442
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:03.100
it's obviously a little easier,
but it's not always the

443
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.710
best when you're in public
situations. Like if you were

444
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.180
in a, in a, in
a bus or in a

445
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.640
train, you don't really want
to start talking. So th

446
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.750
the text commons are actually
pretty good. And also whenever

447
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.540
you have people interacting directly,
they're going to start insulting

448
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.960
each other. So that's why
we, we kinda left it

449
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.240
to the text based. And
also it guys, you, because

450
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.290
sometimes like, it's when you're
starting to fly the, the,

451
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.610
the, the, the ATC part
of the flying is very

452
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.740
stressful. Because most of the
time, you don't even know

453
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.450
what to say, and you're
going to mess up every

454
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.690
single message. So the fact
that it's all like pre

455
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.730
done for you and you
just pretty much, and it's

456
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.090
also context space. So if
you're near, you're not going

457
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.420
to get any ground messages.
So you, you, you can

458
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:51.050
only send messages that are
valid, or, you know, in,

459
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.060
in a context that you
are, Have people ever wanted

460
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.730
to be able to play
out certain scenarios. Like you

461
00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.290
could say, I want to
do the miracle on the

462
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.560
Hudson. And I want to
play that out and try

463
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.560
those simulations. As some people
have done it. I mean,

464
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.190
we, you can just take
off from LaGuardia and then

465
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.320
do the same flight and,
you know, shut down the

466
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.860
engines. And then you you'll
see if we can reproduce

467
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.560
the same thing. Most likely,
you know, same thing's going

468
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.860
to happen. Okay. Did you
see the thing that happened

469
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.530
a couple of days ago,
where an air Canada flight

470
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.480
pick the wrong one way
in lined up on the

471
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.470
one, one, and almost hit
four parked airplanes? Yeah. I

472
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.600
saw that they were saying
that it would have been

473
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.180
the worst air disaster in
like history, if it happened,

474
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.290
missed it by 50 feet.
Yeah. So we kind of

475
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:43.060
have similar situation in the
app where we have people

476
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.800
sometimes make mistakes. They take
the wrong runways, and we

477
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.710
have ways for controllers to
tell them, to go around,

478
00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.230
tell them to behave to
them, to follow instructions. And

479
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.230
eventually they don't listen. We
can just report them and

480
00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.130
it ghosts them. So they
don't actually, they can still

481
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.630
see other people, but other
people can see them. And

482
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.470
that's actually, it, it triggers
sometimes investigations. We have to

483
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.650
pull the logs and records
to see who said, what

484
00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.620
was the plan at that
time? If it's a complex,

485
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.360
it's a complex mechanism. So
you've been doing this. This

486
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.010
started out as a hobby,
and now it's a full

487
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.730
flown business. It's, you've got
multiple employees. You're the CEO.

488
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.030
You still have time to
fly. One thing I'm interested

489
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:33.380
in is, was using C-sharp
as a cross platform solution,

490
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.740
performing enough. And now with
four years, five years behind

491
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.250
you, was this the right?
I think it was definitely

492
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.070
the right call. I mean,
there's definitely there's other programming

493
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.430
language that we could use,
but we were familiar with

494
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:51.740
the language and the project
was started like this. And

495
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.070
considering the fact that that
out to the original version

496
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.010
was on PC. And then
when we went to mobile,

497
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:02.450
it was for windows phone.
It kinda made sense to,

498
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.580
and it actually, there was
the that's what, the only

499
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.700
language you could compile anything
on at that time, the

500
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.550
first version of windows phone
was only for C sharp.

501
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.830
So it kinda made sense.
And then when Xamarin, you

502
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:20.090
know, came and did their
thing ages, I guess we

503
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.960
got lucky with the technology.
When I started, I remember

504
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.970
back in 2004, people telling
me, Oh, you're going to

505
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.220
get stuck on Microsoft platforms.
You should use C plus

506
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.400
plus. And I was like,
I don't like C sharp.

507
00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.200
It's fine, whatever. And then
eventually he worked out And

508
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.920
you're on a memory constrained
device on a CPU constrained

509
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.120
device, but C sharp of
course is ultimately becoming native

510
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.060
code. So you haven't had
performance issues that were language-based

511
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:53.090
or runtime. We had issues
with garbage collection. We're not

512
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:57.170
careful, but when we could
identify those issues, you know,

513
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.420
there's ways to work around
that. So we just went

514
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.880
on to like, you know,
stack overflow and realize we

515
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.320
were completely wrong about things.
And, and we've managed to

516
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.830
like, you know, what, what
you see on those pictures

517
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.160
on my Instagram are things
that are running at 60

518
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.370
frames per second, on a
one year or two old

519
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:23.330
device. So that's pretty remarkable.
Wow. I was looking at

520
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.630
your communities forum, and there
was a summer update that

521
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:29.150
was saying like, when will
this be done? And it

522
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.960
sounds like your users are
excited for this to the

523
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.990
new global update to happen.
And you're stuck at 90%

524
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.160
and now it's all performance.
Yeah. There's a lot of

525
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.450
excitement. We were really careful,
but with will be announced

526
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.510
because we got burned a
few times. I'd be, we

527
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:51.160
saw pitchforks and torches in
their horizon. That's what we

528
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.430
were really careful now about
what we say and what

529
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.420
we tell people. We usually
don't like, dates are absolutely

530
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.120
out of the question. We
never say it's coming on

531
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.450
that day because there's always
something that might come up.

532
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.030
And, and most of our
users, I mean, a lot

533
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.060
of our users, not most,
but don't get it. They

534
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.870
just assume it's just like,
Oh, just add smoke next.

535
00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.310
You know, after the airplane
just, Oh, let me one

536
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:20.330
second aircraft smoke enable like,
Oh, I like this assume

537
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.410
like, everything is simple. So
that's what we're like really

538
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.710
careful. We know, like it's
a balance between announcing too

539
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:31.390
early and communicating too much
or too little. It's really

540
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.640
hard because we kind of
had to stop putting out

541
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.090
updates. We haven't put out
an update since December. And

542
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.790
we made that decision because
we were working on this

543
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.730
new update. And every time
they were getting impatient, they're

544
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.920
like, well, there's no new
thing. So we're like, okay,

545
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.170
well fine. We'll make a
new airplane. So I was

546
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.500
stuck on the airplane and
then, you know, Felipe on

547
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.920
or other people in the
company where sometimes bar over

548
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.760
to develop version, to work
on some update things. And

549
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.440
we're not making progress on
global. So that's why at

550
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.280
some point we said, you
know what, just stop doing,

551
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.940
like stop shipping update until
global is ready. And that

552
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.610
was a tough call because
people are getting really impatient.

553
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.320
Right. What, and of course,
they're also forgetting that you

554
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.140
have to keep the service
running like this. Isn't a

555
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.720
ShipIt and leave. It's a
wake up at two in

556
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.900
the morning, the server's down.
Yup, exactly. And we have

557
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.350
always had a few issues
with like Facebook login, Google

558
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:34.620
login, recently, something with Azure
mobile services who like basically

559
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.060
logging with Google is not,
was not working anymore. So

560
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.520
we actually, we actually, it
was, this was my parcel.

561
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.700
I actually had to leave
the global work to go

562
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.830
back on, on the main
version and update our system

563
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.820
to completely remove Azure mobile
services and use our own

564
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:59.070
system. And that was not
fun, but yeah. Yikes. As

565
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:02.220
Azure worked out pretty well
for you. Yeah. It's been

566
00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.400
pretty good. Except the mobile
services part, which was something

567
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.410
that we're always like kind
of scared of using kind

568
00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:10.920
of like a black boxy
thing. But other than that,

569
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.500
I mean, all the, all
the web services really awesome

570
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.730
to scaling is really awesome
database. Really cool. Now we're

571
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:23.610
using a lot of storage
and CDN, so it's, it's

572
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.180
really a great, great platform.
What do you use SQL?

573
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.970
I'm curious. It feels like
maybe cosmos DB might be

574
00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:35.130
a useful thing. Yeah. We
use sequel and we're actually

575
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:39.560
thinking of switching to another
type of DB. Like I

576
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:44.180
think I Was just introduced
to cosmos DB a couple

577
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.950
of days ago. So I
think I might actually, I

578
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:53.480
mean, we're like, there's different
sections. Like we actually store

579
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.490
a lot of things for
the user, like all of

580
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.790
the physician reports of all
the flights, and this is

581
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.710
a lot of data that
costs us a lot of

582
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:04.310
money to store in SQL
databases. So I actually have

583
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.580
to like ship that over
to a different type of,

584
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.180
of DB. But yeah, it
seems like the fact that

585
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.580
you've got users everywhere that
you're a global database and

586
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.560
you don't want to have
all of your rights go

587
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.990
to one place that, that
kind of a global database

588
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.440
would be a smart decision.
Right? Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Well,

589
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.780
thanks so much for chatting
with me today. Well, thanks

590
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.080
for having me. So that
is Laura Labon and you

591
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.060
can check out infinite hyphen
flight, God come and download

592
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.070
that it's on the Google
play store. It's on the

593
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.590
app store. I bought it.
It's fantastic. I have it

594
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.650
both on my iPhone and
on my iPad. Definitely one

595
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.150
of those apps that you
show people when you just

596
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.340
want to show off what
you can do, if you're

597
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.860
not a flyer. And if
you are a flyer, look

598
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.940
for the global upgrade. Perhaps
later this year, this has

599
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.120
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

600
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:53.660
next week.
