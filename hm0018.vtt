organizational tools. <inaudible> Hi, this
is Carl Franklin and you're listening

11
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.160
to Hansel minutes. I'm here
again with Scott Hanselman after

12
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.410
a week in hiatus. How
are you doing Scott? I

13
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.390
am. Well, how are you,
sir? How was your week?

14
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390
Last week? I was catching
up on reading and I

15
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.690
was a cleaning up after
the baby Looking around for

16
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.180
links. I'm sure because we
have a ton of them

17
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.880
for the show. It's a
complicated topic that we've got

18
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.780
today. What is the topic
today? Scott Topic is life

19
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.850
hacks. This is hacking hacking
your life. There's an interesting

20
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.940
definition of what life hacking.
Is it a string stir

21
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.860
slash F a Y, but
basically a life hack are

22
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.270
really cool tips, techniques, things
you can do to your

23
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.010
life. That like as if
a programmer we're tweaking or

24
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.120
hacking, right, we as, as
programmers or computer oriented people,

25
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.690
not necessarily programmers, but creative
types that use the computer.

26
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.430
Think about our lives. Similarly
that we think about the

27
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.440
computer kind of ins and
outs. And if you tweak

28
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.470
this, you'll get better output.
And with this kind of

29
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.560
onslaught of information, all this
stuff that happens in RSS,

30
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.920
all the stuff that happens
in email voicemails, just the

31
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.340
glut of information that is
our lives and only 24

32
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.460
hours to manage it. All
people are turning more and

33
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.790
more to a different personal
systems of organization in order

34
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.090
to deal with all this.
And in the last couple

35
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.660
of two, three years, there's
become this term life hack

36
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.380
where someone can encapsulate a
here's, what works for me

37
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.290
type tip that they would
then put in an ad

38
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.760
or put in their blog
and someone would go and

39
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.620
say, Oh man, Carl's got
this great life hack. And

40
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.950
it really helped him become
more productive. Huh? So this

41
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.580
isn't necessarily software. This might
be a procedure, might be

42
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.940
a, a book or, or
something else. Right? Exactly. These

43
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.710
are, this could be any
number of things. There's a

44
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.820
whole website dedicated to them
at life. hacker.com shrinks stir

45
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.160
FAA life hacker.com is a
blog dedicated things you could

46
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.990
do to your life. That
has nothing to do with

47
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.150
software. And I think with
hardware, and it's important to

48
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.820
note that this isn't about
gadgets. This isn't about, Oh,

49
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.890
I got a new pocket
PC and it really changed

50
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.770
my life. This is about
modifying behavior. It's almost a

51
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.190
lifestyle. It's a kind of
a lifestyle of continuous improvement,

52
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.950
not in a spiritual sense,
but just in a, how

53
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.930
can I be more effective
in my life? And I,

54
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.330
you know, kind of started
like maybe Stephen Covey was

55
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.870
probably the first big, super
successful life hacker or maybe

56
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.770
Tony Robbins. You know, people
who have that sense of,

57
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.290
I'm always trying to improve,
always trying to make something

58
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.030
more of my life. All
right. So let's jump in.

59
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.400
What do you got for
us? We're not talking about

60
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.100
the Tony Robbins make more
money by buying real estate.

61
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.320
You know, this is more
of a small, small victories

62
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.450
here, right? What's that guy
who was up at two

63
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.180
in the morning, placing tiny
little ads in my one

64
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.060
bedroom apartment and newspapers all
over the country. You know,

65
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.040
this isn't that kind of
life hack. This is about

66
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.870
organization. One of them is
called 43 folders. 43 folders

67
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.770
is a technique from David.
Allen's getting things done. Book

68
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.690
that book is at, at
amazon@ashrinker.com slash FAJ. This is

69
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.140
the kind of the Bible
for the personal organizers. Now

70
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.960
this is the Covey book
for the 21st century. And

71
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.810
David Allen has this technique called
43 folders. You basically get

72
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.190
43 Manila folders. You take
12 of them and label

73
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.510
them with the months and
you take 31 and label

74
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.300
them with the days, just
one, two, three, four, all

75
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.730
the way up to 31.
And you organize them in

76
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.540
a storage folder, in a
circular buffer. We've got a

77
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.030
technical audience. So I can
use terms like that. I

78
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.860
use more complicated term and
I explained it to my

79
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.080
wife and you, the, the,
the, the numbers represent like,

80
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.690
say, this is the 15th.
You would take a, this

81
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.220
is the 15th at what
is actually today. What is,

82
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.680
this is the 22nd of
23rd of May, 20, 22nd of May. 22nd of May. Yeah.

83
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.740
Part of being a life
hacker doesn't involve knowing the

84
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.450
day. Of course I can
tell that that's not a

85
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.030
big part of my life.
Okay. So it's the 22nd of May.

86
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.570
So PDAs are for exactly.
So I would take my

87
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.680
folders labeled 23 to 30
days has September, April, June,

88
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.240
November. I would take my
23 to 31 those days.

89
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.820
I would put them in
front of may and then

90
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.380
as to be in front
of June, rather because June

91
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.120
is the next month. And
then on the other side

92
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.870
of June, I would put
numbers one through 22 and

93
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.550
then get it. So every
day you're moving a folder.

94
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.770
Exactly. So every day you
move a folder to the

95
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.620
back. And so you've always
got this window of 31

96
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.320
days, and then beyond those,
you've got all the other

97
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.200
months. So for example, I've
got a speaking tour. I

98
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.660
got to go on an
October. So I need to

99
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.360
remember to get on that.
So I stick all that

100
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.820
stuff in October. So as
I move these circular folders

101
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.330
through their daily machinations, I
am reminded of things. I

102
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.430
can put something as far
as 12 months in the

103
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.280
future. And I won't, I
won't forget it, Scott, what's

104
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.590
the I'm immediately thinking, you
know, I do this with

105
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.240
my PDA. What's the benefit?
Well, The benefit is that

106
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.690
a lot of people feel
that there's a certain visceral

107
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.410
satisfaction or a sense of
being more rooted when they

108
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.220
do what I call sinking
to paper. Sometimes I just

109
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.520
can't look at that three
by five PDA screen and

110
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.360
really get the big picture,
You know? And there's other,

111
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.820
there's the other thing too,
where sometimes you may have

112
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.550
set am instead of PM.
You might not have checked

113
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.730
off an alarm for the
right day. You know, there

114
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.670
are times when your technology
will fail. Yeah. Yeah. And

115
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.380
there's also physical things that
you can't put in a

116
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.860
PDA. Someone sends you actual
tickets or a credit card

117
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.070
that needs to be chopped
up or any number of

118
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.160
tickets to a play. There's
all these physical aspects of

119
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.500
things. Now, certainly you can
mirror these, these physical folders

120
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.740
in a, in a virtual
folder, but everything that I'm

121
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.480
describing is primarily physical, but
has a computerized component that

122
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.640
you could apply to it.
I call it sinking to

123
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.230
paper. When I get overwhelmed
at the end of the

124
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.750
week, I put everything on
paper so I can know

125
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.760
what's going on. My computer
could blow up tomorrow, but

126
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.410
I still have a pretty
good handle of what's in

127
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.780
my life. 43 folders.com has
also got a podcast, shrinker.com/fac,

128
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.120
and a that's a new
thing that they're doing. And

129
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.200
it's all about life hacking
and applying techniques to, to

130
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.220
make life a little easier.
All of a sudden our

131
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.660
listenership drops by 50% Rushes
to 44 weeks.com/podcasts. Another interesting

132
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.810
life hack that came up
is a funny thing that

133
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.200
you would probably not like
that's called the hipster. PDA.

134
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.680
This is basically a whole
pile of three by five

135
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.070
cards with a rubber band
around them. So you've got

136
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.820
a shiny new windows, mobile
device, but for those that

137
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.670
don't want it, maybe they're
Luddites. Maybe they just think

138
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.190
it's weird. They want a
sh a hipster PDA. You

139
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.970
can go to a, do
it yourself. planner.com. It's trickster.com/f

140
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.660
a E. And you can
download PDFs of these three

141
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.250
by five cards. They include
calendars, grocery lists. It's basically

142
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.450
a design your own PDA,
same size as a PDA

143
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.300
fits in your back pocket.
And you can refresh the

144
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.910
pages, throw them away, do
whatever you want. So you're

145
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.440
laughing, but this helps people,
man, there's official template By

146
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.080
the way, Miguel, Miguel Castro
is here right outside the

147
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.300
window, and he's laughing his
ass off. Listening to this.

148
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.690
I'll have to get him
one for his birthday. You

149
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.670
should, you should make them.
You can download the official

150
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.390
templates at <inaudible> dot com
slash FAF. Oh, there's a

151
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.580
few people I want to
give these to actually Hipster.

152
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.680
PDA is my friend. I'm
telling you, I also, we

153
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.890
talked about pocket mod. Remember
on a recent show, pocket

154
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.660
mod.com, pocket modest, a little
tiny foldable PDA from a

155
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.450
single piece of paper. I'm
thinking of making a pocket

156
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.240
modge with all of the
tech ed talks that I

157
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.910
want to go see, you
know, I think it's great

158
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.950
that people have these little
devices that lasts for two

159
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.050
or three hours and on
batteries. I used to have

160
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.520
one, but there's something to
be said for paper. And

161
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.870
I totally agree. You know,
You can't, I can't say

162
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.010
that loudly enough. I totally
agree. You could turn up

163
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.770
the gain here on the,
on the podcast. Yep. I

164
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.250
talked about some of my
personal systems of organization@shrinksor.com slash

165
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.970
F a H. How many,
how many emails do you

166
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.670
have in your inbox? In
my inbox at any one

167
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.510
time, I've actually let it
get up to 7,000 before

168
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.780
I've decided to flip, you
know, to highlight them all

169
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.760
and push the delete button.
And of course they go

170
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.440
to the deleted folder. Anyway.
I don't know why I

171
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.840
just don't delete them anyway,
Everything older than a week

172
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.390
and toss it. I've done
that before. Yeah. Do you

173
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.970
ever worry that there's some
crucial, you know, come pick

174
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.150
me up. It doesn't make
any sense that I hoard

175
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.590
them because anything that is
important goes into a calendar

176
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.190
entry or goes into, you
know, notes or, or an

177
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.460
alarm or something else. So
I just get lazy about

178
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.540
deleting him Paper or notebook
in your pocket. I don't

179
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.000
anymore. I used to, I
do everything on my PDA.

180
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.660
Now my PDA phone, my
Samsung, and it's always with

181
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.720
you always with, And that's,
that's really one of the

182
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.240
keys with these life hacks
is that this is about

183
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.690
developing positive habits. A life
hack is really just a

184
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.710
fancy, you know, a silly
blogging way of saying, take

185
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.420
a habit and make it
a good one. You know,

186
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.280
if you're going to develop
some habit, at least make

187
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.370
it a good habit. I
think keeping a, an alternate

188
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.650
brain with you at all
times, whether it be your

189
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.950
PDA or a hipster PDA,
or a piece of paper

190
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.160
is as a positive thing,
all the best comedians, all

191
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.110
the best presenters have a
piece of paper in their

192
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.900
pocket and a pen. And
they write down when their

193
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.110
great ideas happen. And I've
recently started doing that. Actually,

194
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.330
it's been actually a couple
of years now, but recently

195
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.920
in, in the, in my
life, like I wish I

196
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.670
would have figured it out
when I was 15. And

197
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.770
I, I also carry out
what's called a molar. Skeena

198
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.380
these are these little, I
call them the iPod of,

199
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.800
of a personal notebooks. You
can get these at <inaudible>

200
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.530
dot com slash F a
I, these are the little

201
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.990
notebooks that like Hemingway used
to carry around with him.

202
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.980
And I got turned on
to this by Omar Shaheen

203
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.130
who wrote a really cool
article about how the, the

204
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.000
Moschino rocked his world. It's
just a very nice tight,

205
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.840
well bound hardback book that
you can keep in your

206
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.930
pocket. And then you carry
the, the Fisher space pen.

207
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.720
Remember the space pen, right.
Was developed with all this

208
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.720
money in order to write
upside down, what are the

209
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.370
Russians do when they went
to space? They used the

210
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.740
pencil, Right? So if you
ever find yourself floating in

211
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.720
space and you have an
idea, you know, you can

212
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.900
whip out the book and
there you go. That was

213
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.470
fabulous. Thank you. So a
lot of these life facts

214
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.050
that you'll find out on
the net are I'm using

215
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.660
this molar. Skeena, they'll take,
they'll say, well, Oh, I

216
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.090
use mine this way. And
I put, you know, colored

217
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.640
tabs on it. And each
color means this. Or I

218
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.420
paste in posted notes. An
interesting life hack, a guy

219
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.170
used with a PostIt notes
was post-its as a task

220
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.450
focus tool. I personally have
a lot of trouble. When

221
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.070
I sit down, I've got
a lot of things to

222
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.790
focus on. I can't stick
with one. You know, I

223
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.860
was kind of the all
tab syndrome. You start all

224
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.690
tabbing around the next thing
you know, you're doing other

225
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:03.730
stuff. Yeah. He takes a,
this gentleman@shrinks.com slash FAO. He

226
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.430
takes a post it note
big one and in big

227
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.980
letters writes what he's working
on and sticks it to

228
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.800
his monitor. Huh? So he
sits there with his monitor

229
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.630
and a big note saying,
this is what you're supposed

230
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.310
to be working on. Is
this, Is he add Kenny,

231
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.420
remember from one minute to
the next, what he's supposed

232
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.700
to be doing? Or so
what are we talking about?

233
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.670
So What the, the general
idea here is that the

234
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.790
internet makes us have add,
right. You know, not the

235
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.390
formalized clinical definition, but it
is an enabler. I mean,

236
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.120
there's, there's even utilities you
can get that will not

237
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.400
allow you to run any
program except the one you're

238
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.960
supposed to be. Right. Hang
on a second. I'm getting

239
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.580
a call on my cell
phone right now. I'm sorry.

240
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:49.440
Okay. Nice reminder. I just
pushed. No, she's, I'm sorry.

241
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.030
This is supposed to be
a serious show and they'll

242
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.250
fluff. What am I doing?
Yeah, we're wasting time. We're

243
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.050
going to have to compress
that whole thing and double

244
00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:00.030
speed at the chipmunks. So
just, that's just an example.

245
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.220
Here's where, where a guy
puts on his blog that

246
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.950
I use this to make
my life work a little

247
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.910
smoother. These aren't, these aren't
big changes, but it might

248
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.010
be as simple as you
know, I forget my keys

249
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.990
all the time. Right? Some
people just accept that they

250
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.600
forget their keys or from
a programmer type of a

251
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.820
point of view, you would
sit down and say, what

252
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.010
is it that causes me
to keep forgetting my keys?

253
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.340
I always forget my blood
sugar meter. So what I

254
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.470
started doing was I have
a stack on the kitchen

255
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.960
counter of the three, you
know, my Blackberry, my keys,

256
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.420
my blood sugar meter, every
single night, before I go

257
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.280
to bed, that's where they
are. Right. They never get

258
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.180
forgotten. Right? So hacking your
life is really, this is

259
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.240
the interesting part. It's about
willpower, right? Because in anything

260
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.010
that you do, whether it
be weight or diabetes or

261
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.710
programming, or staying on focus
or remembering to bring home

262
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.550
milk and bread, it's 95%,
do you have the will

263
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.460
to do this? Right? And
what life hacking is is

264
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.750
doing is it's giving someone
a physical crutch, you know,

265
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.920
in crutch, in quotes, being
a good thing where someone

266
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.310
can focus on something. Like
if you have an email

267
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.450
inbox of 7,000 items and
it bothers you, right, there

268
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.330
are half a dozen, two
dozen life hacks out there

269
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.180
on how you can manage
that from getting things done

270
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.610
is outlook. Addins, that'll help
you do that. Now, Scott,

271
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.740
there's a couple of things
you mentioned that I'm not

272
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.090
sure if we mentioned shrink
stirs for one is Omar.

273
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.880
Check-ins a thing on the
Mola. Skeena did we mention

274
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.060
the shrink stir on that?
Yeah. That's at shrink stir.com/fap.

275
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.390
And this is about how
this little, this little notebook

276
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.830
and pan changed how Omar
juggles is very complicated job

277
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.130
working for Microsoft. And the,
the other one is the

278
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.030
official templates for the DIY
planner. Yeah. We did mention

279
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:50.190
those at shrinker.com/faf FAF. Yeah.
And you can buy Moleskines

280
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.540
anywhere. You can go borders.
But the thing is to

281
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.270
go and just do a
Google search for life hack

282
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.420
and write down some things
in your life that maybe

283
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.330
aren't working out. And this
isn't like, Oh, I, you

284
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.100
know, I wish I was
hugged more as a child

285
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.300
type of thing. This isn't
that kind of hack. This

286
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.000
might be I procrastinate or
I have trouble stay on

287
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.060
focus at work, or I
am a writer. And I

288
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.370
can't, I can't find something
to write about. Yeah. And

289
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.190
I think you would agree
that people would much rather

290
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.600
be self motivated than motivated
by other people. You know,

291
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.380
the drill Sergeant comes to
mind or just the, the

292
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.020
nag, you know, the nag
roommate are the, you know,

293
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.510
the mother-in-law or the mother
or the father or whatever.

294
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.120
Nobody wants to be nagged.
So, you know, it's good

295
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.240
to develop these skills so
that you, you are your

296
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.150
own motivator. Yeah. And it
also comes down to defining

297
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.220
tasks. I think we all
have a file called to

298
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.830
do dot text on our,
on our desktop. Or we

299
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.770
use the tasks and outlook
and people will sometimes write

300
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.640
down very vague tasks. They
might write down, spend more

301
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.880
time with my spouse. That's
always in the other or

302
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.730
someday kind of file. And
that's not an action item.

303
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.450
Right. Okay. That's a vague
project. Well, you know, go

304
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.230
hiking next Saturday would be
a next action. A lot

305
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.840
of these life hacks are
focused on getting you to

306
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.090
think about the very next
thing that needs to be

307
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.990
done. You know, you might
want to do a refinance,

308
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.810
your house, that's a project.
That's not a task. You

309
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.330
know, Mark Hammond, right? You, you
introduced me to Mark Hamman.

310
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.570
Sure. He told me about
assist system and I'm sure

311
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.340
you're gonna remember it. And
you might even have it

312
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.890
on your list here, but
a system of organization that

313
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.190
you can even do on
paper, which basically revolves around

314
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.560
being efficient in terms of
laying out your tasks that

315
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.870
you're going to do. For
example, if two of your

316
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:42.070
tasks for the day involve,
you know, the same shopping

317
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.320
center in the same area,
you want to lump those

318
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.410
two things together versus doing
the, you know, and do

319
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.480
them at the same time,
rather than one on Monday

320
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.480
and one on Wednesday. Right?
So getting things done has

321
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.750
this notion of context. So
you would write down all

322
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.150
of the different places in
your life. You know, at

323
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.710
home, you put like an
outside in front of them

324
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.040
at home, at work, getting
things done. Does this getting

325
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.800
things done? Is it one
technique? I mean, there's dozens

326
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.350
out there, but getting things
done recognizes that there are

327
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.620
vague projects. There are next
action items and there are

328
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.370
contexts. So when you next,
find yourself sitting in your

329
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.010
car, you would look at
your notebook and say, Oh,

330
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.520
at car has these six
things right now, the thing

331
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.170
of the tiddly Wiki that
we mentioned a couple of

332
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.290
shows ago that getting things
done, tiddly Wiki is a

333
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:29.770
client side, Wiki that has
all this information written out

334
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.610
for you with suggested places
and contexts. I've got ones

335
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.660
like at home, at work,
in my car shopping. So

336
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.840
if I come upon an
office Depot in my travels,

337
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.250
I might look at my
thing and say, Oh, I

338
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.230
need to buy ink. And
you spend, what about an

339
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.560
hour, a week planning? You
know, less than that, basically

340
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.220
every week, like on Sunday
nights is a good time

341
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.740
or a Friday evenings. But
personally I find Sunday nights,

342
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.270
you basically defrag your life.
You write down all the

343
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.020
things in your life that
are open projects. It might

344
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.770
be every, I mean, every
single thing that you have

345
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.860
open, anything that's causing any
kind of psychic weight in

346
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.500
your life. I need to
get the outside of the

347
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.040
house pressure washed, right? That's
a project. The very next

348
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.950
action might be, find the
number for the guy, right?

349
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.770
The next action, after that
would be call the guy.

350
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.980
Then the next action would
be, get permission from my

351
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.590
wife to pay the guy.
You know? So those are

352
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.560
all actions underneath the project.
But what happens is we

353
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.110
put these projects on a
list, get the house pressure

354
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.420
washed, and it sits there
and it goes forward and

355
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.360
forward. And then six months,
nine months goes by. But

356
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.810
with this next action idea,
you could say, I have

357
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.230
a context called at calls,
right? Like when I'm sitting

358
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.270
in front of a phone
at any point, I could

359
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.930
make this call so that
the task switching from project

360
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.420
to project can be very
painful. Right? Cause right. The

361
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.000
optimal number of threads in
any one is, is one.

362
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.730
Hmm. Right? The optimal number,
you know, one multitasks, they

363
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.030
just spend less time on
stuff. So I'm picking up

364
00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.520
two things here. I'm picking
up the term life hacks

365
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.830
and I'm picking up, getting
things done are the two

366
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.850
absolutely related to each other
or is getting things done.

367
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.910
One methodology of a life
hack. Yeah. I would say

368
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.090
getting things done as an
organizational methodology or loss, you

369
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.760
know, Stephen Covey and the
seven habits of highly effective

370
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.970
people, getting things done is
one that recognizes that people

371
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.520
work on a great deal
of information at one time.

372
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.490
And that it doesn't actually
call out a difference between

373
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.970
life and work. Yeah. Life
is life. You have a

374
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.330
pile of stuff. There's not
this notion of a work

375
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.940
stuff and life stuff. There's
just projects that are going

376
00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.670
on. Now. People who are
interested in getting things done

377
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.180
often find themselves getting stoked
about life hacks. And they

378
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.870
say, wow, this organized my
desk and my life and

379
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.210
my projects. And I got
so much more done. What

380
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.330
else could I do? Could
I read more effectively? Another

381
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.150
example of a life hack
that someone who does getting

382
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.150
things done might decide to
use would be the notion

383
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.900
of time maps, time map,
an example would be at

384
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.190
shrinker.com/fau. You might do these
for your kids, where you

385
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.660
have a list of, you
know, where they're going to

386
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.440
be at school at home
at soccer chores. A lot

387
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.360
of people don't really know
what they're doing with their

388
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.820
time. And some people will
ask me, well, how do

389
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.040
you find the time to
do blogging and watch TV

390
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.870
and hang out with your
kid and go to work.

391
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.000
And that I think anyone
Who's ever listened to this

392
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.270
podcast or read your blog,
ask those same questions. And

393
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.040
the way that you do
it is, you know what

394
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.140
you're doing at every hour
of every day. Not, and

395
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.000
again, this doesn't, you know,
it doesn't work for everybody,

396
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.090
but to know that you
have six hours free on

397
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.640
Saturday, but you know, if
you woke up two hours

398
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.370
earlier, you'd have eight hours.
Do you ever feel crushed?

399
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.520
Like you're under the weight
of some sort of psychic

400
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:46.280
cosmic, you know, Jack boot,
taskmaster, which is your brain.

401
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.130
Do you ever just want,
turn it off and say,

402
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.220
eh, time to time to
forget about all this right

403
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.370
now? I do that though.
And I think everyone should

404
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.530
do that. I do feel
like that. Sometimes when I

405
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.350
do that, I sync to
paper. I take everything in

406
00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.070
my life. I find out
what's both urgent and important.

407
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.130
Now that's a Covey type
thing, right? The Covey quadrants

408
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:10.140
urgent important, neither urgent, nor
important, simply urgent and simply

409
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.470
important. Sometimes people find themselves
doing things that are urgent

410
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.150
and they get crushed. But
do you ever have a

411
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.310
beer first before you do
that? I mean, you know

412
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.950
what I'm saying? I have
a caffeine free diet Coke.

413
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.940
You know what I mean?
No, no. I get overwhelmed.

414
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.650
I figure out if I'm
working on things that are

415
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.740
really important versus things that
are artificially important, but this

416
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.390
is why we, this is
why we go to Africa

417
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.180
every year, you know, but
the whole Blackberry in Zimbabwe,

418
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.930
so you go and you
chill and you, you know,

419
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.000
I lose 15 pounds and
I relax and then I

420
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.680
come back and I'm ready
to do my thing. You

421
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.440
unplugged from the collective. Yeah.
We're going to Tanzania in

422
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.270
December. Awesome. And everyone should
unplug at some point, but

423
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.250
even the ability to be
able to do that, to

424
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.110
know that you're proud, you
don't just leave your projects

425
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.670
up in the air. Right.
You need to plan for

426
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.280
that kind of, that kind
of thing. You know, and

427
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.440
actually this is a little
a schizophrenia of me, but

428
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.600
speaking of maps, there's some
pretty cool stuff that I

429
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.410
found on like Google maps
and virtual earth and map

430
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.200
packs that were online. There's
a, there's a company called

431
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.640
fresh logic studios that has
taken, you know, Atlas, the

432
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.950
asp.net, Ajax, API, and Microsoft
virtual earth. And they've come

433
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.660
up with a, an API
for you to send GPS

434
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.590
data from any device and
they'll dynamically map it. So

435
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.960
like you have a funky
phone with the GPS or

436
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.220
whatever. Well, the thing is
The thing about the GPS

437
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.310
in my phone is that
it doesn't work as a

438
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.030
location device only for nine
11 calls. Right. Is there

439
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.460
any way to get ahold
of that programmatically? I don't

440
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.060
know. I don't see anything.
These guys, We've got a,

441
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.600
a mobile API for the
dotnet compact framework@shrinks.com slash FAQ.

442
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.630
You know, I know in
mobile five, 5.0, there is

443
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.510
stuff for the GPS, but
That's it then. So what

444
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.940
they've got is a way
for you to talk via

445
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.120
web services to their backend.
And, you know, if you,

446
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.630
or, you know, one of
your minions, the Franklin minions

447
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.880
had one of these phones,
you could see where they

448
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.970
were on a, on a
map dynamically with Ajax. Wow.

449
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.670
And they've got this whole
API and it's a, it's

450
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.760
an interesting, it's built entirely
on virtual earth, but you

451
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.330
know, the virtual earth API
and the virtual birth website

452
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.740
is, it's just not quite
as shiny as Google maps.

453
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:24.000
Yeah. But the, the, the
graphics they have, the, the,

454
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.910
the, the quality of their
photographs is really quite nice.

455
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.890
Hmm. So these guys have
built an entire alternative UI

456
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:36.090
on top of Google maps.
So there's a really great

457
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.390
picture of the space needle
and go to shrink, stir.com/f

458
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.230
a T. And that will
take you into their API.

459
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.940
They're, they're retrieving information virtual
earth, but they're going to

460
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.700
have like overlays of gas
prices. You can see a

461
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.810
map of where the cheapest
gas is, wifi locations. The

462
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.120
potential for map packs is
huge. And a lot of

463
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.520
the, the map hacking work
that's been going on has

464
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.410
been kind of hacky because
you guys have a very

465
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.230
nice API on top of
that. And it's definitely worth

466
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.520
checking out kind of Like
the dotnet rocks road trip

467
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.760
page. Yeah, exactly. You probably
work pretty hard on that

468
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.830
page to make that work.
I didn't, but dr. Neil

469
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:15.220
Rudin did in his guy
Complicated stuff to get that

470
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.220
real time updating these guys
are much, you know, simplifying

471
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.920
it where your device would
just make a call and

472
00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.440
they would handle everything else
for you. Yeah. That was

473
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:29.350
great. Cool stuff. That's fresh

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.920
Okay. Scott, before we go,
there's something else that we

475
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.850
were talking about, flowcharts for
GTD for getting things done,

476
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.640
Right? Getting things done has
a very interesting and fairly

477
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.660
simple flow chartable process on
how you would decide whether

478
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.480
or not to do an
action or to file something

479
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.180
away. There's also the notion
of a daily review and

480
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.000
a weekly review. That can
be a little confusing sometimes,

481
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.200
but there's some very nice
getting things done. diagrams@shrinks.com slash

482
00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.410
F a w that kind
of give you an idea

483
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.500
of how one would go
through that kind of daily

484
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.370
flow and processing the things
in their personal inbox. So

485
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.460
what would you say in
closing to somebody who's thinking,

486
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.650
you know, I don't have
time to look into this

487
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:15.280
kind of stuff and, you
know, learn some new methodology

488
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.310
blahblahblah to organize my life.
I just don't have time

489
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.820
to do it. You know,
it's this It's like saying

490
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.300
to the person who deploys
their website by opening to

491
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.600
Explorer, windows, and dragging files
from here to there. I

492
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.880
just have no time to
write a batch file, but

493
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.100
you still have time to
drag those files from left

494
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.710
to, right. You know, if
you do something more than

495
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.820
once automated, we that's, that's
the mantra in the programming

496
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.090
world, in the computer world,
but somehow people in their

497
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.880
lives continue to make mistakes
over and over and over

498
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.330
again. I think mistakes are
important. Repeating mistakes, I don't

499
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.090
think is important. Yeah. So
I would say you all

500
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.560
kind of owe it to
yourself, whether it be this

501
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.370
technique or some other technique
to identify the aspects of

502
00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.350
your life, that you're not
happy with, you know, you

503
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.820
don't want to smoke, you
don't want to, like, for

504
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.100
example, a there's candy at
the front desk at my

505
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.910
office. And, and I just
can't, you know, Right. You're

506
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.090
diabetic. You can't touch it,
But it's, Reese's pieces, man.

507
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.760
They're free, you know, I
mean, who turns down free

508
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.530
pie? It's just the, you
don't do it. So what

509
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.050
do I do? I use
the back entrance. Yeah. I

510
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.470
stopped going through the front
door. That's a simple thing,

511
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.450
but you just make it
a habit. Right. And then

512
00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.860
if I don't go to
the front entrance, I'm not

513
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.800
going to eat the candy.
Yeah. That's just one example.

514
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.780
But if there's something in
your life, that's not working,

515
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.320
do something different. What's the
definition of insanity, right. Doing

516
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.410
something over and over and
expecting a different result. So

517
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.520
it is simply the, the
will to make the change.

518
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.950
That is important, I think.
And I think your point

519
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.670
is well taken about not
having time. It's precisely because

520
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.980
you don't have time to
waste that you want to

521
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.400
make your time, that you
do things with as efficient

522
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.590
as possible. And I, and
I do, I would just

523
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.540
start small. I think getting
things done as a way

524
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.330
to do it, you know,
pick a religion, whatever it

525
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.290
is and be excited about
it. Cool. Well, I'm going

526
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.400
to look into it myself
and I can't wait. Can't

527
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.230
wait to talk to you
next week, Scott. Thanks for

528
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.350
letting me share. Absolutely. Thanks
again. And we'll see you

529
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:17.880
next week on handsome. <inaudible>.
