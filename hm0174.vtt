applications. online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this episode
of Hansel minutia, Scott talks

7
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.490
with Richard Campbell. This has got
handsome when you're listening to

8
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.880
Hansel minutes with me. Today
is Scott Hanselman. Hi Scott.

9
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.990
Hi Scott. How are you,
Scott? I'm well, you a,

10
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.320
your voice has changed. Yeah,
I've gotten older and wiser

11
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.820
and Canadian. Now you're just
making fun of me. Well,

12
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.520
that's true. Richard Campbell. Thank you
so much for coming on

13
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.190
the show for another episode
of Hansel minutia with Richard Campbell.

14
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.980
Always a pleasure, sir. Very
cool. Someone told me once

15
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.570
on Twitter that they were
getting tired of putting the

16
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.390
word Hansel in front of
stuff. They think that, that

17
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.640
I think they think it's
a little overplayed and I

18
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.730
think it is hilarious. It's
my revenge for being called

19
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.620
Hansel dork in high school.
Now we've got some, we're

20
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.110
listening to some Hansel minutes
and, and you got me

21
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.170
logged into a very cool
tool that I've never heard

22
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.170
of before called ether pad.
Yeah. Yeah. I, you know,

23
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.760
I'm a remote worker, so
I'm always trying to do

24
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.730
things remotely, right. And I
spent a lot of time

25
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.670
in notepad or notepad plus
or plus plus, or notepad

26
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.550
too. And I always end
up trying to share my

27
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.100
notepad to somebody because what
I really want is to

28
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.980
be able to just do
multi-person editing and what this

29
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.500
is is called ether pad
either like ether, net, but

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.400
ETA G R pad. So
I've got an ether pad

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.950
where you and I can
both basically hit the same

32
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.250
website at a very easy
to remember URL and we

33
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.430
can be editing and it'll
automatically highlight our text. So

34
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.820
it's some of the multi
multi-person editors of the past,

35
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.760
except with a web and
Ajax twist. So we're looking

36
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.250
at our notes for today's
show here on the ether

37
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.500
pad. And I think it's
great. And as a remote

38
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.900
worker, it's going to make
collaboration a lot easier, especially

39
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.810
for brainstorming. I've done a
lot of brainstorming with one

40
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.100
note. I don't know if
you've ever played with that.

41
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.840
We throw one out up
on the projector and you

42
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.270
can actually have two people
connected to the same document

43
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.740
at the same time. One
guy's the host and the

44
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.150
other, one's sort of a
guess you can do that

45
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.190
and you can type to
each other. But the problem

46
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.500
was whenever we were brainstorming,
we always insist that everyone

47
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.130
participates. So no secretaries are
allowed. Oh, I like that.

48
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.830
And so whoever was there
always needed to be two

49
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.140
people taking notes so that
if one person that's one

50
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.570
of the persons that could
take notes, wanted to contribute,

51
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.600
there was somebody else to
take those notes. Is it

52
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.980
limited to two people? Or
you said you can have

53
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.990
unlimited, as far as I
know, it's limited to two

54
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.640
people. Cause it's just sort
of a free thing that

55
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.590
happens with two people who
have a OneNote account. They

56
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.970
can, they can just connect
Up and both contribute to

57
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.590
the thing, but, and it
works over the internet or

58
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.860
it's an, it was an
intra within the network kind

59
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.840
of thing. We'd have the
one note up on the

60
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.260
big screen as well, but
it was, I wouldn't function

61
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.570
without it. I'm surprised how
hooked I am. On one

62
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.060
note, all sh all my
show planning is done with

63
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.870
one note, Really I'm an
Evernote person and ever, and

64
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.690
I don't know what Evernote
is scandalous. So we all

65
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.070
know what one note is.
One note is the note

66
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.020
taking application that comes with
office. And it's been an

67
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.600
office since I think 2003,
it's had a lot of

68
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.060
upgrades and then it's even
shiny or an office 14,

69
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.860
but a Evernote is a
note taking application that has

70
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.640
kind of distinguished itself through
its ubiquity across platforms. So

71
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.490
there's any windows mobile version.
There's an iPhone version. There's

72
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.060
a very nice web version.
There are bookmarklets that you

73
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.790
can drag little JavaScript snippets
that you can drag into

74
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.020
the bookmarks of your, your
browser. And it's also got

75
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.930
some hotkeys, just a lot,
like one note, but it's,

76
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.170
it's synchronized into the cloud.
So it's like one note,

77
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.770
although one notes getting cloud
synchronization, but it's it. Everything

78
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.680
is stored in the cloud.
And it also doesn't just

79
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.660
have texts notes, but also
audio and picture notes. And

80
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.220
what's cool about the picture
notes is that you take

81
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.090
a picture of something and
somewhere magically, that information gets

82
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.860
OCR, optical character recognition gets
read by a computer. So

83
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.740
then when you go searching
for something, it'll find the

84
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.280
text and highlighted interest on
the picture itself. To me,

85
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.020
sounds like the sort of
claim to fame of this

86
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.110
app is snapping an image
with some device and then

87
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.930
having the OCR be searchable.
Exactly. And you know, the

88
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.200
person who told me about
this idea of snapping images

89
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.560
of everything was, was Scott,
Kate. He has a Sony

90
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.540
camera that he carries around
with him everywhere. And he

91
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.050
takes pictures of everything, everything,
yes, everything. He takes pictures

92
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.190
of receipts. He takes pictures
of the hotel bill, and

93
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.780
then he puts all that
stuff on the computer. Now

94
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.350
he's using a nice quality
camera when I can get

95
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.290
three, four and five megapixels
on a phone, then I'm

96
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.060
finally down to one device.
And if it's hooked up

97
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.920
to Evernote, this will be
a really nice way to,

98
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.960
you know, I'm looking at
a pile of paper here.

99
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.730
I'd love to take pictures
of these business cards and

100
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.980
different things and have the
most yard mail to search

101
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.010
for, And then get rid
of all the paper. Well,

102
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.020
yeah, isn't that funny? And
then file the paper away

103
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.750
for reference. Please Save me
a file. I file it

104
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.400
away effectively for garbage. Yeah.
Isn't it funny how I'm

105
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.780
starting to treat my life
like, like, like Gmail, where

106
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.450
it's like, there's an archive
button and it's my trashcan.

107
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.870
Yeah. Off it goes. Yeah,
exactly. Well, I know as

108
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.090
you know, when we built
the office, we put four

109
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.790
good size file drawers in
them and you know, they're

110
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.450
filled with files, no idea
what set of anymore. I

111
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.130
think we loaded them up
and we've never touched them.

112
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.550
You, the thing is though,
you never know, and this,

113
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.500
this is why my wife
handles this stuff for me.

114
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.740
She's the receipt keeper. And
I'm, you know, I never

115
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.110
take things back until I
totally need the receipt and

116
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.480
I'm taking something back. I
think I take one item

117
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.860
back to the store a
year and I need to

118
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.310
take this video game back.
And I have no idea

119
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.220
where it is. My wife
went directly to it. You

120
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.920
knew exactly where it was.
Apparently we keep everything. I

121
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.390
had no idea. She may
be pulling it out of

122
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.240
the trash and filing it
away. Yeah. She made me

123
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.070
just creating it on the
fly, but it doesn't matter.

124
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.880
It does what it's supposed
to do. So have you

125
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.120
been following any of the,
the, the portal stuff that

126
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.480
I'm been working on? I
have heard the phrase Hansel

127
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.020
portal Say now, because we're
going to lose listeners, Hansel

128
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.780
listeners. Can we Active X
portal? Could we just, you

129
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.790
know, switch up sub suit
on the term in that's

130
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.970
very popular. Ooh. This is
an interesting concept that you've

131
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.330
just invented is, is Hansel
as a prefix, the new

132
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.210
active Or the new.net. This
is what I think if

133
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.460
they're getting tired of it
it's for that reason. Well,

134
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.650
I think active X is
a good example. Is that

135
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.740
word that doesn't really mean
anything anymore? Absolutely. Like it

136
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.420
used to mean something and
it was like their entire

137
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.240
strategy and now it means
nothing. So apparently Hansel used

138
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.280
to mean something amazing and
wonderful. And now it's just

139
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.480
sad, like ActiveX. Wow. I
mean, there's been lots of

140
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.780
buzz phrases that Microsoft manufactured
over the years that just

141
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.620
remember, you know, windows DNA,
like what was that? It

142
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.420
just sort of went well,
you know, we tried to

143
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.680
make something go of it
and it just sort of

144
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.460
went away or when they
lived everything or they.net everything.

145
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.170
<inaudible>, That's why I like
MVC. Right. We didn't call

146
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.770
it asp.net super-duper version or
something. We just call it

147
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.810
NBC. Cause that's what it
was. Yeah. It's actually a

148
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.840
description of what it is.
It's nothing more, but least

149
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.820
where I think code names
stick around. Right? Like a

150
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.820
good code name is often
better than the product name.

151
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.340
It just won't go away.
Well like a story, the

152
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.270
greatest code name. I don't
know why, but it's mostly

153
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.260
because a product name is
dreadful A D o.net data

154
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.530
services for windows. You still
don't know what it is.

155
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.660
The thing thing you like
about a story is, you

156
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.480
know what it is, even
though it's not descriptive, you

157
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.660
know what it is Totally.
I need a code name

158
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.600
for my portal. I'm turning
my head here and I

159
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.840
can, I will, I've got
a machine set up where

160
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.370
I can see Phil hack
in his office and we're

161
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.260
calling it the Hansel port.
We have basically, we've dedicated

162
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.210
two machines to this, this
exercise. And I can see

163
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.970
Phil's, he's got actually two
people in his office. He's

164
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.510
got a, a cubicle mate
and we've set that machine

165
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.590
to automatically turn on. We've
got a video on it

166
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.440
and I can, I can
just kind of say, Hey,

167
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.570
Phil, what's going on? What
are you doing? So you're

168
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.970
just there all the time.
What's the app you're using

169
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.100
to create the book. Well,
in this case, we're using

170
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.400
Skype. And the reason is,
is that I couldn't figure

171
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.560
out a way with windows
live messenger to have it

172
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.210
automatically answer automatically go full
screen and be high Rez.

173
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.340
And Skype has the features
that will let you pick

174
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.640
up the phone and go
full screen. I'm considering using

175
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.020
office communicator, which is our
internal tool. Right. But it

176
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.460
would require me to be
logged in as me On

177
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.610
the, on the machine and
Phil's off On the machine.

178
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.270
And then the issue is
that that machine and Phil's

179
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.510
office is on the network.
Right? So I can't necessarily

180
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.190
have someone logged in as
me on a machine that

181
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.940
I can't control two miles
away. Yeah, no. So what

182
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.500
we're doing is we've got
a machine, we've got a

183
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.720
very weak user as if
you know, the kind of

184
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.640
the kind of user you
would set up. If you

185
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.520
were making a machine for
like a small child and

186
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.490
this small child is allowed
using the family safety features

187
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.990
in windows only to run
Skype. And the Skype account

188
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.270
is only allowed to talk
to one other Skype account.

189
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.240
So we've really locked the
machine down to basically it

190
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.780
can't do anything but run,
You know, I, I put

191
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.130
an HP touch Bart machine
into the kitchen. Oh, the

192
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.160
big 25 Disposable income that
you would just say, you

193
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.200
know, let's get a touch
smart machine. Cause he's posted

194
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.840
notes are really a hassle.
But one of the things

195
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.390
we've set up is, is
an auto connecting Skype for

196
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.030
exactly that reason. So that
when I'm on the road,

197
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.950
I can pretty much just
drop in and look into

198
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.520
the kitchen. That's wonderful and
creepy. It is kind of

199
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.980
wonderful and creepy, especially catching
my family at dinner. You

200
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.860
know, it's all like, hi
guys. Yep. It's funny that

201
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.210
you say that because I
think I mentioned this before

202
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.130
on the show, but one
time I did that where

203
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.590
the wife had left the
laptop on the kitchen and

204
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.690
my, my three year old
said, daddy, come out of

205
00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.230
the computer and have dinner.
That's brilliant. Oh man, Hey

206
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.200
kids come up with some
good one-liners actually, what is

207
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.760
it? You did you have
a site for this? Don't

208
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.670
you? I actually have a
whole site dedicated to my

209
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:11.780
kids and to your kids.
One-liners, it's called overheard@home.com. Right.

210
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.370
And I've also got a
Twitter account associated with it.

211
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.110
And yet people just go
to overheard at home, you

212
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.730
know, it's interesting. It hasn't
taken off the way I

213
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.280
thought it would. Cause it's
not like these other sites

214
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.430
where it's like, like, what
is it called? Fail blog.

215
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.890
You see in the fail
blog. Yes. Yeah. It's an

216
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.910
entire blog dedicated to things
failing horribly. Yup. That's that's

217
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.770
like, you know, what's the,
what's the word? Shedding, Florida.

218
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.830
Yep. That's the word. Right?
Taking the pleasure and the

219
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.800
failure of others. Exactly. It
seems like all of the

220
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.190
sites that succeed on the
net that are like crowdsource,

221
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.900
whether it be fail blog
or other sites, like it

222
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.200
are all dedicated, like, Oh,
what's the other one. Is

223
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.860
it awful? Family photos.com. Yeah.
I don't think I need

224
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.230
to know about that one.
Basically. It's just like all

225
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.600
those really horrible portraits that
you took in the nineties

226
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.870
of your family. These are
all sites dedicated to shedding

227
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.690
Florida. Well, overheard at home
is like kids say the

228
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.540
darndest things. Yeah. It's sweet.
So it's like, it's like,

229
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.730
it's like every few years
the newsman on the, you

230
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.570
know, the newsreader on the,
on the TV says, now

231
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.550
we're going to dedicate, you
know, 30 seconds of each

232
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.550
broadcast to good news. You
know, the rest of the,

233
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.070
the, the half hour of
news will be all about

234
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.290
death and destruction and bombs.
But, but at the end

235
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.710
here, we'll say yes, and
a flower grew in Brooklyn

236
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.530
today. And then of course
that always gets abandoned. Right.

237
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.180
So my side is the
same way. It's just full

238
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.900
of nothing but cute stories
of poop and babies and

239
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.390
no one visits it. So
See, I've got teenagers. So

240
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.030
the only thing there would
say is, Oh dad, and,

241
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.730
Oh my God, you're so
embarrassing me. Yeah. See, that

242
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.160
would not be a compelling
content. Not so much. Yeah.

243
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.140
I couldn't really build a
website around that. It explains

244
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.780
why soon my site overheard
at home will appear on

245
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.860
the failed blog As itself.
An example of a huge

246
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.280
failure. Yeah. There you nice.
See how we did that

247
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.870
full circle. That was beautiful.
Brought it all the way

248
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.460
around. I like that. I
like that. It's very nice.

249
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.960
I almost think we knew
what we were doing. So

250
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.270
in seven RTM. Yeah. It's
funny. I actually, I just

251
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.060
upgraded my portal to a,
to win seven RTM and

252
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.000
interestingly enough, it looks just
like the release candidate. So

253
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.370
yeah. Well, and I, of
course I'm on the outside.

254
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.860
I'm not in the inside,
like some people, so I

255
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.840
got to wait until I
think August 8th. So we're in

256
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.690
that terrible. I know it's
released I can't Habit. I

257
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.430
think when we realized this
show will become out on

258
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.710
August 7th. So you only have
to wait until tomorrow. So

259
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.740
feel good about that. I'm
feeling better already. Yeah. It's

260
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.900
funny though. I, I asked
my wife, I was like,

261
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.410
so can I upgrade your
laptop? And she's like, you

262
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.710
cannot touch my laptop. Yeah.
Get away. Yes. So I

263
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.240
it's the only machine in
the house it's gonna be

264
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.100
running Vista. And the only
reason is is that it

265
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.110
works fine. Yeah. You just
have to wait till it

266
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.860
breaks. Yeah, exactly. Which interestingly
enough, last night the wireless

267
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.200
stopped working on her machine,
but she's not blaming Microsoft.

268
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.220
She blames Dell. Okay. That's
fair. I think she should

269
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.830
blame Intel cause it's their
wireless chip, but either way

270
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.150
Now, what is it about
windows seven that has everyone

271
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.100
convinced that it's going to
be better than Vista? You

272
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.280
know, I did an interview
recently on run ass with

273
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.190
Mark Munich, Run as radio.
You're a podcast for those

274
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.740
people who don't listen to
it, who should Thank you.

275
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.160
And Menassey, as soon as
I started talking along, along

276
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.080
the lines of wind, 70
says, if you don't have

277
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.360
any empirical data about why
it's better, don't talk to

278
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.250
me about it. Cause I
didn't hate Vista and I

279
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.620
don't hate wind seven, but
I don't believe it. It's

280
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.480
better. So well Trying to
grab on to what is

281
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.190
it about wind seven? That's
actually better. Okay. So you

282
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.050
know how they say, this
is just me guessing I'm

283
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.730
making this up. You know
how they say that, you

284
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.030
know, the death by a
thousand cuts. Yep. Right. It's,

285
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.020
it's that there's a thousand
little tiny things that don't

286
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.440
poke you with a sharp
stick in the eye over

287
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.600
the course of your day.
Yeah. Like let me get

288
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.520
an example. I set up
my machine here and I

289
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.670
realized I needed to get
some clocks up for my

290
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.520
team because I don't know
the different time zones of

291
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.790
the various people in my
team. Okay. That's fair. I've

292
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.530
just, I've just installed windows.
I'm like, Oh, I need

293
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.780
it. I need some clocks.
Sorry. I mean like this

294
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.400
was a true story. So
I hit the start menu

295
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.430
and I type in clock
Oakland. And then it says,

296
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.090
add clocks for different time
zones. That's like the second

297
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.570
option. Swear to God. Wow.
Third option. Add the clock

298
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.650
gadget to the desktop fourth,
you know, another show or

299
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.860
hide clock icon on task
bar. Holy mackerel. Right. I

300
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.750
got a Vista box here.
I'm going to type clocks

301
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.460
in and see what it
tells you what happens. Okay.

302
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:30.330
This is good. Dan. I
have one. Yeah. Okay. So

303
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.220
I've got a bunch of,
I've got a bunch of

304
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.210
some web links sounds that
have the word clock in

305
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.620
them. Like the USB tube
clock. I have a couple

306
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.020
of files of Try typing
in Ram. All right. I

307
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.950
type in Ram. I see
show how much Ram is

308
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.190
on this computer. I see.
I Golf games. Nice. I

309
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.120
also see diagnose your computer's
memory problems. So these are

310
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.250
the kinds of things. That's
just housings of little things

311
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.770
like that. Like the troubleshooters,
I always love to give

312
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.990
the example of the troubleshooters.
What I do is I'll,

313
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.410
I'll, I'll I'll type in
troubleshoot and there's a whole

314
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.370
troubleshooting thing. And they're basically
these PowerShell packs that we'll

315
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.170
figure out all the kind
of stuff that I would

316
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.300
have to do for my
mom or my dad or

317
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.780
my cousin. He doesn't, for
me, one of them I

318
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.470
actually ended up using recently.
I couldn't figure out why

319
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.650
my audio wasn't working on
stage. I'm sitting there. Why

320
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.690
is y'all not working? So
I go to the troubleshooter

321
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.900
and I type, I click
on troubleshoot audio playback and

322
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.370
it goes, and it churns
for a while. And it

323
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:38.410
says, your speaker's not plugged
in. No kidding. Sorry. They've

324
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.750
got, you know, they can
tell if speakers are plugged

325
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.550
in or not. And another
time I did it and

326
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.290
it actually said, Oh, it
was, it was muted. I

327
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.070
un-muted it for you. That's
awesome. That's troubleshooters actually work

328
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.410
Troubleshooting. And what's great is
that they can be updated.

329
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.750
You can write your own
troubleshooters. So your ID, your

330
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.360
it department can package these
things out, these PowerShell packs

331
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.230
and, and, and, and send
them out and have troubleshooters

332
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:03.010
for your applications. Right? Yeah.
That's very cool. One of

333
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.780
the things that I noticed
about wind seven when I

334
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.280
was digging into this was,
was the network stack. And

335
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.560
I think that, I think
that the impact of the

336
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.500
replacement of the windows 2000
network stack, which is what

337
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.030
was in windows 2000, 2003,
2003, our two and XP,

338
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.850
they redid it for Vista.
And I think we've grossly

339
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.190
underestimated the impact that that
actually had. And one of

340
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.350
the big changes they made
in when seven, which I've

341
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.810
definitely seen examples of now,
because I've got a laptop

342
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.250
running windows seven, is it
Invista? If you suspended, when

343
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.280
you came back up, it
reinitialize the entire network stack

344
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.210
from scratch. So new IP,
new everything go renegotiate, everything,

345
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.940
just presume I'm in a
different world, start over. And

346
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.760
that's the big thing. There
is basically, you know, T's

347
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.400
that network stack owns your
machine, right? When it says

348
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.830
I'm busy for a minute
here, busy for a minute,

349
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.140
like there's nothing you can
do. Really. That's one of

350
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.300
the reasons I think outlook
just goes out the window

351
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.240
is that the Vista networks
doc would take off. Yeah.

352
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.280
It's frustrating how with putting
a single bite on the

353
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.830
wire is a blocking call
for a quad proc machine

354
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.260
with 12 gigs of Ram.
Yeah. It totally, you know,

355
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.590
it's just, it owns it
too much. And in wind

356
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.170
seven, they've changed that now
where they don't, they, they

357
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.500
make a much more progressive
failure of, do we still

358
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.170
have that SSI? D do
we still have this domain?

359
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.360
Like, so just give a
chance to stay where you

360
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.300
are so that you stay
responsive. It's funny that you

361
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.480
say that because another, another
example of something that is

362
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.700
a noticeably noticeably different, but
only because it sucks before

363
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.520
was that I always told
people that the difference between

364
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.380
a Mac and a windows
machine is that you can

365
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.830
close a Mac and trust
that it'll fall asleep. Yes.

366
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.810
But when you close a
windows machine, it's always like

367
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.330
trying to peek at the
light in your refrigerator and

368
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.620
you close it and then
you like open it and

369
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.360
close it. You open. Is
it going to sleep? Is

370
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.430
it going to say, you
know, that someone's running a

371
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.580
PC? Cause they get about,
you know, get down to

372
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.530
about 20 degrees or about
to close the thing and

373
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.410
then they wait, why haven't
you closed your laptop? Well,

374
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.150
I'm not sure. I'm not
sure what it's doing. I

375
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.160
mean, not shut down windows
seven. I can actually close

376
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.990
the laptop and feel confident
that it's not going to

377
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.740
freak out. Hey everybody, this
is Scott coming at you

378
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.500
from another place in time.
Summer is peaking. And our

379
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.930
friends at Tellerik are working
at full steam. They've just

380
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.260
released the Q2 volume of
the telework premium collection for.net.

381
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.320
The biggest release yet it's
packed with new things. That'll

382
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.270
excite anyone. Who's got to
do anything with that net

383
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.210
development, starting with Silverlight and
the introduction of the first

384
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.700
commercial 3d chart in the
market. It's developed as a

385
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.490
true vector 3d, which gives
you a nice performance enriched

386
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.050
capabilities with rotation and animations.
Also the Silverlight scheduler, which

387
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.240
is packed with even more
features in the first version.

388
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.250
Telerx flagship red controls for
asp.net. Ajax grows in this

389
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.680
release, not only with four
new controls, but also with

390
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.820
new productivity tools. There's the
new visual style builder, an

391
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.610
online application that allows you
to visually modify skins or

392
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.280
even design new ones with
just point and click. If

393
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.650
that's not enough, they've added
a completely new product, a

394
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:56.640
free testing framework powered by
art of test for automating

395
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.570
Ajax. And Silverlight rich internet
applications. I'm short on time.

396
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.160
So I can't give you
all the new features and

397
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.000
enhancements until our reporting open-access
RM or wind forms, but

398
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.300
I encourage you to check
out all of these products@tellerik.com.

399
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.370
Thanks. Yeah, I think we're
finally getting to the point

400
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:18.020
where the mobile stuff works.
Really? Yeah. It was worth

401
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:23.270
the 15 year. Wait, It's
been so hard. I mean,

402
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.360
still the other thing that's
fascinating to me here is

403
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.300
that are we really gonna
get to a 64 bit

404
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.000
desktop routine? Oh yeah. I
think we will. It's going

405
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.440
to be the next one.
I'm sure it will because

406
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.740
it's a 64 bit server
now, right? Windows server 2008.

407
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.110
Our two is 64 bit
only. Is that right? Well,

408
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.760
and as it should be,
there's no reason in the

409
00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.620
world not to make servers
64 bit, but desktops, I

410
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.650
think you still struggle a
bit with desktops behaving. Well,

411
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.700
do we need this? There's
so many applications. I think

412
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.800
that's the big thing with
servers is you could still

413
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.980
generally count on, on your
fingers. How many apps you

414
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.020
have on a given server.
And that's just not true

415
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.520
in a desktop machine. Yeah,
the, I of course the,

416
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.520
the, for me, the real
fence post here is office.

417
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.460
When office is 64 bit,
then I will believe, Well

418
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.500
there, you know, there is
a 64 bit office 14.

419
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.020
I've heard rumor to that
effect, but I have not

420
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.540
seen it or I've run
it. Okay. I have run

421
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.080
it, which is great because
it lets, lets outlook use

422
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.080
gigs of memory. It really
opens it up. The question

423
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.810
is, is outlook actually memory
constraint. Is that why it's

424
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.200
killing me? No, I'm kidding.
Yeah. We really need is

425
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.240
for it to have several
network stacks. Yeah. Oh yeah.

426
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.480
I don't know why I'll
look as I'll look as

427
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.620
is, has trouble because multithreading
is hard. Is what I,

428
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.900
I tend to agree. I'm
glad I'm I'm sorry. I

429
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.540
keep referencing other shows here.
But I think at the

430
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.130
end of a show, we
did a DNR with Jeff

431
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.390
rector. He made me fire
up task manager, throw the,

432
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.140
the threads on and then
sort by, you know, most

433
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.100
threads and outlook had 65
threads running. Yeah, that's fine.

434
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.740
Yeah. That's a lot of
threads. And then I thought,

435
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.600
and then my next thought
was, and apparently none of

436
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.440
them are for me. Oh
really? You don't get like

437
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.460
62 of them. Yeah. Well
it was off doing, it

438
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.230
was still that point where
I can't type email. Alright,

439
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.880
I'm going to do this
right now. I'm bringing up

440
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.920
the number of threads. Yeah,
this is good. There you

441
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:21.600
go. Outlook 55 office communicator,
47 MSN messenger, 40 Chrome,

442
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.000
25. It looks like being
on the network. Every, every

443
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.510
one of these is on
the network, iTunes 25. It

444
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:33.450
strikes me that developers are
reflexively throwing their network connection

445
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.600
off on its own thread
or two because they know

446
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.590
it's blocking and still somehow
they're getting blocked. See, I'm

447
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.110
looking down at the bottom
here, Kenny cures window clippings.

448
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.860
It's a screenshot application to
threads and I respect, I

449
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.640
respect Kenny that much more
now. Yeah. I only, he

450
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.250
needed my sticky note application.
The one that does my

451
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.270
post it to my screen,
eight threads. I think it's

452
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.940
time for a multithreading show
because I've seen some really

453
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.210
amazing stuff though. Coming in.net
four. It's going to make

454
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.950
threading a lot easier. You've
heard about like the parallel

455
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.680
extensions. Oh yeah. And the
transactional memory too. I'm excited

456
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.650
about that. All right. And
then the, the task task

457
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.400
factory, I've seen people write
really sophisticated multithreading code without

458
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.640
actually saying the word thread.
Nice. Which is pretty cool.

459
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.080
Well, I think this is
where we need to go.

460
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.410
We need to make this
more transparent to the regular

461
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.230
developer that it just, it
happens naturally. Describe what you

462
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:31.050
want to have happen. I'll
deal with the threads I

463
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.570
had meant to. Cause you've
talked about it several times,

464
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.030
but I've never really heard
the whole story of your

465
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.500
obsession around this arcade machine.
Yeah. I don't know. Basically

466
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.040
if it was, it was
less about the arcade machine

467
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.570
and more about a personal
declaration of become handy. Right?

468
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.240
You remember this, you were
actually using power tools and

469
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.850
keeping all your fingers. Yeah.
Well most of nine. I

470
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.160
mean you have, you have,
you have extra fingers, right?

471
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.190
That's why they're given 10
spares. Yeah. You could lose

472
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.770
three, four fingers and really
keep still, it'd be a

473
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.350
lot more productive. You use
less punctuation when you tight,

474
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.100
but you're still deeply productive
if you're you're my emails

475
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.230
start to look like E
Cummings poems for the four

476
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.610
people who got that reference.
But yeah, I, my father

477
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.280
is handy. I did a
show with my dad for

478
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.190
those listeners who have not
heard the legendary Scott interviews,

479
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.890
his dance show. And he
is one of these kind

480
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.880
of like, you know, you
know, he's a man with

481
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.850
like big beefy hands, like
bunches of bananas. You know

482
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.280
what I'm saying? Right. You
just like, you know how

483
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.650
you, you see basketball players
who can like Palm a

484
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.660
basketball and pick it up.
You know, he could do

485
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.460
that with your head. You
can like literally pick you

486
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.170
up by the top of
your head. I have a

487
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.530
pretty big head fingers like
bananas. So he's very handy.

488
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.040
My brother also is handy.
He lives on a farm.

489
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.030
He's always there's hay as
being thrown around and browse

490
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.430
or being wiped, just general
things that I'm not familiar

491
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.930
with. And I just said,
one day, you know, I'm

492
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.780
going to stop hiring handyman
and having people come over

493
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.480
and, and I, where I
pay them to emasculate me

494
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.530
in front of my family.
Cause that's effectively, that's what

495
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.240
it is. Right. You tell
yourself you're too busy, but

496
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.590
ultimately it's because you're not
handy. So I, I get

497
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.590
some power tools. And actually
my friend, John Bettendorf got

498
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.030
me, some introduced me to
a friend who gave me

499
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.560
some power tools. So I've
got the power tools with

500
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.170
batteries. You know, like you
always have like four batteries

501
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.380
and you're rotating the rechargeable
batteries, right? So we put

502
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.830
up a, a square foot
garden. I did 96 square

503
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.340
feet of gardening space. So
if you ever need a

504
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.010
ton of lettuce, we have,
we have more lettuce than

505
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.190
apparently really one thing of
lettuce is enough for a

506
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.180
family of four but 36
square feet of lettuce has

507
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.390
been much poor planning on
my part really well. Let's

508
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.340
just excite you to think
about lettuces that it grows

509
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.230
well, it's amazing how little
you need to put on

510
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.090
top of a taco. And
then the rest is like,

511
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.650
Oh, there's a head of
lettuce. We just threw away.

512
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.250
Anyway, it was wildly successful.
I made like all of

513
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.160
nine cuts with a circular
saw to make this thing

514
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.680
happen. And then I was
like, Oh, well I've done

515
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.020
this now. I've cut wood
nine times. It's time to

516
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.160
make an arcade machine. That
was like the clear transition

517
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.300
obviously. Yeah. From lettuce to
Firefox. Where else could I

518
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.060
have gone with that? Yeah.
So I was poking around

519
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.770
and I, I put together,
I basically, I was going

520
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.140
to build one. I got
this book called a project

521
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.110
arcade and it's a, it's
like a arcade games for

522
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.210
dummies thing. And it has
a PDF inside and I

523
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.560
was going to go and
cut all this wood. And

524
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.750
then I went on Craigslist
and found a guy who

525
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:30.110
had an old arcade machine.
That was not one that

526
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.180
you'd want to save it.
Wasn't like Pac-Man or donkey

527
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.200
Kong. It was video arcade,
trivia, something, you know, I

528
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.930
was not a classic. So
then I decided, what am

529
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.150
I going to go the
kit car way where I'm

530
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.560
going to build a porch,
but it's not really a

531
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.990
poorest it's just made of
plastic. And it's like running

532
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.750
on it like a Toyota
Tercel or do I go

533
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.060
and find a classic car
and, and revitalize it. So

534
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.730
I took the revitalization route
and I took this old

535
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.730
machine and I sanded it
down with an orbit sander

536
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.320
and I primed it and
painted it twice. And we

537
00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.600
hooked up the lights on
the coin slots so that

538
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.560
they would light up. I
felt very, very he one

539
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.990
Oh one about that. That
was thrilling. You know, you

540
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.630
need a resistor when you
do that. Discover it. Yeah.

541
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.300
I'm using buzzwords like that.
Oh, you're living on the

542
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.880
edge. Oh, I am. Okay.
The last thing I remember

543
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.520
at EA was I made
a digital clock when I

544
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.740
was like 19. And that
was pretty much the extent

545
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.230
of my knowledge around, you
know, I can say amps

546
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.420
and ohms and tell them
pretty much tell you what's

547
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.540
the difference between them. But
yeah, it was cool. I

548
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.310
put a computer in the
end of this box and

549
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.830
I hooked up a flat
screen monitor, and now I

550
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.560
can play doom or Bejeweled
or whatever the wife wants

551
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.800
to play. Basically. I've made
a computer case that looks

552
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.200
a lot like an arcade
machine. Yeah. It's like a

553
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.830
kiosk type machine. Really? Exactly
what it is. I've made

554
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.530
a kiosk. Yeah. Right. And
then, you know, and there's

555
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.800
a whole, you know, kind
of underground of people who

556
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.380
do like arcade games and
stuff. And there's that whole

557
00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.170
thing. There's a level of
crazy about arcade machines that

558
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.450
is kind of stunning. That's
what I love about the

559
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.580
internet. Every time I feel
like a weirdo, just go

560
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.550
online for a little while.
You know, you'll find people

561
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.800
way further out than you
ever thought you could go

562
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.470
really, even in water cooling.
And now I know I'm

563
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.210
obsessed about water cooling. I
found a guy who had

564
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.910
hooked up his pool to
coolest machines really. And I'm

565
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.560
like, I talked to him,
I sent him an email

566
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.360
and it just felt, made
me feel so much better.

567
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.490
Okay. Know, you're into that
water cooling stuff. That's so

568
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.130
scary to me. It's a
lot of cooling is good,

569
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.820
man. It's my, my computers
are cold. Quiet water cooling

570
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.520
is great until your, until
your computer is under water.

571
00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.940
Yeah. Well done that. You
have done that. Absolutely. See,

572
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.060
this is the seeding underbelly
of the water cooling community

573
00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.770
that you don't, you don't
hear about it. I would

574
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.330
not call it the seating
on their burial. Having had

575
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.610
a traffic water incident, not
a big deal. The real

576
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:48.380
seeding underbelly of water cooling
is a collapsed hoses. Suddenly

577
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.620
water won't pump anymore, a
occasional failed pump. But I

578
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.280
think the biggest thing is
the quarterly water top-up that

579
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.200
every three months or so,
I got to go around

580
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.390
and take the little caps
off my war's VARs. And

581
00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.960
top up with demineralized water,
You are topping up your

582
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.700
computer. I don't know. I
want to change the oil

583
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.800
on my computer. It's bad
enough that I opened the

584
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.290
thing every, you know, every
half decade and find that,

585
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.100
you know, dust bunnies have
decided to open up shop

586
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:15.200
inside the thing there's more
dust than there is computer

587
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.360
parts. I don't, I don't
think I want to change

588
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.460
the oil. I have no
dust in my machines at

589
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.830
all because I have no
fans in my machines. So

590
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.530
my machines are pristine and
clean, but I do have

591
00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.880
to pour water into them
on a routine basis. You're

592
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.370
going to have to speak
up. I can't hear you

593
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.200
over the sound of the
fans and the computers in

594
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.520
my office. It's serious. It's
like living inside a jet

595
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.580
engine. Yeah. Yeah. I know.
Well, and, and I, you

596
00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.640
know, I share my office
with my wife, right. Who

597
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.790
you've met and, and she
appreciates it. The fact that

598
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.610
the office is quiet. There's
just additional noise in here.

599
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:50.570
We just don't have any
fans. Wow. That's pretty slick.

600
00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:52.820
So there's, there's some value
there without a doubt. Yeah.

601
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.180
Do you have an arcade
machine? I do not. I

602
00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.330
don't have the arcade machine
obsession. I have certainly have,

603
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.080
I have friends who do
like Pac-Man restorations, which just

604
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.200
like the automobile type restorations.
They're obsessed with nothing but

605
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.670
original parts. And, and that
whole thing. And I got

606
00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.290
a friend who actually has
one of the original PAC

607
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.630
mans, which was a tabletop
machine, not an upright Oh

608
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.210
right. They're called cocktail machines.
Yeah. The cocktail machines. We

609
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.730
shouldn't the original ones and
yeah, no, he's, he's very

610
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.040
obsessed. It's a kind of
a, he's got a, he,

611
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:26.450
he built an outbuilding to
hold his arcade machine. Really?

612
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.330
That's cool. It is a
threshold once you've poured concrete

613
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.050
for your hobby, you're serious.
No. And that's funny, I'm

614
00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.330
actually thinking of pouring concrete
to make a little house

615
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.160
for the, for the boys
to play in. There you

616
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.530
go. I mean, I think
that they, you know, what,

617
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:43.570
what little kid doesn't deserve
a tiny house next to

618
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.610
your house that looks like
the same house, but smaller.

619
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.930
I think that's brilliant. Absolutely
brilliant. And then of course

620
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.830
you get to exercise this
handiness in building a structure

621
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.200
and doing the walls and
building a roof and all

622
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.690
of that good stuff. And
your kids get this great

623
00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.360
little house. Well, yeah. And
then they also remember their,

624
00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:06.810
their dad as being amazing
and having hands Somehow you

625
00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.340
will grow the banana fingers
on the way. Have you

626
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.810
considered the idea of the
banana fingers may be a

627
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.630
natural consequence of too much
hammering. I don't know. But

628
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:18.360
this man is, is, is,
he's probably 40% callous. You

629
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.350
know what I mean? It's
like, it's like, it's like,

630
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.780
it's almost like a personal
armor that, that, that like

631
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.710
guys over, over 60 get,
and when you shake their

632
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.140
hand and you know, you,
you know, you try, you

633
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.820
try to like, look them
straight in the eye and

634
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.440
give it a good squeeze
to, they don't think that

635
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.600
you're a wimp, you know,
but they can't even feel

636
00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.270
it through the calluses. Yeah.
But you've got my hand

637
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.940
seriously Quick computers. I got
to do something with my

638
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.890
hands. It's gotta be, I
want to be one of

639
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.290
those guys with like, with
a really cool story about

640
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.240
how I lost my ring
finger while I was, you

641
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.170
know, Nice because you never
hear. Yeah, man. I was

642
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.780
coding an APL man. And
it took the pinky right

643
00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.960
off. Look at that. You
know, nobody has that story

644
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.620
when they're, you know, not
so much because our, our,

645
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.110
our industry is based entirely
on, you know, the sin

646
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:04.740
of sex. I've, I've done
enough hardware work that I've

647
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.580
certainly drawn blood, you know,
blood on the rack. That

648
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.980
could be a book title,
You know, actually I've sliced

649
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.130
myself up. I'm pretty good
doing a, an opening up

650
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.620
cases and stuff that stuff's
like re razor in there.

651
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.440
But when you, when you
go looking for sympathy Yeah.

652
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.030
Not so much, you go
to the wife. Yeah, No,

653
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.010
I just cut myself. I'm
bleeding all over the computer.

654
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.850
What kind of idiot are
you? Well, you know, roofing

655
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.180
accidents somehow seem more manly,
Far more acceptable. Yeah. You're

656
00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.820
outside. And they don't mean
any way to mean to

657
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.900
excuse the, the ladies that
are listening as well, that

658
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.400
want to do their own,
I mean, manly in a

659
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.450
non gender specific. There you
go. Oh, that's possible. Okay.

660
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.760
I believe you you're handy
though. You do this stuff.

661
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.450
Yeah. I mean, I, I
done a lot of case

662
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.020
alterations and I'm pretty comfortable
fixing a dishwasher and that

663
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.720
sort of thing. But I
give up on the lawn.

664
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.490
The lawn was the one
where I mowed it for

665
00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.130
a year and then thought,
wow, for the price, for

666
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.230
the price of like a
quarter of an article, I

667
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.230
can have somebody do this
for me every year. Yeah.

668
00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.920
See, I'm deep into that
right now. I used to

669
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.110
have a guy that did
the lawn and now I

670
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:10.470
got a really great lawnmower
and I'm using it. I

671
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.240
think I'm going to mow
the lawn. It's the, it's

672
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.180
the, the killing of wasps
that I'm ready to outsource.

673
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.830
Right. Cause man, you want
to hear me scream like

674
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.700
a small child, you know,
have me notice a wasps

675
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.890
nest. That's what I don't
mess around like that. And

676
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.950
I'm going to outsource that
Completely. They, my general contractor

677
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.650
comes into the house the
other day, three days ago

678
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.530
or so, and just said,
Hey, you got any Benadryl?

679
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.210
And I'm like, yeah, I
got some Benadryl. Why Bob

680
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.550
says, I just got stung
a few times. I walked

681
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:41.370
into a wasp nest and
I'm kind of allergic. So

682
00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.890
if, yeah, if it's a
Benadryl, that'd be good. Otherwise

683
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.650
I gotta go to the
hospital. Wow. That's amazing. And

684
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.840
literally that comment, I'm like,
well, let me find that

685
00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.870
Benadryl quickly for you while
you puff up and dug

686
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.640
her out and said, nah,
you probably should go for

687
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.300
the double dose there. If
I got bit by a

688
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.190
bee or wasp or anything
like that, you would be

689
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.340
hearing about it for weeks.
So the kicker, so he

690
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.940
literally took the Benadryl, went
back to work, got stung

691
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.270
again the next day and
then found the wasp nest

692
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:14.020
and took it up. That's
Epic. Now these, these guys,

693
00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.610
you know, we, I don't
know that we can get

694
00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.100
there. Scott, we guys who
really work outside of here.

695
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.590
I don't think it's possible.
I think that there's a

696
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.510
special kind of individual who
can pull something like that

697
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.890
off. And I know that
that is not me and

698
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.340
that's okay, but I want
to find the equivalent wasps'

699
00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:32.170
nests story. You know, I
was in soft ice. Here

700
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.650
you go. I was deep
into ring zero. What's the

701
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.060
wash nest equivalent story. I
don't know. I've I recently

702
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.360
went through a serious debugging
cycle around a raid controller.

703
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.290
What happened if you care?
I don't know if you

704
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.690
know that. Well, only if
it ends with wasps or

705
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:53.530
Benadryl, <inaudible> be cursing. That's
all. Let's hear it. And

706
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.910
then we'll okay. We'll call
that a minutia. They didn't

707
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.850
adapt tech guy for a
long time. I had, I've

708
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.700
got probably half a dozen
different adaptive controllers in various

709
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.980
machines in the server closet.
Okay. So you're bugging your

710
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.320
rate controller I'm well, what
it was, I was building

711
00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.130
a new machine windows 2008
and the controller in question

712
00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.370
was a 26, 10, which
is, or 28, 10, which

713
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.620
is not brand new. It's
a couple of generations old

714
00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.010
and there are drivers built
into 2008 for it. But

715
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.230
adapt tech in their infinite
wisdom has chosen not to

716
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.250
make a client for it.
A client meaning an application

717
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.980
that allows you to edit
it. Yeah. Actually could figure

718
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.280
the rate array and so
forth, all that stuff. So

719
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.710
you have to do this
all in bios. What do

720
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.900
you mean by you mean
like hit, hit, hit, hit

721
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.120
the delete or hit F
two and go into their

722
00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.210
bios. Yeah, the control. Yeah.
Actually hit control a during

723
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.250
the BootUp sequence. And that
drops into the bios of

724
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.280
the controller to do the
configuration configuring, which is incredibly

725
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.560
annoying when you're actually, you
know, running a proper rack

726
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.470
closet where I don't have,
I don't normally physically access

727
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:53.170
the machine. It's a lot
15 feet away from me.

728
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.080
It's in a, it's an
air proof air conditioned, soundproof

729
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.030
closet. I don't want to
go over there. I want

730
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:59.230
to do it all from
here, but you have to

731
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.360
do it in the closet.
Cause you're, you're in bios

732
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.070
or I could go so
far as to set up

733
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:06.250
a serial access, but that's
just excessive. So there I

734
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.140
am, you know, messing around
with the bias start they

735
00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.390
build and I'm like, okay,
it's building, it'll be recognized.

736
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.280
Now it'll take a few
hours to finish building, but

737
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.270
I will just boot into
windows and it'll finish a

738
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.740
while. I'm setting other things
up and then drive letter

739
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.680
appears, everything works fine. You
start loading stuff onto it.

740
00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.680
It's slow. Of course. Cause
it's still building but nothing

741
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.900
bad. And the next morning
I come back, I, next

742
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.280
morning, I go check on
the machine thinking, you know,

743
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.010
that Raider that builds probably
finished by now. Let's just

744
00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.360
see how it is. And
when I get to the

745
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.820
machine and take a look
at it, the drive is

746
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:39.390
gone. It's just vanished. Really?
Hmm. That's not good. So

747
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.790
I can't look at the
array from windows cause there's

748
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.070
no clients. So I have
to go to them physically

749
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.140
to the machine, open up
the doors, stand in front

750
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.900
of the air conditioner, pull
up my KVM. So they,

751
00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:52.320
my one, you know, keyboard
and screen boot the machine

752
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.200
and, and watch the bio
screen come up and it

753
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.020
goes, Oh, there was a,
there's a, the, the array

754
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.470
has been compromised rebuilding like,
Oh, okay. You know, something

755
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.720
weird happened there. I'll just
let it rebuild. So I

756
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.170
finished the boot, go back
to windows, drive letters there

757
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.170
again, everything seems to be
okay, tinker around for a

758
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.780
while. Find this is fine.
Come back the next day.

759
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.520
Drive letters, go on again.
And if you've never noticed

760
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.070
how bad it is when
you don't have confidence in

761
00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.760
your servers, Well, this is
the thing. When, when, whenever

762
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.320
like I, you know, you
you've had this situation when

763
00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.440
you buy a machine, you
unpack it. You don't want

764
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.360
to use the default OSTP.
Maybe you want to put

765
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.420
something else. That's crazy on
it. Right? Yup. So then

766
00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.550
you, you run that new,
crazy thing. Like for an

767
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:34.700
example would be I buy
my wife a Dell before

768
00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.420
she, you know, gets wind
of it. I try to

769
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.720
put windows seven on the
thing, like early, early beta

770
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.440
window seven. Right? Nice thing.
You know, thing, reboots and

771
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.700
then blue screens. Okay. Now
at this point, because she's

772
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.800
seen a blue screen once,
even though I was running

773
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.240
some random daily build of
some random thing. Right. She

774
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.420
can't trust it. Yep. She's
seen it. Blue screen wants.

775
00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.390
And the earlier it blue
screens in the relationship that

776
00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.210
you have with this machine,
the less you trust it.

777
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.680
Yeah. Well, but plus one,
you know, it's just like

778
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.070
infidelity. Once you've blue screen,
once you can never go

779
00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.530
back, It's true. You can
never trust it. And then

780
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.530
you'll, you'll, you'll pull the
memory out and you'll remove

781
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.360
whatever you think that was.
But you'll never know. And

782
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.820
you'll always, you know, the
mouse you're happy I have

783
00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.110
at this. Have you ever
had it where you're moving

784
00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.390
the mouse and then it
freezes and then you throw

785
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.460
your hands up. Like you're
being arrested straight up in

786
00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.190
the air because getting your
hands off the mouse quickly

787
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:32.540
enough will prevent whatever that
coming blue screen Don't do

788
00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.400
it. Well. And we remember
this from windows three, one,

789
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.880
right. Where you could feel
the blue screen coming, right.

790
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.440
The machine would start behaving
a certain way. You're like,

791
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.750
Oh, I better save. Now
we're going to be going

792
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.200
down. Yup. Yup. Recommend you
use a disc flushing tool.

793
00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.220
You know, it's coming soon,
quick flush C flush, Flush

794
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.380
everything down, get ready. Cause
you're right. Get those right.

795
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:55.970
Cash is handled or you're
in trouble. So wrestling with

796
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.800
my Raider Ray crisis. I
had gone around a couple

797
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.170
of times now. So finally
I'm like, all right, I'm

798
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.030
not sure what's happening on
this rebuild cycle. Of course

799
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.950
it's a, it's a big
array. So it takes a

800
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:05.930
whole day to build. So
now I booted into the

801
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.440
bios. I leave it there
and actually wa let the

802
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.780
whole build go by and
walk away, come back. And

803
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:16.070
I come back and it's
finished the build. But instead

804
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.700
of saying, you know, a
hundred percent, it says process

805
00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:25.220
a card, Colonel stopped. That's
all it says, card. The

806
00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:28.970
Colonel stopped. Yeah. So you
panicked in the, in the

807
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.970
little firmware of this Card.
For some reason, the card

808
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.370
is decided it's no longer
running. Which of course, if

809
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.580
you did that, while machine
was actually up in windows,

810
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.580
the drive letter just goes
away. But as soon as

811
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.780
you hit, when you're in
the bio, as soon as

812
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.340
hit a key, it forces
a reboot on the machine,

813
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.960
which kicks the kernel back
on again. And then it

814
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.020
goes through the rebuild cycle.
So this was one of

815
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:51.220
those errors where it got
to a hundred percent and

816
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.070
then it would. So how
do you know it's them

817
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.560
though? Because I always assume
it's me, whatever it is,

818
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.660
It's still a note was
them, all I knew is

819
00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:59.970
now the, the Colonel on
the card was failing. So

820
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:03.090
first thing I'm thinking is
I've done something wrong. What

821
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.980
could it be? I've done
wrong. He still haven't fixed

822
00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.780
it. You just know it's
going through this whole build

823
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.410
cycle before it's failing. So
when after I went and

824
00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.600
checked to see if they'll
have the latest firmware, got

825
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.460
the latest firmware, they haven't
updated the firmware at all.

826
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.670
And go look at the
drive configuration that you sort

827
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:21.930
of chasing around all of
these little tidbits and came

828
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.580
to the conclusion that the
drives themselves were too large

829
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.850
for the controller. That seems
like something that your first

830
00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:33.840
web search would have found.
Right? Yup. See, the, the

831
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.380
error was actually the error.
When I searched on the

832
00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:40.050
totally generic error, it's an
error that's caused. The controller

833
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.150
has failed. And the error
was that we flipped the

834
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.790
overflow bit. When I actually
finished building the array and

835
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.740
went to write out the
value of the completed array.

836
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:51.240
It went, ah, this is
too big. Boom. Wow. So

837
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.670
I switched. It was a
raid five array that was

838
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.650
with over four terabytes and
I switched it to a

839
00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.910
raid 10 array that's okay.
And then it worked just

840
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:03.930
fine. Nothing to it. Of
course I've now summarized in

841
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.300
five minutes, something that took
me a week and much

842
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.300
cursing too. Well, you should
summarize it in a, in

843
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.090
a two word blog post
so that someone can find

844
00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:13.440
it the next time they
search for it. Because at

845
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.320
this point they're never going
to find No, they're not

846
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.120
going to find it. Well,
we, we should, we're going

847
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.310
to do a transfer. Right.
But they'll still screw it

848
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:21.840
up. I mean, they're gonna,
they're not gonna be able

849
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.470
to spell adapt tech, adapt
tech, even though right now,

850
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.360
we're actually having a conversation
at one way with the

851
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.510
transcriber. Yeah. We're talking to
Tresor. Here's how you spell

852
00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:36.120
it out. Tech. <inaudible> It's
difficult though. Yeah. It's not

853
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.610
an obvious falling, but it
also sort of, it's interesting

854
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.590
how adapt tech has set
us up. We should actually

855
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.990
replace that controller. That's the
real answer is you can't

856
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.110
trust it now. How would
I know now? Right. That

857
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.080
control is obviously overwhelmed by
terabyte hard drives. It needs

858
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.870
to be right Twice. You
know, terabytes. Just not that

859
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.360
big anymore. It's disturbing. Isn't
it? Well, yeah. I mean,

860
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.460
I've been shooting all this
HD video and I just,

861
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.320
I just did a thing
with Phil hack. I do,

862
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.930
I got 15 minutes. There's
a gig 15 video for

863
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.180
an eight and a gigabyte
of space. A terabyte is

864
00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.450
still a thousand of those,
A thousand, 15 minutes. Right?

865
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.190
This is what is it
like two seasons of Seinfeld

866
00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.660
who knows? I mean, that's
not a lot of space.

867
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.980
I've got 2.5 terabytes in
my windows home server. And

868
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.970
it's just, I'm feeling cramped,
feeling closed in. I am

869
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:26.520
uncomfortable. It's difficult. I collect
a lot of garbage, 250

870
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.670
hours, right? No, you're right.
That was a pretty long

871
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.920
time. That's a lot. That's
a lot of stuff, right?

872
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.670
That's 10 seasons. It is
all of Seinfeld. It really

873
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:39.940
is enabling hoarding, caught at
a cultural level. Like we

874
00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.850
were already, we're hoarders people
that collected too much stuff,

875
00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.450
collectors. And Same time we're
talking about everything's digital now.

876
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:49.120
So nothing's permanent. So, you
know, there'll be no record

877
00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.600
of anything we did. And
when they, when they archeology,

878
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.310
That's a good point. When
the archeologists dig up your

879
00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.750
hard drive, your they're going
to be like, Oh, the

880
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:59.950
raid controller doesn't handle drives
this size. Not the small.

881
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.650
I can't get this to
work. If only those, those

882
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.230
primitive peoples knew that an
adapt tech couldn't handle the

883
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:08.830
drive over a terabyte. Thank
goodness. Our advanced technology is

884
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:13.900
discovered Both the wife and
I are serious about resisting

885
00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.900
hoarding. We built a storage
room in the renovation with

886
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.600
the idea that when that
storage room is full and

887
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.670
you have more stuff to
put in it, throw something

888
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:25.330
away or give it away.
Like, that's it we're we

889
00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.330
live in fear of filling
our garage with stuff and

890
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.490
not parking cars in it.
And so we built a

891
00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.530
storage room for the purpose.
So you already said your

892
00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.450
solution was to build a
storage room. My wife, my

893
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.640
wife and my solution was
that if we haven't physically

894
00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.310
touched something in two years,
it goes away. We get

895
00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:40.750
rid of it. When I
say get rid of it.

896
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.910
I mean, we give it
away. Yeah. Give it away,

897
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:45.100
give it to charity something.
Well, that's what we've done

898
00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.470
with the storage room. Is
it accumulates that point? And

899
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.030
then when it is full,
you go through it and

900
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:51.160
say, you know, this is
still in the box. We

901
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.740
put it in. When we
moved here 10 years ago,

902
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.770
be sure we need it.
Yeah. That is pretty bad.

903
00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.610
That's pretty messed up. It's
funny. And I'm thinking the

904
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:03.010
same way with data, man.
It's just going through and

905
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:05.140
trying to keep that, keep
these things under control. How

906
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:09.010
many terabytes do you personally
need? Yeah, you really don't

907
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.480
need a lot. I mean,
if you, if you just

908
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.850
count video, it's really about
family photos. Right. You know,

909
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:14.530
I've talked about this before,
when I say that you

910
00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.980
should have an escape drive
when they say the house

911
00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.070
is on fire or whatever,
grab escape, drive and run,

912
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.210
you know? Yeah. Four gigs,
eight gigs, major family photos,

913
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.270
scans of your documents, scans
of all your ID, your

914
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:30.790
passport, all that kind of
stuff. Password, protect it with

915
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:34.450
true crypt and then run
And be able to walk

916
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:36.220
out the door. I actually,
I, the other day I

917
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.480
looked at the folder on
my server where every article

918
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.090
I ever written, all of
the original texts and so

919
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:48.430
forth with it, that's like
470 articles in 15 years,

920
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:53.200
150 mics. Right. Cause it's
just text it's text. Even,

921
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.950
even with the screenshots. It's
150 max scandalous. It's just,

922
00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.280
yeah. Just the stuff that's
actually important on these drives

923
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:04.660
is really small. Well, we're
not going to solve these

924
00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.380
problems today. Nope. So let's
leave it, leave it there.

925
00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.900
My friend. Okay. All right.
Well, this has been another

926
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.090
episode of Hansel minutes and
I write in this case

927
00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:16.450
Hanselman Nooshin with Canada. Yes,
it has been. It has

928
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.900
been. And it will be
again. Thanks. Alright. We'll see

929
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.590
you again. Next week. <inaudible>.
