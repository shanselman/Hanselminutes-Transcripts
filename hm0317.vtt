flight controller and current international
space station engineer, Holly Griffith.

10
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.170
This is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

11
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.320
minutes, and we've got on
the phone. Holly Griffith, who

12
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.540
is a flight controller. She
works at the Johnson space

13
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.990
center and she's done some,
some work in space and

14
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.220
the space shuttle. Thank you,
Holly, for being on the

15
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.170
call. So I hope you
forgive me. I've looked, I'm

16
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.120
looking at your LinkedIn and
I'm looking at every other

17
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.330
word is a word I
don't understand. And I thought

18
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.100
I was pretty technical and
I thought I was pretty

19
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.000
smart, but it, it reads
like a periodic table of

20
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.990
elements. I hope it's not
that bad. No, I just

21
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.260
think it was interesting because
I thought I was technical

22
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.390
and I thought I was
an engineer. And I'm really,

23
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.450
it's interesting when I look
at other people's industries to

24
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.240
kind of juxtapose the different
kinds of engineering. I mean,

25
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.980
you're, you're a mechanical engineer,
is that correct? And that's

26
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.610
your, that's your training and,
and what kind of work

27
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.340
have you done in mechanical
engineering as it relates directly

28
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.750
to things like space and
aerospace? So you're right. My,

29
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.170
my degree is mechanical engineering.
When I first got out

30
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.270
of college, I worked for
about nine months at a

31
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.050
small aeronautical company where we
would do some design work

32
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.420
for airplanes and things and
repairs. And then I, but

33
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.450
my goal has always been
C at NASA. So I

34
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.490
kept putting in my resume
and I finally got called

35
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.670
here. When I got hired
on here, I was actually

36
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.630
hired into the electrical power
system department for the space

37
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.370
shuttle. So I spent about
seven years doing more, more

38
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.870
electrical engineering, the mechanical, and
then just recently this past

39
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.110
August after the shuttle was
retired, I got hired into

40
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.450
the mechanical and maintenance group
for the international space station.

41
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.170
So now I'm back to
doing more mechanical engineering. Wow.

42
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.150
And you were the, you
were the lead power systems

43
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.450
officer for five shuttle missions.
And then you supported what

44
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.470
up to 19 different shuttle
missions. Is that correct? Yes.

45
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.810
I think, I think that's
all right. See, actually like

46
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.500
21. Yeah, 1920, 21 around
there. Wow. Okay. When, when

47
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.920
you were a mechanical engineer
by training, by by educational

48
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.020
training, and then you said
that you kind of moved

49
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.420
into, you went from maintenance,
you moved into electrical power

50
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.210
and you're moving around like
this. Are they ever saying,

51
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.950
Oh, well, you're going to
need to go get another

52
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.500
degree. I mean, how are
they confident that you would

53
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.760
be a good lead electrical
power systems officer? Well, when

54
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.490
I, when I was interviewing,
they did say, you know,

55
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.900
well, typically we, we like
to have an electrical person,

56
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.360
you know, a degree electrical
engineer in this position, but

57
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.380
really what it is is
it's the engineering background that

58
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.300
you know, that, you know,
how to think, even think

59
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.240
outside the box, you're a
good problem solver because if

60
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.020
you have that background, they
can teach you what you

61
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.340
need to know in terms
of that specific system. So,

62
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.370
you know, a lot of
times they prefer to have

63
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.560
the degree, you know, what
your degree is in. Then

64
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.410
you go into that system,
but that's not always the

65
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.240
case. So we'll have, you
know, when I was in

66
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.120
the electrical systems group, we
had other mechanical engineers, we

67
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.190
had aerospace engineers and we
had electrical engineers. And can

68
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.870
you tell them apart, I
mean, do they, in the

69
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.780
sense of, do they use
different terminology or do they,

70
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.940
do they, do you ever
talk to someone and you

71
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.620
say, wait a second. I
don't think this guy knows

72
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.280
the difference between ohms and
amps and what are we

73
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.040
gonna do about that? I
mean, what if someone has

74
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.150
a major gap in their
knowledge, Oh, well then that's

75
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.750
a different problem. That's a
different problem because, you know,

76
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.180
in engineering you have, you
know, even though I was

77
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.910
mechanical engineer, I had a
few circuits classes. So I

78
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.210
had to take electrical engineering
classes and the same thing

79
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.820
with the, you know, electrical
engineers, they have to take

80
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.840
thermodynamics. So you should have
that background. And if you,

81
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.090
if you don't, if, I
mean, if, if your knowledge,

82
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.490
you don't have that basic
knowledge and that's another problem,

83
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.520
you probably don't need to
be working on shuttle, But

84
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.010
you can't know everything though.
How do you keep track

85
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.420
of what you're supposed to
know and what you're not

86
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.280
supposed to know, because you're
working on such a large

87
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.790
system that I assume, arguably
as a system that no

88
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.480
one person can hold in
their brain. Right. You're right.

89
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.440
You're right. And that's why
we train for so long

90
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.320
to get up into the
front room to get fully

91
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.960
certified, to take about five
years of training. But yeah,

92
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.350
whenever we first get hired
on, they put the, literally

93
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.380
put the stack of on
our desks, you know, these

94
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.750
like workbooks and it's for
the first few months, you're

95
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.960
just reading. And so you
kind of get a grasp

96
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.850
of the system. And then
what they did was they

97
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.060
sent out to this thing
called training Academy. And that

98
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.210
was a couple months and
you go every day and

99
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.310
they would teach these classes
and it was over all

100
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.500
the systems of the shuttle
and the, and the station,

101
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.510
but it was still kind
of basic, but it was

102
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.490
just gave you a big
overview of how all the

103
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.270
systems work. Then after training
Academy come back and we

104
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.990
would have these things called
fcts, which is flight controller

105
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.240
trainers. And you would have
an instructor and you would

106
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.160
be in front of a
computer and you would see,

107
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.980
you know, simulated data that
you would see on console.

108
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.400
And they would just put
failures in. And so, you

109
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.650
know, you would, you're still
learning about your system, but

110
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.230
as you learned, you know,
the failure modes that could

111
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.230
happen, you're also learning your
system then as well, and

112
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.890
how to handle, you know,
common failures or more basic

113
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.770
failures. And then after you
had done that for awhile,

114
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.470
and you would actually start
stemming on console where you

115
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.320
have the whole flight control
team, the flight director, and

116
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.020
the crew is up in
the simulator and we have

117
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.930
a whole training team and
they just throw failures at

118
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.480
the team. And that's when
you start really working with

119
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.200
the other people who are
on console and you see

120
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.390
how the groups interact and
how, you know, how the

121
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.450
failure in their system would
impact your system and vice

122
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.990
versa. And so it's just,
you know, these five controller

123
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.840
trainers, you would have two
or three a week since

124
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.820
you would do two or
three a week. And so

125
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.760
you're literally bleeding for awhile
just in this constant training

126
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.100
environment. And so doing that,
you know, but you still

127
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.020
can never know everything about
your system. You know, we

128
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.450
still have failures, aren't on
console where people are like,

129
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.810
what is this? I've never
seen it before. And so

130
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.090
that's when you, you know,
there's not just you and,

131
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.520
and the other person you're
working with it's, if you

132
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.950
have time, you know, that
that problem is solved by,

133
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.810
well, the next team comes
in and they look at

134
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.300
it and the next team
comes in. And then during

135
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.420
a flight, when they're on
console, we would have a

136
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.500
summer, which is the mission
evaluation room. And they would

137
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.550
be engineers. And that system
who they weren't on console,

138
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.820
but they helped design a
system or they would work

139
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.800
on it in other ways.
And so we would have

140
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.860
that whole engineering support team
behind us too. So it

141
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.680
wasn't just up to you
to know everything all at

142
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.030
once. It sounds so much,
I mean, forgive me for

143
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.920
the, I've only made it
seven minutes into the show

144
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.310
before the star Trek reference,
but this is some kind

145
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.280
of a Kobiashi Morrow kind
of simulation thing where it's

146
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.650
like, you know, they're going
to give him failures and

147
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.530
failures, and he's going to
refuse to allow the failure

148
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.700
of the simulation to affect
his, his outcome. I kept

149
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.220
hearing in what you were
talking about, failure, failure, failure.

150
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.630
You're trying to make as
many things go wrong before

151
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.070
the actual thing happens so
that nothing goes wrong, Right.

152
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.010
Or if it does go
wrong, you're, you know, you've

153
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.750
seen it before. And so
the Kobayashi Maru, those happened,

154
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.550
we did have Sims for
that would happen. Not very

155
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.060
often, if that happened, it
was not on purpose because

156
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.960
the point of, you know,
the training team was they

157
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.550
didn't want to put us
in that situation where, well,

158
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.220
no matter what we do,
we're, you know, we're, it's

159
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.060
not something really bad happened.
They wanted us to be

160
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.360
able to work through the
failures. And so if a

161
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.220
Kobayashi Maru situation happened, it
was done on accident where,

162
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.680
well, we just didn't realize,
you know, there's so many

163
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.780
failures deep at that point
that we didn't realize by

164
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.330
doing this, it would affect
this in a certain way.

165
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.900
And so we have a
debrief after every swim with

166
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.120
the crew and with the
training team. And that's something

167
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.500
that we would talk about,
but, you know, the point

168
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.090
of the seminar was not
only to help you learn

169
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.480
your system. It was also
to help you, you know,

170
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.240
especially the really high stress
stems was to be in

171
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.240
that environment as close as
you can mimic it. So

172
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.820
that if you got into
that situation on console, you

173
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.950
didn't just freak out and
run away or something, you

174
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.710
know, you were used to
having that stress. And so

175
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.780
you were used to being
able to sit down and

176
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.460
say, okay, what do I
need to do? You know,

177
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.160
this happened and almost go
into kind of a robot

178
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.990
mode. And that's what they
wanted. See, that's interesting too,

179
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.990
because that makes me think
about, about training and by

180
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.460
training. I don't mean basic
training, like the training of

181
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.780
going to college, but training
like Navy seal training when,

182
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.150
when someone's like, yes, and
then my training kicked in

183
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.970
and I just, my hands
were moving and my training.

184
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.490
Exactly, exactly. You know, Oh,
you see this failure where

185
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.470
you have to go to
this procedure and this step

186
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.660
and this procedure, and a
lot of times you would

187
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.030
have the page numbers or
the steps memorized because you

188
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.590
had done it so often.
And since That makes me

189
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.490
feel comforted, but it also
makes me feel a little

190
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.790
sad for my own industry,
because I'm trying to imagine

191
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.080
software engineers that come into
their job and are handed

192
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.180
a big, giant pile of
paper and said, you're going

193
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.740
to read for the next
three months to know our

194
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.460
systems inside and out, which
doesn't usually happen. And then

195
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.130
we're going to simulate failures
and make sure that, you

196
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.100
know, the system inside and
out, and we have a

197
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.580
tendency to assume everything's going
to work okay. Until it,

198
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.730
until it goes horribly bad.
If you found this to

199
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.360
be like a very intensely
professional group of people, I'm

200
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.700
kind of juxtaposing that our
groups are not all that

201
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.780
professional. We are. I mean,
yeah. Especially at work, we're

202
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.980
very professional. Most people who
are here have always wanted

203
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.440
to be here. So they,
there's a true passion about

204
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.140
what we do. So it's
not only about being professional

205
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.170
it's because you want things
to succeed. You want things

206
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.860
to go well, so that
does play into it too.

207
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.470
But when you know you,
a lot of times you

208
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.440
have this image of a
rocket scientist in a lab

209
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.480
blowing stuff up with, you
know, with a lab coat

210
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.260
and whatever. And it's, I
was actually kind of surprised

211
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.540
when I got here because
everyone is just, I mean,

212
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.790
they're normal people, you know,
we go out after work,

213
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:30.020
we have happy hours, we
celebrate birthdays on the weekends.

214
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.200
And, and so it's, you
know, pretty normal group of

215
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.530
people, but when we're at
work, yeah, it is, you

216
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.960
know, you do your job
and you get it done

217
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.140
and you do well. And
you know, you kind of

218
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.260
pulled the switch where I,
you know, when you need

219
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.660
to be professional and when
you need to buckle down

220
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.380
and say, okay, this is,
this is bad. Or, you

221
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.030
know, I really need to
focus on this because if

222
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.430
I don't do a good
job, then people die. Right.

223
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.430
Yeah. And that, that is
something that is different. I

224
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.850
mean, when we're stressed out
in software and we're, you

225
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.520
know, we're, maybe we're taking
a shopping cart and someone's

226
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.030
buying a book, we're not
saving babies. We're not in

227
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.100
surgery right now. And we're
certainly not flying the space

228
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.340
shuttle. So We do have
software engineers, you know, that

229
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.130
had to write the software
for the computers online and

230
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.980
for the simulators. And so
it's, you know, we do

231
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.290
have those people that they
need to do their jobs

232
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.610
correctly too. So, you know,
maybe your particular software engineering

233
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.710
job isn't like that, but
we do, we do have

234
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.210
plenty of programmers and software
engineers at NASA. Yeah. And

235
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.160
I assumed that they were,
and they, are they someone

236
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.410
that you interact with or
are they a group that

237
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.270
is nameless and faceless? No,
it wasn't faceless. I controllers

238
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.780
do interact with them. My
particular group that in so

239
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.090
much that we have, you
know, we have the data

240
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.960
processing system, the DPS group,
they interface with them more.

241
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.060
And then also the training
team, since they were working,

242
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.210
they would do the simulators.
They would work with them,

243
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.340
you know, to make sure
the code was correct. Whenever

244
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.090
we put in a failure
for, for a SIM that

245
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.760
that failure would join correctly
and you know, what would

246
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.720
affect the other systems correctly.
And so they interface with

247
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.850
them more, but know that
I wouldn't say they're nameless

248
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.990
and faceless. They're definitely an,
an active part of, you

249
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.930
know, helping us out in
the missions. That's, that's very

250
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.560
cool. Now the space shuttle
and some of the technology

251
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.310
behind it, isn't like super
cutting edge. Can you help

252
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.500
me understand what is cutting
edge and what isn't, because

253
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.290
I, when I see some
of your videos, I see

254
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.590
some older looking technologies and
older looking offices, and it

255
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.140
makes me wonder, are you
working on these things that

256
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.170
were built in the eighties
or, Yeah, well, the shuttle

257
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.830
was actually built in the
seventies. The station started to

258
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.590
be designed in the eighties
and, and some in the

259
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.890
nineties. And then, you know,
when the actual modules started

260
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.510
to go up in the
nineties, it, it's hard to

261
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.500
explain because here at ASC,
well, I'm an operations. So

262
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.200
you kind of don't have
a choice because these vehicles,

263
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.570
they take a long time
to design. They take a

264
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.730
long time to build, and
then they take a long

265
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.260
time to get ready to
fly. Cause you have to

266
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.210
make sure the training team's
ready yet to make sure

267
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.930
the flight control team's ready.
So it's not, it's not

268
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.900
a process where, you know,
you can say, Oh, this

269
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.450
is the latest cutting edge
technology. Well, it might be

270
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:26.280
today, but in 10 years,
it's not. So with the

271
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.150
manned space flight program, I
would say it's not so

272
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:35.250
much super cutting edge, but
with other areas, you know,

273
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.260
of research and things that
some of it's done here

274
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.510
at JSC, a lot of
it's spent out in California,

275
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.370
they're working on more cutting
edge technologies. I don't mean

276
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.590
to disparage by saying, you
know, cutting edge or not.

277
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.560
But I mean, reliability presumably
is more important than shine

278
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.810
and sparkliness, but the, but
the speed at which things

279
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.410
have developed and the improvements
in processing power. I mean,

280
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.710
I assume that my iPhone
has more power than the

281
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:07.970
original Apollo missions as far
as Rob MIPS. Yeah. When

282
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.000
can you take advantage of
that and are used, are

283
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.430
you, I assume you're using
the latest software and the

284
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.960
latest systems as appropriate. Like,
I guess there's a balance

285
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.720
between picking new technology and
picking the safest, most reliable

286
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.330
technology. Cause you can't have
a windows machine crash in

287
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.360
the middle of a space
shuttle flight. Exactly, exactly. And,

288
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.710
and so, yeah, that's true.
I mean, you know, for

289
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.240
the shuttle, we had certain
software for the station. The,

290
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.480
you know, we use certain
software, the next vehicle that's

291
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.790
being designed. I think they
are trying to do more,

292
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.900
maybe touch screen or you
know, more advanced technologies, but

293
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.830
they're still designing it. So
that's, what's out there now.

294
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.570
So that's what they want
to try to use. But,

295
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.870
you know, whenever it actually
flies, will there be something

296
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.800
different? I don't know. And
you manage the electrical power

297
00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.040
systems for the space shuttle.
So you're dealing with 30,

298
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.500
40 year old electrical systems.
But also I assume that

299
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.600
some of those pieces have
been replaced cause you've got

300
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.630
older wiring maybe, but then
you've got new lithium ion

301
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.920
battery technology all in the
same machine. Right. Right. Well,

302
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:18.040
so the shovel used fuel
cells and yeah, the fuel

303
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.580
cell technology has been around
for a long time, but

304
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.210
between flights that's, what was
good about shuttles shuttle would

305
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.480
come home, the orbiter would
return it's Kennedy space center

306
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.400
and you could, you know,
bring it somewhere and the

307
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.380
text would look at it.
And so yeah, if we

308
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.230
discovered a problem with the
wiring, then we would replace

309
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.140
some wiring, the fuel cells,
you know, they had a

310
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.390
lifetime on them, so a
certain amount of hours. And

311
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.460
then once they, as lone
that certain amount of hours,

312
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.490
then you replaced a fuel
cell. And then obviously if

313
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.180
the fuel cell had a
failure and in flight, these

314
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.930
would replace that fuel cell.
So, and that was, you

315
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.100
know, that was true of
every system. I mean, any,

316
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.070
any time something would go
wrong, whether it be the

317
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:02.350
environmental system or the communication
system, they would definitely go

318
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.090
and look at what the
problem was and then fix

319
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.970
it with new components, you
know, or replace whatever needed

320
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.300
to be replaced. Are you
involved in those kinds of

321
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.490
decisions? I mean, as a,
as a power systems person,

322
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.640
do you make suggestions or
is there someone else who

323
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.280
is deciding what new parts
are going to be introduced

324
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.370
into a, into a complicated
system like this? You could

325
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.990
make a suggestion, but really
that, you know, that decision

326
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.690
was made at the people
with a higher people at

327
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.510
a higher pay grade, because
it's not just up to

328
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.070
us. You know, you have
the vendors, you have the

329
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.260
people who make you make
the fuel cells. You know,

330
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.560
that's another contractor, that's not
NASA. So they're the experts

331
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.070
on the fuel cell itself.
We operate it, they design

332
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.860
it, build it. So whenever
there's a problem, you know,

333
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.170
we generally defer to them
like, okay, well, what do

334
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.910
you think? And then they
make a suggestion and we

335
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.710
look it from an operations
point of view. So it

336
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.230
kind of goes back and
forth. But for the most

337
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.790
part, it's their decision. I,
I noticed that you did

338
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.000
some work on a fuel
cell cooling problem that you

339
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.310
mentioned in your LinkedIn here,
where you got a performance

340
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.190
award. What was the problem
with the fuel cell during

341
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:11.900
STS one 27? So we,
he's trying to explain it

342
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.440
the best way here. Don't
dumb it down too much.

343
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.170
I I'll do my best.
Okay. So the fuel cell

344
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.070
has to say within a
thermal limit, right. It can't

345
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.220
get too hot and it
can't get hold. And so

346
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.910
if it, if it does,
then you have a problem

347
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.830
because floods, the fuel cell
or the fuel cell could

348
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.380
dry out and that's not
good. So we had gotten

349
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.220
into a situation where a
component wasn't functioning exactly as

350
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.350
we expected it to. And
the fuel cell was running

351
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.910
hotter than normal. And so
we, you know, this was

352
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.700
pre launch. And so that's
a big part of what

353
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.520
we do. You know, you
have this problem where on

354
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.370
the ground we want them
on. So there's, there is

355
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.790
pressure to launch. If there
is something wrong, we won't

356
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.320
do it. So, you know,
I don't want you to

357
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.930
think back like challenger, no,
we just have to go.

358
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.180
We have to go. No,
that's, the culture has changed

359
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.570
so much since then, but
there is still some pressure,

360
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.020
you know, you've invested a
lot of time and money

361
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.450
and you want, you know,
there's other people depending on

362
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.830
you. And so you want
to try to go up.

363
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.330
So we're looking at this
problem pretty much. And we

364
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.490
had, you know, we called
in our engineering people. We

365
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.580
had meetings the lore for
days and days and days.

366
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.100
And the finally we decided,
okay, you know, we have

367
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.570
three fuel cells. This problem,
we looking at it, you

368
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.690
know, we have some data
on it. We don't think

369
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.620
it'll get worse if it
does. We, it's not. And

370
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.710
it's the, crew's not in
danger because we have two

371
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.590
other fuel cells. And so
we can rely on them.

372
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.510
So at the end of
the day, we looked at

373
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.180
the data and, you know,
we looked at the history

374
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.190
of the fuel cell and
what we thought could happen.

375
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.860
And we mapped out every
failure scenario that we could

376
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.860
think of, you know, if
this, then this and this,

377
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.210
and we, you know, change
some things like the procedures,

378
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.280
see if those needed to
be changed at all. And

379
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.570
then at the end of
day, we were like, we

380
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.340
think we're okay to go.
And so we ended up

381
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:13.580
launching kind of ends in
a way on some things,

382
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.430
you know, that's when I
was talking about the Sims,

383
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.280
that's kinda what the SIM
team tries to do too,

384
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.090
is not necessarily Kobayashi Maru
scenario, but not every failure

385
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.430
you have is like, Oh,
well this failure, we do

386
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.350
this. We worked this step
in this procedure. And I

387
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.020
said, you know, a lot
of times they want to

388
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.380
test your gray area. You
know? Well, I don't know.

389
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.180
I see this big cause
he that, and then if

390
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.090
I do X, then Y
happens. And if, you know,

391
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.080
I do Y and Z
happens. So what is the

392
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.690
lesser of two evils? And
we have flight rules that

393
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.410
help guide us that tell
us how to operate in

394
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.440
flight. They don't, they definitely
don't cover areas to every

395
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.140
scenario because there's no way
you can think of everything.

396
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.040
But once you get into
one of those gray area

397
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.010
cases, then that's where you're
like, okay, I recommend we

398
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.800
do this. Here's my rationale.
You know, you pull out

399
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.350
a fight rule, you put,
pull out past flight data,

400
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.130
you pull out your engineering
experience. And that's what they

401
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.590
really that's. The point of
the sins is to get

402
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.930
in those scenarios and think
about what you're going to

403
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.120
do. And so that, you
know, that type of thinking,

404
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.920
which we had done that
in SIM, it's not for

405
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.820
this particular case, but in
other cases it helps that

406
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.100
thinking process of, you know,
like I said, you go

407
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.170
into that mode of, well,
I need to do this

408
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.520
and this and this, and
look at this data and

409
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.710
look at that data and
okay, here's what I think,

410
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.850
What did they end up
doing with that cell when

411
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.620
they come back, they replace
it or they just keep

412
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.590
it in that state at
some point, You know? I

413
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.980
think they, yeah, they replaced
that one. I think I

414
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.390
re yeah, I think they
do. I'm trying to think

415
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.090
back. That was a few
years ago, but once, you

416
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.250
know, we got on orbit
and it was okay. And,

417
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.810
but when they came, when
it came back down, I

418
00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.150
do think that they replaced
it, but I would need

419
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.030
to go check on that
to be sure, What kind

420
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.950
of fuel cells are they
like? What is the electrolyte

421
00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:01.740
substance for the fuel cell
It's potassium, hydroxide, Koh. And

422
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.630
is that something that is
a, at a high temp?

423
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.280
Is it a high temperature
fuel cell or is that

424
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.980
a Well, I mean, that's
just the electrolyte. Are you

425
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.660
talking about the actual cryogenics?
Okay. The hydrogen and oxygen.

426
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.900
So that's the fuel for
the fuel cell. So we

427
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.560
have hydrogen and cryogenic, hydrogen
and cryogenic oxygen. So they're

428
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.210
cats very cold and, but,
you know, higher pressures, they

429
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.030
go into the fuel cells
whenever they combine, you have

430
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:31.920
the reaction with the electrolyte
and that produces the power.

431
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.130
And then it also produces
water. So the, it would

432
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.490
drink the fuel cell water
and they had sure, you

433
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.720
know, not contaminated, completely pure
water to drink. And then

434
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.730
it would also produce heat.
And so that he would

435
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.760
go into the cooling loops
and the cooling loops would,

436
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.740
you know, take the heat
away. And then we had

437
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.620
the radiators and it would
go out and space, Right.

438
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.930
Rather than using the heat
to, I guess, heat their

439
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.320
living quarters. I presume it
creates far too much heat

440
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.940
for that purpose. Yeah. Yeah.
That was the electronics. And

441
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.980
they're produced a lot of
heat also. And so we

442
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.160
had a water loop and
we had Freon loops and

443
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.040
they would take that away.
And also Vinod, or I

444
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.820
shouldn't say vent, but radiated
out into space. And do

445
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.550
you think having worked so
much on fuel cells and

446
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.080
seeing them what they can
do and the idea that

447
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.410
someone can actually, you know,
drink the exhaust that that's

448
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.880
the way things are going
and we should be using

449
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.220
those and not running, running
around in Prius's and hybrid

450
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.250
cars. I mean, you know,
I don't feel like I'm

451
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.720
qualified enough to answer that
because I say that, yes,

452
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.040
I do think fuel cells
are a good way to

453
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.650
go, but I don't feel
like I know enough about

454
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.110
the other methods that are
out there. So make that

455
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:46.760
decision so well, I mean,
I, I just feel like

456
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.410
I don't, I'm not, I'm
not, I'm curious about your

457
00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.170
personal opinion. I didn't read
up. That would be a

458
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.590
great way to go, but
maybe I'm a little biased.

459
00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.560
Well, I'm sure you are
biased. Cause they weren't, they've

460
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.140
worked very well for what
you, for what you've accomplished.

461
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.470
Yeah. They were, they weren't
straight the fuel cells we

462
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.980
used, they really, we didn't
have many failures. They work

463
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.900
really good. And the failures
that we did have were

464
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.980
generally small, like, you know,
a flow meter, you know,

465
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.290
something that would measure the
flow rate of something, you

466
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.830
know, really just a transducer
who would go out or,

467
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.300
you know, so it wasn't
a problem with the fuel

468
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.270
cell itself per se, but
just something that gave you

469
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.910
more instrumentation, Changing direction a
little bit. Is this, is

470
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.710
this a 40 hour a
week job? It's just a

471
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.200
nine to five or is
this something that just, you're

472
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.090
always going a hundred hours
a week When we're a

473
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.790
no, and that's, that's actually,
that's a good question because

474
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.390
that's one of the aspects
of the job that I

475
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.060
really liked. I feel like
if it was just the

476
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.740
nine to five job every
day I would get bored,

477
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.030
but sometimes you'd have you
try to have two sons

478
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.480
a day. When we flagged
shuttle, you'd have an ass,

479
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.460
an entry sound, those would
be about four hours. And

480
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.870
then you would have an
orbit stone, which could be

481
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.460
seven to eight hours. So
you try to fit in

482
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.310
one orbit, one after an
entry every day. So sometimes

483
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.170
you would be there at
seven, you know, and get

484
00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.040
out at 12 with the
pre-brief and the debrief. And

485
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:17.410
then what You said seven
to 12 is that seven

486
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.720
to noon or seven Oh
seven to noon, I'm sorry.

487
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.450
Seven to noon. So it's
about five hours with, you

488
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.280
know, four hour SEM and
then you have a pre-brief

489
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.060
and debrief and then some
stems, you know, to let

490
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.930
the team reconfigure, everything started
to, he gets there at

491
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.530
about one. And you would
have the SEM from two

492
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:39.370
to 10. So you would
work from 2:00 PM to 10:00 PM

493
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.300
during flight. Now we had
to be there 24 hours

494
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.600
a day. She had three
teams. We would work nine

495
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.110
hours because we had a
handover before and after. So

496
00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.380
once he would be on,
then the next team would

497
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.050
come on, they would come
on an hour before that

498
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.840
shifts would in to, you
know, get handed over like,

499
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.400
well, this is what happened.
This is what we've been

500
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.680
doing, you know, just to
kind of get caught up

501
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.140
and then they would work
their shifts. And then the

502
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.750
next team would come on
an hour before they got

503
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:10.330
off. And you would do
the same thing. So you

504
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.530
can work midnight to 8:00 AM.
You could work nine to

505
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:19.180
five or nine to six.
You could work 6:00 PM to

506
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.210
3:00 AM. I mean, that was
just, that was all dependent

507
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:25.870
on orbital mechanics. You know,
when the shuttle launched where

508
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.610
the station, you know, but
you had to make that

509
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.790
decision based on this station's
orbit when the shuttle would

510
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.220
launch. And so, and then
every day that we would

511
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.460
delay that would get earlier
by about 25 minutes or

512
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.580
so. So you could start
out with a great shift

513
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.260
of, you know, not having
to come in until 10

514
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.260
o'clock in the morning, but
then if you have lot

515
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.930
of delays, you could be
coming in at six o'clock

516
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.420
in the morning. So it's
like, Oh, you know, you

517
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.320
had good hours, but now
you don't. So yeah, we

518
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.810
would work during flights. We
would work around the clock

519
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.480
seven days a week, you
know, event in matter, I

520
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.940
think I worked two or
three Thanksgivings in a row

521
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.470
for a few years because
you know, you can't stop

522
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.920
eating. It's like, Oh, it's
Christmas gotta come home. No,

523
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.250
it didn't work that way.
But it balances out. I

524
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:18.380
mean, you're not burning out.
Right. So then after the

525
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.090
flight would land, yeah. It's
kind of go, go, go

526
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.900
for about two weeks we're
average flights. And then once

527
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.940
you land, you know, everyone
kind of took some time

528
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.760
off because you had gotten
so many hours during the

529
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.970
flight that, you know, you
had vacation time that you

530
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.130
could kind of chill out
for a few days. Things

531
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.240
quieted down around GSE, and
then you would start getting

532
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.580
ready for the next flight,
which is probably in the

533
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.030
next few months to six,
three to six months. And

534
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.160
that's when you really start
your swimming and your training

535
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.040
for that flight. But, you
know, those days were definitely

536
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.500
not as hectic as whenever
we were flying. And so

537
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.420
if you're not on SIM,
then you're just in the

538
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.210
office and, you know, unless
there's a big issue going

539
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.280
on or you have to
work a big project and

540
00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.200
that could pretty much be
a nine to five job.

541
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.580
One of the things that
I wanted to ask you

542
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.620
is that I always knew
that I was kind of

543
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.110
geeky and I was always
taking things apart and putting

544
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.950
them back together. And I
don't know why disassembling the

545
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.710
toaster and reassembling the toaster
turned into a job at

546
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.040
Microsoft, but I'm just curious,
were you doing that kind

547
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.750
of stuff? Were you taking
things apart? Were you doing

548
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.230
rockets in the backyard when
you were five? I was

549
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:28.550
not. A lot of people
here were, I liked the

550
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.270
more sciency aspect of it
and that's why I think

551
00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.870
I really liked operations. I
just liked the operations part

552
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.150
B. Okay. It's kind of
built in. It's done now.

553
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.500
How do I work with
it? That just interests me

554
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.170
more. That's what I gravitated
to more of the research.

555
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.980
I did engineering because I
thought, you know, I've always

556
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.900
wanted to work here and
that's been my dream since

557
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.270
I was about four years
old. So I kind of

558
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.280
looked into, well, I want
to work at NASA. What

559
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.350
do I need to do
to work at NASA? Oh,

560
00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.920
engineering. And so I did
like my engineering classes, but

561
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.930
I was not the person
who was, you know, taking

562
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.900
my car apart or my
toaster or whatever it may

563
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:11.390
be and putting it back
together. Because you said you

564
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.330
knew this when you were
four or five. Yeah. I

565
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.510
have a picture of me
that my mom found. I

566
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.840
was actually two years old
and I'm standing there wearing

567
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.250
this Johnson space in our
shirts. And so I, I

568
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.060
don't know, maybe it started
back then maybe we had

569
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.950
just taken a trip to
Johnson space center and got

570
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.320
a shirt. But so I
like to say, see, this

571
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.170
is proof it started back
then, but yeah, really I

572
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.870
did start getting interested in
it when I was out

573
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.750
four or five, I was
reading it up, you know,

574
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.270
books, the picture books and
stuff on, and watching shows

575
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.350
on science fiction shows on
space and things like that.

576
00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.220
Now you're involved deeply in
the process. But did you

577
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.560
ever think about actually going
up or is there ever

578
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.750
an opportunity for someone who
works in the, in the

579
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.220
main room to go up
as well? We have had

580
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.000
at least one person, maybe
two controllers who became astronauts.

581
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.180
That is something I always
wanted to do. That was

582
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:11.010
my dream there's I don't
know. I think they may

583
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.290
have changed the role now,
but I had gotten LASIK

584
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.020
eye surgery. And so that
disqualified you, you know, kind

585
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.390
of from the get go,
but I just have a

586
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.690
bachelor's degree in engineering and
you get here and you

587
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.720
look at the astronaut bio's
and you're like, Oh my

588
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.040
God. Yeah. You know what?
I have to go back

589
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.620
to school for a really
long time and, you know,

590
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.770
get up to pee, either,
get a PhD or go

591
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:39.780
into the air force and
be a test pilot. So,

592
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.690
I mean, it is something
I would like to do.

593
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.760
I don't know if I'll
get to do it, maybe

594
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.180
now with other, you know,
commercial companies and space tourism

595
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.400
and things, you know, maybe
I'll get to do it

596
00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.360
one day, but not in
the near future, Figure out

597
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.310
what the right amount of
money. It would be like

598
00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.160
famous people were spending millions.
You know what? I spend

599
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:06.570
50 grand. Yeah. 50 grand,
I think about like, what's

600
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.490
the price point for, for
me going to space, you

601
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.400
know, like what's the amount
of money. All right. I'll,

602
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.200
I'll, I'll, I'll defer my
retirement. I'll pull up my

603
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.960
401k and go to space.
I can do that. I

604
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.690
don't know. I mean, I
know Russian was taking space

605
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.840
tourists to ISS for a
week and that was 20 million.

606
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.790
I think the, I think
Virgin galactic had said that

607
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.190
they could do it for
200,000, but that's just, you

608
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:30.810
kind of go up and
your waitlist for a few

609
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:35.610
minutes and then come back
down. So whenever other companies

610
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.490
actually start, if they start
doing the space tourism, I'm

611
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.340
not sure what the price
tag would be on that,

612
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.310
you know, there's a lot
of man, maybe it would

613
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.230
go down eventually, but I
don't think that's been set

614
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.040
up. Yeah. I've seen people
adding, I've seen a couple

615
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.630
of VCs and enrich people
on Twitter that I know

616
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.490
change their Twitter bios to
include Virgin galactic, astronaut number

617
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.580
600 and whatever. And I'm
like going to space. You're

618
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:07.710
kind of just going up
really high. Yeah. Yeah. But

619
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.410
I mean, I guess it's
better than nothing if it's

620
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.080
kind of the only show
in town right now, but

621
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.960
hopefully, you know, the other
companies really start coming up

622
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.080
to speed and it's, it
becomes more normal and more

623
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.450
of an option, you know?
And it's not, it doesn't

624
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.540
take your life savings to
do it. Yeah, exactly. I

625
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.170
don't know if I need
to have another mortgage Right.

626
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.470
In conclusion. I just wanted
to also point people to

627
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.170
the space Tweep society. Can
you say something about what

628
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:44.300
this Yeah. Society to society.org
is an organization for people

629
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.910
on Twitter and eat. You
don't have to be active

630
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.710
on Twitter. You just need
a Twitter, you need to

631
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.050
be, have a Twitter ID
and, you know, log into

632
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.250
Twitter because that's how the
account works is a website.

633
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.940
But a few years ago,
when Twitter was somewhat new

634
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.870
myself and some other people,
I noticed that there was

635
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.290
a big space community on
Twitter. And, and you know,

636
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.830
we're like, wow, we, we
all kind of follow each

637
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.620
other, but you know, maybe
this person would follow another

638
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.890
person. And you wouldn't know,
you know, you wouldn't really

639
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.080
know who to follow. This
was before Twitter was doing

640
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.810
a lot of the recommendations
and things. And so we

641
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.690
started the space, trace society,
and it's kind of a

642
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.180
place to go where if
you're on Twitter and you're

643
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.460
interested in space, you know,
you can find out and

644
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.240
you can meet new people
and, you know, follow people

645
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.640
who you wouldn't have otherwise
followed because you didn't know

646
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.950
about them. And before when
NASA started doing their tweet

647
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.970
up, we would actually have
our own spacesuit society thredUP's

648
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:45.830
as well. We did a
few of those. I never

649
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.440
got to attend because I
was always working at center

650
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.810
over here. So I couldn't
go, but it's just really

651
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.880
a place for people to
go, who are interested in

652
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.580
space and who are on
Twitter and, you know, likes

653
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.000
to talk about space and
light to, you know, that's

654
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.730
their passion and it's a
way to share it with

655
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:09.040
people. That's great. And you're
a founding member. I am.

656
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.460
I'm one of the founding
members. Yes. Ma'am, I'm actually

657
00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:18.460
at flying Jenny on Twitter.
She's, she's really the brains

658
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.160
and the workhorse behind the
operation she's she did a

659
00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.560
lot of stuff and it
was really her, her brain

660
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.860
child. So I helped out
where I could, but she's,

661
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.310
you know, she's very talented
in everything when it comes

662
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.820
to art, science, whatever. So
she actually designed her little

663
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.860
mascot is a little Twitter
bird, but with a space

664
00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.170
suit on. So we had
a contest to name him

665
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.170
and we named the Mico,
which is when you get

666
00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.870
up in space and, and
you you're, you know, you're

667
00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:49.300
finished, then the main engines
cut off. And so we

668
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.200
call it Nico main engine
cutoff. And it's, you know,

669
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.260
it's a popular call sign
whenever we get to that

670
00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.790
point in board that it's
like, you hit me go

671
00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.190
and it's Oh, okay. We
made it. We're done. We're

672
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.070
safe for now for the
app. We made it from

673
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.320
the asset portion of things.
So anyway, we're getting off

674
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:14.110
track mascots and I think
it's a very positive experience.

675
00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.480
It's fantastic. I will add
links to the space trip

676
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:24.400
society and your Twitter and
her Twitter. You mentioned as

677
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.980
well as a bit of
information about some of the

678
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.200
things that you've worked on.
Thanks so much for taking

679
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.240
the time to chat with
you today. Chat with you

680
00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.050
today. Thank you for having
me. It's been great. This

681
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.470
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and we'll see

682
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:45.480
you again next Week. <inaudible>.
