Mongo DB. At some point,
whether you're building an app

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.520
for millions of users, or
just figuring out your side

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.450
hustle, it's the most popular
non-relational database. Mongo DB is

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320

Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

13
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.630
This is another Hansel minutes
today. I'm talking with Danny

14
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.290
Dilbert. It's like a new
radio project and we are

15
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.130
both very excited about software
defined radio. And you found

16
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.140
me cause I was geeking
out about how great it

17
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.390
is. Yeah. I spend a
lot of time geeking out

18
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.880
about a software radio on
Twitter. So I was very

19
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.450
excited to see you do
the same. Yeah. Whenever someone

20
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.730
discovers a new kind of,
I'm calling it a new

21
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.010
hello world, you know, because
we spent all this time

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.410
teaching people how to do
hello world by them, you

23
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.710
know, outputting a text to
a console. And then we

24
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.230
wonder why, you know, why
is this 13 year old

25
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.840
child not excited about software?
We just said, hello world.

26
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.930
And a console. Isn't that
enough for you? Yeah. So

27
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.180
now I'm thinking maybe I
can teach them by plucking

28
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.850
signals off of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Yeah. It's it really

29
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.240
is an incredible demonstration of,
of technology and something you

30
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.420
like when you do it,
you immediately feel a huge

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.120
sense of achievement. So I
have to go and talk

32
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.470
to a bunch of kids
tomorrow. I'm going to talk

33
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.750
to 50 kids between 11
and 15. And I think

34
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.050
they have probably talked about
the electromagnetic spectrum or at

35
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.960
least they talked about visible
light. And I wanted to

36
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.890
understand that. So there's this
spectrum, there's electromagnetic waves in

37
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.140
this wide range of frequencies.
And on the one end,

38
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.950
you get frequencies that turn
you into the Hulk. Right.

39
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.340
And then the other other,
and you're what looking at

40
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.500
like, I dunno, black holes.
Talk to me about the

41
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.710
spectrum and what's in there,
right? Yeah. So as you

42
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.760
said, electronics, spectrum various from
what we would call for

43
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.600
zero Hertz would call it
DC. Sometimes I all the

44
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.670
way up to, I mean,
there's no, no end to

45
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.700
it. Right. But to give
you some example, optical light

46
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.230
is in the hundreds of
terahertz, whereas broadcast FM radio,

47
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.580
like, you know, that you
would listen to in your

48
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.510
car, for example, is in
the, you know, high, tens,

49
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.030
low hundreds of megahertz. So,
you know, several orders of,

50
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.250
Well below that. So it's,
it's really just this, this

51
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.870
huge range. And you know,
it contains everything from, you

52
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.510
know, the emissions from black
holes to, you know, the

53
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.200
signal that your car stereo
receives is wifi in there.

54
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.150
It's Bluetooth is yes. So
for, for the tech focused

55
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.810
out there, you know, it's
called the ism bands. And

56
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.000
those are what that means
is those are bands that

57
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.760
you were allowed to transmit
in without having a license.

58
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.540
So there are certain main,
most bands are protected. So

59
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.590
Verizon, for example, has to
sit, tell the FCC, Hey,

60
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.090
you know, we're going to
put up a cellular base

61
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.010
station and we're going to
transmit in this band. And

62
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.840
we expect all of our
users to be, you know,

63
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.750
at frequency X and had
to get a license for

64
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.590
that. Well, obviously you, Scott
Hanselman did not ask the

65
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.680
FCC for a license to
operate your wifi router. And

66
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.340
that's because your wifi router
works in this unlicensed ism

67
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.240
band. And right now the
wifi is typically around 2.4

68
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.270
gigahertz or 5.8 gigahertz, which
are two of the most

69
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.910
widely used ism bands. So
this is effectively real estate,

70
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.380
right? I mean, just like
we have the world and

71
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.510
they always say, they always
smile. My dad always says,

72
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.610
you know, invest in land
because they're not making any

73
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.710
more of it. Are they
making any more of this

74
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.450
real estate? No. So for,
for decades and own decades

75
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.420
for a couple of decades
now, sort of the wireless

76
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.000
world has been freaking out
about what's called the spectrum

77
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.930
crunch, which is, or spectrum
scarcity, which is everyone's running

78
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.460
out of spectrum. Right? So
the, the problem with extreme,

79
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.010
so different fruit, this is
let me know if I

80
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.230
sort of dive way too
deep here. Oh, I'll stop

81
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.000
you because I'm all right.
No, I'm right there with

82
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.920
you, but I get the
idea that there's this range.

83
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.420
Right. And I know that
there's a lot of stuff

84
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.090
that I'm thinking about. Like
what's the IPV six of

85
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.430
the electromagnetic spectrum. We're about
to run out of IP

86
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.560
addresses, let's fix it. What
do we do? And run

87
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.080
out of light. So yeah,
the first key thing to

88
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.700
understand is why the frequency
matters and it's because different

89
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.160
frequencies have different characteristics in
terms of propagation. And what,

90
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.170
by the way, what I
mean by that is when

91
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.570
you emit a signal at
a certain frequency, how it

92
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.520
gets from Plano, where you
transmitted it to, you know,

93
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.410
receive or somewhere else is
very different, depending on the

94
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.340
frequency at which it exists.
So as an example, something

95
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.870
at a V what we
would consider to be a

96
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.120
relatively low frequency, say a
10 megahertz, right? That those

97
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.510
low frequencies can actually, they
go very, very long distances.

98
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.410
So, you know, sometimes you
hear about amateur radio operators

99
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.130
who are bouncing signals off
of the moon, and then

100
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.450
to get them to the
other side of the world,

101
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.460
to talk to somebody on
the opposite side of the

102
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.000
world, you can do that
with low frequencies. You cannot

103
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.090
do that with much higher
frequencies because those higher frequencies

104
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.830
experience what we call attenuation,
which basically loss, you know,

105
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.770
power loss in the signal,
as it, as it moves

106
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.400
through space. Right. I just
had a moment. So I

107
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.740
have a 0.4 gigahertz and
a five gigahertz S I

108
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.290
D a wifi channel, and
to get 2.4 is, you

109
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.660
know, not super high bandwidth,
but it definitely goes out

110
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.320
into my backyard. And the
five gigahertz one is really,

111
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.410
really great and high speed,
but barely makes it to

112
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.980
the window. That's exactly right.
And that's exactly what you're

113
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.520
seeing is, you know, your
5.8 gigahertz band, you know,

114
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.800
it's twice, twice the frequency
of two point of your

115
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.220
2.4 gigahertz band. And it
does not propagate as far.

116
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.290
And so what we've seen
is with our existing technology,

117
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.740
we are constrained to, within
a certain band of, of

118
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.590
wireless frequencies that our consumer
electronic devices can, can work

119
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.790
out. So for there's kind
of, there's, there's two ways

120
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.810
to get more spectrum. Obviously
we can't invent more spectrum,

121
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.910
right? It, it, it is
a thing and you know,

122
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.960
it exists it's Oh, you
can't make any more, you

123
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.520
can't make any more numbers,
but you can add a

124
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.230
lot of decimal points. Exactly.
Right. So, you know, Fundamental

125
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.950
property of physics, actually, it's
one of the four fundamental

126
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.790
forces of the universe. So
two ways to get more

127
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.460
spectrum is you either use
what we have access to

128
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.960
more efficiently, or we go
up in frequency. So both

129
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.790
of those are technology problems
and, you know, it's everything

130
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.660
from, you know, faster processors
and more accurate what we

131
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.810
call analog to digital converters
or digital analog converters. They're

132
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.720
able to pluck it out
at a more fine grain,

133
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.350
like tweezers. That's exactly right.
All the way up to

134
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.370
like applying artificial intelligence, for
example, to figure out, okay,

135
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.090
how can I more effectively
share the spectrum with another

136
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.300
user? Interesting. It makes me
think about how I just

137
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.070
recently upgraded from 100 megabit
to gigabit ethernet, but it's

138
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.350
still going over the same
co-ax cable. And that's the

139
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.960
same collector cable that just
brought me like regular old

140
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.230
analog TV 20 years ago,
30 years ago. And I'm

141
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.690
trying to understand the cables,
the same cable. It's still

142
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.240
the same thing, but they've
shoved a lot more information

143
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.350
in that little pipe. Yeah.
And what's, what's really cool

144
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.800
is all of the physical
concepts that sort of define

145
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.890
how your wireless signal works,
like your wireless wifi signal.

146
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.800
It's the same thing. And
that in that twisted pair,

147
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.340
co-ax, they're all we have.
We call all of that

148
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.360
RF actually RF being radio-frequency.
So, you know, the, the

149
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.170
internet connection you're getting, you
know, through your cable is

150
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.870
an RF technology and your
wifi router is also an

151
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.330
RF technology. Just that one
happens to be wired and

152
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.820
what happens to be wireless
Really. Okay. So these are

153
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.540
all just vibrations of the
electric magnetic radiation, whether it

154
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.090
be through the air or
physically on a piece of

155
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.230
wire. That's exactly right. Invite
vibrations is a good, it's

156
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.010
a fairly good approximation, right?
It's like the deeper dive

157
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.640
would be amended at field
induces an electric field, which

158
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.350
induces a magnetic field, you
know, Hey, I'm going to

159
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.660
go ahead and go with
vibrations waves. Yeah, indeed. Yeah.

160
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.900
Now when you look at
this, at least when we

161
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.760
look at this in school
during the 10 minutes that

162
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.370
they talked to us about
this in high school, they

163
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.820
always like to talk about
the visible, the visible spectrum,

164
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.660
and, you know, depending on
what, what bar chart they

165
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.090
ended up showing you, they
always say, look how small

166
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.550
it is. Look, this is
visible physical, and this is

167
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.520
all the other stuff. Can
I take a software defined

168
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.550
radio and see light or
does as an SDR only

169
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.780
allow me to see certain
parts of the spectrum. So

170
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.110
it would certainly be possible
for someone to build a

171
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.770
software defined radio that worked
at optical frequencies. And that,

172
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.060
that kind of, that kind
of exists in the form

173
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.780
of like a fiber optic
transmissions, for example. But typically

174
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.050
when we talk about SDR,
we're talking about, you know,

175
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.620
sort of commercial off the
shelf software radio products, which

176
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.880
are usually between six gigahertz
and below, whereas optical light

177
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.150
again is at hundreds of
terahertz. So, you know, you

178
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.270
can go on Amazon and
spend 20 or $25. And,

179
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.290
you know, by owed a
low cost software, radio receiver,

180
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.420
you're not gonna find something
like that. That works at

181
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.990
optical frequencies. Okay. So I
went and went to Amazon

182
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.620
and I bought one for
$19 and it's so small.

183
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.710
It basically just looks like
an antenna and a USB

184
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.410
thing. Like it's almost so
small that I, it feels

185
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.840
like there's just nothing in
it, but air. But then

186
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.720
when I looked for software
defined radio, I found ones

187
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.480
that were $300 boxes, $500
boxes, varying levels of complexity.

188
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.570
What is the difference between
the $19 one or the

189
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.000
one that just fits into
like it's in the USB

190
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.610
stick it stone itself. Yeah.
So there are, I probably

191
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.310
know exactly the device you're
talking about and kind of

192
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.190
to your point, you can
buy a software radios that

193
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.500
go that are $20 and
you can buy software radios

194
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.310
that are in the millions
of dollars. And so the,

195
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:03.260
the difference is really in
the pure, in the, in

196
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.600
the fundamental radio capability that
provides. So the device that

197
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.080
you have for example, is
receive only it cannot transmit

198
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.680
true. It is a single
antenna only. So you can't

199
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.490
benefit from multiple antennas or
multiple channels. The device you

200
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.910
have, I believe is probably
an eight bit ADC. What

201
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.400
we mean by that is
the analog to digital converter

202
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:28.400
that is listening to the
electromagnetic wave that hits your

203
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.460
antenna and turning it into
a voltage, right? So, you

204
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.500
know, or a digital number
that represents a voltage. So

205
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.980
we're going from analog information
to digital bits. It can

206
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.900
only represent that voltage with
eight bits of precision. Whereas

207
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.700
if you were to spend
a lot more money on

208
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.490
a radio, you might get
something that's producing that number

209
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:51.650
with 24 bits of precision,
and there's all kinds of,

210
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.650
you know, power amplifiers. And
that of thing that go

211
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.290
into making, you know, the
difference between a $20 receiver

212
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.280
and a, you know, a
hundred thousand. I see. Okay.

213
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.770
So then when I go
and get, I was listening

214
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.580
to the, the news, like
the national public radio and

215
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.760
with, with eight bits, I
can go and get what,

216
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.930
250, a number from zero
to two 55 effectively. And

217
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.450
with 24 bit, you know,
we're going off into space.

218
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:20.610
We have just incredible amounts
of Deedo 16 million. The range

219
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.570
is insane from an unsigned
integer perspective. Tail is very

220
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.750
much increased. That's exactly right.
And so that directly impacts

221
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.100
the type of information you're
able to reconstruct. So if

222
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.450
you think about, so let's
think about your voice. Okay.

223
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.780
So let's say, Scott, I'm
going to take your voice

224
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.330
and I'm going to, quantitize
it? What that, what I

225
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.270
mean by that is I'm
gonna take your voice and

226
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.230
define digital values that describe
your voice. So when you

227
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.750
speak really lowly, I'm going
to say, that's 10, when

228
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.670
you speak really high, I'll
say, that's the max, that's

229
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.970
two 55, right. Being, giving
me, giving myself eight bits

230
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.600
here. Right? So, but obviously
your real voice is, is

231
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.590
a continuous function, right? There's
not these individual steps between

232
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:06.000
levels. So there's loss of
information here because I can't

233
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.170
accurately represent the entire range
of your voice. But let's

234
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.840
say I take that from
eight bits to 10 bits.

235
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.020
Now I have, you know,
1,024 levels. Now I can

236
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.070
represent more information. And so
that same concept applies to

237
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.940
Communication systems. Okay. So you
mentioned that the radio is

238
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.360
small. It's receive only, but
still with this little $20

239
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.490
thing, I was able to
do a whole lot. Now

240
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.860
I did find that when
I tried to listen to

241
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.440
quote unquote the radio, and
by that, I mean, FM

242
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.540
radio, I did have to
kind of move it around.

243
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.100
It felt like the old
days where I was holding

244
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.690
the antenna up in the
air to make sure I

245
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.080
got a good signal. I
wasn't picking up kind of

246
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.360
like a lot without having
to do a little bit

247
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.730
of work. That's just based
on the size of the,

248
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.460
the antenna. So there's a
lot of factors at play

249
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.300
there. And I, I'm not
exaggerating when I say many,

250
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.750
many graduate theses and dissertations
have been written about this

251
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:03.480
topic. And so that's everything
from when, when you, when

252
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.780
a radio signal is transmitted,
there's not a single path

253
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.670
that it takes to a
receiver, right? It's bouncing off

254
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.010
buildings and it's moving through
trees and it gets slowed

255
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:16.380
down, you know, going through
windows. So, you know, depending

256
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.010
on how you move your
antenna around the signals that

257
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:25.110
are incident upon your antenna
very widely. And that actually

258
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.760
is even more effected by
the frequency at which you're

259
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.250
operating, because the wavelength of
a very high frequency signal

260
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.660
and by wavelength, I mean,
radio signals, as they're moving

261
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.800
through space, they actually can
be, they have some, some

262
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.770
amount of wavelengths before the,
the, the period repeats itself.

263
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.460
So if you think about
a really high signal it's,

264
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.670
you can think of it
like scribbling really, really quickly

265
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.030
up and down. Whereas a
low frequency signal is sort

266
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.160
of going up and down
a really slowly as it's

267
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.770
going through space. And so
as you move your antenna

268
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.290
around, you're going to see
different parts of a very

269
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.660
high frequency signal differently than
you would see parts of

270
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.840
a very low frequency signal.
So there's just, there's so

271
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.020
much complexity to something as
simple as just moving your

272
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.540
antenna around and seeing how
it affects the reception of

273
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.720
the signal that you care
about. That's interesting. I was

274
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.890
driving a yesterday in Seattle
and I was using my

275
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.830
GPS and I'm in downtown
Seattle. And if you've been

276
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.690
down there, you know, that
the streets are quite narrow

277
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.090
and the buildings are quite
tall and I'm driving and

278
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.240
doing my thing. And suddenly
on the GPS, my car

279
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.990
moved over to streets. And
I was like, I guess

280
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.840
I'm not where I thought
I was is, are the,

281
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.810
is the signal the, the,
the frequency of the GPS

282
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.930
bouncing off buildings. And it
just bounced in a different

283
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.220
way. And I found myself.
Yeah. So it's funny because

284
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.790
a GP GPS, the way
that, that particular, what we

285
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.110
would call wave form is
designed is, is not terribly

286
00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.010
robust to working well in
urban environments. It, it doesn't

287
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.370
do well going through buildings.
It bounces in weird ways.

288
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.610
You know, it doesn't, it
can't propagate through a concrete.

289
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.500
So that's why you wouldn't,
you're in a parking garage.

290
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.810
You know, you, you get
that, Oh, GPS signal lost

291
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.870
message from your phone. And
so, and that's exactly what,

292
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.990
what you described is exactly
right. We would call that.

293
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.980
Multipath where that GPS signal
is bouncing off the urban

294
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.540
environment and in what you
are receiving confuses the radio,

295
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.880
it, you know, it decodes
the information and just says,

296
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.190
okay, well, you know, I'm
doing the best I can,

297
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.080
but you're not actually getting
what you should be. Right.

298
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.320
And of course, you're picking
it up from multiple satellites.

299
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.140
So it's probably internally voting
on what it thinks is

300
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.910
going on. And when they
all, when they all agree,

301
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.530
it gives you a general
sense of where you are

302
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.830
when they all disagree. It's
like, well, good luck finding

303
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:48.760
your way around Seattle. Yeah.
GPS is a, is inherently

304
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.190
the way that GPS works
is actually a time is

305
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.430
a time based system, right?
The GPS satellites, all they're

306
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:59.590
doing is broadcasting their time,
their, their instantaneous time. So

307
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.390
when you get into scenarios
like that, you know, it

308
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.930
sort of falls apart quickly.
Yeah. Your code is powerful.

309
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.420
And so are you. And
when you consider the reach

310
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.210
of your code, it's clear
that to deliver quality code,

311
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.210
you must also deliver secure
code. So where can you

312
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.080
start? A first step is
educating yourself on basic secure

313
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.260
coding principles and beginning to
put these principles into practice

314
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.520
every day. Vera code secure
coding toolkit is your go

315
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.510
to resource for all your
secure coding needs. The benefits

316
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.050
of the toolkit include learning
best practices for secure coding,

317

at vericode.com/toolkit. That's V R

320
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:54.960
a covid.com/toolkit. So I I've
got this, this little, little

321
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.020
radio, and I can go
and install the software for

322
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.240
it. And there's lots of
different pieces of software for

323
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.190
it. And as people go
and explore this, a lot

324
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.650
of them will find or
think that they have to

325
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.870
pay, they have to buy
a package for this, but

326
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.540
they don't necessarily have to
buy a package once they've

327
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:15.140
got their radio. Yeah, that's
right. So The software radio

328
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.070
community has really grown up
around open source, open source

329
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.090
software. I realized that it
kind of, it can feel,

330
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.810
it can feel silly to
talk about software radio and

331
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.960
using software where that versus
the hardware device itself, it's

332
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.380
probably worth real quickly just
clarifying that by software radio.

333
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.840
We mean a hardware device
that, that is control old

334
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.580
and used by software. Okay.
So there's no knob on

335
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.840
my, on my device. That's
right. So the, the way

336
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.270
I like to describe this,
and I realize I'm sort

337
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.880
of deviating from your question
a little bit, please, but

338
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.300
the, so my favorite analogy
for this is if you

339
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.360
sort of think back to
the way computers were when

340
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.600
they were first created in
the forties and the 1940s,

341
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.130
where in order to represent
some computation, a programmer would

342
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.460
literally, you know, flip switches
and plug wires into various

343
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:16.100
ports to create an electrical
circuit that represented the math

344
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:22.130
that needed to get done.
Right. And that has, you

345
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.530
know, as, as computing has
evolved, we're at the point

346
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:29.480
now where instead of having
algorithms defined in hardware, we

347
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.530
have general purpose processors that
we then tell what to

348
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.100
do with software. And that's
exactly the same thing. That's

349
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.220
happened with software radio. So
many decades ago, you would

350
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.710
build a piece of, you
know, or an elect, an

351
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.640
electrical circuit that did some
radio function, and it would

352
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.820
do that one radio function.
Well, now we build general

353
00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.480
purpose, radio hardware, and we
tell it what to do

354
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.530
and interact with it through
software. Mm I'm. Just exploring

355
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.020
this space. So from my,
the things that I was

356
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.030
most interested in were two
things, and I thought they

357
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.130
were kind of my two
fun, hello worlds. The first

358
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.350
one was to just listen
to the radio, to plug

359
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.300
it in and put in
like my favorite radio station

360
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.560
at 91.5. I believe that
megahertz, right. That's where FM

361
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.010
is. That's right. And then
I can see it. And

362
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.350
what was interesting was what
I did that I'm here

363
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.620
in Portland. So 91.5 is
national public radio. I could

364
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.280
see the neighbor stations for
the first time in my

365
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.400
life, literally next door. Like,
I know that they're next

366
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.790
door. I intellectualize that they're
next door, but seeing the

367
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.490
kind of the bell curve
and then an empty space.

368
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.830
And then the other stations,
one of them was rock

369
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.890
music, and one of them
was jazz and they looked

370
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.960
different. Like, I didn't listen
to them, but I could

371
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.640
tell that that's the rock
station. Yeah. That is. So

372
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.810
we, the radio community, Especially
in the open source world,

373
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.560
we, we generally consider building
an FM radio receiver to

374
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.930
be our equivalent of a
hello world. Good. You, you

375
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.860
didn't, you did exactly what
exactly what we would have

376
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.770
told you, you had had,
you asked us excellent. And

377
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.080
yeah, exactly what you're describing.
So what, what you're describing

378
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.520
is visualizing the frequency domain,
right? Cause what, what you

379
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.530
saw is not how it's
not how signals Look in

380
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.830
the air indeed. And so
w what you were looking

381
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:22.170
at was a visualization of
the power and the electromatic

382
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.670
magnetic spectrum across different frequencies.
And so you could see,

383
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.920
you know, those exactly as
you described those radio stations

384
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.680
positioned around and, you know,
the power levels going up

385
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.590
and down and frequency is,
as your receiver saw, saw

386
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.610
things happening. And what's, you
know, what's amazing about that

387
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.480
to me is actually Richard,
Richard Simon has a really great

388
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.860
talk about just how incredible
electromagnetic spectrum is because it's,

389
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.230
it's just everywhere. It permeates
everything. It's, it's kind of

390
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.560
like the force, right? It's,
it's, it is absolutely everywhere

391
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.350
all the time. And things
are bouncing everywhere. And, you

392
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.920
know, the air around you
is filled with information. And,

393
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.310
you know, normally as a
human, you know, we, we

394
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.800
do not have the, the
sensors quote, unquote, to be

395
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.340
able to observe that. But,
you know, using this software

396
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.330
radio technology and open source
software, you're able to observe

397
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.390
it and interact with it
and actually manipulate one of

398
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.200
the four fundamental forces of
the universe. And that's just

399
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.710
incredible. I think People not
to get too off topic,

400
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.320
but why do people worry
about them? Whether it be

401
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.240
the microwave oven in the
eighties, everyone was like, stay

402
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.130
away from the microwave. The
microwave will give you cancer,

403
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.470
or don't put the cell
phone to your head. There

404
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:35.310
are dangerous electromagnetic frequencies, but
are not the ones that

405
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.850
we spend time in and
hold near our heads and

406
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.520
sleep next to ones that
are probably not going to

407
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.370
kill us. Yeah. So this
is this, this is, this

408
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.830
is the realm of, you
know, much, there's all kinds

409
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.550
of conspiracy theories and real
science and pseudoscience. And, you

410
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:59.400
know, unfinished studies, the, the,
there is a scientifically, scientifically

411
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.090
accepted health, you know, sort
of health studies about this.

412
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.700
And the key thing is
all of the frequencies that

413
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.430
we're interacting with, you know,
the, or rather all of

414
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.640
the frequencies that we sort
of blindly transmit out into

415
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.700
the open, like, you know,
FM broadcast, radio, and wifi,

416
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.020
and that sort of thing.
Those are that's non-ionizing radiation.

417
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.560
So what we care about
in terms of health is

418
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.560
ionizing radiation. What we mean
by that is ionizing. Radiation

419
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.620
is radiation that when it
hits the atoms in your

420
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.570
body, you know, it can,
it can change, it'll affect

421
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:37.380
the electrons of those atoms.
And that requires a certain

422
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:41.100
energy level within that radiation.
And so all of the

423
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.220
signals that we're talking about
don't have that energy level.

424
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.490
They can't, they affect the
atoms in your body. Okay.

425
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.790
So when we say ina
ization to use an, not

426
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.400
an analogy, but oversimplifying it's
like, these are ones that

427
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.460
are energetic enough to cause
trouble. And these ones are

428
00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.410
ones that it's just where
they're just passing through. And

429
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:02.290
honestly, whether you decide to
have wifi in your house

430
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.330
or not, you're going to
have these things running through

431
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.450
your body all the time.
Anyway. So Yeah, that's the,

432
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.010
what you just said is
how I wished I had

433
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.970
described it Now, the next
step was I was at

434
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:19.180
91.5 megahertz, and then I
have an insulin pump and

435
00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.890
I wrote an article about
this. And it's also a

436
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.590
wonderful article that I'll make
sure I put in the,

437
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.830
in the show notes by
peach wham, who used a

438
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:31.750
software defined radio to decode
what was happening at 915

439
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.320
megahertz, which happens to be
where my insulin pump does

440
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.910
its radio frequency communication and
what I haven't succeeded in

441
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.190
doing this, but I want
to figure out how to

442
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:46.240
get the ones and zeros
off of that wire basically

443
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.850
see the packets going by.
I've got it to the

444
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.190
point where I plugged the
software defined radio in, I

445
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.400
can initiate communication with the
insulin pump. I can see

446
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.640
lights blinking on the pump
and I can see the

447
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.600
frequencies and the powers change
at that frequency, but I

448
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.030
don't know how to get
from there to ones and

449
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.420
zeros. What's that leap? Yeah.
So that's a really cool

450
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.180
question. And I'll, I'll, I'll
also go ahead and take

451
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.390
the second to point out
that 915 megahertz is the

452
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.720
third, most popular ism band.
So yeah, It's the sub

453
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.490
gigahertz band. Like I also
found out that by my

454
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.770
garage, Door's there too, which
was surprising. That's right. That's

455
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.660
also where, if you remember,
you know, back in the

456
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.810
nineties and early two thousands,
we, everyone had a wireless,

457
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.230
you know, handheld landline phones,
and that's where those phones

458
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.280
operated. I remember those were
so bad. Yeah. It did

459
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.380
not work well like terrible,
but to answer your actual

460
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.820
question. So w what's interesting
about what you just described

461
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.800
is they're actually two fundamentally
different radio technologies. So what

462
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.370
I mean by that. And
so you're actually describing a

463
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:54.700
split between analog modulation and
digital modulation. So when you

464
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.240
did your, when you listened
to your FM broadcast radio,

465
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.350
right. That, that your hello
world, what that signal is,

466
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:07.690
what FM radio is frequency
modulation, and to give the

467
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.780
sort of the simplest response,
if you think about, you

468
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.330
know, when you, when you
talk, right, and you see,

469
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.510
you know, like a wave
that represents your, your, your

470
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.120
voice. Right. Right. And if
I'm allowed, it's really tall,

471
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.870
right. So what analog modulations
are is they, they don't

472
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.540
attempt to turn that into
ones and zeros. It just

473
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.440
takes that raw signal that
represents information in this case,

474
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.450
your voice, what we call
mixes, which basically means put

475
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.070
it up at a certain
frequency. So it takes your

476
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.180
voice, which is at hundreds
of kilohertz, multiplies it up

477
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:45.380
to, you know, 91.5 megahertz
and transmits it. So there

478
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.370
is no digital information. It
actually is your voice just

479
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.190
multiply it up. So it's
such a high frequency. You

480
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.340
can't quote unquote, listen to
it without a radio. What

481
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.860
you described though at the,
your, your, the insulin pump.

482
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.410
And I have, I have
to say, I have no

483
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.170
familiarity with, you know, the,
the, the particular device you're

484
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.500
talking about, but assuming it's
a digital modulation, it's entirely

485
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.540
different. So what it's doing
is it's taking the information

486
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.870
it wants to transmit. And
it actually is, you know,

487
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.900
looking at it in terms
of one's and zero's turning

488
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.730
that into packets. And then,
you know, then modulating those

489
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.130
packets and transmitting them. So
when you listen to an

490
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.550
analog modulation, you don't ever
have to, you know, only

491
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.590
reason you would put it
into ones and zeros really,

492
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.940
so that you could do
something with it on your

493
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.910
computer, but if you had
the right equipment and you

494
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.880
could actually just go basically
directly from antenna to speaker,

495
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.240
cause the heart, there is
no one's and zero's computation

496
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.830
necessary. Okay. My radio is
not making a wave file

497
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.320
out of bits. It's going
analog. And it's like, there's

498
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.890
no conversion here. Listen to
it. Yeah. We're making it.

499
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.100
Yeah. Yeah. You certainly couldn't
do that. And, but, but

500
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.690
your, your, your insulin pump,
for example, that actually is

501
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.590
working with digital information. And
so suddenly there's, there's more

502
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.460
complexity. Right. So now, now
we care about things like,

503
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.920
you know, how big is
a packet? What is the

504
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.860
header information on this, on
this packet? What if one

505
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.170
of the bits gets flipped
through the air? Do I

506
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.660
have error correction? So that
I'm robust to that. Right.

507
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.890
So that all these additional
layers of complexity as we

508
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:26.120
sort of, you know, advanced
that modulation. Yeah. Yeah. It's

509
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.550
really fascinating. So if I
can understand if I can

510
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.410
paraphrase what you're saying and
then add on how the

511
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.860
insulin pump works, when I'm
doing listening to the radio,

512
00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.320
like you said, it's analog
and there's, there's amplitude there

513
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.530
where the power is giving
me information, but not turning

514
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.440
it into a number, but
with the insulin pump they're

515
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.440
using, what's called frequency shift
keying. So rather than going

516
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.650
and again, oversimplifying up and
down, it's going kind of

517
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.300
left and right. It's like,
okay, I'm going to stand

518
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.040
a little bit to the
left. That'll be zero. I

519
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.600
don't understand it a little
bit to the right. That'll

520
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.180
be one. And it's dancing
around that center frequency expressing

521
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:02.150
the higher frequency as a
one in the lower frequency

522
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.700
as a zero, and then
to go and solve the

523
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.060
problem of, did I miss
something? It actually encodes a

524
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.920
bit, one bit with two
bits, it uses a thing

525
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.010
called Manchester coding. So these
are all ways to work

526
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.060
around. It sounds to me
like basically this, the electromagnetic

527
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.610
spectrum wasn't designed to shove
bits around. So we're going

528
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.100
to figure out how to
put them in envelopes and

529
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.080
put them in preambles and
put them in headers and

530
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.340
shove them through this, this,
this, this force is fundamental

531
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.340
force of the universe. That's
exactly right. Yeah. The wire.

532
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.570
So working at RF, which
was, you know, working at

533
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:39.500
radio frequency, whether it's wired
or wireless now wired channels

534
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.770
tend to be a lot
easier to deal with, but

535
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.690
there's, there's, it's very hard.
Right. It's kinda funny. Cause

536
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.460
the more sort of the
longer that I've been in

537
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.250
this field, the more incredible
it is to me that

538
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.430
any of this works at
all, sort of all the

539
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.090
time described all computers, these
sort of all the time.

540
00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.830
And you learn about like
one more thing. And it's

541
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.140
like one more thing that
these radios have to deal

542
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.060
with to get, you know,
a bit from the transmitter

543
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.670
to receiver. You're like, how,
how did anyone ever make

544
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.910
this work and how, how
does, why, you know, and

545
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:13.540
that's exactly right. You know,
every single impairment, you know,

546
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.610
has, has to be dealt
with in some way for

547
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:20.020
communicating communication system to work.
So people should go to

548
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.570
Amazon and whether you're an
adult or a kid or

549
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:24.280
an adult who has a
kid or knows a kid

550
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.520
and get, start with a
kit, get an SD radio,

551
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.980
get an STR, or they're
very inexpensive. They're super fun

552
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.860
to play with. You can
start at the new radio

553
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.710
GNU, radio.org, and also it's
worth pointing out that you're

554
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.240
having a conference in Alabama
in September. So September 16th to

555
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.320
the 20th and 2019, the
new radio conferences happening. Yes,

556
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.050
that's right. So we have
a, we have a yearly

557
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.710
conference. We've been doing it
since 2011. So this will

558
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.860
be our ninth year. And
you know, it's been really

559
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.720
incredible when we first started
out, we were, you know,

560
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.810
40 people sort of crammed
into a classroom at UPN.

561
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.990
And now, you know, we
have several hundred that come

562
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:06.010
together every year from all
over the world. And, you

563
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.820
know, it's, it's, it's everyone
from, you know, a hobbyist

564
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.540
or a student just learning,
just learning about radio or,

565
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.370
you know, they're just interested
in hardware or they're interested

566
00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.380
in math or physics, you
know, all the way up

567
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.350
to people who, you know,
who been building these radios

568
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.860
for decades. So we have
a really incredible array of

569
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.830
people. It's incredible place to,
to meet the community and

570
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.310
learn fantastic. And also, as
you, as you famously said

571
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.370
that of all of the
four fundamental forces of the

572
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.970
universe, weak nuclear force, gravity,
strong nuclear force, and electromagnetic

573
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.300
only one is safe to
manipulate from home. So we

574
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.550
should all get an SDR
and get involved in a

575
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:47.290
software defined radio. Yeah. I,
the community is very welcoming

576
00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:53.590
and I, software radio can
be overwhelming. There's so much

577
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:58.210
to it, but it's also
incredibly rewarding and there's many

578
00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.480
people all over the world
that, you know, all want

579
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.990
to figure out this together
and do cool things. Well,

580
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.120
thank you so much, Ben.
Hillburn for chatting with me

581
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.310
today. Yeah. This has been
really great. Thanks for having

582
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.150
me, Scott. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

583
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:34.740
we'll see you again next
week. <inaudible>.
