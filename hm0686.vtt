00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.420
As a software engineer, chances
are you've crossed paths with

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.060
Mongo DB. At some point,
whether you're building an app

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.280
for millions of users, or
just figuring out your side

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.240
hustle, it's the most popular
non-relational database. Mongo DB is

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.110
intuitive and incredibly easy for
development teams to use. Now

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.170
with Mongo DB Atlas, you
can take advantage of Mongo,

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.950
DPS flexible document data model
as a fully automated cloud

8

service. Mongo DB Atlas handles
all the costly database operations

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.000
and admin tasks that you'd
rather not spend time on

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.100
like security, high availability, data
recovery monitoring, and elastic scaling.

Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

13
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.400
This is Hansel minutes, specifically
an episode of Hansel minutiae

14
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.150
for, I talked to Richard Campbell
And we talk about nothing.

15
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.570
This is the one of
the very rare content, free

16
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.540
episodes of Hanselman. It's how
are you, sir? Why did

17
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.770
they like him? If they're
so content free? I don't,

18
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.270
I just encourage people to
lower their expectations. As we

19
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.970
originally started doing handsome minutia
when we would call each

20
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.540
other when cool stuff happened.
And then at the end

21
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.330
of the call, you would
say, Oh, did you push

22
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.840
record? We should probably just
call each other. So I

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.280
haven't talked to you in
awhile. How are you, sir?

24
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.560
It has been a while,
right? I mean, what have

25
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.930
we done? Eight, 18 or
19 of these things in

26
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.710
the last one was 2017.
So, well, a year we

27
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.710
had one last year, as
you recall, we tried to

28
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.500
get it working on Google
Hangouts and then my computer

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.630
blue screen. And I spent
the next six months debugging

30
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.250
my computer. That's basically what
happened. Build a new machine,

31
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.440
pretty frustrating, but what are
you going to do? So

32
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.860
I just got off the
phone with a very nice

33
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.280
gentleman who is the lead
developer on circuit Python I've

34
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.200
ever used circuit Python. No.
What is circuit Python? This

35
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.170
is a gentleman's name is
Scott Shaw Croft. And he works

36
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.510
at eight of fruit. And
as I hope that we

37
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.240
all know eight of fruit
is just wonderful and everything

38
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.960
that they do is magic.
Yup. Just a great playground

39
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.220
for stuff. And a circuit
Python is a version of

40
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.860
Python that makes coding IOT
devices, you know, electronics, DIY

41
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.540
kits. It's just, it makes
it all about right. It's

42
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.630
what ADA fruit is all
about. So the idea is,

43
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.840
you know, how do you,
how do you deal with

44
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.390
Arduinos right now? Right? You
have to install the Arduino

45
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.110
IDE, which is kind of,
kind of funky looking and

46
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.510
you have to, you know,
it's fakes a serial port

47
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.000
or it installs where do
USB drivers. And it's just

48
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.080
know it's a thing. What
circuit PI's on is it's

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.000
ADA, fruit's branch of micro
Python that basically is designed

50
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.040
to simplify experimentation on microcontrollers,
not microcomputers. This is not

51
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.240
Python on a raspberry PI,
cause that's all computer. Like

52
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.080
it's got four gigs of
Ram, right? So this is

53
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.770
basically writing Python to do,
you know, controlling hardware rather

54
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.110
than using C or C
plus plus or whatever. What's

55
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.550
cool about it though, is
you go and buy something

56
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.730
like a circuit playground express,
which is just a little

57
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.190
round kind of cool badge
or an eight or fruit

58
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.760
feather, or even the aid
of fruit, itsy bitsy, which

59
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.690
is a small thumb. Oh,
all their stuff is great.

60
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.240
Trinket, feather, Gemma, all these
things are tiny. You basically

61
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.560
plug them in to USB
and it shows up as

62
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.520
a drive, as a disc
drive. It's, you know, it's

63
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.500
probably not a disc drive
it's magic or whatever, but

64
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.680
right. And there's a file
called code dot P Y

65
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.080
and you edit it and
you hit save. And when

66
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.000
you hit save it, reboots
the board and runs the

67
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.080
code. Oh my goodness. Any,
any itsy-bitsy is absolutely minuscule.

68
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.000
I mean, it's like the
size of a quarter. No,

69
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.330
it's nothing like, like it
is the size. It is

70
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.240
probably because they needed at
least to be at least

71
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.130
as big as it would
be for the USB to

72
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.410
plug into it. Yeah. I
think it's the connectors, literally

73
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.540
the edge connectors take up
more space on the board

74
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.260
than everything else. Yes. It's
glorious. And it's like $11.

75
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.040
Yeah. Get a kicker. Right.
It's smaller than a feather,

76
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.980
but larger than a trinket.
Right. You know, it's basically

77
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.110
an inch and a half
long. It's really small. Now

78
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.030
that's not a great example.
I think the run, the

79
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.100
fun one and the one
that you should all rush

80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.720
off and buy and tell
them, I asked you to

81
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.350
buy it is the circuit
playground express. And this is

82
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.800
really fun because it's got
10 bright, bright pixels. It's

83
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.220
got a motion sensor, it's
got a temperature sensor, a

84
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.480
light sensor, a sound sensor,
perfect little thing. And it's

85
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.860
just running this, this little
processor at 48 megahertz and

86
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.410
they're like, batteries will last
for forever. Right. And what

87
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.720
just, what a treat. It's
just a great little device.

88
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.000
And if you had an
idea and you wanted to

89
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.720
go and make it happen,
like a costume or a

90
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.730
piece of art or whatever,
you'd find this thing on.

91
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.350
So we're just talking to
him about some of the

92
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.810
work that they're doing over
there. And some of the

93
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.730
things that they're going to
talk about at, at PI

94
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.490
con just pushing the limits
of what you can do.

95
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.120
And it's, it's amazing to
me how they're making the

96
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.620
developers inner loop simpler right
back in the day. Basic

97
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.840
metric is how long does
it take for me to

98
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.600
write code and run it
on the device? Like the

99
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.540
faster I get around that,
the happier I am. Right.

100
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.660
And how many keystrokes are
you writing code and how

101
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.630
many keystrokes are you getting
your code ready to? Right.

102
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.480
Wrestling with the plumbing. Yeah.
Which is just a hassle,

103
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.840
you know, we've talked about
yak shaving, right? Yeah. When

104
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.150
are you done yet? Well,
I'm still shaving that. Yeah.

105
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.280
Right. I said nothing to
do with anything. No, but

106
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.280
yeah. Circuit Python is a
joy and I'm learning all

107
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.130
about it and it's becoming
my most fun way to

108
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.040
do stuff. And I've got
a blog post up where

109
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.400
I used a thing called
a PI portal P Y

110
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.330
portal, which has a little
tiny screen that you can

111
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.420
also get from Meda fruit.
This is super fun. I

112
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.000
can hear you searching for
it. It's got a 3.2

113
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.160
inch color TFT touch screen.
Wow. How much screen? My

114
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.910
friends, 50 bucks, 50 bucks,
little tiny thing. And then

115
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.410
you can go and get
like a little three D

116
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.070
printed case or a laser
cut case. And it could

117
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.080
just sit on your, you
know, like everyone's talking about

118
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.350
getting an Alexa, right? Yep.
So, so Amazon can listen

119
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.990
to your house. Right? You
can have a PI portal,

120
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.570
it's all open source. You
could make it a touchscreen.

121
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.510
You could make it a
button like a stream deck.

122
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.750
I went and made mine
go and talk to 'em

123
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.910
talk to my blood sugar
and just show me my

124
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.900
blood sugar, like a YouTube,
you know, subscriber and view,

125
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.350
counter, whatever, whatever makes you
happy. You could make it

126
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.630
a piece of art to
show your Twitter followers. Like

127
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.790
it's a dashboard. Yeah. Yeah.
Just a little bit. I'm

128
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.830
all about the dashboards. Did
you see that deck board

129
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.080
that I made? Yeah. Yeah.
I've been, I made, when

130
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.790
I saw your original post
on that issue, I made

131
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.400
notes too. That's something for
the house. Like when I

132
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.320
get the cycle to work
on that. Yeah. Yeah. It's

133
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.620
a da K board.com. You
can buy it from them

134
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.630
if you've got the money.
But if you have a,

135
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.520
a monitor line around for
a hundred bucks, they'll sell

136
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.770
you the raspberry PI with
the software already on it

137
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.560
inside of a case with
pre you know, basically they'll

138
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.900
save you time. You can
make this yourself, but they'll

139
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.360
do all the work for
you and associate it with

140
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.400
everything. And it just boots
up and it's done handled

141
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.460
very, very nice. I went
and made one with a

142
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.180
raspberry PI zero, and then
I just gaffer taped it

143
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.080
to the back of the
monitor. Yeah. Nothing that can't

144
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.380
be fixed with duct tape,
but for a hundred dollars,

145
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.440
it's hard to resist. It's
so simple. Well, and, and,

146
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.050
and again, it's even fun
to resist for no money.

147
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.390
If you have Yeah. To
deliver, they just take parts.

148
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.450
If you've got to pay
zero lying around. Yeah, man.

149
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.540
Absolutely. So what, what are
you working on? I have,

150
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.310
you know, I'm all in
on the book. Like I'm,

151
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.910
I'm really almost not gadget
thing at the moment because

152
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.720
it's, it is just nonstop
research and trying to get

153
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.100
the book done by the
end of the year, the

154
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.790
history of.net. You know what
interview I have Coming up

155
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.100
in the next couple of
weeks? Who is that? Guthrie?

156
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.390
Bob Muglia. Oh, wow. Where
is he? Bob ugly is

157
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.580
the CEO of a company
called snowflake down in San

158
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.620
Mateo. So I'm actually making
a trip down to the

159
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.430
Valley. He's graciously give me
some time. I've had a

160
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.870
lot of hours with mr.
Guthrie. He's very detail oriented.

161
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.530
And you know, the first
three hour session I did

162
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.170
with him, we talked about
him joining Microsoft in 1997.

163
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.180
And in three hours, we
got to the year 2000.

164
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.030
So we were still two
years away from.net. So it

165
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.610
is it's over a dozen
hours of interviews. Now I've

166
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:05.250
done with, with mr. Guthrie.
The other recent addition to

167
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.710
this was David Treadwell. Who's
at Amazon these days. And

168
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.550
he was the VP in
charge of.net during the development

169
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.860
of it, 99, 2000 2001.
So where are you anticipating

170
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.230
people will buy this book.
I I'm going to make

171
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.490
the paper book. I'm thinking
I'll Kickstarter it in the

172
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.430
fall so people can preorder
it. I think people want

173
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:29.870
a physical copy of the
book. That's what they tell

174
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.330
me. So I'll, we'll make
a physical version of the

175
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.860
book, but I mean, I
would read it on my

176
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.980
Kindle. That's just the way
I tend to read, write

177
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.280
and the coffee table book
for nerds. Well, if you

178
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.680
know, it's interesting, I've collected
a lot of the original

179
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.780
marketing screenshots and demo apps
and things like that. I'm

180
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.910
almost thinking I could make
a coffee table book, but

181
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.010
I just want to tell
the story of all of

182
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.340
the work that's gone on
over the past 20 or

183
00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.080
so years and how, how.net
transformed itself. I mean, it

184
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.470
used to be a product
for windows and now it's

185
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.610
not. And I tell you
something that's really, that's really

186
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.130
emerged. I've worked on this
that you didn't have to

187
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.250
re you know, normally you
build a platform and then

188
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.650
you build tools for the
platform and then you sort

189
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.900
of exceed the limits of
the platform. So you have

190
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.710
to build a new platform.
You build new tooling.net replaced

191
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.010
its platform, but didn't have
to replace this tooling. I

192
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.010
don't know if that's ever
happened before. Well, I think

193
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.380
the whole idea was that
people like this language, people

194
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.170
like this base class library,
I always talk about the

195
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.430
BCL, the base class library
of.net. Doesn't get enough credit

196
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.890
in the sense of, you
know, Hey, you want to

197
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.110
do something. We probably included
that out of the box,

198
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.690
but at some point with
node and with other things,

199
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.100
you have to go and
figure out which of the

200
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.600
five available libraries is best
one to choose. And, and

201
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.340
I never, you know, back
in the nineties, when this

202
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.110
was in the development, that
was one of your big

203
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.000
debates, what language are going
to work and what platforms

204
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.710
are running on, what library
sets am I going to

205
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.250
use? And the idea that,
that, that.net was highly opinionated.

206
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.380
We have a library set.
This is what you should

207
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.200
use, took a bunch of
decision making, but it also

208
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.310
gave us some substantial advantages
and it allowed that platform

209
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.320
to get much larger. But
the fact that they spend

210
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.100
completely re-engineered now to be
cross platform and let's face

211
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.530
it more focused on the
cloud than it is focused

212
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.920
on any given operating system.
It's a remarkable transformation. I

213
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.890
just am really enjoying. Everybody's
really quite personal stories. And,

214
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.680
and so trying to just
build this sense of a

215
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.080
group of people that work
really hard to make this

216
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.270
happen. I mean, you and
I have had great conversations

217
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.850
over the years about this,
and I have many notes

218
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.580
from you too, because you
were part of it still

219
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.160
are. As I recall Know,
I tend to work on

220
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.140
that a little bit here
and there. It's amazing that

221
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.700
you're putting the work into
it. I hope that lots

222
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.740
of people read it and,
and you anticipate it will

223
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.020
be available by about what
I'm trying to get it

224
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.090
out by the end of
the year. So we'll make

225
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.530
know, I like the Kickstarter
approach, just from the point

226
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.840
of view of, if this
interests you, you know, put

227
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.870
down your money, buy a
copy in advance. Kickstarter is

228
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.080
a way, and we will
put a link to that.

229
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.790
Kickstart Is that started yet?
Now I'm going to do

230
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.860
it in the fall. Okay.
So I want to be

231
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.980
as close to publication as
possible so that I don't

232
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.770
frustrate people. You don't want
people to think that it's

233
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.550
about the money or it's
just getting it done, but

234
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.130
it, and getting it right.
And you know what, I'm,

235
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.170
it has been a, it's
a, it's been a joy

236
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.020
for me. Every time I
listen through, you know, I

237
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.660
be transcribing my own motto
whenever you, you just get

238
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.510
so jazzed, I get so
excited about what's been happening,

239
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.400
but it is, it is
a tremendous amount of work.

240
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.260
And so I put a
lot of other stuff aside

241
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.310
to try and get this
finished. I dig that you're

242
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.380
doing it. Thank you for
doing that. My, my pleasure,

243
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.420
you know, like I said,
it's literally been a delight,

244
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.550
but it is not, not
a small task to do

245
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.600
justice to Your code is
powerful. And so are you.

246
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.940
And when you consider the
reach of your code, it's

247
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.030
clear that to deliver quality
code, you must also deliver

248
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.570
secure code. So where can
you start? A first step

249
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.170
is educating yourself on basic
secure coding principles and beginning

250
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.010
to put these principles into
practice every day. Vera code

251
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.490
secure coding toolkit is your
go to resource for all

252
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.330
your secure coding needs. The
benefits of the toolkit include

253
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.890
learning best practices for secure
coding, understanding how to secure

254
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.310
your dev ops environments and
learning to combat the most

255
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.960
common software vulnerabilities, stay secure
and download this valuable asset

256
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:35.370
today at vericode.com/toolkit. That's V
R a code.com/toolkit, a subject

257
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.890
change. What kind of internet
do you have there at

258
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.870
the house? Well, you know,
up in Canada, I've always

259
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.410
been a beta tester for
every service provider available in

260
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.410
my area. I mean, it
might, my children believe that

261
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.360
the only reason the internet
doesn't work for them is

262
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.410
they haven't done their chores.
And because I've always had

263
00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:01.140
multiple redundant interconnections, right. I
had, you know, symmetrical tell

264
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.300
at a T one early
on. And then when DSL

265
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.090
first came out, I had
DSL. So at this particular

266
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.340
moment, there are three different
internet connections coming into the

267
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:14.250
house. They are. Yeah. Okay.
And they are, wow. Well,

268
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.290
cause one of them is
an inbound fixed IP, so

269
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.880
that I'm still running servers
at home. Cause I'm in

270
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.550
pain. Okay. Like a business
thing I get there's a

271
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.980
PR business internet Is that
class internet. Yeah. So then

272
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.020
there's a, then I have
a separate connection to specifically

273
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.600
for outbound Nat traffic. And
then I have a backup

274
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.330
connection that allows me to
transfer load over if we

275
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.430
have problems or we lose
a connection, anything like that.

276
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.060
And is that an automatic
transfer or do I have

277
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.580
to pull a wire? It's
all automated. So I have

278
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.060
a fairly sophisticated multi-way on
router and a bunch of

279
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.250
rules in place. And you
know, I'm actually a network

280
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.590
guy. So the internet does
not go down at your

281
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.660
house. There's only one time
the internet went down in

282
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.550
my house and it was
when a truck backed into

283
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.060
the pole front of my
house and knocked it over.

284
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.680
And that is when the
daughters came downstairs. Did we

285
00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.000
do something wrong? No. Why
is because the internet, It

286
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.670
doesn't work. It's like, have
you seen the big truck?

287
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.050
Well, I don't have three
internet. Can, I don't think

288
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.840
anyone has 300. Huh? Nobody
does. Nobody should. It's it's

289
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.930
a silly thing. And it
significantly complicates my life. What

290
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.990
about like a backup power
generator? Yeah. Yeah. I need

291
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.780
to do that. Great. So
it's its own set of

292
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.870
complexity, but you know, going
back to the.net, I bought

293
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.990
it, built this house around
the.com boom. And I was

294
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.170
spending a lot of time
in labs, building out websites

295
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.350
for folks at the Microsoft
labs in places like Palo

296
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.150
Alto and things like that.
So I basically built a

297
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.610
lab here that had its
own rack Mount with the

298
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.750
power backup redundant internet connection.
So we could literally benchmark

299
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.420
and test all that stuff
from my lab and I

300
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.060
could charge you for it.
And, but less than what

301
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.740
it would cost to go
to say a Microsoft lab.

302
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.240
And then once we were
comfortable, we could spec the

303
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.130
whole rig out in order
directly to the data center.

304
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.880
Right. Right. Well, there Bought
computers for this, which was

305
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.360
weird. There are people who
are doing infrastructure work, who

306
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.280
believed that you should have
those things at the house.

307
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.440
Like I made a, a,
a, you know, a little

308
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.550
raspberry pie array yup. Of
a, of a Kubernetes array.

309
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:10.780
But like just for Zelle
has like a, basically she

310
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.390
said that she said on,
on Twitter that con ed,

311
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.690
the power company in New York
came to her house because

312
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:19.060
she was pulling in a
normal on unreasonable amount of

313
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.460
power. Right. And they like
knocked on the door and

314
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.110
she was like, Oh, I'm
just running servers in here.

315
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.570
You know? And it's all
like hot and steamy because

316
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.630
she's got like a rack
in her apartment and put

317
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.820
air conditioning in for it.
But it's totally, really Kelly.

318
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.920
I did get rated as
a grow op once because,

319
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.250
because of my power consumption,
I've later found out it

320
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.200
was, it was all consuming,
a lot of power it's

321
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.330
that I consumed too much
power at night, which is

322
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.930
the sort of thing that
grow lights do. And so

323
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.820
that's what they sort of
caught on to is grow

324
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.950
lights. Cause a lot of
power consumption when you would

325
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.310
not normally have power consumption.
So you actually had the

326
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.980
city and police and fire
all show up at one

327
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.950
and just sort of invited
them in so they could

328
00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.930
take a look through the
place. And then the city

329
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.970
guy said, you know, you
can get a work permit,

330
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.190
you can get a license
that basically says, you're running

331
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.990
a lab here and we'll
stop bothering you. I'm like,

332
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.900
I like that a hundred
dollars a year. I'm not

333
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.620
a grow op license. Huh.
Well, I know that Jess

334
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.170
has a, like a lot
of power cause she's running

335
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.380
her own, you know, server
array at home. I know

336
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.770
Kelly Summers has like a scale
array and she uses for

337
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.370
like big data at her
place. There should be some

338
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.020
kind of a check box.
You should be able to

339
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.230
like call your local utility
company and let them know

340
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.780
that I am not growing
here. I am. In fact,

341
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.170
I like it. The city
license model just says, I'm

342
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.420
running a lab here. It
seems to work. I'm surprised

343
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.330
as the crops don't buy
them. I'm running a lab

344
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.340
here. Yeah. That's basically what
I that's what my license

345
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.010
says is that I, I
run a research lab. Alright,

346
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.700
well, so I've had Phylos
for many years is fiber

347
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.620
to the, which sounds exciting.
Great fiber fiber optic for

348
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.320
the house. Right? Well, just
until the last year it

349
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.170
was, it was 20 megabits
and then it was 35

350
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.720
and I was 35, 35
for a very long time,

351
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.480
which I realize is very
privileged, but certainly it's not

352
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.270
the state of the art
by any means, you know,

353
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.850
I'm not in a rural
area. And then I finally

354
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.700
decided to just pay the
money for like 50 bucks

355
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.720
for a 100 megabit up
down. And I was very

356
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.820
happy with that for a
very long time. And then

357
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.490
over the last couple of
weeks, it's just gone up

358
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.530
and down and up and
down and losing IP addresses.

359
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.290
And I think that the
O N T the optical

360
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:31.080
network translator transfer thing that
starts with T yeah, I

361
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.840
don't know, the ONT go
is going out and there's

362
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.530
a problem. So I'm like
very frustrated, like this is,

363
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.460
this is important. It needs
to not fall over. You

364
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.380
kind of, you kind of
live off your internet connection.

365
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.780
Like it's not as minor
thing. I mean, I work

366
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.860
from home. Right. And it's
super frustrating. So Scott Hunter, who

367
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.900
is the King of pushing
me into things that I

368
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.730
don't want to do, and
then making me realize it

369
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.360
was a good idea after
the fact. So Scott Hunter says

370
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.960
to go and get Comcast
out and he says, get

371
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.370
Comcast. He says, UN UN,
ironically, you should use infinity.

372
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.920
That seems like a bad,
It seems like a step

373
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.330
backwards right there. They're the
giant internet service company. That's

374
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.960
sort of the, the worst.
Yeah. Well, so it turns

375
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.750
out that been a joy.
I called, I called the

376
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.300
fire hose people and said,
can you get me files?

377
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.760
Can you fix it? They
said, sure. We'll send it.

378
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.000
We'll send a tech out
in, in eight to nine

379
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.220
days. And I was like,
well, I don't have, I

380
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:32.930
don't have internet now. Yeah.
I'd been tethering my phone

381
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.930
to the house and the
phone was getting hot. You

382
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.800
know, like, of course we're
sipping through a straw here

383
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.240
and not like a straw,
but like one of those

384
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.460
little coffee, stirrer straws, that's
not really meant to be

385
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.340
as strong. And you know,
the family can't do their

386
00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.130
homework and the wife's upset
and Netflix doesn't work. So

387
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.540
things are becoming a problem.
So I called Comcast and

388
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.970
today I have been sleeping
on, what's been happening in

389
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.920
the world of the internet.
Do you know? You can

390
00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.540
buy a standard router now
called doc's. Was it called?

391
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.110
Yeah. DOCSIS this is the
specification for cable modems. When

392
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.240
did this happen? Like you
used to have to rent

393
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.690
it from them. Julie provides
them. Yeah, there are third

394
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.200
party ones, But you're saying
this, like you're saying this

395
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.370
was such a laissez Faire,
casual attitude, casual guy. You

396
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.100
are as Canadian. Right? I
didn't know. This was a

397
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.860
thing you could just buy
one and own it and

398
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.380
have full control of your
network entirely except for the

399
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.900
wire. So that was amazing.
I went and bought this

400
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.560
a gigabit network, a bridge,
I guess. It's not really

401
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.510
a router. I brought, I
brought a, I got a

402
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.180
modem, which is a bridge.
I didn't, I want to

403
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.480
manage my own DHCP. Right.
I got this modem, a

404
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.960
gigabit modem. And they said
they would have a person

405
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.710
out the next day. Wow.
Cause they're selling something new,

406
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.010
right? Oh yeah. But I
was just like, they just

407
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.910
jumped off new internet, rush
over to the house. Then

408
00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.920
they said, well, we don't
have any cable in anywhere

409
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.560
near your house. No I
didn't. Then what did that,

410
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.480
what does that mean? Like,
well, no one ever pulled

411
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.440
the coaxial cable to your
house. And I said, well,

412
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.350
where is it? Well, it's
on the corner. And they

413
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.270
said, we can have a
person come and dig a

414
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:12.030
hole under your, under, under
your house and under the

415
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.240
sidewalk to make a, a
PVC pipe and push the

416
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.540
co-ax to you. And we'll
have that in a couple

417
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.470
of weeks. So that's not
any good. So then I

418
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.480
I'm like kind of sweet
talk the kid. And I

419
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.490
was like, Hey Regina, can
you help me out here?

420
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.390
So he ends up pulling
200 meters of co-ax and

421
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.380
laying it across the front
yard, on the ground. It's

422
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.420
just lying on the ground,
outside my house right now

423
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.780
it's temporary. Right? Shoves it
in a hole in the

424
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.970
side of the house, we
take it all the way

425
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.880
into the server room, which
is the closet under the

426
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.850
stairs. Right. And plug it
in. And, but once he

427
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.740
got it, once he, once
he accepted the fact that

428
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.330
there was going to be
a 200 meter wire, like

429
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.300
sitting across the sidewalk, breaking
some kind of rules, I'm

430
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.540
sure there's a dozen like
zoning rules that have been

431
00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.420
broken. At this point. I
plugged it in. I got

432
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.350
gigabit. I literally 10 Xed
my internet for the same

433
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.990
price. I pay the exact
same. And I went to

434
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:11.550
a gigabit now instead of
a hundred megabits glorious, Suddenly

435
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.000
your network speeds are going
to matter right Now. I've

436
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.590
just hit another limitation, which
is my, my, my wifi

437
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.560
router. Oh, what do you
use it for wifi? Well,

438
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.850
I'm using an amplify am
P L I F R,

439
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.960
which I love and for
wireless, it's perfect. It's like

440
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.710
the perfect balance between a
consumer product and approach Schumer

441
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.800
product. I think it's just
a brilliant router. It's a

442
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.820
mesh network got full coverage.
As I recall her attractive

443
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.220
units too. They're they're gorgeous.
They look at the list.

444
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.180
It looks like the Tesseract,
right? It looks like the

445
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.310
Avengers, you know, I mean,
it's just a very lovely

446
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:55.410
little kind of opaque, white
cube, just looking scrumptious. And

447
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.440
what it does is it's
fine on wifi because wifi,

448
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.650
of course can't do gigabit,
but I've got cat six

449
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.860
cable pulled throughout the house
and I've got gigabit ethernet

450
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.090
on all my things. It
just can't handle sustain gigabit.

451
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.920
It gets kind of warm
and I've got 11 devices

452
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.700
on gigabit. So once I
start doing anything major, plus

453
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.800
I bought a, a modem
that is a multi, multi

454
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.730
homed. It'll let you do
link aggregation across multiple gigabytes.

455
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.690
So in some theoretical future,
Comcast will call me and

456
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.270
say, we can do four
gigabits now, or, you know,

457
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.020
it can do up to
four gigabytes, right? So it'll

458
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.380
max out for individual cables
and then bring it into

459
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.540
the house. And then I
could do link aggregation. Cause

460
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.850
my desktop has two gigabit
with link aggregation. So you

461
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.050
get the idea that this
is going to, this is

462
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.540
going to hurt my little
router. I'm thinking it may

463
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.880
be time to go from
amplify to this ubiquity. Yeah.

464
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.180
Ubiquity seems to be the
way a gigabit ethernet all

465
00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.030
over, but also they're using
some of the new five

466
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:05.530
gigahertz protocols that are, you
know, gigabit speeds. So yeah,

467
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.220
the unify and thinking is
the thing and the frustration

468
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.710
I have with that. And
again, I realize that this

469
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.890
is a, a wonderful and
glorious problem to have. So

470
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.340
I recognize my luck and
privilege and this too, to

471
00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.790
have outgrown a high end,
you know, a high end

472
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.040
router. I mean it's immediate
high end rider. It's like

473
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.490
a $200 router, but still
I've outgrown it. And now

474
00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.010
I'm looking at this unified,
but I guess Troy hunt

475
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.440
has one of these and
he likes it very much.

476
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.510
Troy did a great series
of blog posts cause he's

477
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.270
got a fairly sprawling house
and you know, meshing is

478
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.440
important. You're trying to create
a unified wifi space. Yeah.

479
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.920
But it's really my only
struggle with the unifies. And

480
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.080
I do like them a
lot is that the on

481
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.430
premise UI system uses Java.
So it's like I have

482
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.030
to contaminate a machine to
do management or you use

483
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.100
their cloud product, which has
a fee attached to it.

484
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.960
And then you can Amar,
you can manage it from

485
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.240
an iPad or a phone.
Oh yes. I don't want

486
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.550
to pay for anything. And
I don't want to have

487
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.940
anything, have a dependency on
any remote thing. You know

488
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.500
what I mean? Like I
want my house to work

489
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.590
when it's unplugged. I don't
like it. If my doorbell

490
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.600
won't ring, unless someone's on
the other end, you know,

491
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.760
keeping a server up Well,
and this is purely about

492
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.210
configuration and monitoring stuff because
the instrumentation in the unifies.

493
00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.210
Beautiful. Yeah. It's just that,
you know, they, they wrote

494
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:25.450
the original version for that
stuff in, in Java and

495
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:27.550
they haven't quite retired yet.
And so then they've turned

496
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.410
around and made the mobile
stuff, but it depends on

497
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.880
their cloud product. Then you
have to pay for that.

498
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.360
Yeah. Yeah. So that's been,
my only complaint about unify

499
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.640
is, you know, that you
have these two choices. So

500
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.920
it's like, I do have
one machine that I keep

501
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:43.020
Java on. That makes me
sad, but, but at least

502
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.100
gives me cause it's good.
They're good tools. Right? Like

503
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.780
you really do understand what's
going on then. Yeah. I

504
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.910
don't have any problem with
Java on the service side.

505
00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.010
It's the Java applet that
I'm concerned about and I

506
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.960
have no interest in running
And you got to run

507
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.700
it. And so the, and
the side effect, of course

508
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.440
I have this one machine
that I do the monitoring

509
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.440
from, that has Oracle popping
up on an irregular basis.

510
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.780
Tell me what a new,
An Oracle doesn't like Java.

511
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.080
I mean really? I don't
think Oracle liked anything. They

512
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.740
just mean, yeah, They're just,
yeah, they're there. They're not

513
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.650
pleasant. That's for sure. But
the product, I mean, it's

514
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.800
gorgeous. It really is the
best of the best. What's

515
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.430
really interesting about, about unified
and it's part of the

516
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:22.000
challenge is it really is
enterprise class stuff, but there's

517
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.940
some reasonably priced parts that
you can use in your

518
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.710
home. You just gotta be
sure what you're looking at.

519
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.300
Like, you know, are you
start poking around at some

520
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.370
of their higher end products
like, Ooh, that's a thousand

521
00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.720
dollars. I'm not spending a
thousand dollars on a device

522
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.220
for my wifi in my
house, like $300. Okay. You

523
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.110
see, but see this, this
is the thing though. $300

524
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.940
is still a ton of
money. If I'm going to

525
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.740
something for $300, it needs
to work for years. You

526
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.330
know what I mean? Like
I want these things to

527
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.690
work for. You expect these
to be magic. They're also

528
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.860
Poe, which I really liked
Power over ethernet, The power

529
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.500
of reason, which means that
ultimately it's going back to

530
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.110
my server closet, my server
closets on a generator with

531
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.530
ups backup, which means in
and outage my wifi States

532
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.620
up. So help me understand
that. So power over ethernet.

533
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.870
I get the idea, but
I don't have anything that

534
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.170
uses it. I guess I
could have used power over

535
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.080
using it with some of
my security cameras, but what

536
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.810
kind of stuff do I
need to power with power

537
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.070
vision. Most of these devices,
at least from unified and

538
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.920
many others will come with
an inline Poe device. It's

539
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.070
just a little box that
you plug the ethernet cable

540
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.950
through and then that's plugged
into the wall so that

541
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.260
you don't have to run
power to wherever you put

542
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.590
the a, the access point.
I see seniors in your

543
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.710
closet, which is convenient right
now. Or you buy proper

544
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.760
rack mounted, Poe switches. Like
right now I have a

545
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:49.190
little amplify router in my
closet downstairs. And then upstairs,

546
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.630
I have another one that's
it's buddy it's friend. Yeah.

547
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.960
That's like, it's sub it's
it's secondary, right? It's the

548
00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.500
prime, the primary secondary is
upstairs, but it also has

549
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.810
to be plugged into the
wall, like, and by the

550
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:05.360
wall, I mean the power.
So you're saying with Poe,

551
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.300
that would, that extra thing
would just go away. Yeah.

552
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.300
The Ethan and Jack is
now your power. And so

553
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.880
typically in an enterprise where
I'm putting these into suspended

554
00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.640
ceilings, I have to put
armored power cables in which

555
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.340
really sock. So I'd much
rather do that with on

556
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:23.540
protected cat five cables. It
can't hurt anybody. I dig

557
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.970
it. I see. So, Yeah,
but the big thing for

558
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.610
me was because we have
a fairly big house is

559
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.190
because I have the generator
backup against the server closet,

560
00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.320
not the whole house. The
fact that I had Poe

561
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.280
meant the wifi stayed up.
So, you know, the internet

562
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.920
may or may not have
stayed up depending on whatever

563
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.540
took out the power, but
at least the network connection,

564
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.890
right. That's where I need
to rethink things. Cause I,

565
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.380
you know, we were talking
about backups and restores on

566
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.430
Twitter and there's that joke
about how backups always succeed.

567
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.280
It's restores that fail. Right.
You know, you've got to

568
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.860
test it. Like how often
have you tested to see

569
00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.280
what in your house would
go out? If the power

570
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.790
went out right. For most
people that is not reasonable

571
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.580
to go and plug a
generator into the entire house,

572
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.400
really. You're just trying to
keep the fridge going. And

573
00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.080
you know, maybe the internet
and the, a couple of

574
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.680
important things. If your power
goes out, how does the

575
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.650
house decide? What's on generator
power and what's not. And

576
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.530
does a generator turn on
by itself, Built this house

577
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.900
right or not? I didn't,
I had people build this

578
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.930
house. And so I decided
I didn't want a 30,

579
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.410
a 30,000 watt generator. It's
too expensive. And it's ridiculous.

580
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.980
Like they're massive things. So
I got a 14 kilowatt

581
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.630
generator, which about half the
house. And so I have

582
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.900
a sub panel it's powered
by the generator. And then

583
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:43.270
it, that's where I picked
fridge freezer, heating in hot

584
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.710
water server closet, some lights
up and down one bathroom,

585
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.690
like all of the sort
of essential so that the

586
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.000
house is usable. So they
extended out The generator. It's

587
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.870
like, I've seen like the
little, like my dad has

588
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:57.840
a, like one in the
garage. That's like, I don't

589
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.720
know. He looks like a
lawnmower. Yeah. This is a

590
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.610
bit bigger. At 14. Kilowatt
is a bit bigger than

591
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.560
that. It's, you know, six
foot by three foot by

592
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.560
three foot. It's outside somewhere.
It's a beige box and

593
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.660
it's using gas from the
city. So I don't have

594
00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.150
to store fuel cause its
own set of problems that

595
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.580
I didn't want to deal
with that. And I figured

596
00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.560
if, if gas is out
in the city, I got

597
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.620
bigger problems that give you
my web server gas, like

598
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.220
natural gas, natural gas. Yeah.
Oh sorry. It can be

599
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.260
powered by the same stuff
that you're already using to

600
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.270
heat your water and stuff.
That's right. You don't have

601
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.420
to go fill it with
like Exactly. I don't have

602
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.910
to store fuel, which creates
its own set of problems.

603
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.950
If you, as soon as
you're storing fuel, you need

604
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.590
permits. It has to be
inspected. You need to drain

605
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.190
it, which means using it
on a regular basis. 14

606
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.520
kilowatts. Like, is that a
lot? Yeah. It's half a

607
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.290
house basically. It's more than
enough. Okay. Yeah. And there

608
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.670
are a few thousand there
they're not pennies or a

609
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.940
few thousand dollars, but they're
not catastrophic expensive either. And

610
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.520
they're, you know, a little
more reasonable to manage overall.

611
00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.680
It needs maintenance, just like
anything does once a year,

612
00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.560
a guy comes out, charges
me $200 and changes the

613
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.850
oil 3000 kilowatt hour. That's
like a huge thing. I

614
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.070
was like, I'm old Big
beasts, right? Yeah. And then

615
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:11.910
now you've got noise problems
and you know, you probably

616
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.100
can't get enough natural gas
to run that as it

617
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.800
was with my 14 kilowatt
one, I need high pressure

618
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.030
gas. So that was additional
permits. You know, all these

619
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.100
things creep up on you.
But the big thing for

620
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.580
me is where we live
up against the forest. There

621
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.010
are storms we have above
ground power lines, which is

622
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.040
stupid, but it is what
it is we're wearing, you

623
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.530
know, quick little is what
it's called. But you know,

624
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.500
we're on the edge of
a grid where often we

625
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.270
lose, we lose power a
couple of times a year.

626
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.190
And once in a while,
when there's a good storm,

627
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.130
we lose power for a
day or two. Oh wow.

628
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.370
Okay. And so a couple
of suggestions. If you're going

629
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.140
to do this with your
generator. One thing I did

630
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.410
was I wired a couple
of extra out exterior outlets

631
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.380
on my house to the
generator and I left extension

632
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.870
cords for my immediate neighbors.
Oh that's so we have

633
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.150
an extended outage. Like that's
your cord go plug in

634
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.840
your fridge. And that night
I show a good neighbor.

635
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.910
You're so Canadian. Yeah. It
cost me $30. But it

636
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.650
also means they don't complain
about it running. Cause it's

637
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:14.610
loud. It makes some noise.
It's an engine, right? Like

638
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.020
there's no two ways about
it. It's a motor and

639
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.060
it's self tests. Once a
week, I run it about

640
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.760
three o'clock in the afternoon,
Friday. Cause nobody seems to

641
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.620
mind then, right? The least
annoying time for it. It

642
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.080
does it's automatic. But when
we had a three day

643
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.990
outage, we were running the
neighbors, you know, through the

644
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.720
shower seriously. Cause it had
been a couple of days

645
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.610
and it's like, you guys
want a shower? We got

646
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.640
hot water. So come on
by. Oh isn't the hot,

647
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.160
hot thing. Need power. Depends
on the house. Some people

648
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.850
use electric for hot water.
Some people use gas. Right.

649
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.740
But the bigger thing people
worried about with their bathrooms

650
00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.150
is they didn't have their
fans working. Cause they didn't

651
00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.760
have electricity and you get
humidity buildup and then everything

652
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.620
is moly. Okay. Okay. Yeah.
You know a lot. This

653
00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.120
is giving me a lot
to search for on the

654
00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.250
internet and a lot to
Google for. So we've talked

655
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.100
about circuit Python. We've talked
about the generators. We've talked

656
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.550
about new internet. I've talked
about the better book, better

657
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:12.460
wifi. This is a, a
lovely random content free. And

658
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.140
I don't like doing content
free on the show. You

659
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.210
know this? No, no, no,
no. This is the absolute

660
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.030
conversation we had Any way
where we would have had

661
00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.140
this conversation regardless. Yes. So,
so now you've been here

662
00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.130
with us on another episode
of Hansel minutes with Richard Campbell.

663
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.260
Thanks so much for talking
to me. Always a pleasure

664
00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:51.250
friend. We'll see you again
next week. <inaudible>.
