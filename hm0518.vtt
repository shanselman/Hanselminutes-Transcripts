developer and technologists Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.640
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing the
show number 522. In this

10
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.080
episode, Scott talks with web
developer and entrepreneur Kuranda Adair

11
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.260
about how projects fail and
what to do with that

12
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.880
failure. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

13
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.790
of Hansel minutes today. We're
talking with Kuranda Adair from

14
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.820
Carville digital, where she's the
CEO and been doing web

15
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.970
development for many, many years.
And you've got a great

16
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.970
topic for today. Yes. We're
going to talk about failure

17
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.880
and recovering from failure. I
think that's a very, that's

18
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.100
a very courageous topic because
when we talked about this

19
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.280
earlier and you told me
about like the last year

20
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.070
and that you had done
a talk on failure, it

21
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.030
really resonated with me because
I have talks about imposter

22
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.390
syndrome and I did a
talk on open source recently

23
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.030
where I talked about just,
let's just all talk about

24
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.740
the things that no one
talks about, right? We don't

25
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.990
have to all suffer quietly
and pretend that these things

26
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.800
don't actually happen. Right. And
that's super important. And actually

27
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.280
one of my friends who's
also, my lawyer was talking

28
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.890
on asking on Twitter, you
know, why don't we talk

29
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.520
about like how hard it
is to be an entrepreneur

30
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.160
and all the things that
suck about it. And, you

31
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.350
know, I think there's a
lot of reasons why people

32
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.320
don't talk publicly about that,
but the reality is those

33
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.380
things do happen. And if
you, if you just talk

34
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.830
about like, when everything's great
or when you've overcome, you

35
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.490
know, the bad thing, then
people think it's magic and

36
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.580
they're unprepared. Yeah. They think
that you, you have a

37
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.280
startup or you get funding
and then a year later,

38
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.440
you know, you're famous and
wow, that was great. We

39
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.200
can all do that. But
you know, for every one

40
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.600
that succeeds, there's some number.
We don't know what that

41
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.090
number is, but just don't.
Right. Right. So what happened

42
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.780
to me in the last
year was I have had

43
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.050
my business. This is I'm
going into my fourth year.

44
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.350
And last year was supposed
to be, you know, the

45
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.750
year of my business, I
told my wife this and

46
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.420
I signed up for, you
know, an accelerator program and

47
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.820
kind of a business mastermind
thing and was really just

48
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.300
gonna focus on the business
because the first two years

49
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.410
were filled with either health
challenges or, you know, life

50
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.960
transitions. So joined the accelerator
went really well, got a

51
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.070
really, really big job, a
much larger project than I

52
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.280
had done before with a
great company that I really

53
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.810
felt good about. And then
that project did not go

54
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.300
very well. And I ultimately
wasn't able to finish the

55
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.540
last little bit of it
and had to say, you

56
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.290
know what, this is really
outside of my expertise. And

57
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.230
I'm at the end of
my resources and here's someone

58
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.780
who can, you know, who
can fix this and, and

59
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.360
get you that last 5%
of the way. But, you

60
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.450
know, having spent most of
my year on this thing,

61
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.090
that was a really hard
place to end up. And

62
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.680
it was a very, very,
very expensive lesson. Nice. Was

63
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.130
this just one of those
life happens? Things like we

64
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.770
were going to have a,
a talk earlier today, but

65
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.900
I got a flat tire.
Is it like life happens

66
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.290
or was it a combination
of life happens and an

67
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.540
actual mistakes? It was mostly
just, I think, lack of

68
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.990
structure, like for me, you
know, you have to have

69
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.660
a certain amount of structure
and process in your business.

70
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.840
I think to handle projects
over a certain size. And

71
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.230
I didn't yet have that.
Like I had, I had

72
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.150
the knowledge of like, these
are the things that I

73
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.100
want to put in place,
but not the time to

74
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.770
actually do it. And then
this job came along. So

75
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.480
I think part of it
was that part of it

76
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.690
was, you know, just lack
of experience. And so I,

77
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.520
for the first time was
doing something where I knew

78
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.740
I was going to have
to hire other developers to

79
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.020
help do it and, you
know, work with designers and

80
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.500
do all this stuff. And
I'm a project manager by

81
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.440
background. So I wasn't worried
about that part of it,

82
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.860
but, you know, I didn't
have a lot of experience

83
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.420
hiring. So I hired the
wrong developer to start with.

84
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.660
And then, you know, after
several months realize, Oh, this

85
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.550
person's not going to get
it done and have to

86
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.160
like scrap that and start
over with someone new. And,

87
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.660
you know, that's, that's really
expensive lesson and I took

88
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.960
responsibility for that, but, you
know, it's just a tough,

89
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.230
tough thing to learn on
the job. No, but that's

90
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.330
a really interesting point that
you bring up though, is

91
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.150
that, you know, as an
individual web developer, you've been

92
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.270
very successful and you, you
know, you're a good individual

93
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.600
worker when people then go
out and start a company,

94
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.040
I don't know how to
do subcontractors and taxes and

95
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.140
accounting. It doesn't, it doesn't
mean that you go from

96
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.150
working as a web developer
for a hundred percent of

97
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.670
your time to maybe half
of your time. You're a

98
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.260
web developer and the rest
of the time, it's all

99
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.530
the administrative business type stuff
that we don't have any

100
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.860
experience in. Right. And the,
I mean, the administrative stuff

101
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.010
is, is kind of there
regardless, but yes, when you

102
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.610
take on trying to, you
know, outsource tasks to other

103
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.170
people is a whole other
layer of complexity. And if

104
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.080
you don't have those processes
and documentation in place, then

105
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.780
it's, it makes it that
much harder. Do you use

106
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.340
all sorts of like, what
kind of tools do you

107
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.620
bring in like as a,
as a, do you have,

108
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.790
was it an issue of
like, I have to use

109
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.770
base camp for this and
you use Trello for that

110
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.180
and all those kind of
things. And then I think

111
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.280
when you talk about process
or structure, what do you,

112
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.890
what do you mean? So
when you talk about process

113
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.120
and structure, mostly I'm talking
about knowing how things are

114
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.550
supposed to happen. So that
the road, the tool that

115
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.270
you use to delineate that
doesn't really matter. I've used

116
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.110
Trello, I've used base camp.
I've used teamwork, but more

117
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.960
it's okay. You know, when
it's time to onboard a

118
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.900
new client, what needs to
happen? Well, it's probably the

119
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.590
same set of steps every
time. Like, do you know

120
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.810
what those steps are? Are
they written down or someone

121
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.730
else can see them so
that if you had to

122
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.710
train somebody else to do
it, you know, you would

123
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.770
have, you would be able
to hand them this list

124
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.750
and say, these are the
things you need to do.

125
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.290
If you don't have that,
then every time someone new

126
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.670
comes into your business, you're
either winging it. Or you're

127
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.400
sort of trying to remember
off the top of your

128
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.520
head, okay, what happens next?
And that's the recipe for

129
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.400
disaster and overwhelmed. I'm learning
that now. I just, I

130
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.410
now have a team. I
used to have a team

131
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.000
like many, many years ago,
and then I became an

132
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.950
individual contributor and now I
have a team of three

133
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.920
and they're all different kinds
of people from all different

134
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.900
places in the, in the
world. And they all different

135
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.590
time zones. And I'm having
to like create structure where

136
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.680
there was no structure before.
And it's really like emailing

137
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.140
them randomly turns out isn't
the kind of structure that

138
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.940
they need as important. It's
like bricks for me. Yeah.

139
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.890
So what I do now
is, you know, and it's

140
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.640
easier to do this, you
know, before you start hiring

141
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.280
people, although that's not usually
the way it happens, but

142
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.240
what I've done is just
start to record things as

143
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.700
I do them. So just
writing down the steps of,

144
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.360
okay, when I post a
new blog post, what has

145
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.220
to happen. And so I
have a list of, you

146
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.360
know, almost 25 things that
have to happen if a

147
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.010
new blog post is going
to go out. So then

148
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.830
I can hand that off
to a virtual assistant or,

149
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.080
you know, whatever. Or even
if I'm, you know, I

150
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.120
still do it myself, but
then I don't have to

151
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.800
remember the steps or I
don't have to worry that

152
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.440
I miss something. I just
open the checklist and go

153
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.380
down. It, It seems like
when you go from one

154
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.360
to an people, it all
becomes about documentation Pretty much.

155
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.960
Yeah. And I've written some
blog posts about documentation. I

156
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.680
feel like documentation is a
love letter to future you

157
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.230
because you're going to come
back to whatever it is,

158
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.330
even if it's just you
and go, what is happening

159
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.860
here, especially with websites and
technology. That is really good.

160
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.590
I like that document that,
you know, cause I've been

161
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.810
treating, my blog is documentation.
It is a love letter

162
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.870
to future me because I'm
always Googling for stuff that

163
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.700
I know I did. I,
I know I did before.

164
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.640
And it was like, Oh,
thank you. Pass Scott for

165
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.400
writing that down. So that
future has got denied. Well,

166
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.500
I have to say too
that I really liked that

167
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.830
philosophy and I've adopted it
very strongly. And I tell

168
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.220
people constantly that if someone
asks me a question and

169
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.170
I can answer with a
link to some thing that

170
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.960
I've already written, I feel
like I won. And I,

171
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.780
you know, I've read your
post about having so many

172
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.020
keystrokes. And I was like,
yes, that is the way

173
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.270
in the light and I'm
going to embrace it. That's

174
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.300
awesome. That makes me happy.
Thank you. So, so walk

175
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.460
me through, if you don't
mind the story arc of

176
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.150
the year, because it didn't
start as a failure on

177
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.280
like day one, like things
must have multiplied. Yeah. So,

178
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.730
you know, things started out
very shiny. I, I hired

179
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.400
someone to do, you know,
a lot of the backend

180
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.250
development. I actually handed off
all of the stuff I

181
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.510
went on a vacation, which
was amazing. And then just

182
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.510
as time went by, you
know, there were more communication

183
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.400
issues with the developer and,
and it was just a

184
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.680
lot harder than it needed
to be. And so at

185
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.230
some point, you know, there
was kind of a critical

186
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.110
moment where it's like, okay,
what, what am I going

187
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.230
to do if this guy
can't get it done? And

188
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.250
at that point I was
much further entrenched in the,

189
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.350
in the mastermind community that
I had joined. And so

190
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.560
I had a network of
hundreds of people, you know,

191
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.410
who are all web professionals
of different types. And so

192
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.420
I reached out to that
community, which is what I

193
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.890
should have done in the
first place, but I was

194
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.970
only a couple of weeks
into it. So I reached

195
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.680
out to one of them
and it's called a 10

196
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.410
K bootcamp. And it's actually
a course to teach you

197
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.340
how to, how to land
larger web projects. You know?

198
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.680
So if you were doing,
you know, $500 websites or

199
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.170
thousand dollar websites, like how
to, how to level up

200
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.940
to $10,000 websites. And so
I reached out to someone

201
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.490
in that community and kind
of explained my position. And

202
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.440
he was like, yeah, we
can totally rebuild this. And,

203
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.900
and that process was great.
But then there was the,

204
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.770
there was also the complexity
of getting, getting the data

205
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.050
from the old system into
the new system. And that's

206
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.100
kind of where things fell
apart. And so, you know,

207
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.060
when we tried, tried to,
to launch it just didn't,

208
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.360
it just didn't work. And
it was very clear that

209
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.970
it wasn't going to work
without, you know, further, further

210
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.790
fixing. So at that point
I kind of had to

211
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.900
just remove myself from the
process and say, look, you

212
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.100
know, this person can get
youth, you know, to the,

213
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.780
to the finish line on
this, but, but I've got

214
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.130
to step out. So, so
that was a really hard

215
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:45.170
moment and kind of probably
like the second worst month

216
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.440
of my life when that
happened, but even in the

217
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.840
middle of it, you know,
the great thing about having

218
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.800
that community is that I
was reaching to people for

219
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.720
help. And they were telling
me like, Oh yeah, let

220
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.520
me tell you when this
happened to me and the

221
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.130
stories they were telling me
were almost always 10 times

222
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.280
worse than what was happening
in the moment. And I

223
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.130
was like, Oh, so this
isn't like, I'm a failure

224
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.500
and should never work again.
This is, this is a

225
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.500
thing that happens to everybody
who goes into business and

226
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.260
tries to, you know, get
outside of their comfort zone

227
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.310
and right. And you get
through it, like things happen

228
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.380
in business and you, you
deal with it. And I

229
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.510
think that's, that's an attitude
that you learn when you

230
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.940
have, you know, when you're
a freelancer or you have

231
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.770
a company you very quickly
learn that things happen and

232
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.010
you have to focus almost
immediately on, okay, what's the

233
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.670
thing that's going to fix
the situation and not, Oh,

234
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.730
I'm a terrible failure. And
you know, yeah, you get

235
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.260
a little bit of wallowing,
but then you have to

236
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.350
pick yourself up and figure
out what to do next.

237
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.520
How much of having a,
a, a business like this

238
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.370
is, we're going to say
the word insurance, but it's

239
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.210
not about insurance is about
covering yourself when things go

240
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.220
wrong. Right. Because any number
of things can go wrong.

241
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.920
You say that, you know,
you had a, a subcontractor

242
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.320
that didn't work out, but
it could have been web

243
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.140
hosting that went down or
it could have been getting

244
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.960
audited, you know, like there's
speed bumps in life. And

245
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.820
there's potholes that you, that
are gonna happen regardless. How

246
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.740
do you, how do you
protect yourself from those things?

247
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.410
Well, I mean, you can
only protect yourself to a

248
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.420
certain extent, right? And part
of the, part of the

249
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.060
process with, you know, failing
a thing is, is figuring

250
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.650
out like what went wrong
and how to keep it

251
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.280
from happening again. And so
a lot of the things

252
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.030
that I'm focused on, like
documentation and process and, and,

253
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.390
you know, figuring out what
kinds of projects I want

254
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.310
to work on and what
kinds of businesses I can

255
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.180
help came from having that
terrible year and that terrible,

256
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.630
terrible failure, because now I
can be like, okay, that's

257
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.090
a thing that, you know,
I'm not good at and

258
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.340
I don't want to do,
and it kind of brings

259
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.380
into relief. These are the
things I am good at.

260
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.900
Like luckily, you know, I
did do some other projects

261
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.720
for some other people who
were really happy with the

262
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.230
results. And so I could
point to something and say

263
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.780
like, Oh, okay, I did
this thing. That was cool.

264
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.510
And I made this person
happy and, and it kind

265
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.570
of helped me narrow down,
like, okay, I really prefer

266
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.420
to work with service based
businesses. And I really prefer

267
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.080
to work with, you know,
a certain size of bins.

268
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.380
And I really like to
focus on not just, okay,

269
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.720
let's build you a website,
but how do we make

270
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.000
that website, an asset to
your business? How do we

271
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.660
turn that into, you know,
an employee basically that can

272
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.900
market for you 24 seven,
because that's the whole point

273
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.450
and, and great thing about
the web is that it's

274
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.910
never off. So if you're
going to have a website,

275
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.430
you might as well turn
it into something useful that

276
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.670
actually, you know, is an
asset for your business. So

277
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.790
those are the things I
came to focus on, sort

278
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.870
of out of, you know,
doing all the wrong things.

279
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.290
This episode of Hansel minutes

payments.com/hanselman that's Braintree payments.com/hanselman. So

293
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.250
what do you do? What
would you do if you

294
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.130
literally backed up in time
and started all over again,

295
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.810
the exact same everything except,
you know, what would happen?

296
00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.910
How would you like? You
know what I mean? Like,

297
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.010
like Groundhog day. Yeah. So
with this particular job, you

298
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:09.370
mean, I definitely would point
the client in another direction.

299
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.190
Like in hindsight, I think
that, you know, there should

300
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.430
have been, it probably should
have gone to an agency.

301
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.010
There probably should have been
a team of people just,

302
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.400
just from how complex it
is. And another thing that

303
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.050
one of my friends said
to me is that, you

304
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.230
know, having, when you have
a business that is your

305
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.770
entire website, I mean, this
was a really complex, e-commerce

306
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.360
say where the whole business
was dependent on that. And

307
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.710
you have no one technical
in your company. That's probably

308
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.160
not a good longterm thing.
Like if you're, you know,

309
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.920
like there was nobody, you
know, there were no employees

310
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.400
and, and like, it's, it
was all contractors working on

311
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.220
the site. And so I
think if you're, if you

312
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.260
have a website, that's just
like, Oh, I've got a

313
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.110
bike shop and I need
a website to market it.

314
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.590
Like, okay, cool. But if
your whole business is your

315
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.880
website, you probably want somebody,
you know, at your Beck

316
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.690
and call nine to five,
who understands a lot of

317
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.150
that technical stuff and can
deal with that on a

318
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.730
day to day basis. Yeah.
I mean, they're, if they

319
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.230
do that, they're, they've outsourced
literally everything to the point

320
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.420
where there's no backup, right.
If you get hit by

321
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.750
a bus, their business collapses,
if there's no, no technical

322
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.490
person to manage that, that's
wow. That's, that's a dramatically

323
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:32.710
bad idea. Yeah. So lots
of, lots of lessons and,

324
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.370
you know, I really came
out of it with, I

325
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.620
mean, there were some ideas
that I was working on

326
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.100
that I just didn't have
time to implement. And so

327
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.110
it's been nice coming out
of that to really have

328
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.900
time to focus on the
next thing that I want

329
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.920
to do and focus on
restructuring business in a way

330
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.050
that's going to be better
for me and better for

331
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.770
my future clients and my
current clients. So that's been

332
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.970
really good. This brings up
a really interesting question also,

333
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.210
which is the idea that
when you are growing, when

334
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.950
you're growing as a person,
when you're growing as a

335
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.190
business, you're always encouraged to
step outside your comfort zone.

336
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.490
And I've always been told
by people that I trust

337
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.340
and admire to, to stretch
and do stuff that makes

338
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.640
you uncomfortable. But at the
same time, you know, I

339
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.550
don't go and try to
squat 400 pounds because I

340
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:24.200
would die. Right. So like
at what point go, Hey,

341
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.810
I'm stretching out. Somebody's comfortable
at a, at a reasonable

342
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.330
amount of stretching. You know
what I mean? Basically. And

343
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.180
I I've been thinking about
that a lot because, you

344
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.370
know, a few months ago
when I was in the

345
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.010
thick of it, it's like,
Oh yeah, everybody tells you

346
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.620
fake it till you make
it. And they don't really

347
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.860
talk about what happens when
you don't make it. Which

348
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.480
is part of the reason
I did, you know, a

349
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.960
whole talk about failure a
couple of weeks ago, because,

350
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.120
you know, we need to
talk about that and yes,

351
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.290
you should stretch out outside
your comfort zone, but what's

352
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.710
too much, you know, obviously
400 pound squats, too much.

353
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.280
This job that I took
was too much, you know,

354
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.100
maybe in two or three
years, you know, I could

355
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.500
take a job like that
and it would go off

356
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.350
without a hitch. But yeah,
it's, it's hard to know

357
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.100
that in advance and that's
why, that's why we get

358
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.190
those life happens, moments. It
is a bit of a

359
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.050
correction, but at the same
time, it also takes a

360
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.050
lot of emotional maturity and
it takes also organizational maturity

361
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.380
to be able to, to
say, you know, this is

362
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.890
bigger than I can, that
I can do. Yeah. And

363
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.130
another thing that I thought
a lot about, especially before

364
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.260
I gave that talk is
there's a great article on

365
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:43.370
medium. And I think it's
called seven lessons for seven

366
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.000
lessons for minority leaders and
everyone else. But it talks

367
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.510
about sort of this amalgam,
you know, of a guy

368
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.570
that he calls Kevin. And
it's like, Kevin's sort of

369
00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.020
like your typical straight white
dude in tech or in

370
00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.500
whatever where, you know, you
can fail. And there's really

371
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.730
not that much consequence to
it. Whereas if you're, yeah.

372
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:09.410
And you know, if you
are in an underrepresented group

373
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.620
and whatever your career field,
there's so much more risk

374
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:17.630
to failure to talking about
failure because you know, you

375
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.770
really have the risk of
that's what people remember, you

376
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.100
know, you don't, whereas, you
know, when you're, when you're

377
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.950
talking about people who are
in the majority, then it's

378
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.100
like, Oh yeah, they failed
and whatever they bounce back

379
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.910
and like they get, they
get the past. Right. And

380
00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.770
it's a, it's a great
article. I'll send it to

381
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.710
you for show notes if
you want, but it really

382
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.940
kind of points out, you
know, the con the risks

383
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.310
and the consequences can be
so much greater. And that's

384
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.170
why you, especially, if you're,
if you're underrepresented, it's, it's

385
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.180
more of a stressor to
be like, Oh, I have

386
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.130
to be the best. And
I have to always present

387
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.390
success, you know, because the
risks are greater. Yeah. I

388
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.940
can relate to that. And
I think that, you know,

389
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.680
for some people who are
listening, that might be hard,

390
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.830
hard to hear, but like
many, many years ago, I

391
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.590
wrote a blog post called
I'm a phony where I

392
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.110
kind of was one of
the early people who talked

393
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.650
about imposter syndrome. And while
it felt risky and it

394
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.520
was in, in a way
risky, it wasn't ultimately, there's

395
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.500
still a bunch of people
who just laugh it off.

396
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.130
Like, Oh, Scott ha. You're
not a phony, you know,

397
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.980
it, it doesn't stick with
me like that. You know?

398
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.150
Well, some people are like,
think, Oh, that's so courageous.

399
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:34.320
There's, there's a certain amount
of Teflon involved where it

400
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.300
hasn't stuck with me in
a negative way, from a

401
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.230
technical perspective. And I use
it to empower others, but

402
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.400
ultimately it didn't cause me
pain while it could definitely

403
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.590
cause someone else a problem.
If they had decided to

404
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.560
become the phony and everyone
would just, you know, you

405
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.240
Google for phony and you
find that person and you

406
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.610
go, all right, I will
not be hiring you for,

407
00:21:54.350 --> 00:22:00.150
for your website. Exactly. So,
so then why, how, where

408
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.530
do you come with it?
Where does that courage come

409
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.260
from for you to go
and basically do the opposite.

410
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.170
And rather than simply, you
know, curling up and saying,

411
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.790
all right, there's a failure.
I'm not going to talk

412
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.920
about it. And I will
start over next year. You

413
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.500
have gone and done an
actual talk on failure at

414
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.700
conferences. Well, it was a
meetup. It wasn't a conference.

415
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.090
Although I do have someone
that I'm talking with them

416
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.770
at a conference and they're
like, Oh, maybe that talk.

417
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.470
I'm like, Oh man. And
an opensource. I mean, to

418
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.840
give yourself some credit, you
can an open source bridge

419
00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.050
on a different topic last
year. So I could, I

420
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:35.760
could see this being a
keynote. Yeah. Yeah. I don't

421
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.190
know. I'll think about it,
but, but really why I

422
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.400
decided to do it was
one. It was, I had

423
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.350
agreed to give the talk,
you know, probably six months

424
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.440
before it was supposed to
happen in September. And at

425
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.770
that time I was probably
planning to talk about the

426
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.050
new project that I'm working
on right now, websites that

427
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.260
work. And by the time,
and then I was going

428
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.870
to be out of town.
So then we postponed and

429
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.390
when the new date came
up, it was like, well,

430
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.450
this is really, probably the
most useful thing that I

431
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.000
have to talk about because
people, people are out there

432
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.050
struggling with this kind of
thing. And yeah, I can

433
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.760
talk about my new project
and try to sell people

434
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.400
on a new project. But
for that kind of talk,

435
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.200
it was like, what's, what's
going to be the most

436
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.230
useful for the audience. And
so that's why I decided

437
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.320
to talk about it. And
also, you know, I make

438
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.810
websites like I work on
the internet. So even if

439
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.780
a certain percentage of people
are like, Oh, okay, I'm

440
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.610
never going to hire her
again. Or you're, you know,

441
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.410
I'm going to steer clear.
It's like, it's a big

442
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.540
world and a big internet.
So I don't feel like,

443
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.190
I don't feel like I'm
not going to be able

444
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.490
to create a business or
recover. You know, if there's

445
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.140
a, there's always a few
people who aren't going to

446
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.960
hire you, there's always millions
of people who aren't going

447
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.100
to hire you for whatever
reason, but you know, millions,

448
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.790
more people. So although it's
maybe a higher risk for

449
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.890
me than for some other
people, I also feel like

450
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:57.200
it's probably worth it. And
it helps other people, especially

451
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.500
other people who are really
afraid to speak up and,

452
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.770
and admit to anybody that
they're struggling. It can be

453
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.810
really hard when you're in
that position to just see

454
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.050
success, success, success, and think,
well, everybody else is doing

455
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.850
this. That means like, I'm
not cut out for it

456
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.220
or I shouldn't be doing
it. And that's not the

457
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.360
case. Right. I think it's
so, it's so important also

458
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.070
to think about what are
appropriate comparisons and when comparison

459
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.540
is empowering versus when comparison
just makes things worse. Exactly.

460
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.780
I have a friend who
has a whole program around

461
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.670
learning to stop comparing yourself
to other people. Yeah. Yeah.

462
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.710
I'm on my timeline and
it seems like everyone is

463
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:40.390
visiting the white house for
some amazing thing. Portland just

464
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.150
hanging out at Chipotle, you
know, like I'm not the

465
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.130
white house. Like I suck,
you know, and it just

466
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.940
begins Well, and I am
actually friends with someone who's

467
00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.130
been at the white house
twice in the last two

468
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.940
years, man. I'm so close,
but so far I'm like,

469
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:59.650
I am not doing what
she's doing. And yeah. So

470
00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.900
it can be, it can
be crippling to kind of

471
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.690
dwell on that too much
instead of like, okay, what,

472
00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.630
what is the next thing
that I can do? You

473
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.650
know, what's the way that
I can start helping people

474
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.110
and not like, Oh, you
know, I'm going to worry

475
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.390
that Dina's at the white
house and I'm not Right.

476
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.640
And, but, and then from
a technical perspective, I think

477
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.920
it's important to remember that
there's a whole bunch of

478
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.330
technologies out there a lot.
And you know, I am

479
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.700
never going to be a,
a, a Python expert or

480
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.630
I'm never going to be
a, you know, a WordPress

481
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:36.460
theming expert and then pause
for effect. And that's okay.

482
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.190
You know, that's the part
that's, so that's so challenging

483
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:43.960
is the, and that's okay.
Right. Exactly. And yeah, there

484
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.380
are a lot of technologies
and it's super overwhelming and

485
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:52.900
that's, that's kind of what
the motivation was for my

486
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.900
next project, which is, well,
one thing I learned from

487
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.940
all this is that one
of the things I really

488
00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:03.640
enjoy is teaching people and
empowering people around technology. And

489
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.880
so I created an entire
course around that because I

490
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.730
see this same pattern where,
you know, clients come to

491
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.180
me and I say, okay,
let's get started. You know,

492
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.170
what's your, where's your site
hosted. And you know, where's

493
00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.140
your domain hosted. And, and
they literally say to me,

494
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.310
Oh, I don't know. Or,
you know, my previous developer

495
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.100
handled all that stuff. Like
it's in their name and

496
00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.040
I'm like, wait, you don't
own it. It's your, it's

497
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.520
your business? You know? And
for the first couple of

498
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.250
years, it'd be like almost
half the people would come

499
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.020
to me. And the first
thing we'd have to do

500
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.760
is be like, well, we
have to take back your

501
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.840
stuff that it's yours before
I can actually help you.

502
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.470
And like, that's the level
of, you know, lack of

503
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.790
education, I guess, around technology
when that's not your primary

504
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.380
business. And so I created
a course for small business

505
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.770
owners to help them learn
how to get websites that

506
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.560
are effective. And also just
what you need to know.

507
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.570
You know, you don't have
to be the one to

508
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.300
go in and like change
DNS on your domain name,

509
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.130
but you have to, you
have to own it because

510
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.650
it's your business. It's kind
of like if you bought

511
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.180
a house or you bought,
you know, you had a

512
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.660
physical brick and mortar business
and you go to sign

513
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.520
the lease and you let
your real estate agent sign

514
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.260
it. Oh yeah. Explain it
to people like that. The

515
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.360
light bulb goes on. They're
like, yeah. Oh, I'm like,

516
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.590
they're there to facilitate the
transaction, but it's still your

517
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.930
responsibility. And you, your name
has to be on it.

518
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.890
This is a huge problem
for small business owners. I

519
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.620
had a friend who had
a towing business and didn't

520
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.380
realize that the person who
did their website also own

521
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.880
the domain registration. Exactly. And
they were like, how could

522
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.520
they know? Right. No, one's
going to teach them. Exactly.

523
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.340
Yeah. And there's also, there's
so many brochure ware sites

524
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.300
that are made and even
something like, you know, change

525
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.270
the title. Like again, you
don't need to teach them

526
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.910
HTML, but if there was
some thing, whether it be

527
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.340
Squarespace or WordPress, that would
allow them to go and

528
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.400
update a picture that you
really empower the small business

529
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.730
owner to not feel like
it's a hundred dollar change

530
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.700
fee. Every time they want
to do something small. And

531
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.360
I always, with my clients,
you know, try to give

532
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.820
them as much control as
they want. Right. If they

533
00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.320
want to, if they want
to pay to have me

534
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.260
do every little thing, like
that's totally fine, I'll do

535
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.970
it. But if they want
to be like, Hey, I

536
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.340
don't want to call you
like every other day, teach

537
00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.250
me how to, you know,
manage pages or create blog

538
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.610
posts or change photos or
whatever. Then a, I want

539
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.050
to build it in such
a way that it's easy

540
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.720
for them to do that.
And B, I want to

541
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.480
teach them how to do
that and provide the resources

542
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.420
so that they can be
as independent and as empowered

543
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.080
as they are. And so
you've made a course, where

544
00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.340
is this course going to
happen? So it's not, it's

545
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.520
not created yet. I ran
a beta in the fall.

546
00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.230
So from November to January,
I did six different webinars

547
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.020
with a small beta test
group, or just went through

548
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.200
the different topics. So each
week is a different topic

549
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.630
or foundation where we talk
about things like owning your

550
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:12.470
domain name and, you know,
talk about discovery and actually

551
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.320
figuring out, you know, what
does it, what is your

552
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.270
actual message? Like, what's your
goal? What are you trying

553
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.950
to say? A lot of
people go into to a

554
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.990
website. It's like, okay, we
need to design. It's like,

555
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.960
well, what are you actually,
what's your content going to

556
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.270
be? So we talk about
things like that. Talk about

557
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:29.360
marketing and content, and then,
you know, the technology piece

558
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.010
of how do you actually
create this thing? You know,

559
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:35.720
how do you launch it?
How do you market it,

560
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.820
all that kind of stuff.
So we went through that

561
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.860
with a beta course where
I just did live webinars

562
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.480
and answer people's questions. And
now I'm doing a fundraising

563
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.500
round, a crowd fund on
Indiegogo to go ahead and

564
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.900
create the first version of
the course. So it'll be

565
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.820
hosted online, it'll be recorded,
you know, short lessons and

566
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.070
there'll be a coaching call
each week with me, or,

567
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.680
you know, kind of help
people with the concepts or

568
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.760
the things that they're struggling
with and more detailed tutorials

569
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.430
on, like, how actually do
you do this tech thing,

570
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.160
like step by step walkthroughs
of how to do, how

571
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.700
to do things, because you
know, things have evolved so

572
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.340
much. It's like any manufacturing
process, right? When you started

573
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.600
with websites, it was like
HTML and CSS or, you

574
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.200
know, geo cities or what
have you. And now it's

575
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.930
like, you can spin up
a WordPress site. And I

576
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.800
actually literally sat down with
my cousin last weekend and

577
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.310
we put up a wordpress.com
site for her, you know,

578
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:35.110
where all the structure was
in place and she just

579
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.400
needs to fill it in.
And we did that in

580
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.080
four hours. So manufacturing with
websites has reached a point

581
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.450
where you can create something
that looks professional and nice,

582
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.540
but you still need to
know what should you create

583
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.820
and how do you actually
beach people with it? And

584
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.380
so that's what I'm trying
to teach people. So how

585
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.690
did they, I'm just curious
how, how that person felt

586
00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.810
when you put that together?
Well, she actually was one

587
00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.990
of my people who went
through my beta course because

588
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.880
it was a beta and
it was, you know, very

589
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.460
sort of generalized overview. I
didn't do a lot of

590
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.730
like specific tech walkthroughs. So
she was someone who, you

591
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.140
know, never touched WordPress. She's
a, she's an amazing artist.

592
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.160
Does beautiful paintings, never really
touched WordPress or, or technology.

593
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.130
And so for her, it
was very overwhelming even to

594
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.770
go on wordpress.com and create
an account and try to

595
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.320
figure out. So we just
sat down and said, okay,

596
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.260
you know, we know you're
wanting to showcase your art.

597
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.720
So let's find a good
theme for that. I showed

598
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.930
her how to, you know,
buy her domain name, how

599
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.390
to point it at her
new site, so that it

600
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.840
says, you know, her domain
name and not her domain,

601
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.190
not wordpress.com. And as I
walked her through those things,

602
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.270
she could see like, we're
really just filling in forms.

603
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:57.720
Right. You know, even changing
the DNS for the, for

604
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.720
the domain. It was like,
once I walked her through,

605
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.150
it's like, well, you're really
just copying this thing here.

606
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.270
And you're pasting it over
here in your domain, registrar

607
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.530
in the right place. It's
not something technical. It's like,

608
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.760
if you can follow directions
and just go step by

609
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.300
step, it's something that you
can do without being technical,

610
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.990
without having to code, but
having no having no context

611
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.750
or experience or background, she
needed that step by step

612
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.430
walk through. And so, you
know, she was thrilled and

613
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.180
now she has something where
really, she just needs to

614
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.460
learn how to like how
to add her images and,

615
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.200
and go in and add
the text and all that

616
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.680
kind of stuff, which is,
I think more to most

617
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.060
people. That's very cool. I'm
glad that your, your, your

618
00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.430
new project is a, it
sounds like it's offer to

619
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:50.230
a good start. Yeah. We're
26% funded at this point.

620
00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.700
And the fundraiser goes until
April 20th. So, and then if

621
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.190
we, if things go really
well and we go over

622
00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:01.780
then for every $500 over
the goal, which is $12,000,

623
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.240
I'm going to give away
a scholarship to a small

624
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.200
business owner to join the
course. Very cool. So people

625
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.040
