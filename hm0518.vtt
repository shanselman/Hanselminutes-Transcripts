com. It's Hansel minutes. Our
weekly discussion with web developer

9
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.480
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number

10
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.250
518. In this episode, Scott
talks with maker and robotics

11
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.300
enthusiast Simone yet. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

12
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.630
another episode of Hansel minutes
today. I'm talking with Simone

13
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.180
yet, who is calling in
from Sweden? How are you?

14
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.460
I'm good. Kudos on pronouncing
my last name correctly. Oh,

15
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.650
well I've only been practicing
for the last hour, so

16
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.450
thank you. Ma'am So your,
your, your last name is

17
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.410
spelled G I E R
T Zed. And that's something

18
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.220
that we can find you
on Twitter and on YouTube.

19
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.110
Do you consider yourself a
tuber? I think I changed

20
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.230
my title. Like other people
change socks, but right now

21
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.240
I'm going with inventor in
YouTube or Nice adventuring YouTuber,

22
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.250
Inventor, inventor, Inventor. Okay. And
do you, do you do

23
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.070
Arduino? You do, you do
robots and it seems like

24
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.650
one of your robots is
going viral right now. Isn't

25
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.640
it? I think, I mean,
I think a few of

26
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.040
them have actually gone viral.
Do you think your most,

27
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.820
your most famous robot is
right now? It's definitely. I

28
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.830
made this alarm clock that
slaps you in the face

29
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.620
to wake you up. And
that way it depends a

30
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.010
little bit, but I think
it's around 80 million views. Not

31
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.470
unfortunately, not on my YouTube
channel, but, and it's on

32
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.020
Facebook and they accounted a
little bit different, but still

33
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.460
it's. Yeah, that one just
exploded. That's gotta be frustrating

34
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.560
though. If they're gonna understand
that when you put a

35
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.480
video on YouTube, you get
the credit and you get

36
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.940
the views and you get
the sense of accomplishment when

37
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.760
it goes viral on Facebook,
people tend to copy it

38
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.760
and then you don't even
know how many total views

39
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.220
it has. Yeah. It's a
little bit like that, but

40
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.770
I'm kind of, I'm okay
with it. I'm just more

41
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.470
frustrated that it didn't please.
Normally I put like a

42
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.200
watermark or water stamp on
them, so you can kind

43
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.880
of see like, Oh, this
is some on the edge,

44
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.490
but I didn't do that
with that one. So it's

45
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.830
just like kind of floating
out there all alone and

46
00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.070
people can't, they can't find
me. So one robot that

47
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.710
slaps you in the face,
it hangs on your wall,

48
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.560
the alarm goes off and
then basically it spins and

49
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.620
it hits you when you
make a robot like that.

50
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.800
Like, do you, is that,
is it mostly for the

51
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.810
gag and the building and
the joy of the building?

52
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.720
Or are there robots that
you have built and kept

53
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.250
and they have become a
part of your life and

54
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.690
they're being used regularly? I
think that's such a funny,

55
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.730
I've done a lot of
different interviews and people always,

56
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.500
I mean, I always crack
up when people are like,

57
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.960
Oh, your projects for fun.
We're like, are these supposed

58
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.610
to be serious? No. Like
the one where like the

59
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.440
Spanish talk show you did,
you know, that was like

60
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.000
bad, but you know, But
it's funny. Like if somebody

61
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.540
asks me, like how, how
often do you use your

62
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
toothbrush helmet? So basically I
made like a, I took

63
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.600
the robot arm on a
helmet and added toothbrush to

64
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.220
it and he brushes my
teeth, but it only does

65
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.740
the front teeth. It's kind
of violent. And I'm just

66
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.600
like, it just cracks me
up. The people think that

67
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.680
I actually use these I've
I've actually, I've actually never

68
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.100
used the wakeup machine to
wake up in the morning.

69
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.000
So I feel bad that
you're saying that it's not

70
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.220
a unique question to ask.
Do you ever use it?

71
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.140
It's fine. Obviously you don't,
but, but I want you

72
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.380
to also recognize that that
seems to be the most

73
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.780
useful of them. Like I'm
thinking to myself, I could

74
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.270
use a robot that slaps
me in the face to

75
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.750
wake me up. It's probably
the one that's most requested

76
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.840
to buy too. I think
people want to buy them.

77
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.570
Yeah. It always, it always
cracks me up, but I,

78
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.360
yeah, they, they, they want
to buy them or want

79
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.330
me to build one for
them. That's like special in

80
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.150
some way that like, it
slaps you when you snore

81
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.190
or anything like that. Maybe,
maybe you need to just

82
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.570
make it like an art
installation where people can come

83
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.120
and see them all in
one place. I think like

84
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.060
I've been thinking about like
art installation and museum and

85
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.710
stuff like an application. Cause
I have like a fair

86
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.890
collection of projects I built
now, but they're all kind

87
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.000
of brittle. I don't think
that they, like, if you,

88
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.380
if you take them out
like that, they really got

89
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.740
to last for a long
time. So that's interesting that

90
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.170
you, that you bring that
up because I feel like

91
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.600
when I do making stuff
and I'm sitting here with,

92
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.150
I've got like five Arduinos
to my right and a

93
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.760
bunch of relays to my
left and I'm surrounded by

94
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.350
all this stuff and I'll
go and I'll build something

95
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.750
Sounds like R and B
song. Yeah. That's actually, It's

96
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.510
in my re to my
left. It is pretty nerdy.

97
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.550
Actually we should, we should,
we should drop the track

98
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.020
after, after the show. So
I'm thinking about all this,

99
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.780
this stuff. And I'm like,
you know, I build things

100
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.060
and I get them to
work and I have that,

101
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.840
that led moment where it's
like at work, but then

102
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.140
I realized that it probably
works twice. And then it's

103
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.630
really so fragile that it
breaks apart. So getting it

104
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.790
to work and getting it
to be a real thing

105
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.350
that you could keep going
for and they could keep

106
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.090
being functional, I think is
there's a big difference, I

107
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.330
think. And also it's just
not fun in the same

108
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.800
way, Making it work versus
making it work well. Yeah,

109
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.310
I think I just kind
of like doing it where

110
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.250
it's like, okay, it has
to work Five times. It's

111
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.510
kind of the limit. Or
I think I have like

112
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.880
10 times for my robots.
It just has to work

113
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.220
10 times. And then it's,
it's kind of okay. Like,

114
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.160
and that's just fine, but
when you start getting into

115
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.370
like, Oh, where is like,
is there like tension built

116
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.250
up somewhere? Or to me
that just kind of brings

117
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.540
the joy out of it.
I just want it to

118
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.070
work like a set amount
of times and then I

119
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.090
can just leave it and
build the next thing. Okay.

120
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.850
So this means that you
are, if you got, if

121
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:46.980
you had a, do you
have a job? I shouldn't

122
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.580
ask you that. But if
you had a job, you

123
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.590
would be like chief inventor,
you'd come up with a

124
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.990
concept. You blow everyone's mind,
you'd sell it to the

125
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.870
CEO and then you'd give
it to the engineer whose

126
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.880
job it is to like,
make it work. But you

127
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.830
had the brilliant idea and
then you move on to

128
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.270
the next brilliant idea. Yeah.
Kind of. But I also

129
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.150
want to build the prototype.
Yeah. That's what I mean.

130
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.790
Yeah. Well said, Yeah. Prototype
I'm the prototyping person. Yeah.

131
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.190
It's just like, I'm not
very structured person. I'm much

132
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.100
better with prototypes because it's
just like quick and dirty.

133
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.770
It's just going to work
and then I, and then

134
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.720
I can do that and
then somebody else can actually

135
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.230
figure out how to make
it work. So I'm looking

136
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.850
at these, some of these
gifts and one of the

137
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.250
ones that one of the
Spanish talk show that was

138
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.010
a couple of months ago,
you, you, you took this,

139
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.860
you have the helmet and
it basically brushes your teeth.

140
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.820
How much is going on
there? Is it simply a,

141
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.890
is there an Arduino or
is it just a motor

142
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.310
with some gears? How, how
complicated is a kind of

143
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.060
a mid level invention like
that compared to, It's funny

144
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.220
with that, with that, because
in that talk show, it's

145
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.530
actually not me using it.
So I brought it to

146
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.800
the Spanish talk show and,
and, and I get there

147
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.870
and I'm thinking that I'm
going to demo, I'm going

148
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.570
to demo all of my
products, but then there's just

149
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.760
like this other girl who
gets to show them. So

150
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.300
she actually, and like, I've
never actually watched that toothbrush.

151
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.790
So she's basically just using
my toothbrush. I didn't tell

152
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.660
her about it, but, but,
but something like the two,

153
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.490
three tenements in two, three
times it was actually really

154
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.640
straight forward because I didn't
build the arm itself. Like

155
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.460
the robot arm itself was
a finished robot arm kit

156
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.400
that I just kind of
mounted on a skateboard helmet

157
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.100
and put a toothbrush on
it. So that one was

158
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.990
actually really Okay. So, so
for people who are, who

159
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.330
are listening and are thinking
that they want to build

160
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.360
something, not all of these
kinds of things are going

161
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.960
to involve programming and soldering.
Sometimes it's just having the

162
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.110
boldness to put two things
together or three things together

163
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.820
and go for it. All
of them incorporate some sort

164
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.050
of programming. Okay. So the
toothbrush doesn't toothbrush, Ryan does

165
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.200
Programming. Yeah. Yeah. It's controlled
by an Arduino board. Okay.

166
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.260
Okay. So talk to me
about that sense of what's

167
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.880
involved. So I just used
an Arduino UNO and like

168
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.690
a servo motor shield and
just use that to control

169
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.430
the server motors in the
robot arm. And I just

170
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.160
program it to do like
this little brushing sequence that

171
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.280
I have. So it's nothing
very complicated. And I think

172
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.770
like if somebody wanted to
build it, I might mean

173
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.440
my sketch or the, the,
the program that I used

174
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.230
is, is online. So you
could just download it and

175
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.250
upload it to their own
toothbrush helmet. But, but I

176
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.550
think almost all of them
involve programming. Not all of

177
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.230
them involve soldering, a lot
of breadboard action going on

178
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.680
too, Really. And, you know,
again, that gets to the

179
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.820
point about prototyping versus, you
know, shipping a finished, finished

180
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.940
product when you're inventing in,
you're playing, you know, you

181
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.550
don't have to overthink it
to you. You just have

182
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.320
to like have fun and
get it to work. And

183
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.270
a breadboard is an okay
thing to use, I guess.

184
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.820
Yeah. I think, I mean,
you're always going to think

185
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.340
about what your purpose is
building stuff is. And to

186
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.050
me, it's just like, I
mean, I have a lot

187
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.360
of fun when I build
stuff, but it's also, I

188
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.000
mean, I just want to
make like fun, interesting content

189
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.340
for people. And then it
doesn't, I mean, it doesn't

190
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.440
need to be something that
I can actually send to

191
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:21.530
a factory and be like,
Hey, make 20,000. So Kind

192
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.600
of funny. I would just
want to want the reply.

193
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.860
I wonder what they would
want. What is the payoff

194
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.990
for you? The replies and
the, and the, the, the,

195
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.550
the interaction with people on
YouTube. I think it's, it's

196
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.370
a part of it. Most
definitely. But a lot of

197
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.760
the interactions are just like,
man. I mean, I think

198
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.180
the most common comment I
get is like marry me.

199
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.620
And to me, that's just
like, Oh gosh, It just

200
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.140
doesn't mean anything. It really
doesn't mean anything, but then

201
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.420
you get the occasional, like
I had this like eight

202
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.390
year old girl email me
and be like, Hey, I

203
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.450
also want to be an
inventor. And like sending me

204
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.210
photos of her projects and
stuff like that. So occasionally

205
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.010
you get one of those
where like people who are

206
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.790
electrical engineers or like, Hey,
you inspire me like at

207
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.970
my work. Or like, Hey,
you got me to like,

208
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.190
bring out my raspberry PI.
That's been sitting in my

209
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.980
closet for the longest time.
So those are kind of

210
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.380
the wines that actually make
it, make it worth it,

211
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.930
or that I like feel
in my heart. But a

212
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.940
lot of them are you
just like, man? Okay. Yeah.

213
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.450
It's just a person just
commented some bullshit, some something,

214
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.430
sorry. I promise not to
cuss. It's all good. It's

215
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:40.820
all good. I have never
had a, a, a marriage

216
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.770
proposal. And that is the
thing about the internet though.

217
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.610
I retweeted one of my
colleagues, a woman in Austin

218
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.770
who does some amazing work
and she made a video

219
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.040
and I hit retweet. And
it was like elapsed time,

220
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.420
three minutes before someone commented
on how pretty she was

221
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.300
and not the like amazing
piece of content that she

222
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.860
created a, well, I churn
out content regularly. And the

223
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.260
worst I've ever had is
someone said, why did you

224
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.980
wear that shirt two days
in a row? Yeah, it's

225
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.890
I mean, I always, I,
I try to shy away

226
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.470
from talking about what it's
like being a woman in

227
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.630
tech, because I think that
there are so many people

228
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.190
who do it a lot
better than me. And it's

229
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.700
also not my main focus,
but there are definitely differences

230
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.480
in like the response you
get. I mean, 90% of

231
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.890
my subscribers are men. And
I think the vast majority

232
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.210
are, I think 90, 90%
are men between 25 and

233
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:41.460
34. So Yeah. It sounds
like people on YouTube though.

234
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.080
Yeah. Maybe, maybe that's the
thing, but it's but yeah,

235
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.440
definitely majority dudes and also
the content I make. I

236
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.220
mean, it's unfortunately a lot
of dudes who are interested

237
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.120
in robotics and not as
many girls. Well, hopefully we'll

238
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.430
do, do what we can
to fix, to fix that.

239
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.330
So what I want to
talk about is the first

240
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.570
time you built something, that
first led moment, and you

241
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.970
had a better name for
the led moment. I call

242
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.080
it my love at first
blink because I'm really, and

243
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.110
I remember it so clearly
because I got in my

244
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.410
first Arduino UNO, and I
had this really grand idea.

245
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.900
I wanted to build like
a physical website and move

246
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.390
stuff over the internet, whatever.
I never actually got around

247
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.790
to building it, but I
just really remember. I had

248
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.960
that moment where I was
like, I made that tiny

249
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.860
little led blink on the
Arduino board. And, and I,

250
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.290
like, I tried it, I
changed the duration and it

251
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.750
like blinked a little bit
slower. And it was really

252
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:48.060
low at first blink 23
I'm 25 now. So it

253
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.520
was two years ago. I
had never held a soldering

254
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.490
iron two years ago. Really?
Yeah. Well, he saw you,

255
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.420
you paused a little bit
and I want to talk

256
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.220
about that for a second.
You paused a little bit

257
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.920
like that was not something
to be proud of. Like

258
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.560
there are people who I
guess solder at age four,

259
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.470
maybe. I don't know if
we're giving toddlers soldering irons

260
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.190
right now, but there's lots
of things that I think

261
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.740
people start when they're 20
or they're whatever. So you

262
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.980
didn't, you weren't soldering 10.
I was not soldering a

263
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.910
10. And how did you
find yourself on that day

264
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.200
when you're 20 putting a
light together and Gore 22

265
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.730
going, putting a light together
and going, Oh, wait a

266
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.870
second. Like where you at
walk me through that. It

267
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.130
was actually a kind of,
I never thought that I

268
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.440
would kind of have that
thing where it's like, okay,

269
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.720
this is actually what I
really want to do. But

270
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.180
I just really, like the
first time I played with

271
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.580
an Arduino, I was like,
okay, this is what I

272
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.200
actually really want to do.
It was, I just knew

273
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.850
for sure that it was
what I wanted to work

274
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:58.220
with and just working with
billing. Yeah. I had actually

275
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.860
gotten, because I had this
idea of this physical website

276
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.770
and it took me about
two months before I found

277
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.800
Arduino. I had like, it
was just like the weirdest

278
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.470
detour, because I didn't really
know anyone who was into

279
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.600
electronics. So I didn't have
anyone who could guide me,

280
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.170
but I remember like I
contacted this because like I

281
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.870
wanted, I wanted, it's like
somebody pressed a button on

282
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.510
a website. I wanted like
a motor in real life

283
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.020
to move. And I remembered
that I'd seen this website

284
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.840
where you can play with
cats in a cat shelter

285
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.310
online. So you could like
go into a live broadcast

286
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.470
from one of their rooms
and you could like move

287
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.530
the toys that they have
there. And I contacted that

288
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.780
company. It was like, Hey,
how have you built this?

289
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.150
And they were like, yeah,
it's kind of secret. We

290
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.210
could do it for you
would be around. Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.340
They were like, we're, we're
the only company who actually

292
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.130
does this. And, and I
think they gave me like

293
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.560
an, like, they were like,
yeah, we could do one

294
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:57.920
for you for like $10,000.
And I was like, yeah.

295
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.560
And I, and I remember
I was looking at like,

296
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.950
getting, like, for some reason
I was looking into getting

297
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:08.090
like one of these electrical
pencil sharpeners that you like,

298
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.400
that was on a USB
port. And I was like,

299
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.220
Oh, can I control the
power to the USB port

300
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.630
over the internet? So I
was just like, very like

301
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.030
going on this crazy detour.
And then I just had

302
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.860
somebody who was like, Hey,
but haven't you checked out?

303
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.590
Or do we knows. And,
and that was when I

304
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.360
got myself there and ordering
to start a kid. So

305
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.730
I think in some way
I was like mentally prepared

306
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.580
for getting blown away because
it was something that I'd

307
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.890
been looking for without knowing
that that was the thing

308
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.770
I was looking for. So
I was probably more like

309
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:42.110
susceptible to having that like,
Oh, but it was actually

310
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.610
that, that, that kind of
feeling, but your brain was

311
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.640
ready for it. My brain
was ready for it. Most

312
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.590
of all, I think like,
because I've been thinking about

313
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.990
this, like what would have
happened if somebody would have

314
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.210
just put an Arduino in
my lap and been like,

315
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.800
Oh, Hey, this is a
cool thing. You can do

316
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.470
cool stuff with it. And
I think like, probably I

317
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.880
would have been like, Oh
yeah, that is a cool

318
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.460
thing. But when it was
something I hadn't been looking

319
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.430
for it. And it just
meant that like, when I

320
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.270
found it, it just got
to me a lot more.

321
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.240
This episode of Hansel minutes
is brought to you by

322
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.380
brain tree code for easy
online payments. If you're building

323
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.570
a mobile app and you're
searching for a simple payment

324
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:27.280
solution, check out brain tree,
the brain tree v.zero SDK

325
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.910
makes it easy to offer
multiple mobile payment types. So

326
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.930
you can start accepting PayPal,
Apple pay Bitcoin, Venmo, credit

327
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:39.280
cards, and more all with
a single integration, one small

328
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.140
snippet of code. And you're
set up in less than

329
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.840
10 minutes. If you don't
have time, you can give

330
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.300
them a call. They'll even
handle the integration for you

331
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.580
and walk you through it.
The SDK supports seven dotnet

332
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.800
node, Java, Perl, PHP, Python,
and Ruby elegant code clear

333
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.240
documentation to learn more. And

335
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.900
Do you have a favorite
Arduino? Like I was messing

336
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.240
with one yesterday and I
got it from Intel. They

337
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.310
gave me a box of
a couple of Arduinos and

338
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.080
I thought it was an
UNO and it's not, it's

339
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.140
like an Intel Curie. So
I think it's a, basically

340
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.950
an UNO with a gyroscope
built in. Oh, cool. So

341
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.500
it's got like, got a
Bluetooth and a gyroscope, but

342
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.530
otherwise it's indistinguishable from an
Arduino, but there was a

343
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.300
moment there where I, like,
I had no idea why

344
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.950
this wouldn't work. I was
freaking out. And then I

345
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.640
was like, Oh, there's like
50 different kinds of Arduinos.

346
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.370
I didn't even know that.
Yeah. It's kind of a

347
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:53.190
jungle. I think. I mean,
the Arduino that I've worked

348
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.650
the most way, this called
the light blue bean. And

349
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.600
that is because I worked
at a company that makes

350
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.660
them, so after I had
my like ha or Adreno

351
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.140
moment, I started just building
a lot of stuff. And

352
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.180
then I got a job
as a maker in residence

353
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.330
at a company in San
Francisco and they make an

354
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.820
Arduino boards called the light
blue bean, which has Bluetooth

355
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.060
lower energy. And it's just
like this really cute teal

356
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.850
colored thing. And I think
that, I mean, I miss

357
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.610
probably say that wine. I
don't work there anymore, so

358
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.440
I'm not getting paid to
say this in any way,

359
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.960
but it's just like the
one that I've used the

360
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.360
most and it's kind of
a Homer do you know?

361
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.390
But otherwise I just liked
the Volvo of Arduino, which

362
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.530
is the Arduino. Now I
think it's a trooper. One

363
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.840
of the things that's cool
about the light blue bean

364
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.900
and our little, little tiny
boards, like it is right

365
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.420
there are doing those, but
they're super tiny and they

366
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.510
have a battery. Does that
make design a lot simpler?

367
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.260
I mean, the light blue
beam runs over the coin

368
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.900
cell battery. So it's, it's
kind of nice if you

369
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.310
want to make, and it
has like a built in

370
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.570
accelerometer, temperature sensor, and it's
just a very nice thing

371
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.240
if you want to make
wearables. But I think it

372
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.460
kind of runs out of
batteries quickly. Like if you're

373
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.340
running on a battery, it's
going to be out in

374
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.500
a couple of days or
weeks, depending on how you

375
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.440
use it. So I'm not
sure how useful that would

376
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.340
actually be longterm, but it's
still it's. It opens up

377
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.170
new possibilities when I'm making
stuff. I have like my,

378
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.040
my GoTo project that I
make over and over again.

379
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.120
So like I have this
garage door that I always

380
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.880
leave open. I drive away
with the garage open. So

381
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.790
I want to make a
thing that has an accelerometer

382
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.440
and I tape it to
the garage door. The garage

383
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.350
door opens the thing rotates.
And then it texts me

384
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.170
to say, you left the
garage door open. So every

385
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.760
time a new thing comes
out, whether it be a

386
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.450
blue bean or whether it
be a photon or whatever,

387
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.400
or a raspberry pie, I
make that same project over

388
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.730
and over again, to see
how easy it was. Do

389
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.530
you have a GoTo project,
which is the one you

390
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.610
make over and over again
to see how to test

391
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.670
new stuff? No, I haven't.
And I haven't actually, I've

392
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.990
actually not got into using
that many. I'm very, rather

393
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.850
than being like, Oh, I
want to try out this

394
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.430
new gadget. I'm very, Oh,
I want to build this

395
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.490
stuff or this thing, like,
I just need to find

396
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.280
the best platform to use
it. So I don't really

397
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.800
have that, that process of
trying stuff out. I'm just

398
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.160
very like focused on the
thing that I currently want

399
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.230
to build. Interesting. Okay. So
you're, you decided are doing

400
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.310
those, your platform and now
that you understand, or do

401
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.640
we know, then you move
up to the next level

402
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.650
of abstraction, then you start
thinking about the thing you

403
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.050
want to build, because now
you're, that's, that's your preferred

404
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.280
pencil, I think. Yeah, probably.
And I mean, I need

405
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.500
to think outside of the
Arduino box a little bit,

406
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.390
because there are some times
when I've used them in

407
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.820
projects where I don't actually
need to, like, for example,

408
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.700
in the wakeup machine, I
would have actually not had

409
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.530
to use one, but I
put one in there because

410
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.790
I'm just like, Oh, of
course you need it. But,

411
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.400
but yeah, it's kind of,
yeah, that's kind of my

412
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.740
pencil, but at the same
time, I think, I mean,

413
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.780
I have a lot of
products that I'm not sure

414
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.120
how I'm going to build.
So I don't think I'm

415
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.430
very limited to thinking like,
Oh, this is what I

416
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.450
actually know. Well, that's why
I was asking the question

417
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.490
earlier that might not have
been, it may not have

418
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.530
sounded clever at the time,
but what I was trying

419
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:19.920
to ask about, no, what
I'm talking about is that

420
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:25.410
the, the helmet with the
toothbrush thing, I assumed it

421
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.380
was a motor going in
one direction with a gear

422
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.290
that was switching directions. So
I assumed it was entirely

423
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.050
a mechanical. And then, so
in my mind, in my

424
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.580
mind, I designed it one
way. And then you said

425
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.040
there's an Arduino and you're
switching directions using the servo.

426
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.640
And then my whole brain
kind of rotated 90 degrees

427
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.850
because we'll think about it,
right? We both are sitting

428
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.180
here. We're talking about this,
the solution, this crucial solution

429
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:52.020
that the universe needs a
toothbrush that crushes your face

430
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.820
for you it's mean it's
amazing, right? We need to

431
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.230
productize this. I designed it
in one way, thinking not

432
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.900
art. We know not MCAT,
not in any way computerized.

433
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.460
And then you said, well,
I've got programming and all

434
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.880
my stuff. And that opened
my mind and that's going

435
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.610
to influence that little interaction
is going to influence how

436
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.580
I make stuff. It's interesting
because it is, I mean,

437
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.320
you do kind of get
stuck with the tools that

438
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.750
you know, or me, you
build stuff out or the

439
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.990
things you often know. Like,
I mean, when I was

440
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.670
in the first of what
I built, I built when

441
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.700
I was eight years old.
And that was just, I

442
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.140
just had this idea that
I wanted to build a

443
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.540
robot, but I had no
idea how to, so I

444
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.060
just got a block of
wood and I drilled a

445
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.800
hole through it and I
put a stick through the

446
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.230
hole and the way it
was a robot was that

447
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.660
if I twisted the stick
in one end, it also

448
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.000
moved on the other end.
And to me, it's just

449
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.270
like a fun thing, because
like working with wood was

450
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.550
the only, I mean, it
was the only material that

451
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.850
I knew. So I was
like, of course, I'm going

452
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.760
to build a robot out
of wood and maybe we're

453
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.580
still, we're just grown up
versions of that right now.

454
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.170
I like that. I think
we are grown up versions

455
00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.610
of like, you know, it's
just, we're just, it's just

456
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.230
tall grade school at this
point. And that's okay. We've

457
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.390
got some, you get some
great pictures on your Twitter

458
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.060
timeline and one of them,
which I totally recognize cause

459
00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.270
I've been there myself. And
I think people who are

460
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.410
makers have been there, which
is the, what in the

461
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.570
world do you have in
your bag? How much trouble

462
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.150
do you have taking like
a severed arm and a

463
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:19.330
motor and a helmet with
a toothbrush through airport security?

464
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.840
It's actually, it was a
really fun experience because I

465
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.230
checked it in a special
luggage because stuff is kind

466
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.750
of fragile. And also I
was just worried that they

467
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.430
were going to give me
a mess or that they

468
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.160
were gonna give me trouble
about it. And, and the

469
00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.350
guy was just like looking
at it and he's like,

470
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.250
wait, like what, what is
that? Is that two knives

471
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.400
from this like chopping machine?
I both. And, and he

472
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:48.370
was like, yeah, yeah, they're
actually nice. And then I

473
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.120
realized I have like the
most cartoon verse bond. It's

474
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:57.520
basically like a metal box
with a clock attached to

475
00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.060
it and that's filled with
electronics and it just looks

476
00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.540
like, it just looks like
this very cartoon version of,

477
00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.680
of a Bob. But, and
I was just like, I

478
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.560
can explain. And I got
to like pitch my YouTube

479
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.080
channel and I was like,
this is, yeah, I do.

480
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:16.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The
knives. How did you make

481
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.270
it through with knives? Like
they look like actual kitchen.

482
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:23.230
I didn't take it as
my carry on. Oh, okay.

483
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.830
It can even bring in
Arduino as a carry on.

484
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.580
Oh, I've done that before
makeup, all sorts of stories.

485
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.540
They'll believe, whatever you say,
you say I'm diabetic. I

486
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.840
said it was an insulin
pump and they were like,

487
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.460
they're like, Oh really? And
I was like, yeah, it's

488
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.690
new. I mean, it's so
bad. You know? I mean,

489
00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.930
whatever. Like I took, I
have a recorder for my

490
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.260
podcasts called a zoom and
it has microphones that are

491
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.850
situated to 45 degree alternating
angles. And I had like

492
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.730
a 30 minute interaction where
they refuse to admit that

493
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.820
it wasn't a taser because
of the angles. You know

494
00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.070
what I mean? Because it's
got these crossover metal pieces

495
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.290
that, and I'm like, it's
really not a taser. And

496
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.090
I ended up realizing that
all I needed to do

497
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.300
was just record them and
play it back. But then

498
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.550
I thought to myself now
the bad guys are gonna

499
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:22.540
make tasers that can record.
That's hilarious. How stupid do

500
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.860
they feel after that? I
probably don't think we should

501
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:32.740
talk about airport security and
their level of stupidity, but

502
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.990
it does make them think
about when the bad guys

503
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.170
learned how to make stuff.
Like, you know, It looks

504
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.920
like other stuff. Yeah. Then
it's on. And it's a

505
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.710
problem. What are you making?
What are you making right

506
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.290
now? Because I'm looking at
your video where you're in

507
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.720
the Spanish talk show they're
interviewing you. Is that your

508
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.630
lab, is that like your
master pick your secret layer

509
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.250
behind you when you're on
the talk show that you're

510
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.170
like talking and it looks
like you're in your kitchen

511
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.020
or in your garage somewhere,
and there's just stuff behind

512
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.290
you. I'm curious how neat
your workspace is. I think

513
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.010
is the question I have
an office or it's a

514
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:14.570
friend's office where we're working,
but right now I've just

515
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.650
been I've, haven't had time
to build stuff as of

516
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.810
late, because I had just
been replying to emails, which

517
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.780
is like the most boring
for her work. And I've

518
00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.540
just had like this, it
feels like playing whack-a-mole because

519
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.240
like, I just like whacked
down one email and then

520
00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:34.910
it just Multiplies. But I,
and I'm kind of secret

521
00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.190
about my product. So I
have actually, I have, I

522
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.990
have one thing on the
way, but I don't really

523
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:43.460
talk about Okay. That's okay.
Top secret stuff. No, I

524
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.870
totally understood. Totally understood. So,
so you've got secret projects,

525
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.790
you're always making stuff. Do
you ever worry that you

526
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.920
might run out of stuff
to, to think about or

527
00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:53.840
to invent? Cause I feel
like I go in fits

528
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.850
and starts. I don't know.
Yeah. Sometimes I can, I

529
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.100
can worry about it, but
at the same time I

530
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.330
just have a lot of
ideas. I think it's probably

531
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:10.310
like, yeah. When one of
my everyday superpowers like boring

532
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.670
everyday life superpowers that I
just have this constant stream

533
00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.630
of ideas. So right now
I'm not very worried about

534
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.640
it, but maybe after some
time, I think, I think

535
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.620
more I'm, I'm more worried
that I'm going to run

536
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.700
out of material, You know?
And just when I, I

537
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.840
think that too sometimes, and
then like VR helmets come

538
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.580
out and then I realized
that we are living in

539
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.480
the future that are doing,
those are like $15 and

540
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.570
we're living in the future.
Like there's no better time

541
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.060
to be making stuff. Yeah.
It's a good time to

542
00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.440
be alive. Did you see
the video of the little

543
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.640
video clip of the woman
with her colleague behind her

544
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:53.600
who had a VR helmet
on and a leap motion,

545
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.260
IRR controller tapes to the
front of it. And he

546
00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.140
was deep in, in VR
world. And she's just kind

547
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.720
of mugging at the camera
saying this is the future.

548
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.310
No, I haven't seen that.
She's she's a VR expert.

549
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.410
I'll send it to you.
But basically it's starting to

550
00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.930
make me think about, is
technology going to make us

551
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:18.440
more social or less social,
you know, different way. But

552
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.560
then there was that picture
of a Zuckerberg walking by

553
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.260
everyone who all had those
VR helmets on, like, we're

554
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.150
going to be standing next
to each other. Like right

555
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.310
now we'll sit next to
our significant other and text

556
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.130
them on the couch. We're
going to do that with

557
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:40.070
VR. It's a different form
of communication. Your text can

558
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:45.160
reveal or stuff that you
can't do. In words, you

559
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.470
have emojis in texts. You
don't have spoken emojis yet.

560
00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:57.000
That's an idea spoken to
Moses. Yeah. I already have.

561
00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.130
How do we bring emojis
into our everyday lives or

562
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.450
into like the, the face
to face interaction? No, but

563
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:07.440
I think, I think, I
think people are social. It's

564
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.140
just the way that we
hang out is going to

565
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.440
change. And also, I just
really hope that people won't

566
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.890
fall in love with AI.
Really? You're worried about AI

567
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.740
more than VR. Why, what,
what is it about AI?

568
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.860
I think VR, I mean
it's still or not, not,

569
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.530
I don't know. I think
it's, as long as it's

570
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.470
like human interaction, it feels
like in the foundation, human

571
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:35.580
interaction is a good thing.
Like me, we do good

572
00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.830
stuff when we interact with
each other. But I think

573
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.160
if you just get stuck
in, in, in something with

574
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.590
like, if, what if all
you did was hanging out

575
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:52.990
with an AI? Oh, wow.
You're right. No, because it

576
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:59.460
was disturbing because he spent
the entire movie alone. He's

577
00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.640
still old, but maybe you
can have like a good

578
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:07.050
giving relationship with, with something
like that. But it's just

579
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.790
to me, I mean, like,
I just know that what

580
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.400
actually the stuff that makes
me happy is like the

581
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.920
people around me that I
like and making them happy.

582
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.000
And, but maybe you can
get that same exchange with,

583
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.210
with a robot. I'm not
sure I'm not getting it

584
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.540
from my robots yet though.
Yeah. Well, apparently not. If

585
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.570
they're slapping you in the
face every morning, They're all

586
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:31.950
kind of violent and meme,
So, okay. So you've got

587
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.770
secret projects coming. You've just
hit a hundred thousand subscribers

588
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.520
on YouTube. So congratulations on
that. That is that's I

589
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.710
guess all the money starts
rolling in now. So congratulations

590
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:44.790
on that. I wish I
wish. And you said that

591
00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.390
you were a, a maker
in residence. That's an amazing

592
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.120
title that there was that
basically like please go and

593
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.210
play and have fun in
our lab. Yeah, it was

594
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.850
just, my job was just
to build cool stuff using,

595
00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:00.510
using their product. What a
dream job. Yeah. It was

596
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.150
a pretty good one. That
was fantastic. It was good

597
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.800
because like, and also it
was, it was great because

598
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.280
I didn't know that much
about electronics. So I, it

599
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.720
was just like school for
me because I learned so

600
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.470
much from working in a
team of electrical engineers. Wow.

601
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.560
That is amazing. I, how
do, how do others get

602
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.410
to do that kind of
stuff? I think that working

603
00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.450
with others is so important.
Like people who are listening

604
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.550
and thinking about making, how
much do you think that

605
00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.370
they can do just alone
in their garage versus how

606
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.790
much should they find someone
to pair with a friend

607
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.350
would just sit there and
hold the soldering iron and

608
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:35.850
help. I think it's, it's
nice to have company. I

609
00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.740
think you can do a
lot of stuff by yourself.

610
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.730
I mean, it all depends
on in what Context you

611
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.170
work best. Yeah. I've always
felt that pairing go for

612
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.590
me is the two people
makes you three times as

613
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.910
productive, but I think everyone's
different. I think, I think

614
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.960
I'm actually less productive with
other people because I just

615
00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:01.790
get very excited about being
around people and when I

616
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.120
make them laugh and I
don't know, I think it's

617
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.180
kind of nice for me
when I'm alone, because then

618
00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.920
I can just kind of
get into like the sitting

619
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.510
at like this soldering Zen.
Very cool. Well, I really

620
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.060
appreciate you chatting with me
today. This is a, this

621
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.920
is exciting. And the stuff
that you build, it makes

622
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.080
me smile. And it also
reminds me that not everything

623
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.420
that I make needs to
be like perfectly useful. And

624
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.600
productizable, it's a reminder that
we really are just making

625
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.860
stuff to have fun. Okay.
Good reminder. So people can

626
00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.250
check you out online. And
this has been Simone yet.

627
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:44.410
Thanks so much. We'll see
you again next week. <inaudible>.
