00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.780
In this episode, Scott talks
designed with Microsoft UX expert,

7
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.380
Sarah Summers. This is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

8
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.740
Hansel minutes. And today I
am in Nebraska. Are we

9
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.160
in Nebraska? We are freaking
Lincoln, Nebraska, and I am

10
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.220
sitting down with Sarah Summers, who
is a user experience, expert

11
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.210
and evangelist work for, for
the big blue monster. You

12
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.060
worked for Microsoft, the desktop.
Why would you do such

13
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.910
a thing? You worked in
industry as a designer and

14
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.450
UX person for many years,
I understand in different agencies,

15
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.940
right? And then you come
here, this is where designers

16
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.210
come to ballet or no,
no, no, because there's some

17
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.580
of the best people I've
ever worked with. So I

18
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.270
really am, you know, focused
on who I get to

19
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.660
work with and working with
really smart people is very

20
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.820
important to me. So that's
why I'm at Microsoft. How

21
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.490
long have you been at
Microsoft? Almost three years. I've

22
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.650
been here. I was just
about four years. So not

23
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.980
that long. So what did
you do? Were you just

24
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.830
a designer? Always, always, yes.
Came out of the wind

25
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.580
that way. No. So I
went to Purdue and I

26
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.210
got a technology degree and
I focused on visual design,

27
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.460
UI design, interaction design. And
then I ended up doing

28
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.470
UX. We did a show
with Jeremy, Kratz the designer

29
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.990
who created my blog. And
we talked about his process

30
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.750
and the design process. And
that got me thinking about

31
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.490
design and how coders think
about it. Like from our

32
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.310
perspective, as in our ignorance,
I think would be fair

33
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.550
to say we see a
lot of, of pencil drawing

34
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.830
and a lot of, you
know, you got you guys,

35
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.070
I'm going to separate us
now. I'm afraid to forgive

36
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.230
me. I'm going to chop
us in half there's designers.

37
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.260
And then there's developers. I
see you guys doing a

38
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.880
lot of white boarding and
a lot of pencils and

39
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.650
a lot of balsamic and
a lot of, you know,

40
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.190
onion skinning and all this
kind of stuff and AB

41
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.380
testing and then things pop
out. But you're using terms

42
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.690
like designer, UI designer, UX
designer, this is all different,

43
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.550
but we don't think of
it. We, the coders don't

44
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.230
think of it as different.
Can you break it down

45
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.490
for me? The taxonomy of
design? Sure, sure. So I

46
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.420
think when you have, let's
say visual design, that's really

47
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.240
the, sort of the skinning
of the Doing the color

48
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.040
selection, testing, the, you know,
the different colors together, making

49
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.640
sure everything looks harmonious and
then UI design is really

50
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.240
taking that user interface and
making it understandable and, you

51
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.200
know, placing things, whether you
use a grid or, you

52
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.280
know, you, you go out
and test against what else

53
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.460
is out there with your
users. That's really that user

54
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.620
interface focus is really just
organizing that the pieces of

55
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.750
the application in a usable
way. And then user experience

56
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.670
design, I think specifically focuses
on the user and the

57
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.460
purpose and the meaning and
the value of what you're

58
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.090
making all centered around the
user and their tasks that

59
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.400
they're trying to accomplish, Like
the user's workflow and how

60
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.170
they move through their workflow.
And they move through their

61
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.450
day and have the design
affects that. Right, Right. So

62
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.050
it's, you know, one part
science and psychology and the

63
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.000
other part is, you know,
design and organization. I think

64
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.820
that developers sometimes think that
we live in a world

65
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.730
of data and hard numbers
and things either compile or

66
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.150
they don't. And in the
design world, it feels like,

67
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.270
and this is from our
perspective that what you guys

68
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.780
do is very subjective and,
you know, Hey, it kind

69
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.210
of looks nice. It kind
of doesn't look nice, but

70
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.480
are there hard numbers that
are like, based in like

71
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.180
psychology and how humans think
about things and how humans

72
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.490
eyes move that can really
be pointed to and say,

73
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.490
no, this is a good
design for these reasons rooted

74
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.400
in the lizard part of
your brain, or are you

75
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.230
guys just telling us stuff
and we just have to

76
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.670
believe you. Oh yeah, it's
really there. So a lot

77
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.050
of times you can test
and see it. And so

78
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.520
I would, I try to
do with developers is take

79
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.330
them out to do user
testing and research with me.

80
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.710
And so when you're sitting
down in, you know, someone's

81
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.590
office and you're watching them
work, you have that aha

82
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.410
moment where you can really
see the difference between like

83
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.190
something that isn't as well
laid out and something that,

84
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.860
you know, has been really
thoroughly researched and thought through.

85
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.320
And absolutely there's that lots
of great psychology lizard brain

86
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.130
stuff that we utilize to
prove out what we're doing

87
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.280
When it, when it, when
we look at blogs about

88
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.590
design, when we as developer
see things like we're watching,

89
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.240
we're all watching. I think
you don't work for the

90
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.730
windows organization, but you and
I are both learning about

91
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.010
the next version of windows
by reading the same blog

92
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.770
posts that the public is.
If you're not involved in

93
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.170
that at all, neither am
I, I don't know anyone

94
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.660
over there. I, I noticed
that they had a blog

95
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.950
post recently about redesigning Explorer
and putting in things about

96
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.520
the, the ribbon control and
people either love the ribbon

97
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.150
or they hate the ribbon.
And there's a lot of

98
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.800
just initial knee jerk reaction.
I call it that someone

99
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.490
moved my cheese, right. We've
gone to, we've moved everyone's

100
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.820
cheese, we're moving buttons around.
And that got me thinking

101
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.000
about design and how things
had to feel stale versus

102
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.180
things that we're comfortable with.
How can you say that

103
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.060
something is a good design
if everyone hates it? Right.

104
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.310
Well, you know, if people
don't realize is, you know,

105
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.970
some people hate the ribbon.
Some people love it, but

106
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.390
what the ribbon enabled everyone
to do is increase their

107
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.570
productivity. So they may be
grumbling about the ribbon, but

108
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.080
everyone's better and faster at
what they're doing all the

109
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.380
while we added. But over
200 additional features all baked

110
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.520
into the ribbons. You can
actually do more. So, yeah,

111
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.890
I think the ribbon always
had some controversy. And of

112
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.940
course, when Sanocki put that
blog post out where we

113
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.010
added it to explore, you
know, it makes sense because

114
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.460
what we're now trying to
do is say, well, you

115
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.880
know, the browser can be
a consumptive experience where we're

116
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.950
just going out and we're
looking at stuff, reading things,

117
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.770
or it can be a
creation experience where we're going

118
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.120
to, you know, expand up,
pull the ribbon down and

119
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.300
do work in browser. You
know, that's really interesting that

120
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.310
you bring that up your
act. I kind of thought

121
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.660
I came up with this
on my own, but you've

122
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.510
actually echoed words back to
me that I've said in

123
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.420
my head, when I was
talking to someone about the,

124
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.910
the iPad and they said,
well, you know, can I

125
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.170
do some work on this?
I think it was like

126
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.610
a guy on a plane.
He's like, why can I

127
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.440
do work on this? And
I was like, well, I

128
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.460
mean, you can, but I
said, there's, there's con consumption.

129
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.460
This is just such a
wonderful device for truly consuming.

130
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.760
But in every instance on
the iPad, when you're trying

131
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.850
to produce, you're kind of
fighting against it. You're fighting

132
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.000
against the multitasking. You're fighting
against the keyboard. You know,

133
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.700
it's, it's, it's kind of
there, but it's really about

134
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.540
consumption. And then if you,
if you flip the access

135
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.710
and you start really focusing
on PR producing the user

136
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.130
experience has to be completely
different. That's right. Yeah. And

137
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.110
I was, I'm going to
be doing this talk on

138
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.110
mobile. And people were saying,
well, when should I have

139
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.760
a native app? And when
should I have a mobile

140
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.710
app? And when should I
have a mobile website? And

141
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.330
that got me thinking about
mobile websites are great for

142
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.220
consuming and native apps are
better for production, right? Yeah.

143
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.460
Have you spent much time
looking at like how things

144
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.850
like HTML five versus flash
versus server life versus native

145
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.690
apps can, can, and there,
their various pros and cons

146
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.570
can enable a good experience
for production versus a good

147
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:46.030
experience for consumption? Oh, absolutely.
I mean, you know, when

148
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.120
we really just had like
a flash and silver lights

149
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.910
work with, I mean, those
were powerful, incredible tools to

150
00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:01.620
allow users to really produce
great things. So, you know,

151
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.980
the same thing with HTML
five, I mean, you know,

152
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.550
that blend, all of those
things are going to really

153
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.480
allow people to make great
things for, you know, not

154
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.920
just consumption, but, you know,
allow people to create It's.

155
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.080
So it's so immature though.
Like the example I always

156
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.830
point to on the iPhone
is the Twitter mobile client.

157
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.220
The actual app is very
responsive and very quick, but

158
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.920
the HTML five version of
the same thing. If you

159
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.430
visit twitter.com on a mobile,
it's just awful. It's stuttery.

160
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.800
And it's a mess. I
just think to myself, it

161
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.100
must be because it's early,
right. It's early, it's early.

162
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.370
Right. And when, when we
used to dial up and

163
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.070
use modems, like that was
incredibly slow too. And then

164
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.980
we had to, you know,
figure it out. When you

165
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.350
are prescribing a design, are
you thinking about the tech

166
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.450
or are you thinking about
the experience and then you

167
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.430
like leave? Like when does,
when does that stop? You

168
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.750
see what I'm saying? Like,
you might say, there'll be

169
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.600
a grid, there'll be a
tree, but you haven't necessarily

170
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.380
said, and it will be
a plugin. Oh, right. So

171
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.390
when do you start thinking
about the visual implementation? Yeah.

172
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.460
And is it, is it
your job? Like you go

173
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.320
and design a whole thing
and you do AB testing

174
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.820
and you say yesterday, there's
going to be this tree

175
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.860
on the left here. And
the developer says, well, I

176
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.300
could use flash. I could
use circle or I can

177
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.980
use HTML to get the
same thing. And you have

178
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.650
to then decide, well, there's
the initial startup of the

179
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.650
plugin, but once it starts
up several lights faster, but

180
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.290
HTML five is more portable.
Oh yeah. I, I think

181
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.730
you want to be part
of those conversations and behalf

182
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.910
of the user, but you
know, I've always tried to

183
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.820
make sure that everybody gets
to be in the room,

184
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.500
listening to, you know, these
conversations, talking to clients and

185
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.090
making those decisions throughout, like
I'm all about collaboration and

186
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.730
making sure everybody gets to
work together and make decisions.

187
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.220
So you're not just a,
as a designer, you're not

188
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.880
just like slapping down something
or throwing something over the

189
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.460
fence to the developer, like
here, figure it out, But

190
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.160
that's, I'll push, but push
it a little bit. That's

191
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.360
warm and fuzzy, but isn't
there a, a bright line

192
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.340
where you feel a designer
should dictate implementation versus when

193
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.440
you should stop and say,
well, here's what it should

194
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.480
look like. Here's how, when
you click it slides open

195
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.420
that da here's the complete
animation that I've done in

196
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.890
my prototyping tool. And I
want it done in HTML

197
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.590
five. Or do you leave
that ultimate implementation up to

198
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.620
the developer? Oh, no. I
mean, if there's some better

199
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.070
way that the dev developer
knows that I don't know

200
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.010
about like yeah, absolutely. Show
me, teach me. Cause I

201
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:39.290
wanna make sure, you know,
they're, you know, they're learning

202
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.410
from me, I'm learning from
them. And now if they've

203
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.580
got a, you know, a
better sort of implementation technology,

204
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.790
then yeah. Let's do that.
Okay. Yeah. What are you

205
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.340
implementing most of your like,
like how far do you

206
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.300
go? Do you, you make
animations, do you make, what

207
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.590
is the delivery product that
you would, that you, as

208
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.370
an, as an interactive designer
would give someone like, if

209
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.080
we were making a Twitter
application sure. I'd want to

210
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.420
deliver as interactive of a
working prototype as possible. So

211
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.530
everybody can feel the transitions
and really get the true

212
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.170
essence of what you've made.
So you can have those

213
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.890
conversations where you're talking about
the same thing and doing

214
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:27.870
less hand-waving to describe what
you mean. Yeah. What do

215
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.940
you usually do that kind
of stuff in whatever you

216
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.370
can find. I know that
most designers, if I understand

217
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.040
correctly starting Photoshop, like literally,
that's just where you live.

218
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.370
Yeah. You do a lot
of work in Photoshop, but

219
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.880
I use expression blend primarily,
especially sketch flow to get

220
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.400
across those ideas. And of
course, with a sketch flow,

221
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.720
you get the sketchy styles.
So people understand that this

222
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.680
is a concept and it's
not the final thing and

223
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.890
they're comfortable using it and
giving feedback, which you can

224
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.310
do all in sketch flow.
Like I saw in your

225
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.850
talk earlier today, you had
what looked like you drawn

226
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.190
on a napkin or maybe
drawn on a piece of

227
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.000
paper, a phone, and then
the interface that was kind

228
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.120
of a Panorama behind the
phone, would you go into

229
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.250
science, something like that in
sketch flow, and then the

230
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:22.980
developer would move around within
your penciled design it, feel

231
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.710
of how things move. Absolutely.
If I'm, if I want

232
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.790
to do something really quick,
I'll, you know, sketch some

233
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.570
stuff out and, you know,
snap a picture or scan

234
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.990
it in and then just,
you know, put the interactions

235
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.480
right on top of it
and send it out. So

236
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.250
you can at least get
the idea out there. I

237
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.590
mean, it's amazing what you
can do with a half

238
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.370
an hour, you know, just
sketch something and get the

239
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.260
idea out. It's amazing what
developers can do with a

240
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.490
half an hour to two,
we can waste a lot

241
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.650
of time. One of the
things that was really interesting

242
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.590
about your, your talk is
that you kept saying that,

243
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.730
well, you can do this
in half an hour. You

244
00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.470
can do that in an
hour. I mean, it didn't

245
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.470
seem to me, like you
were advocating really heavy, upfront

246
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.770
design. Your design process seemed
very kind of agile and

247
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.460
very iterative. And you were
saying even, what was it

248
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.650
that you called? It was
it wasn't a poor man's

249
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.490
AB testing. You were basically
saying people aren't doing AB

250
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.710
testing. They perceive it to
be a big deal and

251
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.660
expensive and a lot of
time. So what were some

252
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.520
of the techniques that you
had for doing AB testing

253
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.940
on the cheap? So, I
mean, if you just want

254
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.480
to even, you know, walk
over to a different department

255
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.630
in your office and have
somebody, you know, have somebody

256
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.670
in accounting, test out your,
your idea, your concept. I

257
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.920
mean, you don't need a
lot of time or budget.

258
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.260
You know, once you walk
through your idea three times

259
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.600
with different people, you're going
to know exactly what you

260
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.550
need to do. And then
you bring in the formal

261
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.160
testing, like at that point,
Oh, you can, or you,

262
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.670
I mean, honestly, you know,
you can really kind of

263
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.430
go about it that way
and I'm still make a

264
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.400
great product. I mean, you
can do formal testing. Sure.

265
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.830
But you know, for all
the people out there that

266
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.590
don't have the budget to
do that, I think you

267
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.160
can still make a fantastic
product just by testing with

268
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.610
people around you. This episode
of Hansel minutes is brought

269
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:16.420

get started, especially by importing
your LinkedIn profile. However, there's

283
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.050
one catch profiles on career
2.0 or invite only they

284
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.850
did this to keep out
the spam and have a

285

high quality environment. Fortunately, for
you as a Hansel minutes

286
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.410
listener, I've got your back
head on over to careers

287
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.050
dot stack overflow.com/h M to
accept your invitation today, once

288
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:29.380
again, that's careers dot stack,
overflow.com/hm. I hope you like

289
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:35.470
it might you not find
yourself. Self-selecting like likeminded people

290
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.390
like you're in the same
company. Like you said, like

291
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.790
there's, it's, it's attractive idea
to pop down to accounting

292
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.190
and ask whoever to check
out, take a look at

293
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.470
your design, but how important
is it to go and

294
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.750
find like a target audience?
Like if you're making a

295
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.290
website for, well, you showed
the app website guilt, which

296
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.460
is a high end fashion,
mostly women. And now moving

297
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.520
into men, surely they're not
going to drop down into

298
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.530
the developer pit and go
and ask them what they

299
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.260
think they're going to go
and find women in that

300
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.470
demographic and then do the
testing. Right. Well, I mean

301
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.970
for, yeah, for a complicated
sort of product or idea

302
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.880
where you're not the target
audience, like, you know, if

303
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.970
you're designing something for tweens,
you're going to need some

304
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:21.610
twins. Absolutely. But if you're
just trying to, you know,

305
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.510
figure out whether like an
interaction works or if, you

306
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.870
know, from your intuition fee.
Yeah. Like, okay, log in

307
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.570
here and tell me, you
know, I'm going to observe

308
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.970
somebody just, just log into
the site and let's see

309
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.390
how it feels. Yeah. I
mean, you can really just

310
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.560
get that idea just by
yeah. Popping over to, you

311
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.320
know, account management and just
having somebody play with it.

312
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.130
Surprising how few times I've
seen that done. You know

313
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.430
what I mean? Like I've
seen people go all the

314
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.360
way to implementation before they
get that kind of feedback.

315
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.550
At my last company, we
would take a giant piece

316
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.070
of butcher paper and we
would actually paste it up

317
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.200
on the cubes and like
near the bathroom or in

318
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.530
the kitchen. And we hang
markers from it on a

319
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.930
string. Exactly. And I think
that's great too. You just,

320
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.400
you just want outside feedback.
And a lot of times

321
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.480
people can see what you
can't see because you're so,

322
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.210
you know, absorbed by it
or, you know, we can

323
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.850
all get my OPIC. So
I mean, some of the

324
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.970
simplest things, you know, can
go on a sticky note

325
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.610
and, you know, get put
up on that butcher block

326
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.460
and you're like, Oh yes,
that's a great idea. I

327
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.840
was too close to the
problem. Yeah. One of the

328
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.670
other things that has been
striking me recently as I

329
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.040
redesigned my blog. And of
course, as I mentioned, we

330
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.070
talked to the designer was
that no one told me

331
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.030
that my blog looked horrifically
old and it was almost

332
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.870
like one time I was
in a meeting. I think

333
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.460
I had like a booger
hanging out of my nose

334
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.380
and no one would say
anything until after I was

335
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.420
like, Oh my goodness, you
guys let me sit in

336
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.610
that meeting for an hour
with a burger in my

337
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.190
nose. It's like, people let
me have a nasty looking

338
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.830
blog for two years. And
then one of the feet,

339
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.050
one of the, the folks
that reached my block said,

340
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:09.740
well, it didn't look old
three years ago. Right. But

341
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.040
it started looking old two
years ago. Why, why does

342
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.930
that, why does that happen?
Why does a blog that

343
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.060
looks so fresh and so
clean so many years ago

344
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.170
suddenly look old, it didn't
change. Right? Well, styles change.

345
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.320
And I, you know, styles
changed for everything. I mean,

346
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:29.000
fashion, art, everything, everything is
constantly kind of moving forward

347
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.300
and we're all as humans,
we're all used to that.

348
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.680
So when we see things
that we've seen a million

349
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.010
times before, or maybe don't
have that new cool fonts

350
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:44.090
or whatever it may be
yeah. Then it starts to

351
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:48.200
look old. So I think
constantly sort of keeping your

352
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.530
site fresh or, you know,
at least pay attention to

353
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.150
what everybody else is doing.
So, you know, also when

354
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.640
your stuff is kind of
looking a little tired. Yeah.

355
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.000
I was looking at my
iPad recently thinking it looks

356
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.680
kind of old and I
was like, really, this thing

357
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.990
just came out a couple
of years ago and I'm

358
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.350
feeling like it needs a
refresh. Right? Some skinning. Yes.

359
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.530
It's interesting though, because they've
committed to a look, they

360
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.420
really have set themselves down
to a look. It'll be

361
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.070
interesting to see what they
can do. And it makes

362
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.230
me worried a little bit
about Metro. Cause I'm watching

363
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.920
the Metro is a nation
of everything at Microsoft. It's

364
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.250
just kind of happening organically.
I think people outside might

365
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.650
think that there's some boss
at the top. Who's demanding

366
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.840
that we all use this
font and that, but it's

367
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.510
just kind of things that
are natural for Metro are

368
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.940
moving that way. I mean,
parts of MSDN have become

369
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.120
that way. We've seen the
phone, you know, presumably the

370
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.250
next version of the operating
system will have some Metro.

371
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.790
That seems like a big
bet. It's a huge bet.

372
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.640
But I think it's, I
think it's a really clever

373
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.640
one because Metro's actually really
genius at being so clean

374
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.840
and so simple and what's
nice and new and not

375
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.840
tired about it is that
it isn't so heavy handed.

376
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.810
I look at, you know,
a lot of the sort

377
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:06.190
of heavy gradient, heavy drop
shadow stuff. And, and that

378
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.940
seems a little overdone. If
it's a button, it's a

379
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.630
button and it doesn't need
to be so overstated about

380
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.600
it. So I think Metro
is a great bet because

381
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.800
it's really clean and simple.
And it's easy to understand

382
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.640
because you know, we used
sort of the idea of

383
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.680
like the simple traffic or
subway sort of Oh yeah.

384
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.460
I cannot gruffy and, and
messaging to, to convey the

385
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.840
same thing without being so
heavy handed about it. That's

386
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.880
interesting. I'd ever put that
together that the kind of

387
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.590
the New York subway map, flat
clean fonts, that kind of

388
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.710
Helvetica like you ever, you've
probably seen the Helvetica documentary.

389
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.050
Have you seen the movie?
Exactly, of course. Yeah. And

390
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.140
it's just, there's just something
about the curves of the

391
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.920
good black text on a
white background with bright, bright,

392
00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.240
but not overly bright colors,
just as classic. Exactly. Yeah.

393
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.880
Nice. Clean and classic. Yeah.
Well, it'll be interesting to

394
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.100
see how far we can
take Metro in the sense

395
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.960
of what does it look
like in four or five

396
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.480
years? Is it going to
start to get some garish

397
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.760
accenting of some kind or
are we going to be

398
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.670
able to flex it and
move it around and make

399
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.550
a real application? Like I'm
trying to envision what Microsoft

400
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.730
word and Metro and like
what would that look like

401
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.550
without taking away the good
things like the ribbon and

402
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.100
what does it add other
than a coat of paint?

403
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.710
Right. Well, it can be
a coat of paint, but

404
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.430
I think anytime you add
extra lace or extra fancy

405
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:36.330
to it over time, you
know, that gets removed and

406
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.000
you go back to what
the basic good thing. I

407
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.430
feel like we're moving towards
the way that star Trek

408
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.370
did all their colors. I
mean, you remember in the

409
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.030
star Trek panels, it was
just lines and basic colors.

410
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.150
There were no drop shadows
or fake buttons that looked

411
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.800
like they were popping out
of the screen. I mean,

412
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.160
everything that they were working
on were just matte, flat

413
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.450
color. Right. And I think
that, you know, that, that

414
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.600
style of the time, this
sort of fifties and sixties

415
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.720
sort of mid century design,
where it is really clean

416
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.270
and the colors are really,
you know, bold, that's, you

417
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.570
know, we're returning to that
for a reason architecture's returning

418
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:20.730
to that. And you know,
of course, you know, postmodern

419
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.260
architecture is dead where we
did that. Overexaggeration that over

420
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.520
emblematic stuff. So yeah, I
think everybody's kind of moving

421
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.720
back to Lake simple clean.
Is it, is it a

422
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.630
cyclical thing? I mean, are
we going to get back

423
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.860
into crazy Roman looking Saraf
type stuff or are we

424
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.200
like, I'm trying to understand,
like I'm imagining the timeline

425
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.380
kind of circling back on
itself and I'm wondering are

426
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.270
we can converging onto some
shared thinking around design and

427
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.130
colors and font and type,
or is this just part

428
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:58.550
of an ongoing cyclical thing
that's moving forward? Like, are

429
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.640
we, what's the word, you
know, are we coming to

430
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.760
a point where we just
kind of repeating ourselves over

431
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.500
and over and we'll be
right back to times, new

432
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.650
Roman in a couple of
years, You know, we could

433
00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:12.220
be, but it's also a
reflection of sort of the

434
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:17.980
psychology of, you know, current
state of the world, that

435
00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.970
type of thing. I mean
the, so for example, when

436
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.180
postmodern started popping up And
then maybe you could define

437
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.220
postmodernism just to make sure
that that listener may not

438
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:32.020
be familiar. So postmodern architecture
was that really sort of

439
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:40.360
exaggerated big and then distorted.
Right. So take some modern

440
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.980
design and then add, yeah.
Add like a couple gigantic

441
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.520
overstated Roman columns to the
front of it and there

442
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.790
you have it. Okay. And
so the response to that

443
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.710
was because we all kind
of felt lied to the

444
00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:01.630
clean sort of classic design,
you know, it wasn't really

445
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.960
the way the world was
working then. So we distorted

446
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:11.260
it. And so my favorite
example is the sort of

447
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:19.150
talking heads video where he's
got this gigantic suit, The

448
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.790
whole Zoot suit, like, is
he David Bowie space kind

449
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.540
of thing. It's like 1940
days in 2014. Yeah, Exactly.

450
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.010
So it's a, it's a
statement about overstatement. And so

451
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.170
now I think we've since
left that because we want

452
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.690
to return to that sort
of clean. Like, no, I

453
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.910
want it to be what
it really says it is.

454
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.440
I want things to feel
like they're supposed to feel

455
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.170
when you're interacting with them.
Someone said something. I saw

456
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.030
something go by on Twitter
a couple of hours ago

457
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.290
and I'm going to get
the quote wrong. But it

458
00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:50.110
was something along the lines
of that boiling something down

459
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.860
to its essential elements can
never be a mistake. Right.

460
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.350
Maybe they were quoting you
in one of your talks.

461
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.770
Oh no. I, I think
that's, yes. That's a famous

462
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.290
quote. I can't remember. Yes.
It's what, it's just one

463
00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.210
of those ideas that getting
down to the basics, it's

464
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:08.860
almost like we have to,
it's funny. My, my mom

465
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.110
says this about my kids
that children can either grow

466
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.230
up, like straight up in
the air or grow out.

467
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.540
You get tall, you can
get fat, but you can't

468
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.240
do both. So you expand
and then you can track

469
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.920
and get taller when you
expand it, you try. And

470
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.900
the same thing happens in
his design. You know, we

471
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.940
Guild a bunch of things
we put in drop shadows,

472
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.380
we add them and then
we tear it apart and

473
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.820
then we base it to
get it down to its

474
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.310
essentials. And then we, you
know, we, then we do

475
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:33.940
the same thing again. So,
you know, remember trees, trees

476
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.060
were one of those things
that were abused in, in

477
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.400
designs, tree views, Oh, we've
got a problem on the

478
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.740
web. Let's make a giant
tree view. It'll be, you

479
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.640
know, 60 levels deep and
they'll have a plus and

480
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.850
a minus and it'll represent
a tree and we'll stick

481
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.830
it on the left side
and it'll solve all of

482
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.440
our navigation problems. Right. And
then we shoved the entire

483
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.840
web into a tree and
it doesn't work out. And

484
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.610
then we rip it apart
and we come up with

485
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:01.320
new things like breadcrumbs and
new, new thinking around design

486
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.650
up and out, up and
out. Right. And I think

487
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.410
that's what it needs. Cause
we're all learning this stuff.

488
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.860
And so yeah, we had
to put trees on things

489
00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.290
and then realize that they
didn't work and then break

490
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.810
them out and make them
more simple and easier to

491
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:19.670
use. And yeah, it's, it's
great to see things grow

492
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.370
and change like that. I
wouldn't be interested in our

493
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.790
field if we didn't get
to really push the envelope

494
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:31.370
and move forward. There's a,
an older, silver light guy.

495
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:32.930
He used to work for
Microsoft. Now he doesn't have

496
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.480
Scott Barnes who says that one
of the things he likes

497
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.510
and hates about Metro is
that it means that anyone

498
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.730
could make a good looking
application. Like if you simply

499
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.730
follow the rules, you can
at least not being a

500
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.270
designer, have a passable looking
application. I mean, do you

501
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.550
think that Metro is one
of those design tenants? That

502
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.580
for the most part you
can have a decent looking

503
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.430
application, as long as you
follow the rules, If you

504
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.660
follow the rules. Yes. But
I think that's what the

505
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.890
design I, and understanding that
design thinking behind Metro helps

506
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.850
you do, but you still
need a designer to really

507
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.390
help you implement that correctly.
I mean, there's a whole

508
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.330
bunch of, you know, things
that are right there in

509
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.540
the Metro style guide, but
you know, people miss them,

510
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:23.120
you know, because they're so
used to capitalizing everything or,

511
00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.790
you know, and it's just
like, wow, like pop that

512
00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.190
down and that'll it look
so much better. And then

513
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.650
when you show, you know,
when you show devs how

514
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.530
to do it, they're like,
Oh, that's great. Yeah. I

515
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.270
don't know. But that's the
one thing the whole let's

516
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.230
make everything lowercase. I'm still
not quite sold on that

517
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.650
one, but it's funny. I
do. I don't, I don't

518
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:47.120
see Metro in everything, but
I see Metro like things

519
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.940
like, like the economist magazine,
like if you read the

520
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.950
economist and you look at
the way their design has

521
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:56.470
moved over the years, it's
extremely minimalist. You know, it's,

522
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.090
it's almost, it's almost formulaic,
which is when one of

523
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.310
the things that's Metro has
been both praised on and

524
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.820
accused of sir it's being
formulaic. Right. Well, and I

525
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.540
think, you know, a lot
of great websites out there

526
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.750
definitely take the grid approach.
You know, you put a

527
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.300
grid on it and organize
it in a way so

528
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.720
you can, you know, really
flow through the information and

529
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.010
your eyes can kind of
relax cause they're not bombarded.

530
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.060
But yeah, I think there
are times where you want

531
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.060
to break the grid too.
And I think that's, Metro

532
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.410
allows you to do that
as well altogether. Well, you

533
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.740
know, break the grid with,
let's say that, you know,

534
00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.590
the great, you know, in
a full screen images and

535
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.210
stuff like that. So it's
not so hard that it

536
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.250
has to be boring. That's
right. It's not hard wired

537
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.560
to be boring. I think
it's hard wired to be

538
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.330
really simple and you know,
incredibly easy to use. Yeah.

539
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.510
If you look at the
apps that people are talking

540
00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:59.160
about being really nice and
design like Flipboard, you know,

541
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.110
you, you, I bet you,
if you change the font

542
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.810
of Flipboard to, you know,
was it called, is it

543
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.350
Sago? It's pronounced? Oh yeah.
If you changed Flipboard, which

544
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.570
is a magazine application with
the iPad, if you changed

545
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.180
its fonts to say, go,
it'd be a Metro application.

546
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.860
I mean, it's just cause,
cause all there is, is

547
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.960
topography white space and good
photography. And you've advocated for

548
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.450
people having good photography. Like
nothing can spice up a

549
00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.330
blog or a magazine or
a design and great photography.

550
00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:29.520
I mean, people want to
look at interesting things. So

551
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.390
yeah, I mean a few
great pieces of photography and

552
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:37.350
some really nice like clean
fonts, you're halfway the hair.

553
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.480
And that is kind of
the essentials that I think

554
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.480
we're moving towards. I mean
Metro or not it's it

555
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.990
is what it is. The
idea that, that white space

556
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.200
that is meaningful typography and
fonts that are clean, which

557
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.630
is now being enabled by
web fonts, which is great,

558
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.780
having more and more fonts
that are free. Google's got

559
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.410
that great catalog of all
these free patent free and

560
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.800
copyright free fonts that you
can use and good photography.

561
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.030
And you put together a
nice, a nice application of

562
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:10.230
any kind. Absolutely. I think
about me. That's a great

563
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:14.160
example to me. Yeah. You
can just, you know, it's

564
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.710
really just a great big
picture view or what you

565
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.070
like to do with your
information and you know, it's

566
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.680
really pretty, they allow you
to, you know, change some

567
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.360
of the things in the
fonts and everything, but it

568
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.600
still ends up looking cool.
It's bizarre. That's so funny

569
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.030
that you bring up about
me. You can go to

570
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.060
about.me/s Hanselman and you can
see, and all it is

571
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.850
is it's like your, your
about page. They want, they

572
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.760
want to be your about
page and it's a giant

573
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.860
photograph of you as the
background, but it's done in

574
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.050
such a way that like,
even though it sounds like

575
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.210
listening to it on a
podcast that how could that

576
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.910
be a business? How could
that actually work? It actually

577
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:52.320
does. Yeah. Sometimes you don't
need this like grandiose like

578
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.010
complicated idea. It's really just
a neat, simple idea that,

579
00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:00.630
you know, takes off Well,
like tumbler is, is half

580
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.140
what it is, which is
tiny blogging, but it's half

581
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.290
great design. I mean they
really embraced designers and got

582
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.980
designers paid for their designs
as well. Yeah. And they've

583
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.760
rolled out with that great
design right away. Yeah. So

584
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.090
they led with that and
it worked really well for

585
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.030
them. It's interesting. Even, even
sites that you wouldn't think

586
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.240
of as being deepened designed
like stack overflow led with

587
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.910
good design. Like I don't
think there's, there's the gaming

588
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:31.080
aspect of it stack overflow.
There's the, the crowd theory

589
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.810
and all that economics of
stack overflow. But if it

590
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.240
hadn't been well designed and
well thought out from the

591
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.590
beginning and all of the
subsequent sites that are being

592
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:43.460
designed around the stack exchange
family, it couldn't have succeeded.

593
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.520
Right. And ugly stack overflow
would be ignored just as

594
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.540
an ugly tumbler would. Oh,
that's right. Yeah. No, I

595
00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.730
mean, that was the keys
to the city for them

596
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.430
in a sense, What are
some, and kind of in

597
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.190
conclusion, what are some blogs
like three or four blogs

598
00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:01.450
or books that you would
recommend that non-designer listeners might

599
00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.430
enjoy taking a look at
to learn more about the

600
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:08.380
design world? Sure. I think
a about face by Alan Cooper

601
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.210
is the Bible for interaction
design and great design. I

602
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:18.640
really like the lukewarm blouse
ski form design book. I

603
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.860
think that's incredibly great. I
mean, if you have to

604
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.870
do something with a lot
of information on a lot

605
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:25.570
of fields, he tells you
exactly how to make that

606
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.480
like the absolute best experience.
So feels like text boxes

607
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.900
over data, And then let's
see. Okay. What about blogs

608
00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.160
that you would read? Like
do you like to read

609
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.350
like the usual suspects, like
a list apart and things

610
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.230
like that Part is fantastic.
I read it all the

611
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.830
time. I mean, obviously I'm
a huge tech crunch fan

612
00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:50.590
and then let's say a
UX mag is good and

613
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:53.140
smashing mag is really great
too. They broke out and

614
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:57.430
have a UX sec section
now. And, and they also,

615
00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.100
you know, they really accommodate
for, you know, developers do,

616
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.590
they do a lot of
like, you know, let's try

617
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.950
CSS for, you know, like
the stuff and you know,

618
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.260
they, they do a lot
of web design stuff too.

619
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.330
Great. Well, send me those
links and we'll make sure

620
00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.800
that we put them up
on the show notes for

621
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.220
folks to visit. Thank you
so much, Sarah. So much

622
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.260
for chatting with me today.
Hey, thanks for having me.

623
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.290
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

624
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.370
you again next week.
