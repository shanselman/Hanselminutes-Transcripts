That's bitly.com/datadog shirt. Hi, this

9
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.000
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

10
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.690
And today I'm chatting with
Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas authors

11
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.470
of the pragmatic programmer from
tournament to master now in

12
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.370
its 20th year. How are
you gentlemen? We are thanks

13
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.220
for having us. I know,
I know this, Andy, you

14
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.890
get an Andrew and I
just got a Dave. I

15
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.520
mean, you know, you know,
what's funny is that that's

16
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.430
one of the other combinations
because when we first wrote

17
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.010
the book, it was Andrew
and David, because, you know,

18
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.410
we were young trying to
make a name for ourselves

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.450
and then all the books
we've written since then have

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.230
been Dave and Andy or
Andy and Dave. And so

21
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.950
we still get kind of
random permutations. Is there a

22
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.800
preferred one? I dunno. I
guess my dad is Dave,

23
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.010
so I'm afraid. I, I
got a little sloppy there.

24
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.770
That's what I go by.
Andy and Dave and Andy.

25
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
This is 20 years old,
which feels impossible. I mean,

26
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.430
I, it, it feels fresh.
It reads fresh. Did you

27
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.320
know when you were writing
it that it was going

28
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.210
to be a Seminole work?
Do you sit down and

29
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.920
say, you know, let's write
a book, but let's make

30
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.010
it a seminal work or
did you just slap the

31
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.440
keyboard? And it turned out
that way. I think the

32
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.350
only person in history who
said, I'm going to write

33
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.600
a bestseller was Jeffrey Archer.
And he wrote one because

34
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.520
he was bankrupt and he
needed the money. I think

35
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.880
otherwise it's just, I mean,
you write the book you

36
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.100
write and you see what
happens. I mean, I think

37
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.010
both of us were stunned
when it took off, because

38
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.490
for us it was an
exercise in really as much

39
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.400
as anything else trying to
clarify our own thoughts and

40
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.400
put down what was to
us kind of like common

41
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.370
sense that our clients at
the time, weren't really seeing

42
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.880
as common sense. So it
was almost like a crystallization

43
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.100
of a set of notes
when we wrote it. So

44
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.080
you're writing it down to
explain it to yourself, make

45
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.610
sure that what you think
you know is what you

46
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.070
know. Yeah. And to our
clients. I mean, we got,

47
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.020
we kind of got, we
went through a period where

48
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.130
we were going into onsite
and just about everybody we

49
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.230
went to, I mean, typically
as a consultant, you don't

50
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.760
get brought in when things
are wonderful anyway, But the

51
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.100
people that we were brought
into all had the same

52
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.210
kind of problems, their builds
weren't consistent, they were shipping

53
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.570
code that hadn't tested, they
were designing things in such

54
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.150
a way. It was impossible
to change them. And so

55
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.950
we thought, well, let's save
ourselves a bit of time

56
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.230
and heartache by just jotting
down notes we can give

57
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.010
to them. And that got
turned into the pragmatic programmer.

58
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.010
Yeah. I mean the original
thought was we didn't even

59
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.740
seek out to do a
book to begin with. We

60
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.840
were just going to write
a white paper, you know,

61
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.000
literally just, just some notes
just to save us a

62
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.240
little time, going into the
next client and, you know,

63
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.490
projects grow in scope, right?
So, you know, the little

64
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.130
white paper became, you know,
more of a full fledged

65
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.190
book, but you know, that
was, that was our intent.

66
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.190
We didn't, we had no
notion that this would be

67
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.670
a popular at all or
any kind of bestseller. We

68
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.470
just kind of, we were
like, wow, we can actually

69
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.710
get this printed and published,
you know, that's, that's really

70
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.750
cool. And we figured, you
know, our moms would buy

71
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.760
a copy and you know,
maybe a few friends, but

72
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.770
yeah, not much more than
that Sounds like you're, you're

73
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.140
trying not to repeat yourself
in this case. You're being

74
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.420
dry because you're like, you
know, people keep asking us

75
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.850
this, we should probably just
make a FAC and then

76
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.200
we can hand it to
the client when we were

77
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.510
like, Oh, welcome. You've just
hired us. Here's the, here's

78
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.900
how we work, Basically, basically.
And then as Dave said,

79
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.750
as we started looking at
that, that level of project,

80
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.480
like, well, okay, we have
a chance to make this,

81
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.840
this fact, this white paper,
what are the most important

82
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.480
things that we could say?
You know, we don't want

83
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.090
to waste time talking about,
well, you know, you should

84
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.790
format your code this way
or adhere to the one

85
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.610
true brace style or, or,
you know, that, that level

86
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.800
of stuff. So it's like,
well, what do you want

87
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.320
to say? And what is
the most important and how

88
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.150
can we, how can we
say that? How can we

89
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.630
convey that in a way
that people will, will remember

90
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.480
it and understand it and
you know, really grok it.

91
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.180
Cause as much as I'd
love to you, can't go

92
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.400
in and tell people, you
have to brush your teeth

93
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.580
and eat your broccoli and
know that kind of advice.

94
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.210
It's like, yes, that's true.
But people tune out. They

95
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.420
won't, they won't necessarily hear.
And if nothing else, you

96
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.940
gotta eat your broccoli and
then brush your teeth. Otherwise

97
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.580
there's no point order important.
Absolutely. Yeah. And I think

98
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.620
the other thing that was
really beneficial to us was

99
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.720
that at that time we
were working with a really

100
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.060
wide variety of clients in
a whole bunch of different

101
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.100
industries, different languages, different operating
systems. And so there was

102
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.460
no one size fits all.
So we were kind of

103
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.680
forced to go back a
level and look at it

104
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.750
from the kind of, you
know, the metal level, if

105
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.560
you like, of what are
the underlying concepts, as opposed

106
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.350
to what of the tools.
And I think that's possibly

107
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.020
one of the reasons that
we, we were lucky with

108
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.200
the book is that we
didn't make it specific or

109
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.560
too specific to one such
technologies When you're working in

110
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.650
software and especially, or auditory
and in software you're people

111
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.090
are always saying, if you
can name it, you can

112
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.310
claim it. People will spend
days trying to name the

113
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.220
right class. If they get
the thing they say The

114
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.170
name, right then they'll understand
it. And the design will

115
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.750
just fall out from it.
How important was it to

116
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.470
call it pragmatic when you
discovered that word pragmatic, you

117
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.780
didn't call it the dogmatic
program or you needed the

118
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.870
pragmatic programmer when you nailed
that word. Was that the

119
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.180
word that you needed or
was that just a title

120
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.380
We wanted because, and I
had almost forgotten this until

121
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.710
I saw some interview from
back in the day, but

122
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.520
at the time, like with
Twitter today or read it,

123
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.040
there was a lot of
discussion on a use net

124
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.010
on comp.com dot object. And
in some of these other

125
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.570
news groups, and there was
a long running argument slash

126
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.510
discussion about whether programming was
craft or not. And, and

127
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.550
you know, all kinds of
the follow on arguments, you

128
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.050
know, well, if it's not,
is it art? Is it

129
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.540
science? Is it engineering? Is
it this isn't that? And

130
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.050
the answer is yes. You
know, it's, it's all these

131
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.910
things in measure, but in
particular, there was a strain

132
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.340
of thought at the time,
which, you know, kind of

133
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.540
virulently persists to this day
that is very dogmatic that

134
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.450
says, you must abide by
this principle and you must

135
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.390
do this and you must
do this this way. And

136
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.880
we looked at these and
you're like, well, yeah, no,

137
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.480
it doesn't work like that
really. I mean, yes, a

138
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.570
lot of the time this
principle can be helpful. This

139
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.230
practice can be helpful. This,
you know, this paradigm can

140
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.980
be useful, but not always.
And you need to know

141
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.450
the difference. So we very
much pushed deliberately against the,

142
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.410
the, what we perceived as
the dogmatic approach and approach

143
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.900
is being pushed at the
time and said, no, no,

144
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.160
you gotta, you've got to
look at things in context.

145
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.680
You've got to be able
to apply these lessons where,

146
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.560
and when they make sense.
And I think a lot

147
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.110
of that, we tried to
capture in the book of

148
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.870
trying to give that sense
of, you know, this is

149
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.420
what you need to look
at to evaluate is this

150
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.270
the right thing to do
here? In this context, you

151
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.750
can't just blindly say, I'm
going to use a, Oh,

152
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.850
or I'm going to use
functional programming, or I'm going

153
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.040
to use scrum, or I'm
going to use CLO or

154
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.600
whatever it is. It has
to fit the situation. Yeah.

155
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.420
Yeah. That's absolutely true. I
mean, I think one thing

156
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.100
I like to put up
on slides is that there's

157
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.800
only one universal rule and
that is that there are

158
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.240
no universal rules. And I
think that's, that's very, very

159
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.620
true. And I think one
of the things that we

160
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.280
try to be is, and
it's harder on our readers

161
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.050
because what we're doing is
we're pushing back on them.

162
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.200
We're trying not to say,
do this. We're trying to

163
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.070
say, here are the options.
Here are things other people

164
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.520
do now go work out
what works for you, because

165
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.160
there are no two developers
doing the same thing at

166
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.130
the same time, in the
same environment, et cetera, et

167
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.160
cetera, et cetera. So it's
pretty much guaranteed that there

168
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.400
is no such thing as
a best practice. We, when

169
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.500
we've been talking at a,
at my job about how

170
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.900
to interview people, especially now
that there's this new fresh

171
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.690
generation of developers coming in,
and a lot of people

172
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.650
have been pushing back on
white boarding interviews, pushing back

173
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.720
on how we interview people,
because they feel that it

174
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.540
is asking a bunch of
trivia. And one of the,

175
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.000
one of the bosses propose
that we're less interested in

176
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.180
people who have the answers
and more interested in people

177
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.970
who know the right questions
to absolutely. That's a really

178
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.910
good way of it. The
other thing from my personal

179
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.760
experience is that some of
the best developers I've hired

180
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.930
couldn't program at the time,
you know, I mean, and

181
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.660
nowadays you can get productive
in a couple of months

182
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.090
up to a level where
you're, you know, you're paying

183
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.970
back your salary. So I
think you're looking at the

184
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.850
personality. Absolutely. I had the,
I had the, I had

185
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.530
the very, the very same
experience. One of the, one

186
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.380
of the best C programmers
I ever met had an

187
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.010
advanced degree in botany. And
he used to go on

188
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.600
literally like expeditions into the
Amazon to collect some Don't

189
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.190
tell me he was looking
for bugs. Oh, no, it

190
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.720
was plants. I'm sure. I'm
sure that there were bugs

191
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.840
involved, but yeah, But no,
it's yeah, it's absolutely. It's,

192
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.400
it's the, it's your part
of personality, but your outlook,

193
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.970
you know, that, that kind
of insatiable curiosity about the

194
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.740
world. I mean, if you're
willing to go traipse into

195
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.580
the farthest jungle with headhunters
and, you know, actual headhunters

196
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.430
who like, like cannibals, not
the scary kind who, you

197
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.200
know, try to get you
jobs and stuff, but you

198
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.660
know, if you're willing to
traipse out into the jungle

199
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.320
to look for plants, just
because it's cool, you know?

200
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.930
Yeah. You're willing to read
a few man pages, you

201
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.790
know, look up a few
things on the web, figure

202
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.990
out how stuff works, but
it's that, that driving curiosity,

203
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.230
Hey, this is neat. How
does this work? What's behind

204
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.780
this, where'd this come from?
Can I use this? You

205
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.840
know, that's really the driving
force. I think, Well, you

206
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.690
bring up an interesting point
here because we're, we're on

207
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.270
a, we're hearing a podcast
with, with, with all due

208
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.550
respect to all three of
us, a bunch of older

209
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.670
programmers, we probably got a
hundred years of programming experience

210
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.910
between us and Dave just
said, well, you know, you

211
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.530
can get up to speed
in a couple of weeks

212
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.710
and, you know, start paying
back your, your studying. It's

213
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.710
interesting. It's one of those
things where it's like the

214
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.960
game of go, right, where
it's a minute to learn

215
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.390
and a lifetime to master.
I'm not hearing from either

216
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.190
of you, any kind of
what they call these days,

217
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.230
gatekeeping, where it's like, well,
you know, you need a

218
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.230
software engineering degree and a
master's thesis before you can

219
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.190
start writing that HTML. I'm
hearing an enthusiasm for people

220
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.550
to start programming right away
and just start asking the

221
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.400
right questions. So I let
you into a little secret.

222
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:25.160
I I'm teaching currently I'm
teaching two classes, undergraduate level

223
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:31.670
at SMU, just to, well,
Paul, for two reasons, one

224
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.910
of them is I want
to corrupt the youth. So,

225
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.680
you know, I'm teaching them
things that, you know, like

226
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.830
functional programming that they wouldn't
get otherwise. But the other

227
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.990
reason is I have this
nagging feeling that particularly computer

228
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:50.120
science education is really poorly
serving both the industry and

229
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.160
the student in that these
people are coming of university

230
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.880
With tens, maybe hundreds of
thousands of dollars of debt.

231
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.400
And yet in terms of
the value to the industry

232
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.280
as a whole, there are
really not that much different

233
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.620
to people that go through
an eight week or whatever

234
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.180
boot camp, eight month, I
guess it is bootcamp in

235
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:20.080
that they, they aren't being
shown the real world. And

236
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.080
what, what they're being shown
is like, you know, various

237
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.180
ideas on how to do
certain things in C plus

238
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.000
plus or whatever it might
be. And I mean, for

239
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.190
example, I teach people in
a third, fourth year and

240
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.960
the masters students, and pretty
much universally, not a single

241
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.660
one of them has ever
been shown any form of

242
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:49.080
testing so far in their
calls. So it's yeah, you're,

243
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.070
you're never going to get
me saying, Oh yeah, you

244
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.640
need a degree in this.
You know, I would much

245
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.870
rather hire somebody who had
the right attitude and who

246
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.600
I liked and who was
smart and who could talk

247
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.310
to people and then show
them how to code. I

248
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.190
agree a hundred percent. In
fact, I think it's, It

249
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.740
seems to me and, and
both, you know, here's a

250
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.370
reveal, both Dave and I
have have kids in and

251
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.310
just about to be out
of college, you know, studying

252
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.210
in these areas and looking
at the various degree programs

253
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.360
and, you know, the contents
and what they teach. I

254
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.390
get the strong feeling that
most computer science programs are

255
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.200
there to teach you to
become a professor, a teacher

256
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.320
of computer science, you know,
and not practically actually get

257
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.510
out in the world and
be a software developer to

258
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.680
be a problem solver. And
that's really kind of disappointing.

259
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.010
I know the, when my,
my son went to college,

260
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.380
they, they had the attitude
in the introductory courses that

261
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.540
here you were, you know,
coming into college for the

262
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.970
first time. You want your
declaring your major to be

263
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.060
computer science. And they started
with the assumption. You'd basically

264
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.900
had never seen a computer
before, and here's the keyboard.

265
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.240
And you, you know, this,
this level of instruction, it's

266
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.470
like, they missed the fact
that this generation has been

267
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.520
playing on their iPods, iPads
since they were, you know,

268
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.580
toddlers or whatever, you know,
they're very comfortable in the

269
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.590
digital age. These people have
had, you know, these kids

270
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.130
have had summer jobs programming
in Python or PHP, or

271
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.160
what have you, they're coming
in with a certain base

272
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.940
level of knowledge. And the
regular programs are like, Nope,

273
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.240
you've never seen one of
these magic devices before, you

274
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.970
know, starting from there. And
you know, again, in four

275
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.010
years with everything else they're
trying to teach. Yeah. They

276
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.850
don't cover testing. They don't
cover working effectively in a

277
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.060
team. They don't cover things
like version control that are

278
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.060
just, you know, hygiene really
I'm, it's back to brushing

279
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.070
your teeth. I mean, this
is just how you do

280
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.610
things. And that's, you know,
often not, not part of

281
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.110
their experience. I Mean, fundamentally,
I don't think they teach

282
00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:00.260
programming in the, in the
broader sense they teach how

283
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.930
to code in certain languages.
And typically that is motivated

284
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.900
by I'm going to teach
you data structures, or I'm

285
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.050
going to teach you, you
know, algorithm speed or something

286
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.400
like that. But in terms
of just general good things

287
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.270
to do when programming that
never gets taught. And that's

288
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.610
a, that's a big shame.
I mean, that reflects the

289
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.980
overall problem. Right? And, and
you, you hit the nail

290
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.980
there in the head. It's
like people still identify themselves

291
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.920
as I'm a Java programmer.
I'm a C plus plus

292
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.630
programmer. You know, I want
to go to school to

293
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.480
learn programming. No, as you
said, you know, you can

294
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.220
learn that in a couple
of weeks, a couple months

295
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.490
at a bootcamp, what you
need to learn is problem

296
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.960
solving. How do I attack
and solve this problem using

297
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.570
technology, using computer languages, using
algorithmic constructs, using, you know,

298
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.660
development paradigms, how do I
solve these classes of problems?

299
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.840
What tools do I use?
That's really the heart of

300
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.050
the matter. That's well, that's
the first pug, but then,

301
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.200
then after you get more
experienced than the second part

302
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.650
is being able to recognize
the problems. Yeah. And that's,

303
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.660
that's never tool. I've been
teaching my now teenager, some

304
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.420
of the fundamentals of hygiene,
the thing that came up

305
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.070
yesterday was the importance of
deodorant. And I was trying

306
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.100
to explain to this, this
young person, how important this

307
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.820
was. And I realized that,
you know, if you don't

308
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.000
have a person To do
that, you're just going to

309
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.560
smell. And how would you
know? Yeah. How, how could

310
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.250
you have discovered that? And
I think that we, we

311
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.590
Assume so much that this
is this or that is

312
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.190
discoverable, and That's asking a
lot of someone to go

313
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.810
and discover that when we
could simply show them, Hey,

314
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.630
there's a way to do
this. That's understood. And maybe

315
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.800
You could do it this
way. Yeah, absolutely. Hey friends,

316
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.190
summers longer days and slower
pace, invite us to pick

317
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.220
up a book, follow our
questions and try our hand

318
00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.490
at something new. The work
of modern software developers is

319
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.910
evolving in ways that are
both challenging and rewarding. As

320
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.270
a developer, it's essential that
you cultivate a security mindset

321
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.390
and to help we've put
together a collection of information,

322
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:15.520
security books, podcasts, blogs, and
hands on exercises recommended by

323
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.750
Vira coders, across our development
security and product teams from

324
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.160
adjust published page Turner to
classic frac articles. There's something

325
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.400
here for everyone who's interested
in becoming more security minded.

326
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.890
So dip your toes in,
or take a deep dive

327
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.510
visit www dot Vierra code
that's V E R a

328
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:44.710
code.com/reading that's vericode.com/reading. I noticed
that. And the chapter three

329
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.690
of the, of the book,
you have a whole section

330
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.700
called the basic tools and
you go right off the

331
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.940
bat and you say, look
the power Of plain text,

332
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.490
but I don't remember learning
how to edit text in

333
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:59.070
college. I was told how
to use punch cuts. So

334
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.790
that's almost the same, but
no, I mean, again, again,

335
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:08.400
it's it's so, okay. Here
here's here's an interesting, Andy

336
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.840
talked about his boy who
went through effectively. It was

337
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.360
basically like it was a
cybernetic. So computer science, one

338
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.760
of those kinds of engineering
year kind of things. My

339
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.760
son, my oldest son took
a liberal arts degree is

340
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.550
relatively fluent in ancient Greek.
Some Latin, some French, he

341
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.420
can argue philosophers until, you
know, your eyes drop out.

342
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.150
And because I was in
to programming, he was vehemently

343
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:44.190
not into programming for a
long, long, long time. And

344
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.570
he got out of college
and discovered that there aren't

345
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.420
that many openings for liberal
artists out there in the

346
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:56.510
job market and was basically
hanging around, looking for, for

347
00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:02.910
stuff to do and got
involved programming an Arduino to,

348
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.930
he was trying to sense
muscle tension. So he could

349
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.010
produce like an artificial hand
and he kinda got into

350
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:15.540
programming that way and decided
he liked it, went and

351
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:21.360
did a really fantastic course
at a boot camp. He's

352
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.220
now pro I mean, he's
been basically, he's probably paid

353
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.740
more than twice. The next
type of student that graduated

354
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:38.490
in his class, totally enjoying
himself and getting back to

355
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:44.730
editing text, he was taught
using visual studio code and

356
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.700
he has gone through this
conversion to the dark side.

357
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.120
And he is now, you
know, beating me up cause

358
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.980
I use vs code. And
he's saying, Oh no, no,

359
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.800
you should be using VIM
and T mucks and blah,

360
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.340
blah, blah. You know, and
this is someone who had

361
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.180
really never even seen an
editor until a year ago.

362
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:09.960
So that side of things
is, is I think there's

363
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.180
lots of different levels, you
know? And I think that

364
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.030
that sort of thing, the
edge and tech stuff is

365
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.050
absolutely fundamental. But what we're
trying to get to in

366
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.350
that chapter is not so
much the, this is how

367
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.310
you edit text, but it's
how the fact that if

368
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:30.480
you have stuff in text,
then it's accessible to all

369
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.230
of your tools. Whereas if
instead you have tools specific

370
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.980
data, then you're limited to
what you can do by

371
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.830
what the tool can do.
So that's kind of an

372
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:45.330
underlying principle, if you will,
that, that runs through the

373
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.730
whole book, are these subtle
little things That you might

374
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.970
not think about, but that
if you do them correctly,

375
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.060
they help keep your options
open in the future. Because

376
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.930
as a species, we were
terrible at fortune telling, you

377
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.910
know, we think we're decent
at it. We think we

378
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.790
can, we know, Oh, this
is how this class will

379
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.160
be extended in the future.
And I'm going to build

380
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.000
it to be maintainable and
extensible and nonsense, right? None

381
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.210
of us know what's going
to happen six months, 12

382
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.380
months, 18 months from now.
So anywhere we can, we

383
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.650
try to do whatever we
can to be as flexible,

384
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.560
keep our options open, right?
Keeping things in plain text

385
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.170
while we can use it.
Any number of ways in

386
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.050
the future, we don't need
to know what those ways

387
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.850
are, but we're ready for
it. It's been funny now

388
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.130
that I've got so many
years doing this to watch

389
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:39.330
people go back and forth
between name equals value to

390
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:44.610
XML, to Jason and now
Yammel, and I try not

391
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.640
to be the older programmer
and go, Oh, you know,

392
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.750
that's just adorable. As I
watch people reinvent these things,

393
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.790
as we all come back
eventually to just name value

394
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:57.090
pairs or, you know, INI
file As they say exactly.

395
00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.780
Exactly. Yeah. But it doesn't
just apply to things like

396
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.070
in configuration. So for example,
we wrote the first edition

397
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:09.920
of the book using latte,
which is basically this text

398
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:16.350
files, right? Yeah. And the
publisher was, was a guest

399
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.220
at this. They wanted us
to use word and then

400
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.900
they want to take the
word and back then they

401
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.600
were going to import it
into frame maker and make

402
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.180
a book out of that.
Of course they were. And

403
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.190
we said, okay, but if
you do that, then how

404
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.190
do we make changes? And
they were, they were like,

405
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.990
Oh, what we make the
changes? Would you do that?

406
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.950
They wanted to make the
FrameMaker, the authoritative source and

407
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.770
then throw away External source.
Here's the, here's the real

408
00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:48.300
cool thing. So skip forward
20 years and we're going

409
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.910
to do it again. We
had exactly the same conversation

410
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.360
with the publisher and in
the end we were entrenched

411
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.260
intransigent enough to win. But
now we're faced with the

412
00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.130
fact that we'd produce this
incredibly complex, low tech system.

413
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.000
And we in the meantime
have develop our own publishing

414
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.850
company. And we actually had
a pretty kick ass system

415
00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:14.010
around. And obviously we didn't
accept latte, but it was

416
00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.730
in plain text. So a
couple of Ruby scripts later

417
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.460
allow tech actually quite happily
fed into our plain text

418
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.780
based production system for the
news, the new stuff. And

419
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.690
that's the benefit of plain
text, right? You don't have

420
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.210
to think about the future
because you know, ASCII is

421
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.030
asking is always going to
be asking you, right. It's

422
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.650
funny that you mentioned that
I was working with an

423
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:42.180
Apache spark system recently, and
it was many, many hundreds

424
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.250
of terabytes of data, but
it was all CSV. And

425
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.710
some of the, some of
the more, what they thought

426
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.830
of as being more pragmatic,
people were having trouble understanding

427
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:59.000
the scope and reconciling the
size hundreds of terabytes with

428
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.150
what their CSV files. Like,
I can't open them in

429
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.420
VIM, but they are giant.
And, but there's a benefit

430
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.240
for that because when it's
all done and it's a

431
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.400
hundred years from now, it's
the CSV files that are

432
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.470
going to save us all.
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

433
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.230
Well, I mean CSV it's,
it's incredible to me that,

434
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.540
I mean, when did Excel
for us come out like

435
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:23.680
early eighties, mid eighties or
something? Yeah. CSV is still

436
00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.880
the only lingua franca of
business in the United States or

437
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.490
in the world. And you
know, all this talk about

438
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.000
EDI and everything else, people
just email spreadsheets, each other.

439
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.510
Okay. So is this a
truth? Okay. Because we are

440
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.520
old or is this a
truth? And we need to

441
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.150
teach everyone this truth because
it's the pragmatic truth. I

442
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.580
think, I think it actually
it's that it is a

443
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.220
pragmatic truth. Now, if, if
we went the other way

444
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.710
and said, okay, this is
a truth because we're old.

445
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.500
That's where we it's like,
well, bash scripts forever baby,

446
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.460
because I've got shell scripts
that are 30 years old,

447
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.970
that still work perfectly fine.
And I've got COVID and

448
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:07.030
<inaudible>, and you've got those
working. Did you bugs in

449
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.750
them? But yeah, well done.
Actually I wouldn't call them

450
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:16.180
a truth. I would call
them it's an observation because

451
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.000
a truth implies that it's
my way or the highway.

452
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.410
And you know, I don't
believe that. I think that

453
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.450
there are likely to be
lots of different opportunities to

454
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.200
doing different things in different
ways for us to date

455
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.650
plaintiff Has been all savior.
Well, which is great because

456
00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.570
it gets back to the
original root of the conversation,

457
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.870
which is about pragmatism, where
you might feel something is

458
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.050
a truth and someone comes
up with a better truth

459
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.700
and go, okay, well, that's
the truth now. But in

460
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.800
this case here, it is
a proven thing because it

461
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.470
is just like scientific method.
It's a theory that has

462
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.150
been proven time and time
and time again, to be

463
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.530
a useful thing. Exactly. This,
this is what works and

464
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.460
that's really, I mean, that
really probably should have been

465
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.220
the tagline to the book.
This is what works, but

466
00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.800
I think also, no, no,
no, it's not. This is

467
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.530
what works. It's this is
what worked in the past

468
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.590
tense. You could even say,
this is what worked in

469
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.310
the past tense for us.
Yeah. On these projects at

470
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.580
this time. And then here
we are over specifying the

471
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.010
specification. And now the name
of the book is the

472
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.380
pragmatic programmer. This is what
worked in the past tense

473
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.720
for us at these specific
times on these projects, we

474
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:25.660
hope that you have Well,
their success. exactly.com. Yes. You

475
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.000
made the funny joke about,
but yeah, About bash scripts

476
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.890
and Dave said, are those
working? And that brings me

477
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.460
to the chapter on software
entropy, this idea of software

478
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.280
rot. I am personally right
now actively trying to get

479
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.880
a 15 year old blogging
system that uses XML for

480
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.250
its backend up and running.
Cross-platform all new software And

481
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.050
I'm just trying to get
the thing to build. And

482
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.890
I like nothing's really changed
except basically everything has changed.

483
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.260
Yeah. It's, it's, it's insidious
because I actually had an

484
00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.040
opportunity to pull An old,
it was either an iPhone

485
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.670
or an iPod touch. It's
not some old bit of

486
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.920
gear out of the drawer
that was maybe seven, eight,

487
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.090
nine, 10 years old. And
I couldn't even connect to

488
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:16.130
any websites on it. Oh.
Certificates because certificates, because the

489
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.130
SSL protocol, The calls have
changed because you know, enough,

490
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.010
little bits of the plumbing
who changed that, Oh, that's

491
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:26.360
all it's insecure. You can't
even load, you know, modern

492
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.960
websites on an older bit
of gear and you would

493
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.320
think, well, okay, God, it's
HDP. It's HTML. Nothing has

494
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.820
changed. Well think again, you
know, enough has changed that

495
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.820
you can't get there from
here. Give me coming back

496
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.370
to your, your, your XML
thing. I think the other

497
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.620
thing is we tend to
have this kind of rosy

498
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.520
view of life was simpler
back then. And so you

499
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.920
could say, well, it worked
in the past, you know,

500
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.230
as if it was a
no brainer back then, why

501
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.770
isn't it working now? But
we all tend to forget

502
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.040
that getting it to work
in the past also involves

503
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.520
downloading 17 different versions of
WebEx and melon. So you

504
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.190
found the one that was
compatible with whatever software you

505
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.770
were using. And then it
will always incompatible with this

506
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.630
version of read line. And
therefore I've got to change

507
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.510
this. And you know, and
so I don't know about

508
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.630
you, but one of the
reasons I switched from Linux

509
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.540
to a Mac was I
just got so sick of

510
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.420
spending at least half of
my day dependency managing the

511
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.500
whole time. So, you know,
it's it's, if you imagine

512
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.990
you had one of those
systems back then that you

513
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.810
had just managed to get
work and you go all

514
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.750
dependencies. Right. And I said
to you, Hey, Scott, stop

515
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.960
doing that for a month.
You'd go spare on me

516
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.000
because you'd know at the
end of that month, right.

517
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.990
Three things will be out
of date and 15 years,

518
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.810
forget it. I mean, you
know, just rewrite it mate.

519
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.420
Well, so there was a
Ruby script buried in the

520
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.790
thing that apparently tidy it
up and did some cleaning

521
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.890
of my XML files. And
it was using like Ruby

522
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.980
2.1 0.4. And I was
trying to go an app

523
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.980
to get that version of
Ruby and it's not available.

524
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.380
So then it's like, I
don't know what the semantic

525
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.480
versioning rules are for Ruby.
If I could just go

526
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.380
to 2.1 0.3 or six
or seven, and I ended

527
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.710
up shaving the yak for
about three hours, trying to

528
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.870
figure out which, how to
get a Ruby script to

529
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:19.200
work because of versioning because
of rock because of, and,

530
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.200
and of course we've all
had the experience where a

531
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.010
repository disappears off the internet
entirely it's software can't even

532
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.500
be downloaded, but then the
children, the kids today will

533
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.090
tell you that it's all
about containers. And I should

534
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.430
be doing everything as a
container. And having my build

535
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:36.170
system live, you know, basically
in Amber, just freeze, dry

536
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.690
it in Amber, like a
bug in Amber and have

537
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.010
my whole build system there,
which, which is fine until

538
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.050
you have to interface with
the rest of the world,

539
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.790
like with the phone in
the drawer. And then the

540
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.740
rest of the world has
moved on and it doesn't

541
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.660
matter what you've got an
Amber you're still going to

542
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.020
run into problems. Okay. So
then what's the pragmatic thing

543
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.270
to do. The pragmatic thing
to do is to say

544
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.720
that software rot is a
real thing, right? If you

545
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.450
don't touch a piece of
software, it will gradually stop

546
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.150
working, which is kind of
really counter intuitive, but it's

547
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.530
absolutely the truth. So if
there is software that you

548
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.520
suspect that you want to
be using for a long

549
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.190
time, you're going to have
to put some effort into

550
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.990
it in the same way
that, you know, if you

551
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.330
live somewhere, you're going to
do a maintenance every now

552
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.970
and then otherwise it's going
to like fall apart, same

553
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.570
thing with your software. And
part of that maintenance is

554
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.570
the code. But to me,
the most important part of

555
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.350
that maintenance is thinking about
the data. And do I

556
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.350
have backups? Do I have
backups in a format that

557
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:39.310
I can use if I
lose the original and you

558
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.530
know, all these kinds of
questions or things that you're

559
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:45.040
always asking yourself as part
of the ongoing maintenance issue.

560
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.580
So I think the pragmatic
approach is simply don't do

561
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.380
it. Don't just leave a
bit of software and then

562
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.970
come back to it and
hope it's going to work

563
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.040
because it won't well, see,
now you feel like I

564
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.870
need to go get my
zip disks and make sure

565
00:30:55.870 --> 00:31:00.130
that they still work. Oh,
goodness. I think my jazz

566
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.190
drive is here somewhere. Yeah.
Those backups on VHS tape.

567
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.680
Yeah. That's yeah, no. I
actually had a whole set

568
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.670
of backups on some incredibly
expensive debt storage that I

569
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.060
bought. Right. And I had
like, I don't know, like

570
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.660
a $1,500 that drive and
I had about, I don't

571
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.650
know, 20 or 30 backup
tapes. And when I moved

572
00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:24.070
house, I looked at those
and threw them away. Cause

573
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:27.550
I just thought, okay, this
is like never, ever, ever

574
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.370
gonna work for star. It
had a scuzzy interface on

575
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:34.000
it. This is never going
to work. What's the point,

576
00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.670
right. I've never actually gone
to these tapes, throw them

577
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.880
away. And I think that's,
that's kind of like, to

578
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.640
some extent, one of the
things that we do Roman

579
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.760
software is we tend to
Revere it too much. A

580
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.710
lot of the stress goes
out of software. If you

581
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.460
consider it to be disposable,
Zs, some bits of software,

582
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.920
like if you were writing
software for a pacemaker, it

583
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.380
probably pays to get it
right. But a lot of

584
00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.370
software really. Yeah. You don't
have to worry that much.

585
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.710
And if you have to
throw it away, you have

586
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.720
to throw it away and
start again. And that's fine.

587
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.780
And so I think if
he could bring the cost

588
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.020
of experimentation down and the
cost of replacing down, then

589
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.410
a lot of those stresses
go away. Yeah. That's one

590
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.270
of the points we make
in the book is that,

591
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.750
you know, it might be
better to think about writing

592
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.140
software, knowing that you're going
to replace it rather than

593
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.320
trying to invest in fortune
tellings that, well, how, how

594
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.570
might this be extended in
the future? How could this

595
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.690
be more maintainable? Forget that.
Cause you have no idea.

596
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.090
You don't know what's going
to happen, but you know,

597
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.340
worst case scenario, whatever does
happen, you're gonna have to

598
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.260
rip this thing out. So,
okay. How can I make

599
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.080
it easy To rip this
piece out when it's no

600
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.000
longer functioning now you've got
better coupling cohesion, Applewood, mother

601
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.890
pie, all those things, right?
Yeah. I just figured it's

602
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.290
going to change in such
a way that you're not

603
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.300
going to be able to
fix it. Great. So let's

604
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.080
toss it out, throw it
out. Right. So Context of

605
00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.780
my blogging system, what I
need is the 20 years

606
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.440
of XML files and graphics.
I need the, the blog,

607
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.930
whether it's WordPress or ghost
or whatever, I don't really

608
00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.930
care. Yeah. If I went
through the executive, the same

609
00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:16.120
thing I had XML, Then
it turned into a, what

610
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.810
was it, Textile? And then
it turns Back into XML

611
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:23.470
for awhile. And then it
went right. You know, and

612
00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.380
the most important thing has
to be re retain enough

613
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.710
semantic information in the data.
Right. So I can just,

614
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.170
I can reconstruct it. And
ultimately All I care about

615
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.960
in this context of my
new migration is my URLs

616
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.630
because prop off the inner.
So as long as I

617
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.270
don't change that and I've
got the same data, hopefully

618
00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:43.540
it'll be a, it'll be
a good experience. And hopefully

619
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.840
I will be able to
have the pragmatic programmer, 20th

620
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.530
anniversary edition updated. How updated
is this book? How much

621
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.600
did you change? Because a
lot's changed in 20 years,

622
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.940
We changed a lot at
a lot of different levels.

623
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.060
So, you know, on the
one hand we probably made

624
00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.870
edits at least several edits
to every single page. I

625
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.030
know that escaped. And some
of that was just the

626
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:09.250
low level obvious stuff. Right.
So we'd been talking about

627
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:13.900
CORBA and RMI and you
know, exciting new languages like

628
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.280
Tom and interesting languages like
Eiffel and right then the

629
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.180
audience is what I've never
heard of these things. Yeah.

630
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:26.710
So there's a lot of
technology, obviously that didn't survive

631
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.890
the passage of time. And
there were a lot of

632
00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:33.250
tips where the tip is
still spot on like, like

633
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.310
the dry principle or, or
no broken windows or whatever,

634
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.300
but we have found better
ways to express it. Better

635
00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.080
ways to talk about it.
We've discovered people taking the

636
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.220
advice the wrong way. Maybe
we expanded on the, the,

637
00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:53.620
the dry principle a bit,
because that's come to mean

638
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.620
to a lot of people
don't copy and paste. And

639
00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.460
it's not about that. It's
about duplicating knowledge. So you

640
00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.610
may have a literal copy
of something in two different

641
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.790
places and that's fine because
it's serving different purposes. It's

642
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.450
in a different context. Like
we were saying before, that's

643
00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:14.830
not a drive violation. We
had some advice in the

644
00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:18.250
first book of saying like,
well, you should use metadata

645
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.980
to push decisions out of
the code. So you don't

646
00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.030
have to recompile and redeploy,
if you just need to

647
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:29.050
change some bit of configuration.
Right. Great advice. We had

648
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.550
some people take that to
the extreme and their application

649
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.740
had 40,000 configuration variables in
it, but told me to

650
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.070
do it, Andy, it's your
fault. Exactly. So, you know,

651
00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.020
there was, there was, there
was things like that where

652
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:48.060
we'd gotten feedback years and
figured, okay, well this is

653
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.820
something we should clarify. We
should tell this story. We

654
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.270
should mention, you know, a
drop will cure you if

655
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:59.940
you drink the whole bottle,
you're gonna die. Yeah. So

656
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.950
we went through and put
skull and crossbones on quite

657
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:07.170
a few things. So we
did that kind of housekeeping.

658
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.370
And as Andy said, that
was pretty pervasive. We also

659
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:17.070
took out a fair few
tips and inserted some nuance,

660
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.000
partly because the world has
changed. So for example, the

661
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.040
first edition kind of touched
on concurrency, but back then

662
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.190
the idea of having 16
calls in a laptop was

663
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:34.050
like, you know, star Trek.
So the world has changed.

664
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.060
And so we beefed up,
we have a whole new

665
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:42.180
chapter now on concurrency and
also the world has changed

666
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:49.080
in terms of socially that
the, the ethics of programming

667
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.420
is becoming more important. The
ethics of personal interactions become

668
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.550
more important. And so we've
added content to try to

669
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:05.220
address both of those things.
And in general, you know,

670
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.720
every now and then that's
a tip that I just

671
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.690
really, really, really wanted to
write, you know, over the,

672
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.530
over the intervening 20 years
have, Oh, I wish I

673
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.660
have put that one in.
And so now we have

674
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.930
the opportunity to put them
in. So probably about or

675
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.260
about a third, Andy is
brand new, probably about that.

676
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.130
And yeah, some, some topics
weren't even a concern back

677
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:28.380
then. So we have a
whole new section on security

678
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.190
because back in the day,
we were just struggling to

679
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.680
get the stuff to run.
Right. We didn't have to

680
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.630
worry about, you know, deliberate
attacks from bad actors locally

681
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.780
or around the world or
what it might be. So,

682
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.590
you know, that's a whole
new landscape that I'm sure

683
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.110
20 years from now when
we do the 40th anniversary

684
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.080
edition, we'll have a lot
more to say with a

685
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.090
whole section on AI and
making sure you don't make

686
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:58.110
Skynet. Exactly. Exactly. Please. Don't,
it'll be a whole section

687
00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:03.210
on how not to upset
Skynet off switch. You need

688
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:09.660
a big, fantastic. Well, thank
you so much. Andy hunt

689
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.090
and Dave Thomas for chatting
with me today, always a

690
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.540
pleasure. Thanks for having us.
The book is the pragmatic

691
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.670
programmer from journeymen to master
and it is now in

692
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.360
its 20th anniversary updated version.
There'll be links in the

693
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.100
show notes, so you can
pick this up. It is

694
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.320
great for everyone, whether you've
been in software for 20

695
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.060
years or 20 minutes, I
encourage you to check it

696
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.480
out. This has been another
episode of Hansel minutes, and

697
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:52.210
we'll see you again Next
week. <inaudible>.
