talks with lane Newsome. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman, and

8
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.570
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. Today. I'm talking

9
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.720
with Layne Newsome. She's a
former Microsoft, and now in

10
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.140
the MBA program at Vanderbilt
and she is a practitioner

11
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.790
and a enthusiastic of GTD
getting things done. Thank you

12
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.290
very much for taking the
time to chat with me

13
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.870
today. Thank you so much
for having me. I have

14
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.840
got on. I have, I'm
sad to admit. I have

15
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.750
gotten almost 500 emails in
my inbox and I was

16
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.040
down to like 40 or
50 yesterday. And you know,

17
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.690
I mean, I've got all
the folders set up. I've

18
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.840
read the, getting things done
book, but I've fallen off

19
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.690
the wagon. Can, can you
start at the beginning and

20
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.020
remind me what the basics
of getting things done are

21
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.680
Absolutely. One of the best
parts about DTD is that

22
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.140
you actually can get back
on the wagon pretty easily.

23
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.590
For me, it's actually a
big stress reliever when I

24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.750
get back on the wagon.
So the basics of GTD

25
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.880
are, you know, the first
step is you want to

26
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.030
make sure you're collecting everything
that goes through your head,

27
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.770
Oh, I need to do
this. I need to reply

28
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.480
to this email, every task
that might come up that

29
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.960
you think of just collected,
collected in some place. Some,

30
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.040
you know, common collection places
are your email inbox, which

31
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.850
obviously is a high traffic
area for you. I also

32
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.240
have personally, I have notebooks
everywhere. I have notebooks next

33
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.930
to my bed in my
car. I use the audio

34
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.770
recording feature on my cell
phone just to make notes

35
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.190
to myself. And that's the
collect phase. And that's basically

36
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.920
to make sure that you
don't forget about anything, you,

37
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.940
everything, every thought that's popped
into your head. You know,

38
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.230
I need to pick up
dog food at the grocery

39
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.680
store, or I need to
get my car maintained or

40
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.440
something work related. It's basically
to make sure that you

41
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.120
don't forget about anything and
you've captured it. The next

42
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.020
step is actually processing all
of that. And that's kind

43
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.330
of the next step for
you with your 400 email

44
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.560
inbox is processing all those
notes to yourself. So what

45
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.470
do each of those 400
emails mean? Do you have

46
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.830
to actually reply to all
of them? Do you need

47
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.310
to read, just read them
or do you need to

48
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.160
start a whole new project
based on those emails? And

49
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.030
so you have to take
some dedicated time each day

50
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.980
and for you, it may
be multiple times a day

51
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.610
to just sit and process
all of those. And the

52
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.560
important part in that phase
is that you don't have

53
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.160
to actually do everything on
your, to do list, right?

54
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.130
Then you can put a
task on your, to do

55
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.070
list. Okay. I have to
deal with this later. And

56
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.840
for me, that was one
of the most freeing things.

57
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.100
When I started doing GTD
was realizing that I don't

58
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.200
have to do everything as
soon as it comes in,

59
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.540
but I do need to
decide what I need to

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.970
do about it later. That's
the second phase, the third

61
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.950
phase is organizing, and that's
basically making sure that you

62
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.500
set yourself up to get
things done when you're able

63
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.950
to. So when you're sitting
at your desk and you

64
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.560
have access to a phone,
you can make phone calls.

65
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.080
If you're driving your car,
you probably don't want to

66
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.430
make those phone calls, or
if you are in the

67
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.070
grocery store. So what you
want to do is make

68
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.560
sure that when you have
access to a phone, you

69
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.560
have your to do list
for at your phone. So

70
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.380
right now I have a
phone list. That's probably about

71
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.560
seven calls, different calls. I
need to make both personal

72
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.170
and work related. And then
the next is reviewing. And

73
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.030
that's probably the most important
step for me, the most

74
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.320
helpful phase. And that's looking
at your to do list,

75
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.900
making sure you review it.
I usually review the book

76
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.650
actually suggests about once a
week for me, enough stuff

77
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.630
comes in and I try
and actually do it probably

78
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.850
about twice a week. It's
just to look at your,

79
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.820
my entire, to do list,
make sure that nothing's falling

80
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.030
through the cracks and I'm
getting things done when they

81
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.020
need to happen. And then
lastly is just doing, looking

82
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.140
at your, to do list
and getting stuff done. So

83
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.840
I'm sitting by the phone
and I'm going to make

84
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.780
some phone calls. Now I
pull out my to do

85
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.320
lists for, at my phone
and start making phone calls

86
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.020
and start crossing stuff off.
So those are the basic

87
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.790
five phases. So it feels
to me like just kind

88
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.000
of applying this to myself,
that I'm spending a lot

89
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.100
of time staring at outlook,
moving stuff around, as opposed

90
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.010
to formally calling out that
I am in the process

91
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.010
phase. Like you're, you're very
clear about what the process

92
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.580
phase and the review phase
are, but for me, I

93
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.120
don't feel like they're, they
are very well delineated. Do

94
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.270
you say to yourself, all
right, I'm done processing and

95
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.780
I am now reviewing like
Don't, you know, we have

96
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.850
very first started with GTD.
I was a little bit

97
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.860
more defined about how I
was spending my time as

98
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.890
I've gotten more comfortable with
the process and didn't take

99
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.040
much time. I started, there's
a little bit of bleeding

100
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.400
there. And part of that
comes from, you know, I

101
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.410
used to work at Microsoft.
So I understand your pain

102
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.350
with the 400 emails stuff
comes in and people expect

103
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.740
you to respond to stuff
quickly. And at a minimum,

104
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.150
you know, if you have
a minute to check your

105
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.750
email, you know, you do
that sort of emergency, okay,

106
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.270
what do I need to
respond to right now? And

107
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.040
that's kind of dealing with
work as it comes in.

108
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.950
And you know, you have
to allow yourself flexibility to

109
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.960
do that. And so there
might be a little bit

110
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.360
of processing. There might be
a little bit of just

111
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.860
doing right there. And so
it bleeds a little bit,

112
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.210
but when you have a
moment to sit and process,

113
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.490
you can crank through a
hundred emails fairly quickly. If

114
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.330
you're not actually, you know,
taking actions and you're just

115
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.170
processing. So it's helpful, you
know, one of the rules

116
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.490
or one of the suggestions
of the GTD program is

117
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.960
to implement a two minute
rule. So as you're processing,

118
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.510
let's say, you know, after
we're done here, you have

119
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.870
15 minutes to sit and
process your email. If you

120
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.350
come along an email that
has a two minute action,

121
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.230
something that will take two
minutes or less, a quick

122
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.480
yes or no reply, or
affording to a colleague, go

123
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.850
ahead and take care of
it. Right. Then there's a

124
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.250
lot of stuff that can
be taken care of in

125
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.010
two minutes or less. And
he suggests going ahead and

126
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.860
doing actions that are two
minutes or less, go ahead

127
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.890
and do them while you're
processing. And then you'll, and

128
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.230
then you don't have to
go back and do them

129
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.260
later. So there there's a
little bit of overlap. I

130
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.330
don't think it has to
be so completely delineated, but

131
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.630
it actually does help to
have time dedicated just to

132
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.450
processing, especially when you're talking
about the volume of emails

133
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.980
that you encounter on a
daily basis. Do you schedule

134
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.380
that? I mean, do you
put in your schedule 3:00 PM,

135
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.670
Friday we'll review inbox, and
then sit down and do

136
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.080
it. I used to, and
that, that was a big

137
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.380
help for me, especially scheduling
the weekly review. I would

138
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.070
schedule at least an hour,
if not two on, I

139
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.560
usually did it on Friday
mornings because then I had

140
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.340
time to address something. If
I let something fall for

141
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.110
a week and I still
had time while people were

142
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.840
still in the office. So
the weekly review I used

143
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.570
to have on my calendar.
And if I ever feel

144
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.180
like I'm not doing it
frequently enough, I'm not having

145
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.280
the discipline to do it.
I'll throw it back on

146
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.160
my calendar, but it's, I've
gotten into enough of a

147
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.640
habit now that I really,
I start to feel stressed

148
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.090
out. If I haven't done
a weekly review and assessment

149
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.140
of everything I have to
do. So, you know, for

150
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.880
me, it's almost a form
of stress relief. If I

151
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.040
start feeling stressed, I know
I'm not doing my review

152
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:45.100
frequently enough. So in terms
of the daily processing, I

153
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.820
don't, I don't really schedule
time for it. Typically that's

154
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.250
the first thing I do
in the morning is processed

155
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.860
emails. So I make sure
to allow myself a few

156
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.700
extra minutes in the morning,
just to process email, and

157
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.620
that can take anywhere from
15 minutes to half an

158
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.350
hour, for someone who's getting
the kind of volume of

159
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.480
email that you are, you
might need to schedule an

160
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.450
hour for that, and then
just sort of start your

161
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.820
day better. And then, you
know, as you have time

162
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.270
throughout the day, 15 minutes
here, 10 minutes there, you

163
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.820
can keep up with the
system. But if you haven't

164
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.400
had a chance all day,
you know, I would suggest

165
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.190
taking half an hour at
the end of the day,

166
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.740
just to process email. And
that's not, you know, like

167
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.830
I said, it's not replying
to email necessarily. It's just

168
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.890
deciding what does this email
mean? Do I need to

169
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.380
take action on this and
by when do I need

170
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.820
to do that? Okay. So
I, I think I get

171
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.230
that part. I'm, I'm looking
at my now I have,

172
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.530
I have an inbox and
I also have an inbox

173
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.730
CC. So I formally pulled
out a second inbox. So

174
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.730
I've made the determination that
if I'm CC'd on something,

175
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.780
it is less important than
if I am directly mailed

176
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.020
and that's helped a lot.
I've got 250 males in

177
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.770
my CC list and I've
got 170 in my inbox.

178
00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.780
So I can go into
my CC and I could

179
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.660
spend 10 minutes here and
I could go delete, delete,

180
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.820
don't need that, need that
delete, delete. And I could

181
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.620
do that and then take
about five or 10 minutes.

182
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.930
And then I would have
effectively, I'm sure that in

183
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.540
about 10 minutes, I could
clear out my CC cause

184
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.800
most of it is FYI,
right? It's either reference or

185
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.100
it's either reference some action
required or I don't need

186
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.850
it right on the inbox
side. This is, you know,

187
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.610
like here we go, I
need to renew a prescription.

188
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.060
And that's right next to
a mail from legal affairs

189
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.820
with these are, these males
are, are effectively peers within,

190
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.560
within the inbox until I
assign value to them. One

191
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.560
is easy when I'm near
a website where I'm near

192
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.340
a web browser, I'll renew
my prescription, but this, this

193
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.050
legal and corporate affairs, and
this could be a huge

194
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.350
thing. This could turn into
a day long project right

195
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.630
now. What? Right. Well, that's
an excellent point. And that's

196
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.640
the distinction that GTD makes
between projects and next actions.

197
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.310
So a lot of your,
to do items that come

198
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.030
out of your email box
may be simple, like renewing

199
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.330
a prescription and that's a
one single next action. You

200
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.640
need to be near a
web browser. So that's an

201
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.300
easy action to take, but
there's tons of stuff that's

202
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.340
going to come up. That's
going to require more than

203
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.810
just a simple action and
the GTD system calls those

204
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:28.520
projects and basically anything that
requires multiple steps to be

205
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.210
considered a project. So right
now, I think on my,

206
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.940
to do list, I have
around 25 projects that are

207
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:40.280
ongoing. And so what I
do, I use outlook and

208
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.820
I have a category of
my tasks called projects. And

209
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.430
what I do is I
gather all the information that

210
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.680
I have on that project
emails, you know, files notes

211
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.800
to myself and I keep
them all in that task.

212
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.630
And so I create a
project and what I try

213
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.840
to always make sure is
that I'm always, I always

214
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.810
have a next step on
that project. So whether whether

215
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.190
the next step is to
look up an article that

216
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.900
I need to reference for,
for a project or contact

217
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.790
a person from the legal
department to ask them a

218
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.560
question. So those are next
physical actions. And so you're

219
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.370
going to have multiple tasks,
tasks associated with that project.

220
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.530
And you just want to
make sure that you're always

221
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.220
making progress on those projects.
And that's a big part

222
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.720
of the weekly review as
well, and is making sure

223
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.840
that you go through all
of your documentation on your

224
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.500
projects. So, you know, then
that can be a quick,

225
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.680
fast process, or it can
be a little bit slower

226
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.550
if you need to take
some time. But you know,

227
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.970
I go through all my
notes that I've gathered over

228
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.820
the past week on this
particular project, I make sure

229
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.370
I'm making progress on it
when I do my weekly

230
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.340
review. And if I haven't
made any progress, I have

231
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.620
to sit and think about
what is literally the very

232
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.350
next action that I need
to take on this. And

233
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.300
then that goes onto my
to do list to make

234
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.090
sure that the next time
I have a chance to

235
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.550
call that person that I
need to ask the question

236
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.480
about the legal project. You
know, I have that on

237
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.990
my to do list. So
that's how you handle multi-step

238
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.150
projects. Okay. So, so let's
talk a little bit about

239
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.340
the specifics of how to,
how someone would set this

240
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.160
up. What kind of folders
do you have an outlook

241
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.440
and how important is the
setting up of that? Because

242
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.840
I'm hearing you say things
like to do lists, but

243
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.970
I don't know if you're
using the, to do list

244
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.370
that it's built in outlook
where you're using, you know,

245
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.790
remember the milk or one
of these, Right, right. Yeah.

246
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.350
I've actually, I've played around
with several, I'm personally a

247
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.630
little biased towards outlook. I've
been using it for a

248
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.610
long time. So I've got
my smartphone set up that

249
00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.600
it'll sync my outlook tasks.
So I I'm a big

250
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.770
outlook user. The GTD system
actually doesn't dictate a particular

251
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.400
system at all. As a
matter of fact, he outlines

252
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.310
how to use just pen
and paper. And it just

253
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.130
is a matter of what's
most comfortable for you. For

254
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:19.080
me, attacky outlook is very
comfortable for me. So I

255
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.090
use the tasks in outlook.
I use categories for my

256
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.240
tasks and the categories are
similar to what I was

257
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.830
talking about. I put a
context on my categories. So

258
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.590
if it's a phone call,
it's in my phone category,

259
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.910
if it's something I need
to do on my computer,

260
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.510
it's a computer category. There
may be times in which

261
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.880
I have access to my
computer, but I don't have

262
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.550
access to the internet. So
I make a distinction there.

263
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.380
I have some tasks that
are at my computer. I

264
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.590
just need my computer and
that's it. I don't need

265
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.580
internet access. I also have
an app web category and

266
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.070
that's for stuff that I
do actually need internet access

267
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:02.360
for. So, and, and the
categories, you know, might add

268
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.320
web category. That that was
just one that I created

269
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.110
for myself. It wasn't outlined
in the GTD book or

270
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:14.000
anything. It just makes sense
for me. So depending on

271
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.990
what your, you know, what
your context is, you know,

272
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.310
if you work from different
places, I'm working from home,

273
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.160
working from the office, there's
certain things you can do

274
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.160
in each of those locations.
So that's how I divvy

275
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.200
up my categories. And, and
I use those in outlook.

276
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.840
And in terms of email
folders, I actually only have

277
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.250
a single archive email folder.
And I used to have

278
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.900
tons and tons of email
folders. You know, this project,

279
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.440
that project, which can get
a little bit unwieldy because

280
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.320
as you know, you can
get an email, let's say,

281
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.380
you and I are working
on two different projects. I'll

282
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.750
probably send you one email
that addresses both of those

283
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.770
projects. So then it becomes,
do I make two copies

284
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.700
of this email to file
it? Or which project do

285
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.130
I file this email in?
Because you want to hang

286
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.040
onto the email, but you
want to make sure that

287
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.010
you can find it later.
And the good news is

288
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.540
that the way email search
has improved over the past

289
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.590
several years, I find that
I really don't need to

290
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.550
categorize my emails into folders.
I moved, I moved my

291
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.090
emails over to saved email.
Once I'm done looking at

292
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.820
them. And then whenever I
need something, I just search

293
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.360
and it actually works pretty
quickly these days. This is

294
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.640
the part of the show
where I mock you while

295
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.350
actually Tellerik mock says your
applications, that you're testing dependent

296
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.530
on external systems over which
you have no control. Maybe

297
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.380
you're being slowed down by
those systems that are lack

298
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.870
of availability. Responsiveness. Do you
want to do TDD? Right?

299
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.780
Our friends at Tellerik help
you solve some of those

300
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.710
problems with their newest mocking
tool. Just mock it'll let

301
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.950
you do fast, simple controlled
unit tests, independent of external

302
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:11.410
resources like databases, web services,
proprietary code, unlike some marketing

303
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:16.060
tools, just mock works with
non-virtual methods, seal classes, static

304
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.390
methods, giving you complete control
of your code. You can

305
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:24.520
get more details. You can
download just mock at telerik.com/just

306
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.190
mock. And don't forget to
thank Tellerik for supporting Hanselman

307
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:32.140
it's on their Facebook fan
page, facebook.com/tellerik. Thanks a lot.

308
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.440
No, I think that, that
one thing that one big

309
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.790
statement of, I have only
one folder called archive is

310
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.270
the scariest part of the
whole process from 90% of

311
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.070
people, you know, you tell
them everything and like, okay,

312
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.870
context. I get that, do
it, drop it, delegated different.

313
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.120
Okay. I get that. Oh,
you have only one folder.

314
00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:00.210
I think only people who
use Gmail really get that

315
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.420
they're they're okay with that.
And outlook people, you know,

316
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.480
with their PSTs and their
50 folders, they just, they

317
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.350
can't let go of that.
Having only one, one folder

318
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.330
thing mean how do we
get those people to stop?

319
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.420
My boss has 5,000 emails
in his inbox, Right? Yeah.

320
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.110
Well, you know, the, it
took me awhile to get

321
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:24.380
over that hump. Actually, the
way I adopted GTD was

322
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.650
definitely piecemeal. And I took
sort of the pieces that

323
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.380
I liked and the stuff
that scared me, like the

324
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.690
one folder I didn't adopt
for probably a good six

325
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:39.320
months. And I think I
was talking with somebody else

326
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.690
who had implemented the system
and they were a fellow

327
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.860
outlook user. And they said,
look, it's actually taking you

328
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:51.410
more time to search through
folders to find an email

329
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.400
that, that you need to
reference. And they said, think

330
00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.080
about how frequently you look
for an old email. And

331
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.390
so, and it's not actually
that frequent that I go

332
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:09.380
back and look for emails.
And so, you know, I'm

333
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.520
already getting a new email
on a particular topic, perhaps.

334
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.420
So first of all, it's
not a pro you know,

335
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.210
it's not a task that
I do all the time

336
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:27.200
and the search functionality has
gotten so good that it

337
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.100
means that it actually takes
less time to search for

338
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.790
an email in a single
folder, rather than looking at

339
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.580
multiple folders. Cause really, you
know, if you have an

340
00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.130
ongoing project, you're going to
have to search within that

341
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.850
folder anyway. So if you're
already doing a search in

342
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.820
that folder by person, or
just putting in a keyword,

343
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.640
you're already doing that searching.
So why not just have

344
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.170
one place to look now,
one thing to keep in

345
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.150
mind when I have an
email that I have to

346
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.380
reply to, I don't put
it into saved emails until

347
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.560
I've either created a draft
of that email or made

348
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.630
a copy of that email
over in a task list.

349
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.230
So that means that the
emails that I'm actively working

350
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.880
on are, I'm not accessing
them from my saved email,

351
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.090
saved email really as an
archive for me. And so

352
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.640
it's when I go and
look up old conversations or

353
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.280
need to find a piece
of data that I haven't

354
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.610
actively been working on. I'm
wondering if I have too

355
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.640
many folders, then I don't
have a lot. I have

356
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.000
a system I've put online,
I've got my inbox inbox

357
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.810
CC. I've also separated out
emails that come in from

358
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.830
externals. So email that comes
from inside Microsoft is more

359
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.260
important than InMail email that
does I'm CC'd on, is

360
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.100
more important than email from
some random email address. So

361
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.260
that helps me in my
processing phase. I have, I

362
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.100
don't have one archive folder.
I have two, I have

363
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.030
one where items do not
expire. That's my archive folder.

364
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.990
And then I have one
where only the last 90

365
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.880
days of stuff. So I
have reference and I have

366
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.210
reference short term and it
is set up in outlook

367
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.270
and exchange with an expiration
date. So when something is

368
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.360
91 days old, it automatically
gets deleted that way. I

369
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.230
don't have to worry about,
you know, email space. Right,

370
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.960
right. You know, that actually,
that actually sounds like a

371
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.890
great system, you know, in
terms of the inboxes, the

372
00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.500
different inboxes that you referenced.
I think that's a great

373
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.740
way of sorting a large
volume of email. And like

374
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.500
you said, if you are
processing a particular box, you

375
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.640
know, that you're, CC'd for
example, on emails, then that's,

376
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.710
that's a mindset that you
have and you can drill

377
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.820
through a bunch of emails
quickly. And in terms of

378
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.690
the, the two separate archive
folders, I think that's a

379
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:50.220
great system. As long as
you are comfortable, personal, personally,

380
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.570
comfortable with the emails that
are expiring, if you're ever

381
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.740
stressed out about, Oh, I
hope that that's, you know,

382
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.230
I hope I didn't need
something that was 120 days

383
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.880
old. And, and that's really
just a personal decision that

384
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.290
you'd need to make about
particular emails. I mean, TTD

385
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:14.400
is really all about stress
relief and so anything that's

386
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:20.580
stressing you out, isn't working
really. And so if that's

387
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.110
working well for you and
you know, I can't see

388
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.810
why it wouldn't and not
something that's older than 90

389
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.530
days is probably not super
relevant to you. I think

390
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.020
that sounds like a great
system. That's not too terribly

391
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.140
many folders. Yeah. Well, I'm
trying to make the number

392
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.050
of decisions that I make
as small as possible. And

393
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.620
after I've replied to an
email, I just look at

394
00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.630
it and I think to
myself, do I need this

395
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.600
for the next year or
so? I don't even think

396
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.910
90 days, I just think
now next year or so,

397
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.940
even though it's kind of
a lie, you know, so

398
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.560
I need, do I need
this for a long time?

399
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.350
Or, you know, do I,
do I need it forever?

400
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.860
So really it's about deciding
forever or not. And that

401
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.310
seems to work fairly well
where I'm getting a little

402
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:10.350
caught up is I have
folders for contexts you were

403
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.360
referring to like I'm in
front of the phone and

404
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.340
I'm at the I'm at
the mall and all the

405
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.820
different kind of ad contexts.
Right. So I have, I

406
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.540
have a folder for, for,
at, at, at blog, which

407
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.030
isn't really a context, but
it's like stuff I want

408
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.510
to blog. That's not really
what to do, but it

409
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.460
is stuff I want to
remember. It's my, it's my

410
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:33.600
Heil of stuff I could
blog about. Right. It's not

411
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.800
a project, it's not an
ongoing project. It is a

412
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.960
reference folder of its own.
Right. And, and that's it.

413
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:47.180
That's a great question actually.
And there's two ways that

414
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.290
I would probably look at
that the way that I

415
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:56.630
would likely handle it is
with my someday maybe list.

416
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.680
So that's, that to me
is a pretty powerful part

417
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.520
of the GTD system is
the ability to say, okay,

418
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.430
I'm not working on this
right now, but I don't

419
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.920
want to forget about it.
And when I have a

420
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.950
chance, sometime I want to
look at it, but it's

421
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.040
not, you know, in my
active to do list right

422
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.990
now. And I have, I
have over a hundred items

423
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:24.260
in my someday maybe list.
And what that means is

424
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.810
that it's just stuff that,
you know, it could be

425
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:31.400
very important, like for you,
with blogs, you know, it's

426
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.470
not your act as law
that you're writing right now,

427
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.440
but it's, you know, you
want to keep track of

428
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.010
it or it could be,
you know, more of a

429
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.540
longterm. I want to learn
Chinese, you know, so it

430
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.900
could be, I have a
very wide spectrum on mine

431
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.610
and it doesn't bother me
in the least that it's

432
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:54.530
a large list. And what
I do is usually part

433
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.540
of my weekly review every
once in a while, if

434
00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.030
I'm pressed for time, it'll
be, I'll do it every

435
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.510
other weekly review. I'll take
a good look at that

436
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.610
list. And it usually doesn't
take me very long cause

437
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:05.900
there's a lot of stuff
on the list that I

438
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.760
can immediately say, Nope, I'm
not working on that this

439
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:14.300
week, but something like a
blog idea. If you reviewed

440
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.660
it weekly, if you reviewed
this list weekly, I would

441
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.330
probably have a different task
for each project. I'd say,

442
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.940
all right, someday, I'd like
to blog about this topic

443
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.370
and I just put it
in my someday list. And

444
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.300
then next time I have
my weekly review, I'll see

445
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.670
that idea. And I can
decide at that point, do

446
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:32.840
I want to do that
this week? Or do I

447
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.630
want to do it next
week? Or sometime in the

448
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.160
distant future? And so it's
actually a helpful tool to

449
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.680
allow you to say no
to stuff. No, I'm not

450
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.840
going to do this right
now, but I don't want

451
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.540
to forget about it. It's
important to me. And I

452
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.490
think it's a great idea.
I just don't have time

453
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.500
for it right now, or
I have other things I

454
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.680
need to do first. So
I, I use that list

455
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:59.650
a lot. How do you
deal with, and this may

456
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.030
be a silly question, but
how do you deal with

457
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:05.890
guilt? I went into my
someday maybe list recently, as

458
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.410
well as my action. I
have a folder for actions,

459
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.630
which I think I need
to get rid of and

460
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.410
found that about 10 different
things were no longer relevant

461
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.910
simply because I didn't do
it. So then That is

462
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.480
a funny question. I like
it though. Cause I've definitely

463
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.930
looked at my someday maybe
less than went. Oh, okay.

464
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.930
I didn't end up doing
that. What about usually signals

465
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:30.520
to me is that I'm
not looking at the list

466
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:38.560
frequently enough. So if something's
come along, come and gone

467
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.970
and opportunity, that means that
I didn't look at that

468
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.470
recently enough to add it
back to my, to do

469
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.470
it. So that's the really
great thing about doing a

470
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.040
weekly review and why I
actually would recommend for somebody

471
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.490
starting on the system to
actually block the time until

472
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.870
you get into the habit
of reviewing when you review

473
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.530
it, it's right there in
your face. And something that

474
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.920
wasn't a priority last week
may have turned into a

475
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.060
priority this week because time
is running up. And so

476
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.590
just being able to look
at, look at those lists

477
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.130
and be reminded if you're
looking at it frequently enough,

478
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.730
you'll be reminded in time.
Now, one other thing that

479
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.300
I will do, if there's
something that I'm not gonna

480
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.160
worry about right now, an
example may be, would be

481
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.380
a dentist appointment, not, not
a super urgent item, but

482
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.360
I need to schedule a
desk appointment. It needs to

483
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.660
be, you know, around February,
I'll put it, I'll go

484
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.850
ahead and put a date
on that task within outlook.

485
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:49.350
And so then as I'm
reviewing my upcoming week, I'll

486
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.900
look and see that task
and it's coming up on

487
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.360
it as a date. And
so at that point, I'll

488
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.240
say, Oh, that date is
coming up and I'll put

489
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.350
it into my, you know,
at phone call list to,

490
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.510
to make the phone call
to the dentist, to schedule

491
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:08.520
the appointment or create a
project to, to get something

492
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.420
done. So You said create
a project. Whereas what is

493
00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.580
that? Is that a folder?
Is that a, is that

494
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:21.530
a mental construct? Yes. Yes.
I use again, the categories

495
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:26.330
in outlook tasks and I,
so I have project categories

496
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.860
and those are those projects
that have multiple steps to

497
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.060
them. It's not just a
single action. So I would

498
00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.190
imagine that maybe a blog
entry would be an example

499
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.360
of that. So if I've
got a blog potential blog

500
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.620
topic on my to do
list and I look at,

501
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.300
I'd go through my weekly
review and I said, that's

502
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.090
a perfect topic for next
week. So I put that

503
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.060
into the, into my project
list and I make sure

504
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.040
that I have a next
action on it. So it

505
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.160
may be doing some research.
It may be writing a

506
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.000
rough draft. It may be
making a phone call to

507
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.590
product manager of a particular
new project or something like

508
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:13.940
that. And so anything that's
a multistep project would be

509
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.510
a project in the DTD
context construct anything that requires

510
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:22.160
more than one next physical
action. And you're managing that

511
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.440
only with categories Pretty much.
Yeah, I'm a heavy outlook

512
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.920
user. I pretty much live
in my tasks list. And

513
00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.620
you know, I take advantage
of the capability and outlook

514
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.450
to be able to put,
you know, a PowerPoint or

515
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:43.180
an email or a web
within the task. And then

516
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.790
I just review those items.
Now that's not to say

517
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.760
that I don't have, you
know, folders. I have both

518
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:54.670
physical and electronic files and
folders that basically hold them

519
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.200
working material. So, you know,
right now I'm in school.

520
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.230
So I have folders for
each class and that's where

521
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.780
I keep my materials for
that class. And I also

522
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.390
have physical folders for each
class. And then at the

523
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.530
end of the semester, I'll
change over my folders. I'll

524
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.140
file what I want to
keep and throw away the

525
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.090
rest. So, but in terms
of projects to get done,

526
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.180
I manage it mainly out
of my Alec tasks. Yes.

527
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.050
Do you think, and all
of that, we're talking about

528
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.510
outlook, which is very, you
know, outlook centric, but certainly

529
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.790
all of this would work
in, in Gmail or whatever

530
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.730
someone else wanted to use
as far as they could

531
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.570
use labels instead of categories,
et cetera, et cetera. Definitely.

532
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.140
I'm not as familiar with
Gmails system in terms of

533
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.570
tasks, basically anything that you
can keep track of information.

534
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.980
So I know that remember
the milk is very popular.

535
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.680
So any, any system, even
just paper and notebooks and

536
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.750
paper, if you have any
way of tracking information will

537
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.930
work. So if you're using
literally just a note pad

538
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.780
and a pen, then you'll
have probably a file folder

539
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:12.240
for each project. So for
each, let me think of

540
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.380
a, a particular project. So
if I was having this

541
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:21.300
conversation with you today beforehand,
I did some additional reading

542
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.190
and I made some notes
on stuff I wanted to,

543
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.770
to touch on. If I
was doing that all in

544
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.720
paper, then I would just
have a bunch of papers

545
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.510
filed in there. And then
when I did my weekly

546
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:34.770
review, I would page through
my file folder instead of

547
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.040
going through my outlet task.
So there's tons of programs

548
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.540
out there that will work.
And it just, as a

549
00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.110
matter of what you're most
comfortable with, Sounds like it

550
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.870
sounds like this is as
much about just being regimented

551
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.030
as it is about the
system itself. Like you said,

552
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.820
the goal is to be
not stressed out and it

553
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.820
is to have a trusted
system that you can count

554
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:58.920
on that you, that works
for you. Exactly. And actually,

555
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.350
that's, that's a key point,
a trusted system that you

556
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:06.540
can count on your brain
will know if your system

557
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:10.320
is working. Your brain knows
if you're going to put

558
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.580
off doing that weekly review.
And so if it realizes

559
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:19.230
that you're not hitting those
milestones, you're not, you know,

560
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:23.460
your, your emails backing up
or you're letting tasks fall

561
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.640
off. Your brain knows that.
And your subconscious tries to

562
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.820
then start remembering things for
you. So it doesn't want

563
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.700
you to forget stuff. So
if it doesn't trust that

564
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:37.980
your system is fully in
place and it's capturing every

565
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.970
to do item, you have,
then it's gonna start taking

566
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:46.760
back that responsibility. And that's
what stress feels like. And

567
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.590
so when I, when I'm
feeling stressed out, I do

568
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.870
a review and I just
make sure I've captured every

569
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.170
single thing. You know, one
of the examples that David Allen

570
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.480
touches on in his book
is he said, you know,

571
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.000
we've all had that feeling
of we make a list

572
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.400
and it makes us feel
better. You know, we're stressed

573
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.720
out. We know we have
a lot of stuff to

574
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.360
do, and then we make
a list and that makes

575
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.760
us feel better. And there's
a good reason for that.

576
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.160
Our brain now knows, Hey,
I can look at that

577
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.420
list and see all these
to do items. And I

578
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.790
feel better because now I
don't have to remember them.

579
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.140
I just have to look
at the, to do list.

580
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:27.620
And so that's, that's where
the trust comes in. Your

581
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.110
brain has to trust what
you're doing, or it'll just

582
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.540
continue to, to try and
hang on to all those,

583
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.670
to do items. And there's
just too much to do

584
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.410
your brain. Can't hang on
all that stuff. I like

585
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:42.520
that really the issue is
releasing yourself from the psychic

586
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.580
weight of all the stuff
that you're keeping in your

587
00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.890
head. I mean, you, those
lists that you're, that you're

588
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.740
spilling onto paper or into
whatever your trusted system is,

589
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.830
those lists are causing you
pain. Exactly. And it's a,

590
00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:00.010
it's a big stress relief.
I mean, that's what I

591
00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.700
think the official title of
the book is the art

592
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.790
of stress-free productivity. And that
really is true. It's a

593
00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:10.570
big stress relief to know.
I know for a fact,

594
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:14.230
I'm, I haven't forgotten to
follow up with anybody, you

595
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:18.040
know, right now I'm finishing
up an MBA program and

596
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.410
you know, so I'm doing
my networking and talking with

597
00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:22.990
people and I don't want
to forget to follow up

598
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:25.360
with someone. I don't want
to, you know, wake up

599
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.340
in the middle of the
night in a couple of

600
00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.020
days and go, Oh my
gosh, I'm interested in an

601
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.240
email that person, and now
I've missed, you know, a

602
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:35.740
potential future job opportunity and
that's stressful. And so if

603
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.890
I know, I know I'm
not going to forget something

604
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:41.770
because I've written it down.
It's in my system and

605
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.900
I feel good about that.
So I can just relax

606
00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.460
and focus on getting things
done. Very cool. Thank you

607
00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.770
so much lane Newson for
talking to me about getting

608
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.230
things done today. I really
appreciate it. Thank you for

609
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.270
having me on it's fun.
All right. This has been

610
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.660
another episode of Hansel minutes.
See you again next week.
