Scott talks with Warren sand

7
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.620
and his son Carter about
their new book. Hello world.

8
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.790
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman
and this is another episode

9
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.040
of Hansel minutes. And today
I've got on the phone

10
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.460
from California Warren and Carter
sand. They are the authors

11
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.750
of hello, world, computer programming
for kids and other beginners.

12
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.420
How's it going guys? Great.
So Warren, you're an engineer,

13
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.820
but a Carter as an
author. You're, you're kind of

14
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.210
in a unique situation. How
old are you, sir? I'm

15
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.360
10 years old. You're 10.
And when did you start

16
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.630
writing this book? I started
writing this book when I

17
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.510
was six years old. So
you've been working on this

18
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.240
book for basically 40% of
your life. So you've, you've

19
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.470
always been writing a book
haven't you? Yeah, I guess

20
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.100
I could say that. And
did you, were you, did

21
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.890
you actually write stuff? Did
you sit down and write

22
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.830
programs and did your dad
test things on you or

23
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.230
what was the relationship? How
did you guys work together

24
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.790
on this book? Well, I
wrote a lot of things

25
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.500
in the book and my
dad also wrote a lot

26
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.190
of things. The primary things
that I wrote were the

27
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.360
virtual pet programs in the
book, which my dad did

28
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.630
help me with a little
bit. And also anytime you

29
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.960
see a little cartoon of
me with the speech bubble,

30
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.960
I also wrote that, Oh,
okay. And this is a

31
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.880
print. This was an interesting
book. I read this book

32
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.080
the last couple of days
and because it's called hello

33
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.280
world, and it's got a,
you know, kind of a

34
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.340
cartoon picture of you and
your dad. I thought that

35
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.490
it would be, and, you
know, forgive me for phrasing

36
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.540
it this way, but I
thought it would be kind

37
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.760
of dumbed down. You know,
I thought that you were

38
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.450
going to make it really,
really, really, almost too basic,

39
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.790
but I found it to
be really enjoyable to read.

40
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.760
I didn't feel that you
were, you know, pulling any

41
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.120
punches. I kind of assumed
that, that you were maybe

42
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.690
in your teens, what ages
do you think that kids

43
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.850
could read a book like
this? Cause it's, it's, it's

44
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.460
simple, but it's complicated at
the same time. I think

45
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.970
we really tried not to
dumb it down so it

46
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.890
could be used by beginners,
but also if people want

47
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.860
to go deeper that they
could and really also for,

48
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.750
you know, beginner adults. So
it wouldn't seem like it

49
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.470
was just a kid's book.
The age question is one

50
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.300
that we've had quite A
few times and it's kind

51
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.940
of hard to answer. Like
some kids could be, you

52
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.560
know, six or eight years
old really, and get a

53
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.870
start on as long as
they can read. Well, and

54
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.970
they have a really basic
knowledge of computers, like how

55
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.310
to operate the computer and
save files and things like

56
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.160
that. And some kids would
be a little bit older

57
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.930
when they're, when they're ready
for it. It really just

58
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.710
depends on the kid. It
all goes to probably, I

59
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.540
would say motivation is one
of the key factors. If

60
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.720
you're motivated to learn programming,
then you can use this

61
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.590
book. I think. Yeah. I
think that's an interesting, an

62
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.100
interesting point. Sometimes I feel
like beginner programmer books spend

63
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.280
a lot of time trying
to convince the reader to

64
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.400
be interested. And it definitely
seemed like, like the way

65
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.800
that you've structured, this was
that you assumed that the

66
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.900
people that are already pretty
interested in getting involved and

67
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.600
you're enabling them rather than
trying to convince them of

68
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.560
why being a programmer would
be a good thing. Right?

69
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.210
Yeah. There's a little bit
of that at the start.

70
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.180
I mean, I do think
that learning programming is a

71
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.100
very valuable and good thing
to do, even if you're

72
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.930
not going to be a
programmer when you grow up,

73
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.640
like if you're going to
be in some other career,

74
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.280
because just a little bit
of programming knowledge, even the

75
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.680
basics can help you no
matter what kind of career

76
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.440
you go into. I think,
Yeah. That's a really interesting

77
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.380
point because I had asked
you just before, if you

78
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.390
were a programmer and you
said you were an engineer,

79
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.730
but so you probably use
programming in your job, but

80
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.840
you're not a professional coder.
Is that right? Yes, that's

81
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.260
right. And then, so do
you find yourself writing code

82
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.900
occasionally to solve the problems
that you're trying to solve?

83
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.240
Yeah, I do. I mean,
I've done a little bit

84
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.240
of embedded scene programming. I've
done some scripting to automate

85
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.800
things that I do in
my job. So I do

86
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.430
write code from time to
time. Do you think that

87
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.700
everyone should learn should learn
coding? I mean, I, I've

88
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.490
always said that, you know,
some point in your life

89
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.410
you're going to be working
somewhere and you'll need to

90
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.410
write an Excel macro. And
if you had a programming

91
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.050
class early in your life,
that macro that you write

92
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.290
in Microsoft Excel will be
so much easier if your

93
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.480
brain is tuned to those
kinds of, of construct. Exactly.

94
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.340
That's, that's exactly what I
was thinking. Like there's so

95
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.950
many people who, again, aren't
in programming work, whether it's

96
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.600
in engineering or finance or
whatever the job, and it

97
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.190
may be that even just
a little bit of basic

98
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.500
programming, like you said, to
do an Excel macro or

99
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.020
a little script to automate
some tasks that they need

100
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.780
to do every day. Just
that basic programming knowledge is

101
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.130
really valuable. Now, now that
this book has done Carter,

102
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.310
do you find yourself writing
programs all the time to

103
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.130
solve problems for, for school
or do you, do you

104
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.660
mostly write games? Well, I'd
say that I program like

105
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.020
every once in a while,
probably once a week, for

106
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.850
example, or yeller this school
year, I needed to learn

107
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.610
my math facts, which I
was getting a little rusty

108
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.520
on. So I wrote just
a very simple program to

109
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.680
test me on my math
tax and see how well

110
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.640
I did. That's a pretty
cool thing. So you wrote

111
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.770
a program to test yourself
on math and this is

112
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.460
something that you came up
with on your own? Yes.

113
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.560
It was something that I
came up with on my

114
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.870
own Now, amongst the ten-year-old
set and not, you have

115
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.550
to forgive me. I haven't
been 10 for a very

116
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.700
long time amongst people who
are 10. Do you think

117
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.120
there are a lot of
programmers? Well, that's kind of

118
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.020
hard to say because like
most ten-year-olds that I know

119
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.420
aren't really programmers, but there
probably might be. Now when

120
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.090
you started learning about programming,
did you think you would

121
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.520
maybe be like write games
for like an Nintendo? I

122
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.170
suppose ten-year-olds play, play handheld
games. Actually. I think lots

123
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.930
of ten-year-olds would want to
do that, do that, but

124
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.110
the problem with that is
like video games that are

125
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.700
out today, like Mario and
Zelda and all those other

126
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.030
games. Those are like some
of the most complicated pieces

127
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.870
of programming around. So that
wouldn't really be something that

128
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.930
you would tackle when you
were first being in programming.

129
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.470
Like I am, But you
did write a game or

130
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.860
two for, for this book,
which I thought was pretty,

131
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.980
pretty cool. What, what games
did you ride Then? The

132
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.560
main games that I wrote,
I think were the hang

133
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.160
man and the virtual pack,
those were kind of my

134
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.880
two main games. I also
wrote one of the more

135
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.140
basic games. It was called
Paul. And you have a

136
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.680
little paddle, which you control
with your mouse and, and

137
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.840
you have to get a
ball to like bounce off

138
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.930
the top of the screen.
And like, if the ball

139
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.160
goes past your paddle and
you lose the life. And

140
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.380
what was the hardest part
about writing a game like

141
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.830
that? The hardest part I
think, was finding all the

142
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.640
little tiny bugs that I
made. Like that is always

143
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.980
going to be the hardest
part of programming for me

144
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.220
is the debugging. You really
have to think outside the

145
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.660
box for that. And you
said the tiny bugs is

146
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.640
it are the tiny bugs
harder to find than the

147
00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.280
big bugs? Well, I think
they were, they are because

148
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.340
like Facebook's place on gives
you an error and it

149
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.370
tells you exactly where the
bug is, but little bugs,

150
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.310
let's say like the ball
kind of floated past the

151
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.220
top of the screen, instead
of bouncing off, those would

152
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.890
be harder to find because
Python wouldn't alert you and

153
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.770
it wouldn't tell you where
it was. You'd have to

154
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.730
like search all of the
code by herself. Sometimes I

155
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.910
think that the difference between
those kinds of that, the

156
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.560
big bugs and the little
bugs is kind of like

157
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.100
when you're writing a report
and sometimes Microsoft word will

158
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.310
tell you that you misspelled
something and sometimes it won't,

159
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.480
but it's still wrong. So
like, if you spell something

160
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.550
wrong, it'll put a little
squiggly under it and then

161
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.300
you know that that's wrong,
but sometimes you just have

162
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.760
poor grammar or you've written
something wrong and that's like

163
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.560
a little bug that you
have to really hunt for

164
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.850
and think about, do you
think so? Yes, I do

165
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.140
think so. That's one of
the things actually that I

166
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.440
think learning program Is valuable
because it teaches you to

167
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.530
problem solve and to find
those harder, to find bugs

168
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.660
in order to get things
working. I think that's one

169
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.430
of the reasons that, again,
even if you're not going

170
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.680
to be a program or
learning programming is kind of

171
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.380
like learning how to learn
and learning how to think

172
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.300
or learning how to problem
solve. So I think that's

173
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.850
why it's really valuable. Really.
Do you think that that

174
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.510
changed the way that that
Carter's brain kind of was

175
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.200
wired when you started thinking
about moving from what is

176
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.520
he now fourth grade from
first grade? I'm not sure.

177
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.560
I think people who, who
are into computer programming, computers

178
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.260
and that sort of thing,
maybe they are, they tend

179
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.880
to think that way already.
They tend to be that

180
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.340
problem solving type of person
who can look at those

181
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.410
hard problems and find the
answers more easily than the

182
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.990
average person can. But I
think probably that doing a

183
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.990
lot of programming did help
in that direction as well.

184
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.060
Cause I'm interested in, in
what the learning about programming

185
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.470
does to a child's brain.
It basically, I'm trying to

186
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.770
think about nature versus nurture
cause you know that amongst

187
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.130
programmers and engineer types, there's
always the joke that you

188
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.030
can spot. You can spot
a nerd. And when I

189
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.060
was a kid being a
nerd, wasn't, wasn't cool. But

190
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.360
I suppose now in the,
in the time of Carter

191
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.250
being a nerd, it's pretty,
it was pretty cool. If

192
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.170
you know about Twitter and
you know about Facebook, that's

193
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.840
not being a nerd at
all. That's just being connected.

194
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.870
And in here you've done
a little experiment where you've

195
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.870
started with a kindergarten or
a first grader and been,

196
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.540
been writing a book for
his on programming for his

197
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.070
entire career. Do you think
that Carter would think differently

198
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.060
if you'd never written the
book? I think so, because

199
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.100
I think he, if we
hadn't written the book, he

200
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.870
wouldn't be doing as much
for Grammy. He wouldn't be

201
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.180
on the computer as much.
He wouldn't be in that,

202
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.020
that thinking problem, solving debugging
mode nearly as much. And

203
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.760
so, yeah, I think it
has affected probably the way

204
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.150
he thinks and the way
he approaches things. What do

205
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.790
you think about that card?
Or do you think that

206
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.470
your brain works differently because
you worked on this book?

207
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.690
I don't actually know, but
I do know that I

208
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.030
am pretty good at problem
solving and I'm not sure

209
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.190
if that was a result
of the book or something

210
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.550
that made me like programming
in the first place. Yeah.

211
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.310
That's an interesting question. One
of the things too with

212
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.890
us is that I think
with Carter, when he showed

213
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.720
an interest in computers, I
mean, it's very young, like

214
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.540
three or four years old,
you know, we said, go

215
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.160
ahead, go for it. We
didn't wait and say, Oh,

216
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.900
he's too young for computers.
He's too young to do

217
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.060
that. We just let them
go with it. And that

218
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.360
was one of the main
differences with Carter. Was it

219
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.050
hard to get, to get
kids interested in the text

220
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.370
aspect of things? Don't you
think that, you know, in

221
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.580
examples you use Python and
the, the idol IDE it's

222
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:45.410
not exactly thrilling stuff typing
at the command line, but

223
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.850
I mean, that's how I
learned to program. I just

224
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.580
wonder if kids these days
want to know how to

225
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.920
make a little man walk
around on the screen immediately

226
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.730
and they're not interested in
the text. Well, I was

227
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.280
worried about that too, but
actually it's funny when you

228
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.590
actually see kids going through
that and doing the first

229
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.260
programs that are all text-based
of course, because the graphics

230
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.270
takes a much higher level
of programming before you get

231
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.220
to the point where you
can make graphics on the

232
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.010
screen. Even just the very
basic set, just making the

233
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.990
computer, do something and do
what you want it to

234
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.150
do. Kids love it. And
they, even if it's a

235
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.670
simple text based program, they
really get into it and

236
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:20.610
they really enjoy it. Hmm.
Now you picked Python to

237
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.330
start out with, why did
you pick Python? Well, a

238
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.940
couple of reasons. One is
that I'd been using Python

239
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.070
network and I really enjoyed
it as a language. I

240
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.110
found it very easy to
use. I found it had

241
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.850
a nice, clear syntax, and
I kind of thought as

242
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.860
I was using it. So
it'd be a good language

243
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.010
for teaching programming again, because
you know, it has a

244
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.280
very nice, clear syntax. And
also because it's an interpreted

245
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.740
language, so you can get
immediate feedback, you can try

246
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.920
little one liners and see
what happens. That those couple

247
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.320
of attributes make Python really
good for teaching, I think.

248
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.470
And were you, at what
point did you move from

249
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:57.480
text to graphics For myself?
I very soon after I

250
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.460
started using Python, I mean,
one of the first things

251
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.380
I want to use it
for was a graphical application.

252
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.570
So I learned the very
basic Python stuff first. And

253
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.780
then I quickly moved into
a, using a Python module

254
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.880
that allowed you to do
some graphic stuff, which we

255
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.740
do actually cover in the
book as well called it's

256
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.680
called Python card. It's a
way to build some simple

257
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.940
gooeys, but I mean, you
can definitely start off with

258
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.680
it, get the basics in
the text mode and then

259
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.330
add the graphics later. The
other nice thing about Python

260
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.120
course is that it's, it's
free. And also it's available

261
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.510
for, you know, all the
platforms, Linux, Mac, and windows.

262
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.390
So all the like in
schools, you can find a

263
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.970
lot of computer labs still
use a lot of max

264
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.620
or some of them are
starting to use Linux boxes

265
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.540
now, as well as all
the windows machines that are

266
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.140
out there. So having a
language that's really truly cross

267
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.220
platform is also nice. Hey
everybody, this is Scott coming

268
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.530
at you from another place
in time. No doubt. You

269
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.050
probably bumped into testing tasks
now, and then, and your

270
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.900
work and, you know, writing
functional tests is probably not

271
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.150
your favorite thing. It's kind
of difficult. It takes time

272
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.610
and the results can be
dubious. Well, get ready to

273
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.760
start liking tests. Thanks to
Tellerik with the, the new

274
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.660
webinar testing framework. Building web
automation test is a breeze.

275
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.410
You've got code automation with
advanced asp.net, Ajax and server

276
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.960
wide applications. You can write
a single test, have it

277
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.470
executed against multiple browsers at
once. You'd benefit from a

278
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.890
rich API there's link support
integration with visual studio, unit

279
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.790
testing, also end unit X
unit and NBA unit, not

280
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.490
to mention the free rappers
for Telerik rad controls for

281
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.820
ESPN and Ajax and several
light, all shipping with Telerik's

282
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.240
new testing tool. One of
the best features, the webinar

283
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.330
testing framework, which is developed
by art of test is

284
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.500
it's absolutely free Friday, got
hooked on web testing framework,

285
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.620
start using it right away,
go to tellerik.com for more

286
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.860
info. Thanks a lot. And
when you, when you had

287
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.470
this idea, w had he
had, had Carter already expressed

288
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.690
interest in working on Oh,
for sure. Like he was

289
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.940
interested in the computer from
the time he could read

290
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.150
basically, which was about three
years old. And so, I

291
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.520
mean, the first things we
did is he, he just

292
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.260
wanted to play on the
computer, so we would just

293
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.510
start up, you know, word
and let him type things

294
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.460
and draw pictures using the
drawing tools and that sort

295
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.270
of thing. And before too
long, he decided he wanted

296
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.040
to do a little bit
more with it. And he

297
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.400
started to do a little
bit of HTML, make some

298
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.510
simple webpages most time he
was five. He really kind

299
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.000
of wants to, you know,
programming stuff. And he started

300
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.620
asking about, can we make
a game or can we

301
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.170
make a program? And that's
when we really got rolling

302
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.990
on thinking about, well, what
resources are out there to

303
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.110
help teach them programming. And
when I started looking around,

304
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.210
I didn't really find any
books that I found that

305
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.180
were suitable or really good
for teaching kids or beginners

306
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.730
programming. And that's sort of
where the idea came from

307
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.620
for writing this. Have you
done any, have you thought

308
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.110
about any web programming, most
of the programming in this

309
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.310
book was kind of graphical
user interfaces and kind of

310
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.040
the fundamentals. Have you, have
you worked up to create

311
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.370
creating web pages with Python?
We haven't, no. We don't

312
00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.010
really cover any web programming
in the book. Have you

313
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.730
done that since? Not yet.
No. Maybe that'll be the

314
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.350
next book, but we haven't
really started on that yet.

315
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.560
When you started, when you
started writing this book, did

316
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.110
you, did you already have
a publisher? I'm just kind

317
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.270
of curious about the process
because you're not a programmer

318
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.660
and this is your first
book. Yeah. So no, we

319
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.490
didn't have a publisher at
all. When we first started

320
00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.000
that we just had some
ideas. We started, you know,

321
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.620
it was just a project
that we were doing Carter

322
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.570
and I together to have
something to work on together

323
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.810
and to help Carter learn
programming. And we worked on

324
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.460
it that way for probably
about a year and a

325
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.610
half. We had, you know,
outlines for all the chapters.

326
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.530
We have a fair number
of chapters written, probably a

327
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.480
couple of hundred pages of
material was done. All our

328
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.630
example programs and everything. And
at that point we kind

329
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.920
of didn't know what we
were going to do with

330
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.690
it. Should we try and
self publish it or should

331
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.880
we try and find a
publisher for it? It wasn't

332
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.650
really clear what we would
do or just do nothing,

333
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.930
just, you know, let it
be its own little private

334
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.630
project. So at that point
I did have a, an

335
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.810
idea to start sending out
proposals for this book to

336
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.720
publishers, just to see if
there was any interest. And

337
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.360
as I was just starting
to do that, I saw

338
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.560
a message in a Python
newsgroup that said, Hey, if

339
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.410
you are a Python author
or know someone who's an

340
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.810
author of the beginners, but
for Python, let me know,

341
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.370
because I know a publisher
who is looking to do

342
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.380
a book like that. And
so I saw this message

343
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.910
and replied to it and
the person put me in

344
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.020
touch with someone at mountain
publications. And literally like before

345
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.820
I knew it, I was
signed up with a publishing

346
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.080
contract. Wow. Is it supposed
to be that easy? That

347
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.000
seems, I don't think it's
supposed to be that easy

348
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.130
from what I've heard. That's
that's the exception, not the

349
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.920
rule. It just was, you
know, sort of preparation meeting

350
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.050
opportunity. We had this thing
that was sort of half

351
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.060
finished or more than half
finished. And we had a

352
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.890
publisher who was looking to
do that kind of book.

353
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.860
And I was very fortunate
that Michael Stevens at Manning was

354
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.080
very excited about this kind
of project. It's something he'd

355
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.660
be wanting to do for
awhile. And so just the

356
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.930
timing worked out perfectly. Wow.
Now you've been working on

357
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.780
this for four years and
We started, yeah. From the

358
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.490
time we started til the
time that we signed up

359
00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.680
with Manning was about a
year and a half, maybe

360
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.500
two years. And then after
that, it was about another

361
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.420
year and a half or
so by the time the

362
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.520
book was actually released and
published. So a total of

363
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.840
three, three and a half
years from inception to hitting

364
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.690
the bookshelves. Hm. I've got
a, I've got a two

365
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.970
year old and I've got
a four year old. And

366
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.280
my, my wife and I
always joke about the time

367
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.800
when the four year old
will become like, you know,

368
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.310
really useful as the, as
opposed to the, the, I'm

369
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.370
trying to be useful part
of, you know, growing up,

370
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.710
you know, right now we'll
go shopping and he'll really,

371
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.800
really want to be useful,
but inevitably, you know, drop

372
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.060
something or clean up on
aisle two, you got to

373
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.780
experience your, your son going
from, you know, a little

374
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.950
small person to a larger,
much more useful person. Did

375
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.440
he get more and more
involved in the book? The

376
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.070
older that he got? Well,
he was pretty involved right

377
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.070
from the start. Like he
was, you know, very keen

378
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.590
and he was helping with,
you know, ideas. We worked

379
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.540
on all the ideas together,
the what should be in

380
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.490
the book, how, how should
it be written? How can

381
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.500
we make it easy for
kids to understand and make

382
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.710
it interesting? I think that
it didn't really ramp up

383
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.540
from the start. It started
at a very high level

384
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.670
and continued that way all
the way through his involvement.

385
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.080
I think quite honestly, it
never, would've got finished this

386
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.330
book. If Carter hadn't been
involved, it would just have

387
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.700
been me if I hadn't
had kids or whatever. And

388
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.740
I just got an idea
to write this book. I

389
00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.050
probably wouldn't have had the
initiative to get it finished.

390
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.920
I don't think without Carter's
excitement and interest and pushing

391
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.780
it along and saying, daddy
let's work on the book

392
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.640
instead of reading stories tonight
and things like that. I

393
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.670
don't think it would have
got finished. Wow. That's really

394
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.010
cool. Cause I, you know,
when, when I saw that,

395
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.920
that the book was written
by a father and son,

396
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.950
one, one always wonder is
how involved really was the

397
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.530
son. And like, like Carter
was listing out all the

398
00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.660
different things, different parts of
the books that he worked

399
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.140
on. It sounded like it
really was a collaborative, collaborative

400
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.260
thing. Absolutely. Like you can
definitely see Carter's, you know,

401
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.540
voice and input in the
book in many, many places,

402
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.190
Carter, as like, as you
get into the book, you

403
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.310
know, around chapter 14, 15,
16 things start getting pretty

404
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.960
complicated towards chapter 17, you've
got sprites and collision detection

405
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.320
and things like that. What
part of the book did

406
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.780
you, did you think was
the hardest, Well, I don't

407
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.800
know. It was all kind
of pretty hard writing this

408
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.530
book, like the whole book
from your first print, hello

409
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.180
world to spreads and collision
detection. It was all kind

410
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.480
of a challenge to make
it simple and easy to

411
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.590
understand and something that people
would like. So I don't

412
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.900
really think that there was
any hardest part of the

413
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.400
book from my point of
view. So the whole process

414
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.080
was hard. Was it the
book writing or the programming

415
00:20:53.080 --> 00:21:00.870
that was harder? I would
probably say the book writing

416
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.110
because when you're writing for
a computer, like, you know

417
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:08.340
exactly what the computer wants,
but we didn't really know

418
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.750
exactly what the, like people
who are going to read

419
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.750
our book wanted. So we
had to try harder to

420
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.020
make something that people would
like. And when you were,

421
00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.010
when you were writing this,
were you thinking, were you

422
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.580
thinking about kids your age
or who were you, who

423
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.250
were you thinking about when
you could envision, who was

424
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:35.250
writing the book? Well, generally
I was thinking kids, but

425
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:41.880
as, but as we like
thought more on steam, middle,

426
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.100
and the end of the
book, I just kind of

427
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.830
started thinking about it as
beginners nurse in general, not

428
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.830
just kids. So you thought
about like adults, like I

429
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.290
could, I could start with
your book and start learning

430
00:21:52.290 --> 00:22:00.120
programming. No problem. Yes. You
probably could. Hmm. Now what

431
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.140
can you tell me about
Python card Carter? Well, play

432
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.000
sound card is a more
or less simple gooey creation

433
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:14.430
module for Python. And usually
when I start a Python

434
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.330
card program, I start with
the resource editor, which is

435
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.900
a tool in Python card
that lets you just kind

436
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.750
of start with a window
and drop in buttons and

437
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:30.810
text fields and labels and
lots of other things. And

438
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.810
then I write the code
for it. So the resource

439
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.810
describes what's going on in
the form. And then the

440
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:46.920
code is somewhere else in
another file. The resource describes

441
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.890
exactly what the window looks
like and what's there and

442
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:56.010
where it is. And then
the code is in another

443
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.640
file and it's just kind
of the underlying code that

444
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.920
handles all the events. Okay.
So what's an event, An

445
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.520
event on a computer, at
least insulin. Like somebody clicks

446
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.330
the button or just something
that happens in the program.

447
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.690
It could be like somebody
moves the mouse or somebody

448
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:21.810
close to the window or,
or somebody like type something

449
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:26.100
into the text field. So
when you have say somebody

450
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.940
clicks on a button, usually
have an event handler, which

451
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.390
handles the event and does
whatever the button does. So

452
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.880
she clicked on a button
that says, submit, say on

453
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.290
the form, the event handler
would probably send the contents

454
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.440
of the form to somewhere.
You sound like you've got

455
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.380
a pretty good handle on
all this. You didn't this

456
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:51.950
difficult at all. When, when
you started getting into object

457
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.830
orientation, did, did, did you,
did you write your applications

458
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.770
differently? So we're on chapter
14, you started introducing objects.

459
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.640
Were you writing programs without
objects earlier? And then you

460
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:24.850
started using objects later. Also
when you get into the

461
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.670
later chapters where you're looking
at pie game and Python

462
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.260
card, and some of the
other modules that we use

463
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.280
for graphics and sound, they
are, they use pythons auditorium

464
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.950
to nature in the way
that they're written. So you

465
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.470
are really sort of forced
to write more object oriented

466
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.260
code because that's the way
to interface with those modules.

467
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.210
Okay. So you introduced object
orientation because of the use

468
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.020
of objects within libraries? Not
necessarily. Exactly. So if people

469
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.700
are gonna start using those
libraries and they see this

470
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.900
dot notation, I see objects
being used at, they certainly

471
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.070
need to know how that
works in the background. What's

472
00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.610
really going on. Yeah. I
was thinking about that. Like

473
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.460
how do you, how do
you introduce that concept of

474
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.250
object orientation? I remember when
I first got my taste

475
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.710
of programming, someone tried to
teach me C plus plus

476
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.940
first and not just real
basics. And they started, they

477
00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.170
said, all right, well, the
first thing you need to

478
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.960
know is about an object.
And I kind of felt

479
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.550
like a kind of a
regular procedural small application would

480
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.230
have been a better place
for me to start. Cause

481
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.740
object orientation was very difficult
as an introduction. And in

482
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.080
here you've chosen to put
that pretty far into the

483
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.130
book chapter 14, Because I
agree. I think that starting

484
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.620
with object oriented type programming,
isn't the way to go.

485
00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.680
I think starting with simpler
procedural oriented code is a

486
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.390
good way to get an
introduction to all the basic

487
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.140
things like variables and looping
and decision decisions. And so

488
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.660
on the if statements and
then once you get the

489
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.720
basic figuring out how program
flows and those basic constructs,

490
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.330
then you can introduce other
things like objects and then

491
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.170
graphics and sound. And the
other things. Have you tested

492
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.630
this on other kids that
aren't Carter? How, or how

493
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.810
are other people finding the,
finding the book, maybe teachers

494
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.530
or schools We did actually
in the review process of

495
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.080
writing the book. This is
when we, after we got

496
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.780
engaged with Manning and we
started finishing off the book,

497
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.720
there was quite a extensive
review process, which included lots

498
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.900
of kids and teachers and
other educators. So it was

499
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.240
a quite an extensive process.
And we got really good

500
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.270
feedback from kids of ages,
from Carter's age on up

501
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.090
to, there were some high
school kids, some college students,

502
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.870
teachers, and, you know, right.
The whole age range. And

503
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.980
we got good feedback from
all those people Really until

504
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.260
college students as well. And
what about adults? What about

505
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.750
fresh adults? Cause I'm thinking
about letting my wife read

506
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.670
this book. It's funny. There's
actually been several comments that

507
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.410
if you look at some
of the reviews on and

508
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.900
so on that we've gotten
in other places, there's people

509
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.880
who said, you know, I
reviewed this book and it's

510
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.620
really, it looks like it'd
be really good for beginners

511
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.740
in my, my non programmer
wife tried it. And she

512
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.690
even is interested in it.
You know, we've got comments

513
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.730
like that. And we've got
comments from people who are

514
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.980
seniors, who haven't done programming
for 30 years and they

515
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.960
want to get back into
it. And they found this

516
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.330
book has a really good
way to get restarted in

517
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.790
programming. Hmm. Well, that's, that's,
that's pretty cool. That makes

518
00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.100
me feel better. So I
shouldn't let the four kids

519
00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.190
part of the title slow
me down. No, and that's

520
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.320
actually why we put the,
that's why we add at

521
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.450
the end, other beginners in
the title as well, because

522
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.610
it isn't just for kids.
And as you noted at

523
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.340
the start, it, it doesn't
really, you know, talk down

524
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.950
to the audience. So it's
really good for all ages.

525
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.370
Do you think that programming
should be something that everyone

526
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.440
should learn in school and
at what age should they

527
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.470
all start? That's a tough
one. I think that programming

528
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.300
is a very useful thing
for all kids to learn

529
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.540
in school. But as we
were talking about before, motivation

530
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.210
is such an important factor.
So if you have kids

531
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.970
in school who aren't interested
at all in learning programming,

532
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.700
I'm not sure if forcing
them to learn programming is

533
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.010
the right thing to do.
I'm a little bit on

534
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.330
the fence on that one
while I think it would

535
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.670
be really valuable. If all
kids could learn some programming,

536
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.920
if they don't have the
motivation, it might be the

537
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.560
kind of subject where some
kids just aren't going to

538
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.600
be interested and just aren't
going to learn anything. So

539
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.640
that's a tough one, But,
but we forced them to

540
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.820
learn English and we forced
them to learn math. Why,

541
00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.180
why do we find those
subjects appropriately, forcible, but not

542
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.570
programming. Maybe it's just history
because you know, Matt's been

543
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.030
around for thousands of years
and programming hasn't been right.

544
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:19.760
Hmm. Yeah. The motivation thing
is interesting. The, the nature

545
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:26.150
versus nurture discussion is very
complex. I wonder I was

546
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.720
a professor at, at our
state university for a while

547
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.610
and there were a number
of times where I had

548
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.370
to pull people aside and
figure out how to say,

549
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.490
you know, and there's no,
you know, it's just as

550
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.560
difficult to say it now,
as it was to those

551
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.380
people that may be programming,
isn't really what you need

552
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.270
to be doing. You know?
I mean, you don't want

553
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.970
to discourage a student ever,
but at the same time,

554
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.370
some people just have a
knack for it. And it's

555
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.850
interesting when you, when you
say or threatened to say

556
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:59.300
something like that to a
person about an intellectual, an

557
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.990
an intellectual thing that they
want to accomplish, that's, that's

558
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.870
not okay. But if someone's
physically not able to do

559
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.000
something, that's, that's kind of,
okay, like I'm not a

560
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.150
very good long jumper. So
I don't think anyone would

561
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.850
be offended if a coach
came over and said, you

562
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.160
know, Scott, maybe the long
jumps, really not what you

563
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.560
need to be doing. And
I would go, you know,

564
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.710
yeah, the stats don't lie.
I'm not a long jumper.

565
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.930
And I would go on
and I'd pick another sport,

566
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.900
but to, to go to
someone and say maybe programming

567
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.780
or whatever, some intellectual pursuit
that they're interested in is

568
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.200
not their thing. Cause, cause
then you, cause for every

569
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.410
time you do that, there's
a person who, who Rose

570
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.580
up and, and accomplished something.
Great. Anyway, even though they're

571
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.480
not wired way, The other
thing too is how do

572
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.940
you know whether it's not
your thing or not until

573
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.530
you try it? How do
you know it's going to

574
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.470
be your thing or not?
So probably some exposure to

575
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.630
programming at some point. And
I would say probably the

576
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.690
middle school, age ranges is
a good thing to have.

577
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.410
Yeah. And how far into
it do you go before

578
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.510
you realize it's not your
thing? I didn't realize math.

579
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:05.220
Wasn't my thing until calculus,
right? I mean, basic math,

580
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.370
you know, everything up to,
but not including calculus. I

581
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.730
totally rock. And then my
calculus teacher pulled me aside

582
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.290
and said, you know, really,
you need to just try

583
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:14.640
to get a C in
this class. And if you

584
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.230
can pull that off, you
should be happy with that.

585
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.800
Yeah. I actually had the
same experience, but then I

586
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.680
found a really good calculus
teacher. And then I went

587
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.940
to the next level for
my engineering education. So sometimes

588
00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.100
it depends on a lot
of other factors too. The

589
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.110
teacher, you have the course
material that you have and

590
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.180
that sort of thing We
don't, that may actually bring

591
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.520
the discussion full circle because
perhaps all it is is

592
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.010
the right book or the
right teacher. And then anyone

593
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:41.010
can learn programming. Exactly. Well,
that's what we hope. Right?

594
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.400
I mean, I think that
this book is written somewhat

595
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.740
like a textbook. I mean,
it's really meant for home

596
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.200
use, but I think it
could have application in schools

597
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.630
as well. I could see
it, this book or some

598
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.450
slight derivative on this book
being used as a textbook

599
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.620
in like a middle school
computer class. Very, very cool.

600
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.550
All right. Well, the book
can be a is hello,

601
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.400
world, computer programming for kids
and other beginners. And you

602
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.900
can get it@manning.com and you
guys set up a 40%

603
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.950
off code for us. It's
a H a N S

604
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.360
E L M like Hansel
man, except handsome 40. I'll

605
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.860
put that up on the
website and that is going

606
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.140
to be good until the
end of January. If folks

607
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.360
want to buy that book
at a, at a 40%

608
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.460
discount and they can check
it out, I assume in

609
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.410
bookstores everywhere. Yeah, that's right.
Well, thanks so much Warren

610
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.980
and Carter. I really appreciate
your time. Thank you very

611
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.370
much. This has been another
episode of Hansel minutes and

612
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.600
I'll see you again next
week.
