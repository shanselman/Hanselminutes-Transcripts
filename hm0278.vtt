00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.110
web developer and technologists. Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

3
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.840
show number two 78. Recorded
live Thursday, August 4th, 2011. Support for

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:45.000
online@wwwdottelrik.com. In this episode, Scott
talks with Scott Hunter about the

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.240
direction of ASP, the recent
Azure web reorg and the

8
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.580
future of open source at
Microsoft. Hi, this is Scott

9
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.400
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes today on

10
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.520
the show, my boss, another
Scott, of course, we all

11
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.740
know that at Microsoft, your
ability to move up and

12
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.540
the company is tied directly
to whether or not your

13
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.720
name is Scott. In fact,
this is not Scott Guthrie. This

14
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.210
is Scott Hunter, one of the
1500 Scouts that work at

15
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.300
the company. How's it going,
sir? Are you going to

16
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.730
call out that we are
the lesser Scott's? Yes. This

17
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.310
is a very good point.
When we are in meetings,

18
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.330
when there are many, many
Scotts, particularly when Scott Guthrie or

19
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.560
the goo is present, some
of our friends, particularly Cura

20
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.890
Richardson has taken it to
calling Scott Hunter and Scott Hanselman,

21
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.660
the lesser Scots. So we
are collectively the lesser Scott's

22
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.660
the lesser. Yes, indeed. Thanks
for having me on the

23
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.650
show. Scott. No worries. So
let's get right to some

24
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.000
of the confusion that's going
on. So rumors are Guthrie

25
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.390
has left the building, abandoned
the web group and moved,

26
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.790
moved over to Azure and
that's a confusing and scary

27
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.880
sounding. What is really happened
and where, where are we?

28
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.740
Because I work for you
and you work for goo

29
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.080
where's where's our group and
how, how did this work

30
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.520
out? Yeah, so it, it
really is not as much

31
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.490
of a change as, as
people would expect. So when

32
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.600
Scott moved into the new
Azure application platform team, he

33
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.460
brought a bunch of sub
teams of Microsoft with him.

34
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.450
So for example, one of
those teams was the team

35
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.240
that's got Hansen and I
are on, which is formerly

36
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.760
called the web platform and
tools team that makes up

37
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.350
visual, visual web developer, parts
of visual studio, asp.net, what

38
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.040
matrix I S so that
that group moves in with

39
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.920
Scott. We also were able
to move some other groups

40
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.410
in with Scott as well,
such as the workflow team

41
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.610
and the WCF team. And
in a lot of ways,

42
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.500
I think that'll be a
benefit to all of our

43
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.460
customers because before we were
kind of in different groups,

44
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.130
meaning that, you know, a
lot of things that WCF

45
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.950
team does in some ways
look very close if you

46
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.030
squint. So what the ASP
net team does and having

47
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.780
us together in one team
is gonna allow us to

48
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.220
do a lot more collaboration
that we've done in the

49
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.940
past. And so I think
we can do some good

50
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.430
convergence on those two technologies
and make them make the

51
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.940
experience much cleaner for our
customers. I should also point

52
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.940
out that as part of
this new Azure application platform

53
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.600
team, we also brought in
the people in Microsoft that

54
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.230
work on the portal for
Azure. So if you create

55
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.250
an Azure account, this, this
team works on that experience,

56
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.880
the experience of billing, the
experience of creating a, you

57
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.810
know, Azure SQL account, any,
any kind of quarterly part

58
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.700
of, of Azure is kind
of been brought in as

59
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.680
well. And the fabric team,
which provides a bunch of

60
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.040
the services that are available
on the Azure platform for

61
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.740
customers, you know, that could
be things like caching. That

62
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.510
could be things like service
bus, and a variety of

63
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.720
other, other technologies, such as
storage and stuff like that.

64
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.390
And so all these teams
come under Scott and the

65
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.640
reason they're all under Scott
and this new in this

66
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.460
new org is because everything
that I kind of listed,

67
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.040
if you think about it
could be used if you're

68
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.190
building cloud applications. So in
some way where the cloud

69
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.600
application platform team, now I'm
trying to optimize on, on

70
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.320
developer experience for customers that
wants to host their applications

71
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.070
in the cloud. Okay, let
me, let me try to

72
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.700
do a little translation because
sometimes when we talk to

73
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.100
Microsoft people, even, even people
that are kind of down

74
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.150
to earth, like myself and
yourself, we get into a

75
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.970
kind of, you know, Microsoft
speak, marketing speak and stuff

76
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.410
like that. So I really
want to break it down

77
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.770
for the developer. Who's listening.
When he, when you say

78
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.750
he moved a couple of
groups, this is like hundreds

79
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.290
of people though, right? Yeah.
This, this, this, I think

80
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.170
the combined team has over
600 people. So It's an

81
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.180
easy thing to say, Oh
yeah, we moved a couple

82
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.090
of people or we moved
a couple of groups, but

83
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.730
really what's happening from my
perspective. And tell me if

84
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.500
I'm right. Cause I, I
mean, I get the memos

85
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.420
and I've talked to Scott,
but this is still just,

86
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.710
we're all kind of getting
our brains around this all

87
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.730
web development stuff is in
one place now, like before

88
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.790
Azure was Azure and web
platform was web platform, but

89
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.350
now any, any angle bracket
generation is in one place,

90
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.440
is that right? Yes. And
I would say even more

91
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.720
than that though, I mean,
you know, you just mentioned

92
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.020
like I S an ASP
net, any, any web development,

93
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.910
but you know, also web
development is if you create

94
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.690
a restful endpoint with WCF,
you know, that's, that's something

95
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.410
that's, that's, even though that
they consider themselves the, you

96
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.190
know, a different, what does
the VCF stand for? Windows

97
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.170
communication foundation? I think anything
like that, that, you know,

98
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.630
anything that's accessible via the
web you're right, is, is

99
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.660
part of this new, this
new org. And, you know,

100
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.530
I also can quell people's,
you know, thoughts on union

101
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.940
Scott going to be like
less involved with asp.net. I

102
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.470
was on vacation, they'll have
two days. And Scott at

103
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.600
the spur of the moment
had a fill in the

104
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.670
lawn as Phil hack and
Elon Lipton from the team

105
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.420
here, come over and present
the Scott, you know, how's

106
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.030
the next version of ABC
NBC coming along and what

107
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.660
are we working on? And
just two days before that

108
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.250
he had met with Damien
Edwards from our team, we

109
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.040
worked on some of the
web form stuff and wanted

110
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.570
to see some videos of
what we're doing with web

111
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.230
forms. So, you know, his
involvement with.net is, is to

112
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.300
me the same as it
was before. Just more, maybe

113
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.350
more focused now because it's
purely the website. So he's

114
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.910
got, he has more jaw,
he has more stuff to

115
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.680
do. He's like, his job
is bigger. The scope of

116
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.470
his job is bigger, but
it's almost like they've expanded

117
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.400
web development to include, you
know, both hosted and cloud

118
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.950
all in one, one Scott
goo organization. Yeah. Okay. And,

119
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.950
and like you said, not
just asp.net, but like I've

120
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.420
always thought before I worked
at Microsoft that our, our

121
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.180
story around what I would
call kind of web applications,

122
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.270
like real enterprise, big type
of applications, like your, you

123
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.460
know, your Dells or your
banks and stuff like that

124
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.110
almost was treated differently. Like
there's asp.net applications. And then

125
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.620
there's like big, complicated multi-tiered
stuff. And before there was

126
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.770
like this app fabric, this
windows server app fabric group

127
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.360
that had things like velocity,
which is the caching and

128
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.540
workflow and long running workflow,
and the kinds of complicated

129
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.470
applications that you see behind
the firewall, you know, inside

130
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.390
of a big company. And
that was another whole org

131
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.710
itself as well at Microsoft.
Right? And that org is

132
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.690
that that org is now
part of this new, bigger

133
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.800
business unit as well, providing
those same services in the

134
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.770
cloud. And there's, there's a
variety of things there, if

135
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.090
you will, if you want
to store files in the

136
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.400
cloud, you know, they've got
a service for that. As

137
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.200
you mentioned, they've got caching.
If you want to do

138
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.990
caching in the cloud, they
have all these mechanisms that

139
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.110
if you there's, there's a
component of that called service

140
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.810
bus, and I'm not super
familiar with it, but I

141
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.110
know that the general premise
of that is I'm one

142
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.420
of those big enterprise customers
like Dell, that you just

143
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.810
mentioned. And I've got all
my sensitive data in my

144
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.760
servers sitting behind the firewall,
but I want to run

145
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.830
a website outside the firewall.
And I wanted to send

146
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.410
my proxy, my data back
and forth in a secure

147
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.010
manner through the firewall boundaries.
And that's what the service

148
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.320
bus services. And I think
you'll find that as we

149
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.320
grow, you'll see more services,
you know, land on this

150
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.310
app fabric fabric. I could
easily see us having a

151
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.230
way to a notification service
that works across tablets, desktops,

152
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.410
phones, for example, variety of
things we could offer in

153
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:36.190
the cloud. So asp.net, I
guess, Azure app fabric. And

154
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.880
then you also said briefly
windows communication foundation. And we

155
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.500
know that Glen block has
been doing a lot of

156
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.560
work with that group, trying
to get a rest services

157
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.320
kind of thing, working. So
that's kind of all asp.net

158
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.160
and WCF almost are kind
of merging, you know, in

159
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.350
an organizational sense. At least
They're not merging, they're a

160
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.960
lot closer than they were
before that before, before both

161
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.880
of those teams are in
totally different business units and

162
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.760
they kind of had their
own agendas. And the benefit,

163
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.950
the benefit to me of
having everybody in the same

164
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.440
business unit is now we'll
have a shared agenda examples

165
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.260
of how we can help
our customers. There is today,

166
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.820
if you want to use,
you know, Glenn blocks is

167
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.980
a great example. You know,
he's working on something called

168
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.830
web API right now, but
whether it be, I kind

169
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.450
of stands on its own.
What if I'm building an

170
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.740
MVC application? Do I do
my wrestle services and NBC,

171
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.490
or do I do web
API and having our two

172
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.200
teams a lot closer together
is going to let us

173
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.440
rationalize that and hopefully provide
the customer with a smoother

174
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.870
experience as well, where they're
not going, when do I

175
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.140
do a versus when do
I do B you know,

176
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.360
what, if we had a
similar, similar way of writing

177
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.700
restful services across both Deb
CF and asp.net, well, then

178
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.850
we help everybody. If you're
an NBC guy, you right

179
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.910
in the same pattern that
the web API guys going

180
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.330
and vice versa. So those
are areas where we plan

181
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.370
to collaborate on the future.
And hopefully, you know, as

182
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.910
I said, bring the products
closer together. And like in

183
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.820
the past, that's kind of
a good example of how

184
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.670
Microsoft being so big has
been difficult. I mean, I

185
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.280
remember a year ago, or
even longer than a year

186
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:16.070
ago, talking to people over
in the WCF team saying,

187
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.600
gosh, I wish that this
stuff fit better into the

188
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.000
asp.net world. And, you know,
there's two different ways to

189
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.850
make, you know, two different
ways to make rest services,

190
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.460
three different ways to make
rest services. And then I

191
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.250
felt the same thing about
app fabric that, you know,

192
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.610
this is interesting, but now
there's half a dozen different

193
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.140
ways to make session state.
Scott likes his things tidy.

194
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.270
I mean, you see almost
kind of like de fragmenting

195
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.620
the entire story and making
it tidy. I think in

196
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.210
the long run, that's what
we're going to see is,

197
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.800
you know, I can already
tell you, he's been asking

198
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.540
us, Hey, how, how can
we make web API and

199
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.270
ASP net not look so
different? How can we make

200
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.190
them closer? How can we
make, you know, as you

201
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.320
said, one of Scott's big
focuses is, you know, not,

202
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.020
not telling the customer, Hey,
here's 12 ways to shoot

203
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.330
yourself in the foot. Let's
give them one prescribed way

204
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.320
of doing things. You start,
you started seeing us going

205
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.110
in that path in dot
four and, and with NBC

206
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.530
three, where yeah, there's, you
know, Microsoft got a ton

207
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.210
of data stories and we've
got, you know, linked to

208
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.210
sequel. And if the framework
idea of that net, but,

209
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.460
you know, by default in
the box with NBC three,

210
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.530
we, we put one in
which was the new framework

211
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.280
code first. Hopefully that means
if you're a new customer

212
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.530
on our platform, you don't
play the guessing game of

213
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.680
which, which do I use
and why. And I think

214
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.470
you'll continue to see that
process go through other things

215
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.510
like weather API, for example,
you know, the one we

216
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.410
were just talking about solve
that same rationalization, where while

217
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.240
there's two ways to do
it, which way should I

218
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.710
do it and why would
I do it that way?

219
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.930
And when would I do
it that way? You know,

220
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.060
that's that's feedback. I think,
you know, you've probably heard

221
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.090
from our customers as well,
Scott, that, you know, Microsoft

222
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.110
doesn't tell us what we
should be using and there's

223
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.710
lots of choices. So speaking
of the choices though, there's,

224
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.110
there's two competing things and
I've talked to you about

225
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.820
this, cause I'm kind of
one of the primary guys

226
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.470
that goes out in the
community and talks to people

227
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.940
and brings back feedback. But
there is a, there's a

228
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.160
group in the community that
wants prescriptions. They want to

229
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.690
say, just tell me the
right way to do this.

230
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.810
Tell me the way that'll
be supported that won't, you

231
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.520
know, shoot me in the
foot that my company won't

232
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.640
regret in some number of
years. And then there's the

233
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.580
other group that says, it's
great that you're prescribing this,

234
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.130
but I really would rather
have the ability to use

235
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.300
this injection framework or that
test framework. So there are

236
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.190
people who want to buy
their Legos and follow the

237
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.380
kit. And then there are
the people who want to,

238
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.740
you know, bring in Legos
from outside. And I know

239
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.110
I've been pushing this Lego
thing hard, pretty hard lately.

240
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.440
Yeah. We definitely want to
support both of those. I

241
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.650
mean, a great example of
that to me was, you

242
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.440
know, Steve Sanderson from our
team, if anybody knows him,

243
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.220
he, he worked on the
scaffolding support that we added

244
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.850
in NBC three. And, and
even though we added that

245
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.080
scaffolding support and it was
only MVC scaffolding support, there's

246
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.600
nothing preventing you from using
that same scaffolding work on,

247
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.990
on web form, for example.
And so while we offer

248
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.730
something with a prescriptive model,
we do have all the

249
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.010
hooks, hopefully that you can
plug whatever you want in

250
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.400
NBC three is I think
a great example, again, is,

251
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.870
you know, if you want
to, if you want to

252
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.910
plug the scaffolding with some
other scaffolding, so we have

253
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.250
scaffolding built in the box.
So if you are building

254
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.490
an MVC application and have
a data model, we can

255
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.830
easily have it build some
pages for you that give

256
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.410
you a generic experience against
your data model, which you

257
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.290
could then go and customize.
And by default, that uses

258
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.720
what we ship in the
box, but all the hooks

259
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.000
are already there that if
you want, you can go

260
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.620
download Steve Sanderson's standalone package
on new Getz and plug

261
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.200
it in, basically replacing the
one that we actually have

262
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.250
in the box with one,
with his implementation, you know,

263
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.600
on top of that in
the future, you'll be able

264
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.030
to actually plug in, for
example, a web form scaffolding.

265
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.830
And so, yeah, while we're,
while we are prescriptive, you

266
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.050
know, we're all about choice
as well, but we know

267
00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.700
that as you said, those
are two different customers. If

268
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.000
you're a brand new customer,
you probably want prescriptive. If

269
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.020
you're a hardcore developer, that's
been using the platform for

270
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.030
five, 10 years, you know,
you probably want to roll

271
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.490
your own or use whatever
things you're comfortable with. And

272
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.410
we want to support both
of those models that filament

273
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.290
Stack overflow dev days, the
universe is best conference series

274
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.190
by coders for coders is
back this fall bigger and

275
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.040
better than ever. I've personally
been involved in selecting the

276
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.990
speakers for the San Francisco
show. It's going to be

277
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.680
fantastic. Now stack overflow dev
days, is it fast paced

278
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.560
two day conference? You're going
to learn the latest new

279
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.270
technologies you might not be
using. DVCS no JS F

280
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.970
sharp am I learning? We
mean that the speakers are

281
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.330
actually coding, not just rambling
on about ROI and doing

282
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.690
PowerPoint slides. After two days
at stack overflow dev days,

283
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.030
you will leave with solid
knowledge about the ins and

284
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.320
of these technologies. You're going
to see awesome speakers like

285
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.840
John skeet, Mark Ravel, Roy
<inaudible>, Rob Connery, Paul Iris,

286
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.590
Scott Yukon. And of course
Joel Spolsky and even members

287
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.200
of the stack exchange dev
team will be speaking at

288
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.420
these events. They're going to
give you the inside scoop

289
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.720
on all the awesome that
makes up stack overflow. To

290
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.810
top it off. You'll enjoy
lots of networking opportunities with

291
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.730
your fellow programmers, and you'll
really get to put a

292
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:20.690
human face to that Gravatar
experience at all. At stack

293
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.530
overflow dev days, it's a
ridiculously inexpensive price. And as

294
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.550
a Hansel minutes listener, you
get 25% off using the

295
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.090
discount code, Hansel minutes on
the registration page, check it

296
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:38.990
out now@devdaysdotstackoverflow.com. How many times
do we get pushback on

297
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.420
stuff like that? Like, I
think it's obvious and we

298
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.070
always push that. And I
think that that's, that's spread

299
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.310
out to all of asp.net
and I S and hopefully

300
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.040
we'll spread that kind of
attitude to all the other

301
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.890
org underneath Scott. You know,
I mean, Scott helps set

302
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.990
the tone. I help set
the tone, you and fail.

303
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.040
We all, we all are
very likeminded, but we aren't

304
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.740
all of Microsoft though. You
know, how much, how many

305
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.860
times are we going to
get pushback? You know, we've

306
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.170
gotten pushback before. There's an
area of pushback on that.

307
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.350
I'm going to bring up
there. There's a classic example

308
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.720
of pushback, but there is,
there is that, that pushback,

309
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.030
but I think what's kind
of going on is, you

310
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.480
know, why, why our teams
started making these changes kind

311
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.880
of goes back to about
two years ago when we

312
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.690
were comparing asp.net against some
of our competition, which includes

313
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.920
things like PHP, Ruby on
rails. We're looking, you know,

314
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.170
we're looking at how does
our platform can compare to

315
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.200
these things. And one of
the things that is interesting

316
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.260
is, you know, if you
use Ruby by default, there's

317
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.090
a data story built in.
If you use a PHP,

318
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.890
there's a bunch of examples
that are built in now,

319
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.710
they, their PHP is a
little bit closer to us

320
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.600
because there is, there's some
overlap there as well. But

321
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.790
one of the common themes
when we started looking at,

322
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.640
at our platform versus some
of our competitor platforms was,

323
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.360
you know, our tools, it
kind of got complicated and,

324
00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.980
you know, our frameworks has
started to get kind of

325
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.610
complicated. And we went through
a whole process of process

326
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.350
of building something which was
called it was code named

327
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:10.000
plan nine for a while,
and eventually shipped earlier this

328
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.440
year as webpages with razor
syntax, that same razor syntax

329
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.920
is available for NBC as
well. And part of that

330
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.860
whole process of building that
new product that was trying

331
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.880
to compete better against some
of our competition was trying

332
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.510
to teach the whole team
that we'd gotten complicated. And

333
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.430
we had too many, we
were giving developers so many

334
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:34.780
choices that the developer was
confused. And so over the

335
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.270
last year, year and a
half, we kind of trained

336
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.530
our whole team that let's
look for ways to make

337
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.510
a developer productive. Let's look
at adding features that are

338
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.920
features. They're not demos. You
know, a lot of, you

339
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.700
know, I'm sure we've been
accused of building features that

340
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.620
are only good for demos,
but when you start trying

341
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.120
to use them in the
real world, they fall apart.

342
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.640
So, you know, try to
stay away from building demo

343
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.320
features and building real world
real world features, focusing on

344
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.050
simplicity, make them very easy
to use. You know, I,

345
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.420
I think you coined the
term around this, Scott, what

346
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:15.420
developer happiness. I think that's
that, that, that theme is

347
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.480
been emanating from us. And
I know it's been spread

348
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.000
to other teams as well,
including the WTF team, you

349
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.820
know, knowing that we got
to make our stuff easier

350
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.890
for people to use and
pick up. And, and I

351
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.100
think that is that washes
through the company will help

352
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:35.310
this, you know, having this
prescriptive solution versus, Hey, here's

353
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.600
35 ways to shoot yourself
in the foot. What about

354
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.270
us building stuff that already
exists? I know that that's

355
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.760
like a big point of
contention with the community. The

356
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.460
idea that, and I realize,
I personally don't think it's

357
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.190
necessarily reasonable to say like,
Oh, we're going to build

358
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.860
a logger. Why don't you
just use log for net?

359
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.580
I mean, there's, there's lots
of issues around who owns

360
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.370
it. How, how, how the,
is there support with it?

361
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.620
Does it do this? Does
it do that? But for

362
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.050
the most part, every time
we build something new, that's

363
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.100
a Lego piece. Somebody says,
why didn't you use food.net

364
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:11.060
cause food.net does that already?
The biggest example is entity

365
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.700
framework and in hibernate, but
smaller examples come up as

366
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.970
well. When do we, when
do we want to use

367
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.370
community stuff and not build
something like, and how would

368
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.760
we always say, throw your
support behind, you know, what

369
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.000
do you, what do you
think that means? And how

370
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.860
do we do that? And
will we do that? I

371
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.790
think you see us doing
that more and more, you

372
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.460
know, over time. I mean,
obviously the best example of

373
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.010
this is, you know, five
years ago we wrote something

374
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:38.120
called the Microsoft Ajax library.
And it was basically a,

375
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.310
you know, a bunch of,
bunch of the teams sitting

376
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.930
in a room going, Hey,
what, what kind of tools

377
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:47.240
would a JavaScript developer wants?
And pretty much anything that

378
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.850
was thrown into into, into
that, into that library, you

379
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:55.430
know, existed in another, another
library called jQuery. And you

380
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.620
know, now we're shipping jQuery
in the box and we're

381
00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:02.510
slowly cutting the ties to
Microsoft Ajax. Each release of,

382
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.150
of one of our products
probably has less Microsoft Ajax

383
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.420
in it and more jQuery
in it. And maybe at

384
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.250
some point in the future,
we'll be all jQuery and

385
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:15.560
no, no Microsoft Ajax. I
think what you're talking about

386
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.330
is something that is happening
in the company as well.

387
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.790
You know, you've seen it
with our products, we ship

388
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.950
modernizer, we shipped jQuery, UI
shipped jQuery. There's a good

389
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.450
chance in the future that
we're going to be shipping

390
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.020
jQuery mobile. You know, for
the most part, we try

391
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.690
to find things, you know,
now let's say our, our

392
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.630
first first choice is to
go look and see, is

393
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.120
there something out there that
actually meets the needs and

394
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.760
solves the scenarios a hundred
percent if there is, I

395
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.530
think there's a good chance.
We'll, we'll try to use

396
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.140
it. We've been much more
successful. You know, all those

397
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.700
libraries I just told you,
we've been, we've been pretty

398
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.510
successful shipping those things in
the box, even with visual

399
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.980
studio. So I think the
it's getting easier for us

400
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.810
to do that. And the
other thing is, you know,

401
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.140
everybody out there in the,
in the world probably thinks

402
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.870
all of Microsoft's got, you
know, thousands of people and,

403
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.300
you know, the ESPN team
has probably some huge team

404
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.380
building these, these web strategies.
And the reality is over

405
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.450
the whole last 10 years
that we've been doing asp.net.

406
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.700
It's not a very big
team. I mean, most people

407
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.200
would be shocked to find
out that we only have

408
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.530
about 10 or 11 devs.
We've got four or five

409
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:23.020
PMs and a handful of,
of 10 or 12 testers

410
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.300
that make up the core
ESPN that team. So if

411
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.620
you add all that together,
you know, it's going to

412
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.780
be 30 or 40 50
people, something like that, but

413
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.210
it's not going to be
the hundreds or thousands or,

414
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.480
or what people would expect.
And so, you know, I

415
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.130
love, I love trying to
embrace some of the stuff

416
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.430
that's out there from the
standpoint that why would I

417
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.820
spend time with my limited
resources rebuilding what's already there.

418
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.530
So if we find some
good stuff out there, especially

419
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.720
if our customers tell us
about it, I think that

420
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.340
that would be the most
important thing. It'd be fun

421
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.610
for you to run some
kind of a thing on

422
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.840
your blog or Twitter and
ask people what libraries that

423
00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.240
are out there that people
think are common enough across

424
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.800
all web development, that we
should include them in the

425
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.270
box. You know, at the
same time, I was kind

426
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.520
of a tangent on what
you said, we're also doing

427
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.650
something else. Historically, when we
add new features to asp.net,

428
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.720
or we add new feature
features to.net, we do that

429
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.080
in the, in the core
platform, the core.net framework, that

430
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.230
core.net framework only ships every,
you know, two to three

431
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.720
years, or at least it's
been historically doing that. I

432
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.980
don't know if that's going
to change in the future,

433
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.020
but for the past couple
of years, every two or

434
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.970
three years, we ship a
new version of the.net framework.

435
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.930
That's a, that's a long
time for us to have

436
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.400
to sit on a new,
a new feature before we

437
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.650
can actually give it to
our customers. And so with

438
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:43.330
the introduction of new gate
earlier this year, that's kind

439
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.740
of a new way for
us to add features. And

440
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.840
so far I can already
say for the next version

441
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.750
of the, of the.net framework,
about a month or two

442
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:54.790
ago, we had some, some
really cool features. One of

443
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:59.470
these is having a asp.net
providers that support at the

444
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:07.060
Azure environment, Azure sequel, SQL
compact databases. And our plan

445
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.130
was to actually ship those
in the, in the box

446
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.400
as part of.net. We also
have some work that we've

447
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.190
demoed a few times this
year called web optimization, where

448
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:20.530
we can do some combining
of JS and CSS files,

449
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.560
some compression and stuff like
that on those files. And

450
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.420
originally we were going to
put those features into the

451
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:31.300
next version of the.net framework,
but right before one of

452
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.130
the milestones, we're like, why
are we putting these things

453
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.690
in the framework? That means
we can only rev them

454
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.390
every three years. And so
what you're going to see

455
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.580
us do is we'll probably
start building more features and

456
00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.370
as new get packages. And
then what we'll do is

457
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.590
we'll change the templates and
ASP nets. So when you

458
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.930
say file new project, we'll
just, pre-install some of these

459
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.290
new gets into your, into
your application. The benefit for

460
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.780
the customer is we're no
longer tied to that three

461
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.160
year cycle. You would get
upgradability, but using the package

462
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.090
manager. So we think it's
a much better experience that

463
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.460
same mechanism, I think also
will allow us to include

464
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:09.920
more third party stuff with,
with new releases and not

465
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.110
requiring us once again, to
wait for framework releases and

466
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.300
all that kind of stuff
we could maybe next April,

467
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.480
we could just say, Hey,
here's the ASP net 2012

468
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.790
release. And all that really
is, is a bunch of

469
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.610
new project templates that get
injected in individual studio. And

470
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.640
those new project templates just
installed a bunch of pre

471
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:29.000
pre-installed new gets into your
project. So I think, I

472
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.370
think we're going to work
on, on, you know, trying

473
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.650
to not duplicate work that's
out there in the community.

474
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.910
And I think we're going
to try to not add

475
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.560
features to the core framework
as much as we had

476
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.200
in the past. I mean,
obviously some things, you know,

477
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.910
infrastructure, like if you want
to support some of the

478
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.670
new async stuff that we've
been demoing for the last

479
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.830
year or so, that has
to be in the core

480
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.520
framework, but we're now asking
ourselves the question, does it

481
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.810
have to be in the
core framework? And if it

482
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:57.320
doesn't and we use new
GATS, new gate is also

483
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.120
the same mechanism that we're
shipping some of these third

484
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.420
party libraries as part of
projects as well. And I

485
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.220
think to see us continue
to, to continue to do

486
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.970
that. So we'll both grab
new libraries from the community

487
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.940
and add features via new
get. And as I said,

488
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.350
I think it'd be a
great exercise for you to

489
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.570
sit there and say, Hey,
is there some library out

490
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.240
there that most of our
customers think we should have

491
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.170
in the, in the product?
Okay. Maybe a use of

492
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.980
user voice to do the
voting on that. Yeah. Just

493
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.110
to see what, you know,
the only thing that we,

494
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.910
we tend to try to
do is when we, when

495
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.470
we do make a choice
like that, we want something

496
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.000
that's gonna have brought adoption,
right? So we, we want,

497
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.080
something's gonna affect a lot
of our customers. If we

498
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.700
think it's only gonna affect
five or 10% of our

499
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.200
customers, then go and sell
the new gateway. So, so

500
00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.790
in, in doing stuff like
that, I wouldn't, I spoke

501
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:46.750
at, at a conference yesterday
that was at Intel and

502
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.720
showed a bunch of stuff
in new get, and one

503
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.450
of the big concerns that
people said, and I think

504
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.370
it might be because I
was at a large corporation

505
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.360
or that, well, you know,
my company XYZ doesn't want

506
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.000
anyone to, to do open
source, or we only have

507
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.670
these licenses or these things,
you know, how do we,

508
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.940
as we move towards open
source, get other companies that

509
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.660
aren't even considering open source
projects to, to think about

510
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.880
open source. Well, I think
one of the things is,

511
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.150
is via shipping the things
in the box. We're solving

512
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.540
some of those problems for
people, because if we're shipping

513
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.730
it in the box, that
means we're typically are shipping

514
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.760
it with a license that
is probably amenable to the

515
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.890
customer. A lot of, a
lot of corporations are afraid

516
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.540
of open source because let's
say company a has a

517
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:37.690
patent and they started shipping
an open source library that

518
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.640
is very similar to the
technology. They have patented by

519
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.350
them, that technology, that opensource
library, they actually basically potentially

520
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.140
lose the rights to their
patent. And so that's one

521
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.440
of the areas that you
see companies being afraid to

522
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.150
use some open source that,
Hey, we might, we might

523
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.880
lose some of our own
intellectual property, the rights to

524
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.090
some of our own intellectual
properties by embracing this. So,

525
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.210
you know, one thing we
do is we, we typically

526
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.390
relicense some of these open
source libraries that we ship

527
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.030
with a lot with, with
a license that protects us.

528
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.760
So that's, that's one thing.
Another thing is, you know,

529
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.060
any, any library that we
ship as part of visual

530
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.700
studio or a part of
an NBC release or an

531
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.420
asp.net release is also backed
by our support staff. So,

532
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.760
you know, if, if, if
one of our customers wants

533
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.620
to has a problem with
jQuery and wants to pick

534
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.560
up the phone and call
our support service and ask,

535
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.950
you know, about a problem
with jQuery, we'll help them

536
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.300
with jQuery. So I think
anything that we're shipping, cause

537
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.700
it's part of our umbrella,
you're getting the Microsoft support

538
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.490
policy to go with it.
And I think those are,

539
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.140
those are two things that,
that definitely help some of

540
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.130
those, you know, other companies
out there We've had, we've

541
00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.400
had groups inside Microsoft that
have said, I don't want

542
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.070
to use this product because
we don't think jQuery is

543
00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:03.890
allowed, even though it is
That's. That's correct. So we've,

544
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.450
I was going to say
that the next thing I

545
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.220
was, was going to lead
to is we know we've

546
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.140
had many teams inside of
Microsoft come to us and

547
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.760
say, Hey, we want to
use jQuery. Or we want

548
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.850
to use jQuery UI. And
you know, and we're told

549
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.500
we're not allowed to do
that. And that's, that's, that's

550
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.860
slowly changing as well. If
you are a Microsoft employee

551
00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.270
inside of Microsoft, our legal
site now has a whole

552
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:31.700
section on shipping OSS software
with, With your software, With

553
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.090
a bunch of guidelines and
stuff on how to what

554
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.000
the processes are. You know,
before, when, when I joined

555
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.080
Microsoft, you know, four or
five years ago, there was

556
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.880
no process. Basically you had
to go talk to a

557
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:48.020
lawyer, you know, at the
office and, and convince them

558
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.690
that it would be safe
for us to ship. You

559
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.140
know, one of those libraries
now, because it's becoming more

560
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:57.560
and more prevalent, all that
guidance and stuff is already

561
00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.200
on the, on the internal
website here, employee can go

562
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.810
there, read the rules on
what they have to do

563
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.080
to ship something, you know,
and as I said, the

564
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.080
main thing that, that Microsoft
worried about is just making

565
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.060
sure it doesn't lose any
of its rights to its

566
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.490
own intellectual property. It's as,
as part of your using

567
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.350
one of those libraries. And
as long as we can

568
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.380
resolve that, then you know,
you're free to use them.

569
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.560
So how long do you
think it will take for

570
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:27.620
Scott to defragment the whole
thing I don't have. I

571
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.410
think, I think it will
happen pretty fast. I, I

572
00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.720
think that under the same
roof, as everybody else in

573
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.720
this, in this new Azure
application platform team, you know,

574
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.190
I'm going to get, you'll
see lots of changes over

575
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.400
the next. This might sound
like a long timeframe, but

576
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.810
I think over the next,
the reality is even though

577
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.530
we, we moved under that
new name a month or

578
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:53.170
two ago, just right now,
are we actually figuring out

579
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.870
what that means, what that
means? And so, you know,

580
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.030
it's going to take us
a little bit of time

581
00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.890
just to, just to work
through that. But I think,

582
00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.960
you know, maybe by this
time, next year, we'll, we'll

583
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.550
resolve a lot of that.
Yeah. It definitely seems like,

584
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.620
I mean, I've heard Scott
give, he's starting to give,

585
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.250
he's sending out vision documents
and vision PowerPoints and talking

586
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.670
to people and you know,
people know Scott, right. And

587
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.980
they trust him because he's,
he's got some common sense

588
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.900
and he very much seems
to have an attitude of

589
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.780
like, Hey, here's how this
should work. Here's how this

590
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.210
should work. He sits down
and explains it. And you

591
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.700
know, as with almost all
of these kinds of organizational

592
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.140
things, it really is organizational
stuff. That's kind of holding,

593
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.030
holding us back. You know,
if it could be said

594
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.120
that anything is holding us
back in my, in my

595
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.210
experience and what I know
about our groups, it's almost

596
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:44.400
never talent. It's almost always
communication and organizational stuff tidying

597
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.190
up the organization can make
it just easier. Whether it

598
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.040
be where people sit in
the, in the, in the

599
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.020
building literally, or what meetings
they're in or what, what,

600
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.340
what goal and what target
that they're aiming at. And

601
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.590
that's something that's, you know,
not to kiss Scott's butter

602
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.030
or anything, but that's something
that he's really good at

603
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.480
good at doing. Yeah, I
agree. As you said, I

604
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.780
think hopefully as part of
these, these reorg reorganizations, that

605
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.630
we'll take all the, you
know, those teams and make

606
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.580
them very close to each
other. You know, for example,

607
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.130
right now the WTF team,
for example, used to be

608
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.130
in a different organization than
us, meaning that they had

609
00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:21.090
the organization had their goals.
The organization we were in

610
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.330
dev had its goals, and
those goals always did not

611
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.900
align 100%. And you know,
now being under the same

612
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.420
organization, you know, we will
make all those, those things,

613
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.300
you know, align the same
way. And you know, we'll

614
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.480
also move all those teams
closer together. I mean, right

615
00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.120
now, you know, the WCF
team is in building 18,

616
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.780
we're in building 42 for
people that have never seen

617
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.080
our campus. You can't really
just tell by the numbers

618
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.060
how far somebody away is.
But the reality is they're,

619
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.960
they're a good six, seven
blocks away, which means, you

620
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.340
know, the only time you
see those people is if

621
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.400
you get to something where
you're actually in their building

622
00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.900
or vice versa, I think
we'll all be hopefully in

623
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.150
the same building and they'll
just be walking in the

624
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.420
hall. So that's why I
think it's a great move

625
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.940
by Scott to put all
these different technologies that are

626
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.990
web facing, you know. Cool.
Well, thanks for chatting with

627
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.720
me today, boss. This has
been another episode of Hansel

628
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.550
minutes and I'll see you
again next week.
