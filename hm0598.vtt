Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.910
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

9
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.140
talking with Rachel neighbors. How
are you? I'm doing great.

10
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.780
How about you, Scott? I
am lovely. And I'm happy

11
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.880
to talk to you. The
last time we did a

12
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.480
podcast was about three years
ago. Oh my gosh. Yeah,

13
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.110
you were doing a CSS
consulting and you were speaking

14
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.600
all over the world and
the web was a different

15
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.860
web. I think it was
a little bit of a

16
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.150
different web three, four, three
or four years ago. And

17
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.240
I'm looking@yourblogunderrachelnabors.com slash about at
all your interviews and your

18
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.460
workshops and your conference schedule.
You're doing a lot of

19
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.390
really fun stuff. I sure
am. Although now I am

20
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.380
stepping back into more of
a making things roll again,

21
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.290
which pleases me greatly. Yeah,
absolutely. I think we all

22
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.360
feel better when we're making
stuff. And then we kind

23
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.340
of go back and forth
between making stuff and talking

24
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.890
about stuff and making stuff
and talking about stuff. It's

25
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.930
true. You have to have
something to talk about otherwise.

26
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.350
What are you doing up
there? And back in the

27
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.510
day three, it was three
years ago. We talked, but

28
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.430
you've been doing a web
for many, many, many years.

29
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.460
You had a thought about
a book and then this

30
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.250
book is now out here
in 2017. And you wrote

31
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.640
this article about it on
your site animation at work,

32
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.790
and you call the article,
the web animation book. I

33
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.660
wish I'd had five years
ago. It's yours. You've written

34
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.660
a book. Congratulations. Thank you
so much, Scott. It's been

35
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.030
a lifelong dream of mine
to write a book, especially

36
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.380
with my favorite publisher, a
book apart it's like, these

37
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.840
are the books that I
grew up on. So it,

38
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.230
it just thrills me utterly
to finally have published with

39
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.590
the B publisher whose books
helped me through my very

40
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.130
first foray into front end
development. Yeah, that's fantastic. If

41
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.490
you go to animation at
work, you'll get linked eventually

42
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.420
over to a book apart.com.
There's all kinds of great

43
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.870
books there. They call the
website brief books for people

44
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.840
who make websites and your
book is there. And of

45
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.970
course you've also been so
kind as to make a

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.890

55
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.530
And the course, particularly on
CSS, animation has a lot

56
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.140
of stuff going on. It's,
you know, lots and lots

57
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.250
of videos and practical understanding
about how CSS animation sequencings

58
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.130
performance, all those things fit
together into an effective animation.

59
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.790
I like to say that
it's the perfect partner to

60
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.040
the book. The book is
all about the theory and

61
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.490
the how well not the,
how the book is all

62
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.320
about the theory, how the
human brain processes animations, Oh,

63
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.280
visual input period. And when
it's appropriate to use them

64
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.610
in your web and web
app designs, or actually I

65
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.070
know some people who've been
putting these lessons to work

66
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.980
in their app development and
even their slide deck development.

67
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.050
So it turns out what
I wrote was actually a

68
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.390
lot more useful than I
anticipated. There's even great stuff

69
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.850
in here about how to
normalize animations across the systems

70
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.110
so that you can incorporate
them into your style guides

71
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.690
and design systems. One of
the things that I was

72
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.850
impressed about, and I know
that this is a thing

73
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.710
that a book apart cares
about and that you care

74
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.440
about is that the book
is very affordable. It's an

75
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.170
$8 ebook, but it's still
got a lot of detail.

76
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.810
Was it hard to decide
to do it? Any book

77
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.510
that was that inexpensive, as
opposed to like a $50

78
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.590
giant, like the web animation
Bible smack. So glad you

79
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.140
asked me that, because originally
when I was like, I'm

80
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.690
going to write a book,
it is about everything I

81
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.160
have ever known about animation
and extra research included. And

82
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.860
that was the book that
I pitched. I pitched to

83
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.810
pick apart. He was like,
I want to write the

84
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.420
tome. And they came back
in. They're like, not for

85
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.690
us, sorry, but if you'd
like to know why we're

86
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.230
happy to talk with you.
And of course I was

87
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.040
all heartbroken and know my
submission, it was rejected. Why

88
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.340
would they do that? But
anytime people give you a

89
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.630
negative reaction or the reaction
you don't want, that is

90
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.660
an opportunity to learn something.
So they were offering to

91
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.420
talk to me, you know,
spend their time on me

92
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.300
for free to tell me
something about why they'd made

93
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.220
a decision. And I was
like, I got to get

94
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.440
in on that. So I
was like, tell me, I

95
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.830
want to hear what it
was about this, that, that

96
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.320
wasn't floating your boat. They
might help me make this

97
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.500
an even better submission package
for another publisher or might

98
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.600
help me write it and
self publish it even better.

99
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.790
So I reached out to
them and we had a

100
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.790
long conversation. It turns out
all of their issues with

101
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.820
the book were actually my
issues too, because by the

102
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.730
time I had finished writing
the submission package, I was

103
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.160
like, maybe I don't want
to write the big book

104
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.470
of animation because there's still
so much undiscovered out there.

105
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.590
There's so much research that
needs to be done. There's

106
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.470
still many people who are
going to accomplish great things.

107
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.630
And you're going to have
great things to say, who

108
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.130
am I to come in
and be like, I have

109
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.310
all the answers, right, right
now that would be a

110
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.910
little premature. In fact, I've
even seen some folks who

111
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.010
end up in an industry
being set up as an

112
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.400
expert. They make big claims
early. And then later on,

113
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.520
we learned better, but their
claims are still held up

114
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.270
because they were put out
there first. So misinformation can

115
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.900
have a lasting lasting effect
in the community. And I

116
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.910
really didn't want to add
to that. I wanted to

117
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.400
make sure that I was
actually covering what we know

118
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.310
now, what I'd learned from
working in this field for

119
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.800
five years and set the
stage for us to move

120
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.960
on to two other greater
things down the line. One

121
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.340
of the other things that
I like about the book

122
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.770
is that it's not necessarily
just a list of CSS,

123
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.900
properties and stuff. Although it
does talk to you about

124
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.590
like the anime and the
anatomy, rather the web animation,

125
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.540
you talk about easing and
duration and things like that.

126
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.810
But you talk about like
why we do animation in

127
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.060
the first place and like,
why does the brain work

128
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.610
the way it works? And
you talk about something interesting

129
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.780
that I had never heard
of change blindness. Oh yeah.

130
00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.130
So when you change, blindness
often happens to those of

131
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.470
us who work at computers
because we are staring at

132
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.680
this one focal point for
so long that things can

133
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.990
be happening left or right.
And we might not actually

134
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.930
notice that they're occurring. You
know, if you've ever had

135
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.450
your, your spouse or someone
have to wave their hand

136
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.150
in front of your face
while you've been working, probably

137
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.520
because you didn't notice them
out of the corner of

138
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.750
your eye, people can become
changed blind. They don't notice

139
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.870
when something is moving or
changing in their peripheral vision.

140
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.960
So you have to, you
have to catch their attention

141
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.640
often by increasing something's animacy
or how alive it appears.

142
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.670
So if someone's staring at
a, at a screen and

143
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.920
you want them to look
in a bucket or at

144
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.410
an icon or something, you
might shake that icon or

145
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.170
cause it to expand and
contract kind of pop them

146
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.900
out of that, that, that
tunnel vision and attract their

147
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.750
attention over to something else.
We've seen this a lot

148
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.510
with those horrible shaky ads
from back in the nineties,

149
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.330
We'll get as much of
the nineties as possible, including

150
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.580
most of the animations that
were written in flash in

151
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.200
the nineties. So I'm going
to have to, I'm going

152
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.050
to have to apologize for
that one. It's okay. I

153
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.780
think we were all scarred
by those. It was a

154
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.840
difficult, difficult time for all
of us. I'm afraid, But

155
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.450
you got to say like
the flash developers, even though

156
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.750
flash is dead, I keep
meeting them running really wonderful

157
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.280
interaction agencies around the world.
So I hope that their,

158
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:24.190
their spirit and their cleverness
transforms in different locations throughout

159
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.760
the industry. Yep, exactly. I
think that we all learned

160
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.150
how to animate on the
web because of flash and

161
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.850
what they called future wave
or future splash before it,

162
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.330
like, without, you know, the,
the, the, the dream weavers

163
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.550
and the future splashes, we
would never have animated anything.

164
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.100
It would all just be
a big, giant hypertext book.

165
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.750
Absolutely. And I don't know
about you, but this is

166
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.130
the internet. When I was
growing up, I, it was

167
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.850
not pitched to me as
glorified microfiche. It was supposed

168
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.350
to like the conduit of
human interaction. And there's so

169
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.080
much more to human interaction
than just text. Yeah. The,

170
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.310
the one thing I was
interested in understanding is how

171
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.720
you think animation is going
to go forward in, on

172
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.330
the web, given that the
things you were doing three

173
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.450
or four years ago were
kind of like poly filled.

174
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.400
I mean, maybe I'm using
the wrong terms. Like you

175
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.190
were doing things with animation
when there weren't necessarily standards

176
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.650
for them. And now people
are talking about those standards.

177
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.350
You've worked on some of
those standards. Yes, I have.

178
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.870
Are they simply allowing us
to do things that we

179
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.170
could do three years ago,
except in less markup, like,

180
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.060
like, or are we still
doing the same things we

181
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.160
did in flash, except now
it's one property instead of

182
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.240
an entire flash? Well, that's
interesting that you should ask

183
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.660
about that. So partly, yes,
some of the stuff is

184
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.820
no longer. Polyfill older behind
a vendor prefixes and we've

185
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.610
advanced in that regard. But
in the other, on the

186
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.210
other hand, some things have
become more popular. For instance,

187
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.260
most front end developers or
designers who want to build

188
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.520
interactions, not just like animations,
but actual, like anything from

189
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.510
making an icon change, creating
an interactive of visual data

190
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.160
visualization, or, you know, making
a really cute kind of

191
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.150
almost like a flash video
using CSS and JavaScript. There

192
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.750
are libraries that are kind
of now industry standards like

193
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.960
grain sock is one of
them. It's a, it's a

194
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.380
tweening library that was written
in action script rewritten in

195
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.470
Java script. And it's the
most popular animation library on

196
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.220
the web now, top 20
JavaScript errors. Yeah, really. So

197
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.510
we've seen a, well, it's
a blinding amount of change

198
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.810
in this space over the
past three years. I think

199
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.080
at one point I wrote
an article on a list

200
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.360
of part where I said
that we're going to see

201
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.300
that prototyping software that invests
in animation is going to

202
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.750
compete better than prototyping software.
That doesn't, I was speaking

203
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.240
specifically about the web, but
this also applies to app

204
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:05.990
development. And it's true. Those,
those prototyping companies that didn't

205
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.990
get a good animation workflow
nailed down. They weren't able

206
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.430
to also grab the app
development market as well. And

207
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.800
even, even juggernauts, like envisioned
quickly dotted and, and bought

208
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.950
out people who were building
animation tools online and added

209
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.110
them into their stables so
that they could provide that

210
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.200
feature. Anyone who didn't do
that just isn't even competing

211
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.090
right now. Really? Yeah. Motion
design is a big part

212
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.260
of making fully integrated, smoothly
flowing experiences. You don't really

213
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.860
have a touch strategy without
emotion design on your staff

214
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.370
right now. Do you think
that if we make motion

215
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.390
animations available in like single
properties and simple things like

216
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.820
that, they'll just be abused.
Like if you basically, if

217
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.620
you give me those tools,
I'm just going to mess

218
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.040
it up. It's funny you
should that, because that would

219
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.440
Be like me saying, well,
if I give you more

220
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.930
fonts, why don't you just
change every font on the

221
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.870
page and make it ugly?
And yeah, that, that could

222
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.490
happen. And ultimately it all
turns into comic Sans, But

223
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.650
eventually people, people, Hmm. Let's
put it this way. If

224
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.380
you were doing that, you
wouldn't be building anything anyone

225
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.240
would want to use. So
no one will see it

226
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.220
does a tree falling in
the woods really make a

227
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.330
noise. Does a poorly designed
experience ever really get seen

228
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.510
by anybody. So I'm not
worried at all that people

229
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.520
are going to abuse it
because if they do, no

230
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.530
one will use it. Okay.
Okay. I can see that.

231
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:32.640
I can see that. I
know that I'm going to

232
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.950
mess it up the ultimate,
But I will say there

233
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.290
are some best practices. There
are some things that people

234
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.610
can do to not horribly
horribly ruin their users' experience.

235
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.550
For instance, in the CSS
world, we have this new

236
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.930
thing that the Apple people
proposed, the good folks working

237
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.220
on WebKit, it's a reduced
motion, prefers reus, reduced motion

238
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:58.320
media query. Now it's nonstandard
it. It's it's been proposed,

239
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.530
but it's not been implemented
by every browser everywhere. Right

240
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.490
now. It's, it's definitely Safari
only. But basically what it

241
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.870
does is if the user
has gone into their, their

242
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.640
preferences and selected, you know,
reduce motion, then this media

243
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.830
query will respect it. It
means that you can dump

244
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.980
all of your CSS animations
to be under that media

245
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.370
query so that people who
suffer from vestibular disorders won't

246
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.540
have to suffer through your
animations. It also offers a

247
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.550
couple of other benefits. Like
you can loop into that

248
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.910
with Java script and only
conditionally load a parallax library

249
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.510
and all of its triggers.
If that, if that motion

250
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.290
preferences set in a way
that allows it. Yeah. Interesting.

251
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.150
And so I would set
that just like I set

252
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.270
my, I do not track
in my browser. I mean,

253
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.680
it's a preference. I would
tell the browser, I get

254
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.270
vertigo. I get dizziness Actually
is system level setting for

255
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.170
iOS. And I don't know,
actually if it's on desktop,

256
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.100
but it's a system level
setting on iOS and now

257
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.450
iOS, Safari respects it. So
it's lovely to see all

258
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.650
the browsers are contributing something
special. That's very interesting. I

259
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.440
wonder, I know that there
is a play animations on

260
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.480
windows option on windows itself.
And I wonder if that

261
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.100
is then respected and then
it goes all the way

262
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.180
through the browser and at
this time. Okay. But certainly

263
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.610
could because it's a flag
and it just needs to

264
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.550
find its way through the
store. Exactly. I have high

265
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.710
hopes for that one because
it really does change the

266
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.500
usability of the web and
apps that are built on

267
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.710
top of web technologies. Yeah.
I definitely noticed the one

268
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.020
in iOS. That's like, you
know, use less motion. I

269
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.670
don't know if it uses
no motion, but it's like,

270
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.840
don't use the motion that's
going to have, give me,

271
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.480
give me vertigo. All right.
That's interesting. And that feeling

272
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.510
of vertigo is what we
call. I may have used

273
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.580
a word that some of
your audience members are like,

274
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.950
what is the stipular disorder?
It's a, it's a thing

275
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.470
where your vestibular system is
the thing that controls your

276
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.690
sense of balance. And when
it goes out of whack,

277
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.030
it involves your eyes. It
involves your ears, it and

278
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.210
falls a lot of different,
a lot of different parts

279
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.850
of things. And when it
gets a little out of

280
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.700
whack in any particular way,
everyone's is a little out

281
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.290
of whack in a different
way. If they're suffering from

282
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.400
a vestibular disorder, you can
feel vertigo from things like

283
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.550
parallax motion, where things and
in the foreground are moving

284
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.220
faster than things in the
background, which is very popular

285
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.000
in design right now. And
that can throw people at

286
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.600
odds. You know, they can
feel like they're going to

287
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.090
vomit because you know, something's
moving. Shouldn't be really not,

288
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.740
no, no disrespect to people
who have this, but as

289
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.470
someone who doesn't currently have
any, I've had vertigo in

290
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.420
the past, but I don't
have it right now. Is

291
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.170
this a big deal? Is
this like a, like, this

292
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.060
is an accessibility issue. Like
I want to make my

293
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.120
webs site work for the
blind, even though there's not

294
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.640
a whole ton of blind
people, there's a, certainly a

295
00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.850
measurable, insignificant amount. And we
care about them. We want

296
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.490
to make our videos have
captioning for the hard of

297
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.210
hearing. But I don't think
that we're necessarily as familiar

298
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.630
with vestibular disorders as we
are blindness and deafness. Like

299
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:09.100
at what point at what
point do we go too

300
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.050
far? And when do we
stop? And when do we

301
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:14.890
start? Like, is this an
easy thing to do? That

302
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.160
is a great Dancing around
it. Like I'm I know

303
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.720
that I'm going to get
an email from someone with

304
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.150
a Vista reorder. That's like,
yes, it's totally real. But

305
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.790
I understand that, like, you
know, I don't eat cake

306
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.580
I'm diabetic. I get that.
Like, we want the web

307
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.170
to be accessible. Is it
just a matter of having

308
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.840
a flag? And then just
simply not animating the things

309
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.970
I would ordinarily animate? Well,
the media queries are a

310
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.160
way to do that, but
right now the problem is

311
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.950
that not everybody. Yeah. That
is to say everyone, but

312
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.970
Safari at this time, doesn't
support them. So your other

313
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.950
option is to do something
like what I did with

314
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.260
this project I did with
Mozilla back in the day

315
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.030
show off Firefox is excellent.
And ere still best-in-class web

316
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.860
animation tools. You should totally
check out dev tools, challenger.com.

317
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.280
This was such an exciting
project. It was a, we

318
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.380
had five weeks and there
were just five of us.

319
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:10.480
And I was like lead
creative director person and chasing

320
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.140
down awesome illustrators all over
Portland. We got these beautiful

321
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.110
deep sea fish, and it's
a tutorial for how to

322
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.980
use the tools, but you'll
notice that there's also a

323
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.290
call to action on the
page. It's like to turn

324
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.170
off the animation. It's right
there with the turn down

325
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.530
the sound option. So we
like to like to give

326
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.860
users options these days. I
think, I think what we

327
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:38.170
keep getting back to when
having these discussions around accessibility

328
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.720
and is there such a
thing as accessible by default?

329
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.300
And the truth is there's
no such thing as accessible

330
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.890
by default. We are all
on some continuum of different

331
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.030
abilities. Some us can see
better than we can here.

332
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.340
Some of us here better
than we can see. Some

333
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.510
of us get dizzy. When
we see things moving on

334
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.080
a page and for others
of us, it really helps

335
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.270
us figure out where things
are on the page. So

336
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.750
you can't just say, all
right, the computers are now

337
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.570
completely non visual because that
doesn't help the people who

338
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.030
have problems hearing you can't
say, well, we're going to

339
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.670
remove all the animation because
then we lose all the

340
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.450
cognitive benefits that animation confers
on people who don't have

341
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.530
the stipular disorders. So what
we're seeing as a trend

342
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.980
in app and web design
is giving users options. And

343
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.250
if there's no system level
setting that you can respect

344
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.690
for contrast, that's a great
feature, by the way, for

345
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:40.560
contrast or reduce motion preferences,
we try to offer it

346
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.490
in another way. I specifically
love it. When, when sites

347
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:48.360
offer, for instance, in their
user settings, like big corporate

348
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.270
or governmental sites and their
user settings, if they have

349
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.850
a box you can take
to use a font that's

350
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.000
designed specifically to help people
with dyslexia, read the screen.

351
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.310
It's not a font. That's
easy to read for people

352
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.060
who do not have dyslexia,
just Lexi. Yes. But for

353
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.340
those folks that do have
it, that's a major feature

354
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.670
boost, but you're not forcing
this on everybody. Cause there's

355
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.020
nothing that's perfect for everybody.
You're just giving people choice

356
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.070
in how they experienced the
way. Yeah. I'm going to

357
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.400
have to apologize for about
10 minutes ago when I

358
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.890
was talking about that, I
did not realize that when

359
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.620
you think about vestibular order
disorders, you're also thinking about

360
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.770
epilepsy, which I am familiar
with. And I understand that

361
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.900
there are people who have
had their epileptic seizures triggered

362
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:38.870
by, you know, something as
innocuous as, as an, as

363
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.240
an ad. Like you, you
just, you're deciding to read

364
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.650
the news and you go
to a page and then

365
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:47.750
suddenly there is suddenly there's
an advertisement. And then you're

366
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.260
having a seizure because someone
was thought, yeah. And this

367
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.580
unfortunately been used as a
weapon against some people on

368
00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.630
Twitter. I've seen threads where
someone's being a horrible troll

369
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.600
to a person who's known
to have epilepsy and we'll

370
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.490
tweet triggering gifts at them
on purpose. And that that's

371
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.930
really sick. And yeah, no,
but epilepsy is not a

372
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:16.430
vestibular disorder. It's just another
one of those, those different

373
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.670
cognitive quirks that some people
have and some people don't

374
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.680
and you want to be
respectful of them. I would

375
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.560
say that epilepsy is a
very dangerous one because while

376
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.010
vertigo can make you feel
dizzy, you're unlikely to fall

377
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.500
over and die in the
street in front of oncoming

378
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.610
traffic because of vertigo. Unlikely,
didn't say it can't happen.

379
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.490
Just saying most cases of
a disorders are not that

380
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:42.440
extreme. Whereas epilepsy, when it
hits can have devastating consequences

381
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.190
in an, in an active
environment. How much of this

382
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.920
do you talk about in
book where you have the

383
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.400
chapters on human perception, animation?
Cause you go through how

384
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.480
the human visual system works
and kind of the cognitive

385
00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.150
load of animation. We actually
save these for the last

386
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.480
chapter because it's a, the
last chapter of the book

387
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.530
is all about accessibility. And
I feel like accessibility is

388
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.880
a wonderful field of research
and people are constantly diving

389
00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.660
deep and learning more and
more about, about how the

390
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.270
brain works. And a lot
of these things, we don't

391
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.220
even know that they're a
problem until they are, for

392
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.990
instance, iOS seven had a
zooming in and out animation

393
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.140
that they, the designers didn't
even realize that that would

394
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.210
be a problem because all
the people they tested on

395
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.570
were very positive. And, you
know, Hey, this animation helps

396
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.160
me see where my apps
are from. I'm one of

397
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.210
those people. And that, that
helped them find those apps.

398
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.940
Again, later it decreased their
cognitive load. They didn't have

399
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.820
to stop and think about
where those apps were because

400
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.390
it was reinforced every time
they accessed and exited it.

401
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.320
Now, what they didn't realize
was just a few weeks

402
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.320
after launch, there were all
these negative reports coming in

403
00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.000
of people feeling dizzy and
you know, like trying to

404
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.690
pull back their installations because
they didn't like this animation.

405
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:08.160
So the iOS developers pushed
out that prefers, reduced motion

406
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:13.230
toggle as a immediate response
to their users needs. Interesting.

407
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:17.250
Okay. Do you, do you
put these toggles on all

408
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.730
of your sites? Like I'm
looking at your challenger one,

409
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.500
but I have to say,
I have not seen a

410
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.890
lot of those, huh? I
haven't either, but I think

411
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.050
my next site, I will
put it on there and

412
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.890
I'll also have, I will
also have the media query.

413
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.380
If I'll use a little
bit of JavaScript to detect,

414
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.370
if the media query isn't
supported, puts put this toggle

415
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:43.470
on the page somewhere On
your site at Rachael neighbors

416
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.860
and neighbors is N a,
B O R S. You

417
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.650
have a section called Alice
in video land. It's basically

418
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.890
an interactive storybook and it's
a couple of years old

419
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.550
now, isn't it? It is.
I made this for Adobe's

420
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.850
inspire a magazine back when
it was all about the

421
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.410
web. And this book was
from an era when flash

422
00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:09.900
animation just wasn't being done.
And everyone was being, being

423
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.970
really into the moral type
of graphic, stateful, web, you

424
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.170
know, it all very beautiful
and magazine like unfortunately could

425
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.020
have looked more magazine. Like
now we have grid, come

426
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.880
back, everyone, try it again.
But anyway, I made this

427
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.860
to kind of prove that
you could have an interactive

428
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.300
storybook using CSS and Java
script only. And it would,

429
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.880
it would still work on
an iPad. It could look

430
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.810
really good. In fact. Yeah.
And it's been a while.

431
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.680
What I'm doing now is
I'm taking this site, which

432
00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.430
has a lot of cruft
it, you know how you're

433
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.380
always looking back on the
projects you've done and you're

434
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.020
thinking I would do it
differently. Now I do that

435
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.540
all the time too. And
this one specifically, I have

436
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.600
some bones to pick on.
I'm giving a keynote at

437
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.810
JS Congress in Munich, in
November. It's going to be

438
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.860
right alongside people like my,
my favorite Lynn Clark. So

439
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.590
exciting. I want to show
how much faster and better

440
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.070
I can make the site
today. For instance, it's got

441
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.300
J query in there. It's
got modernizer, it's got, it's

442
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:23.360
using scroller, a JavaScript library
that causes parallax to happen.

443
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.530
It's also got another library
waypoints JS, which checks to

444
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:32.000
see I'm using it here
to change some classes, depending

445
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.630
on which, which part of
the book is in, in,

446
00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:40.370
in viewport. And these were
some pretty heavy assets. And

447
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.730
they're not the most performant,
not the most performant for,

448
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.060
for scrolling or anything like
that. And we have new

449
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.450
API APIs. We have new
features in the browser that

450
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:55.540
completely negate. Most of them,
You are doing things in

451
00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.540
this thing, in this, in
this website that feel like

452
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.480
modern. Like it's like this.
I don't know. I don't

453
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.190
know if the term is
scroll jacking, but as you

454
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.570
scroll things are happening, right.
I don't remember that. Yeah.

455
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.000
It's like very common. It's
common now. But when this

456
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.700
came out, that was not
something that was really widely

457
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.620
seen. At least it wasn't.
I didn't see it much

458
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.710
Was very popular when this
was first published way back

459
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.140
in the day, everyone wanted
to know how to do

460
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.900
parallax, which was what they
later came to call scroll

461
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.740
jacking. Pretty much anytime something
happens in accordance with the

462
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.380
user scroll, you'll hear it
referred to as scroll tracking

463
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.040
or parallax. Parallax is official
effect where it's something in

464
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.470
the foreground or a 2.5
D presentation moves faster than

465
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.010
things in the background. Things
moving at different rates, scroll

466
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:46.240
jacking is whenever you're using
the scroller to change or

467
00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.760
changing the behavior of the
scroll bar, there may different

468
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.670
kinds, just like scroll triggering,
which is when something only

469
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.850
happens. When you scroll to
a certain point, other scroll

470
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:58.420
linking when maybe you've tied
the scroll bar to a

471
00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.060
progression, like as you're scrolling
down the side of a

472
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.630
site, you might see, Oh,
you seen like, like when

473
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.730
you're reading an article and
as you scroll, there's a

474
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.680
bar at the top that
shows you how far away

475
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.320
from the end you are.
That's an example of scrolling

476
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.920
King. So it can be
used for both nefarious, evil

477
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.130
purposes. Like, you know, parallax,
he can't turn off that

478
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.070
makes some users sick and
it can also be used

479
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.220
for great purposes, like a
useful bar that shows you

480
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.400
how far you are through
a, through a book. But

481
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.840
in this case, it's really
touching the Dom a lot.

482
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:37.810
Scroller. The library is by
hand updating these different elements

483
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.980
with CSS properties, using a
scroll event listener. And it's

484
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.260
really not that efficient. Now
we've got some other things

485
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.180
that are much more efficient
and I'm looking forward to

486
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.200
showing people how they can
work. W like I'm looking

487
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.870
at Alice and her eyes
having like an idle animation

488
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.850
and she's sitting on a
park bench. And I think

489
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.130
maybe you are standing, sitting
next to her reading Java

490
00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.350
script for designers. That is
not me. That is her

491
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.450
older sister. I only wish
I looked at that. Cool.

492
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.690
Okay. Are, are the, and
I notice that there's some

493
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.140
jQuery on the site. Are
you animating her eyes with

494
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.680
CSS or with JavaScript at
this point With CSS, the

495
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.870
bulk of the animations on
here are CSS driven. And

496
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.920
the only time I use
any JavaScript to drive animations

497
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.640
is when I'm changing classes
to change her mood as

498
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.340
she's falling down the rabbit
hole. And also for the

499
00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.330
parallax effect where her descent
down the rabbit hole is

500
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:34.100
controlled by your scroll position.
Oh, okay. Cause I'm scrolling.

501
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.800
And like you say, the
background is going fast. It's

502
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.000
almost like gears on a,
on a bicycle where the,

503
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.150
you know, I'm moving my,
my scroll wheel at a

504
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:47.120
constant speed. She's at one
gear. And the background is

505
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.360
at a much, a much
lower gear. Right. And you'll

506
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.570
notice that she's also changing
as you scroll down. That's

507
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:57.110
because the class on her
container is changing. It's changing

508
00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:02.180
her background position attribute. So
what I would do to

509
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.690
do that today is I
would be using intersection observer

510
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.080
to check, to see which,
which mood she should be

511
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.470
having instead of using waypoints,
which has to listen to

512
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.070
a bunch of scroll events.
Intersection observer is an interesting

513
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:21.170
API. It was created largely
because people wanted to optimize

514
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.440
the behavior of ads. But
of course the first thing

515
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.910
that was going to happen
was it was going to

516
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.750
be co-opted by creative coders
and interaction developers as well.

517
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.920
So it's very useful in
that regards. You just let

518
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.440
it tells you when two
elements on the screen have

519
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.810
intersected and you can use
it to listen for all

520
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.300
kinds of things. I've seen
it being used in systems

521
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.090
to check, to see when
something has fully loaded. I'm

522
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.100
using jQuery on here to
check to see when the

523
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.250
page is loaded, but I
could also use intersection observer

524
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.490
to just see when all
of the images have intersected

525
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.360
with the window. It I've
seen it being used also

526
00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.740
to help with getting just
the, what is it, the

527
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.900
most important CSS that you'll
see, that's just above the

528
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.020
fold, the stuff that must
be loaded. First I've seen

529
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:14.270
intersection observer used in automated
systems to just find that

530
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:18.680
CSS set applies, and then
just spit that out separately

531
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.590
as a style sheet that
can be embedded in the

532
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:26.390
page for faster performance. So
forgive my ignorance on this

533
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:30.050
one here, but I see,
I see SVG in some

534
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.170
of the CSS where it's
like background URL, something, something

535
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:37.370
as Fiji. Yeah. I see
inline SVG where you can

536
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:40.790
actually see the points and
the data directly with the

537
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.900
array of the data points.
And then I also see

538
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:49.120
what I'm assuming is SVG
in a base 64 encoded

539
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.760
giant data, colon image islands.
So I have three different

540
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.490
ways to be doing SPG.
Is there a reason for

541
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:58.290
that You're paying attention? I
am sure I had my

542
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.560
reasons. I don't actually remember.
Where are you seeing the

543
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.290
basic city for? You gotta
tell me I haven't saw

544
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.610
a style dot CSS. Yeah.
I've gone to Alison video

545
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.460
land and I've clicked on
line 13 style that CSS.

546
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.050
And I see, I see
cups and I see saucers

547
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.200
and you know, it's a
nontrivial amount of basic Seaford

548
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.570
stuff. So now there's three
different ways to load your

549
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.200
SPG. There's inline in the
HTML. There's loaded in as

550
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.410
an external resource in the
CSS. And then there's basically

551
00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.810
four in the CSS. So
I'm curious why that was.

552
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.640
And then more interestingly, how
you would do it in,

553
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.620
in, you know, today I
was probably using that because

554
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.700
I wanted to have the
loading cup and saucer right

555
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.420
there immediately before all the
other things had loaded. So

556
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.320
that was a part of
my most important CSS styles

557
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.050
that must be embedded on
the page. I would probably

558
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.540
do the same thing today,
but I would probably, like

559
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.350
I said, reference, I think
this is not in line.

560
00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.630
I think this is still
in the CSS. I would

561
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:04.020
probably pop that out of
the external style sheet and

562
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.020
just directly embed that in
the header element so that

563
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.830
it would be there available
immediately. Oh, interesting. So then

564
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.540
it would, it would still
be in line, but it

565
00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.760
would be in line in
the, in the HTML. It

566
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.240
would load even faster because
the HTML I say, so

567
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.540
right now the page Does
loading fast in the CSS

568
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.250
because it still didn't have
to wait for an SVG

569
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.590
to load. It was already
encoded in the CSS, but

570
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.600
I could make it even
faster by not waiting for

571
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.970
the CSS to load and
just having it right there

572
00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.750
in the HTML. Very cool.
You know, I just, it's

573
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.910
so sad sometimes when you
go and view source on

574
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.820
a website and it's just
a mess of minified stuff,

575
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.950
it's fun to go and
look at a site like

576
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.370
this Alison video land and
view source and like go,

577
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.620
Oh, are they thinking interesting?
You can actually explore the

578
00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:51.240
space. I kind of miss
the view sources I do

579
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.420
too. And you know, I
started working for myself about

580
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.840
five years ago. I don't
work for myself anymore. I

581
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.870
enjoy working for other people
from time to time. But

582
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.340
back I remember working for
myself. We still sometimes would

583
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.490
build sites like this. And
now we have so many

584
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.410
processes to optimize. We have
entire tooling pipelines to optimize

585
00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.950
delivery. It's impressive. I mean,
it's great, but it's also,

586
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.130
I wish we would also
just build lighter weight sites

587
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:24.000
by default says a lady
who loves building interactive experiences

588
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.130
on her weekends. Absolutely. Well,
thanks so much for, for

589
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.110
talking with me today. Thank
you for having me. And

590
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.630
if any of your listeners
would like to learn more

591
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.540
about animation on the web,
I would love to invite

592
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.010
them to join the animation
at work Slack, Slack dot

593
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.040
animation@work.com got all kinds of
people of all levels of

594
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.400
skill. And we also have
a newsletter which you can

595
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.230
find at web animation, weekly.com.
Fantastic. I'm going to put

596
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.860
all of these links in
the show notes, and then

597
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.990
also remember the, the coupon
Hansel, H a N S

598
00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:00.100

off the book. Fantastic. Thanks

599
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.710
so much. Thank you so
much for having me Scott

600
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:06.370
take care. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

601
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.720
