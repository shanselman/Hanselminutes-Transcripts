Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.550
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. I'm here with

9
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.220
Courtney Irvin. She works at
the New York public library. I'm

10
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.230
great. Thanks so much for
having me. So we're in

11
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.960
person in Portland, Oregon. You're
in my fine city. Why

12
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.720
are you here? Oh, I'm
here for write, speak code,

13
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.350
which is a conference for
women and non-binary developers to

14
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.680
practice their career skills and
writing, speaking coding. It's pretty

15
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.050
straight forward. Okay. Very cool.
So that is going to

16
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.570
happen tomorrow and you're here
kind of setting up. So

17
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.370
I was able to catch
you while you're doing this.

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.980
You work at the New York
public library and I met

19
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.860
you first at code land.
So that's now two different

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.950
conferences that I've seen you
at. Have you always been

21
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.220
a conference goer? Yeah. Yeah.
I'm I actually have been

22
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.280
a conference goer for longer
than I've been a developer

23
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.940
or longer than I've been
coding regularly. So it's sort

24
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.520
of the only way that
I know. Do you think

25
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.980
that, like, I would say
that for every one, you

26
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.890
know, conference goer, there's probably
a thousand that don't go.

27
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.870
Why did you, did you,
you said it was the

28
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.940
only way that, you know
Yeah. I mean, when I

29
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.810
started learning how to code,
I was going to events

30
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.730
like hacking Jill now to
funct and girl develop it

31
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.300
and got caught up in
WriteSpeak code as well. But

32
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.960
those events helped me become
a developer. And so now

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.920
they're just kind of a
part of my developer DNA,

34
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.310
where I feel like it's
really important to create spaces

35
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.600
that encourage people from a
diverse background to continue their

36
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.660
work in software. So you
are a developer, you've been

37
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.880
a developer for a number
of years. You came out

38
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.120
of school though, not with
a development degree. No, my

39
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.920
degree was in English and
anthropology. So basically computer science,

40
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.740
right? Well, I get it.
The reason I ask is

41
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.690
that I get a lot
of emails from people who,

42
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.730
and this is a lot
that say I have a

43
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.580
BA in English. Should I
go back to school? I

44
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.190
want to be a developer.
And, you know, I have

45
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.020
said in my emails, in
my answers that you know

46
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.580
that I appreciate the rigor
that four year degrees give

47
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.460
you, but honestly, that rigor
can be applied to yourself

48
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.740
and your self study. What
do you think you need

49
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.800
to go back to school?
Oh, I think it depends

50
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.810
on the person, but I
don't think that it's required.

51
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.750
And I, one thing that
I tell people who go

52
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.860
to school is to make
sure they are learning how

53
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.340
to code working on open
source projects. I'm working on

54
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.740
coding outside of school as
well, and building up the

55
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.840
skills that they need to
prove to employers that they're

56
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.860
valuable beyond the CS degree
itself. And that just comes

57
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.430
from my not, not lived
experience with the experience that

58
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.660
I've heard people explain about
computer science degree Havers, which

59
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.680
is coming out of school
without the product building experience

60
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.590
that might be required in
a full time position. So

61
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.060
I kind of bring that
to the table when I

62
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.290
give people advice who are
in CS degree programs, Were

63
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.390
you a techie before you
like a 12 year old

64
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.370
techie? You know, everybody says,
and then me and then

65
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.590
my mom and dad gave
me a computer. And then,

66
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.600
and then that those people
had like 15 year heads.

67
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.740
Yeah, no, I definitely wasn't
that. I played a little

68
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.930
bit of Bernstein bears as
a kid on my computer,

69
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.200
but nothing, nothing that deep.
I do remember when I

70
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.900
was in high school though,
I would build these geo

71
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.270
cities websites with definitely not
licensed anime images. And I

72
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.600
would make these, I would
stay up until 4:00 AM making

73
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.190
these like animated live journal
icons for friends for their

74
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.610
birthdays. But I didn't think
that those things were the

75
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.940
same as this job I
did. Like, I didn't know

76
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.860
that there was a job
that, you know, staying up

77
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.700
until 4:00 AM fixing the malware
on your windows. Computer could

78
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.810
like lead you towards doing
Okay. Interesting. So it sounds

79
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.760
like you were set to
techie, but maybe didn't realize

80
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.560
it. Yeah. I didn't know
that it was, I thought

81
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.960
it was just a thing
that you do. I didn't

82
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.600
know. I mean, it's been,
I'm still learning that, like,

83
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.850
there are a lot of
people who don't have the

84
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.130
skills that I even had
back then and was using

85
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.740
on a regular basis. So
you came out with what

86
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.220
degree? English. And did you
assume that you would immediately

87
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.680
become, I don't know, an
English speaking anthropologist or whatever

88
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.190
people? Yeah, no. I think
I came out of school

89
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.650
and it was basically I
want to change the world

90
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.840
and there's only one way
to do that. And so

91
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.930
I started working at nonprofits,
not, not as a developer

92
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.590
at all, but instead as
a program manager type, you

93
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.930
know, working directly with our
clients and I've worked at

94
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.380
a few different nonprofits that
are, that are different. And

95
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.110
yeah. So then how long
have you been at the

96
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.950
public library? Two years now?
Almost almost two years. Did

97
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.050
you go in, did you
go there to work on

98
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.150
a particular product or did
you get like with, did

99
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.670
the product exist before you
got there? The product had

100
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.710
existed, but only one person
had been working on it

101
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.590
and they were building out
a team. And so I

102
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.150
was really excited by the
product itself, which is simply

103
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.640
or library simplified, which is
the name of kind of

104
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.220
the suite of products and
the partnership that helped bring

105
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.520
them into being. And I
was excited by them having

106
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.140
been someone who worked in
the nonprofit sector and, and

107
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.040
coming in to technology. I
wanted to make technology for

108
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.010
nonprofits because I think that
they are really, really bad

109
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.280
at technology. So the idea
of building out a technology

110
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.320
team inside of the library,
that's going to be working

111
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.320
on some software that empowers
the library and its patrons.

112
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.690
Yeah. Because more often than
nonprofits, just buy vendor software

113
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.550
for exorbitant amounts of money
that maybe does, maybe doesn't

114
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.270
meet their actual need. It's
not very customizable and they

115
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.080
have to pay for everything
that they add. Every extension,

116
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.970
every change, you know, it's,
it's really, it's in, sometimes

117
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.610
it's a racket. Sometimes it's
just a desire for grant

118
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.190
based money from the government
coming through these nonprofits and

119
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.130
going directly to third party
vendors. And I really liked

120
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.760
the idea of working in
a place where we were

121
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.860
focusing on building software by
the nonprofit, for the nonprofit

122
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.290
to solve a problem, not
just for the New York public

123
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.580
library, but for lots of
public libraries. Now this might

124
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.010
be a dumb question, actually,
I'm probably positive. It'll be

125
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.770
a dumb question. The New York
public library, is it a

126
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.040
system or is it like
one giant magical castle library

127
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.690
thing? A little bit of
both. It's a, it's actually

128
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.930
one of the, it's the,
it's one of the top

129
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.560
four libraries and a lot
of different categories. So it's

130
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.480
actually the largest public, one
of the largest public library

131
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.370
systems. It's one of the
largest research libraries. And it's

132
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.310
unique in that it's both
a circulating library for the

133
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.310
people of New York city and
New York state, but it's also,

134
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.600
it's also a research library
as well. And it has

135
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.540
four different research divisions, But
like if there is there

136
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.820
only one on the Island
of Manhattan, or can I

137
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.230
go to the Bronx and
go to the New York public

138
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.960
land? Yeah, of course there
are a bunch of different

139
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.890
individual library buildings, but they're
all part of the same

140
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.640
circulating system. And then we're
that Queens and Brooklyn have

141
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.360
their own. And then this
software simply is something that's

142
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.050
used by all of those
buildings. Yes. So simply covers

143
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.630
all of, of New York public
library. And also Brooklyn public

144
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.030
library uses the simply a
platform now as well. And

145
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.920
we're going to be expanding
to more States and more

146
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.100
library systems soon. So what
does it do? So it's

147
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.430
an eroding reading application and
it's a mobile app that

148
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.410
you can use to read
books from the New York public

149
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.470
library. But basically it brings
the, the takeout, the number

150
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.390
of steps to take out
a book from the library

151
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.270
that was an ebook was
19, and we brought it

152
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.300
down to three. And so
making it a lot easier

153
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.910
for people and patrons to
access the books in a

154
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.850
direct way that didn't involve
any knowledge of sort of

155
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:21.500
the DRM mechanisms behind reading
the book. That's interesting that

156
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.720
this is really a total
coincidence, literally, before I met

157
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.710
you here today, I bought
a Kindle from a guy

158
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.720
on Craigslist. It's in my
bag here. I bought it

159
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.060
from my son and the
guy made the comment, Hey,

160
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.280
you know, you can plug
that into the library system.

161
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.430
And I know that because
I tried and failed once,

162
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.360
because it was all kinds
of weird steps in order

163
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.690
to install some weirdo. It
wasn't a nonprofit, it was

164
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.240
some third party, some third
party that we dare not

165
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.720
speak its name. And, and
it was just such a

166
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.940
hassle that I would not
want to inflict that on

167
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.910
my, so I'm probably going
to go find, I don't

168
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.500
know, eat pub books or
figure out some other way

169
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.920
to do it. Yeah, definitely.
I mean, when I, when

170
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.890
I interviewed for this position,
I mentioned my own experience

171
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:09.260
with unnamed third party ebook
application and was like, I

172
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.000
couldn't figure out how to
read books. And if I,

173
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.120
a person who, you know,
fixes my own windows, computer,

174
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.910
can't figure out how to
download books. How are we

175
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.700
going to serve the entirety
of New York city? Now, does

176
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.100
this application only work on
Android and iPhone and iPad

177
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.410
and windows machines? Or what
is the demographic? Can I

178
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.410
put on a Kindle? So
we have been working with

179
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.640
Kindle fire, and basically that's
just an Android application that

180
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.070
is slightly different and we
had some trouble with it,

181
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.290
but we have it on
Chromebook. We have it on

182
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.020
iOS. We have it on
Android and we're working on

183
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.570
a web platform as well.
So then the idea is

184
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.270
that I assume I log
in, I have my official

185
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.520
login for my New York public
library that I'm a member

186
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.790
of. And I say, check
out. And the book magically

187
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.100
appears somewhere. And then when
the book is time to

188
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.960
be returned, I'm either offered
a chance to renew it.

189
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.080
And it magically disappears, Totally
disappears. And it's all in

190
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.610
the app. So you can
read it in the app

191
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.250
as well, and you can
return it in the app.

192
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.360
And we also have a
huge open access library available

193
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.660
almost 5,000 books, a little
more than 4,000 that you

194
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.000
can browse and read for
free and keep forever On

195
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.170
your phone. Oh, wow. Okay.
Like an unlimited lease. Okay.

196
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.770
So which part do you
work on? I basically work

197
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.010
on all of it. It's
a really flexible system. Our,

198
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.020
our architect did a really
great job of building something

199
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.090
that was flexible because it
has to work for a

200
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.400
lot of different libraries. And
like I mentioned, near public

201
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.520
library is unique in its
arrangement of circulating and research,

202
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.140
but we're hoping to reach
university libraries as well. And

203
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.680
then we also have to
account for consortial libraries, libraries

204
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.830
where, you know, it's eight
different systems, but they all

205
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.930
share the same collection. So
it's, it's pretty, it works

206
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.600
for pretty much anyone. So
is this intending to be

207
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.150
for lack of a word,
a better word, a product

208
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.400
where like Portland public library
could like, I don't know,

209
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.040
like my guy could call
your guy, like, Hey, I

210
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.600
hear you got a cool
app. Can we use it?

211
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.990
Yeah, definitely. Definitely. You can,
you can use it. And

212
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.380
we're working with some folks
around infrastructure and making sure

213
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.120
that libraries know who they
can get in contact with,

214
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.220
if they need support for
infrastructure. If you want to,

215
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.340
to hire a developer to
add a feature that doesn't

216
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.800
exist, you could do that
as well. It's open source.

217
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.030
And so any library can,
can start working on it.

218
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.600
And we're already working with
several other organizations and building

219
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.270
our roadmap with many other
institutions. Right. Oh, that's cool.

220
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.630
Is it on GitHub? It
is. Wow. So that seems

221
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.660
like pretty like forward-thinking and
progressive of a library to

222
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.930
have an open source. Yeah.
It was one of the

223
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.810
reasons I joined the team.
I love that it's open

224
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.830
source. I love that. Even
if for me, it's about

225
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.740
longevity, right? So having an
open source project, unlike a

226
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.950
third party vendor who can
stop supporting some product, and

227
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.720
then you're kind of working
with that product or trying

228
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.340
to figure out a way
to continue using it with

229
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.800
an open source product. If
NYP decided tomorrow that they

230
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.100
didn't want to support simply
or library simplified anymore, which

231
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.580
they're not planning to do.
Sure. Then another library could

232
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.350
just pick up the ball
and get a grant for

233
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.870
some developers and work on
the parts that are important

234
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.650
to them and to their
population. And you had mentioned

235
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.030
that we don't want people
to have to think about

236
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.580
DRM. Is there DRM in
this? I assume there would

237
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.350
have to be otherwise the
publishers wouldn't allow you to

238
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.470
distribute the books. Yeah. There's
definitely DRM in this and

239
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.310
it's a huge part of
the constraints of the application.

240
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.050
It's part of why it's
part of why you have

241
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.390
to use a mobile app
to be able to access

242
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.520
the books and to read
them as well because the

243
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.220
mobile app handles the DRM
component. Does that mean that

244
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.720
by reading the source code
though, I might be able

245
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.940
to break the DRM or
is it more than, Oh

246
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.760
no. The DRM, the elements
that handle the DRM are

247
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.730
not in the source code
itself. And we, we do

248
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.290
a really good job of
making sure that we're not

249
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.130
breaking any of the licenses
that we pay for. That's

250
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.310
cool. So you've got an
app that runs in multiple

251
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.340
places. You described everything from
Chromebooks to browsers that you're

252
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.550
working on Android and iPhone.
Is it a web based

253
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.620
app? And that's how it
runs inside of iPhone and

254
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.470
Android. It's a web based
API and then the mobile

255
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.730
applications directly interact with the
API. So we use a

256
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:20.430
protocol called OPDs open publication.
Don't don't, you know, we

257
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.070
just love shortening words to,
to things we can't remember.

258
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.100
That's interesting for a couple
of reasons, one that you

259
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.840
didn't have to make up
your own API that like

260
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.760
people have already thought about
that. So people in the

261
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.060
library and space have thought
about API APIs. So then

262
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.860
you just use one as
opposed to just making up

263
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.710
your own rest API. That
was pretty cool. And then

264
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.620
you say you have native
applications that sit on top.

265
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.650
Yes, exactly. And so even
our web based client that

266
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.050
we build, which is we
have an admin component and

267
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.140
we're working on a Patrion
component, both of those directly

268
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.590
interact with that same API.
Right. When I think about

269
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:58.200
technology in a arguably non-technology
based company, I could imagine

270
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.830
that the architect or yourself
could for lack of a

271
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.340
better word, kind of Lord
your power over the nontechnical.

272
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.710
How do you deal with
those kinds of interactions with

273
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.810
like, I don't know, the
head librarian, I'm imagining the

274
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.410
lady from Ghostbusters at the
beginning. So she's, she's the

275
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.630
head librarian, you know, and
she has to effectively trust

276
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.990
you both implicitly and explicitly
to do the right thing

277
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.900
for the library, because there
you are the bridge between

278
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.720
the tech and the non-tech.
Yeah. There's I, I think

279
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.140
one thing that I've found
working in non kind of

280
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:34.140
technology focused organizations is that
it's, it's very, it's just

281
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.480
a very different level of
communication that has to happen

282
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.160
across the board. And this
is sort of where the

283
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.530
English and anthropology degree does
come in handy that when,

284
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.830
when you work at say
a Microsoft or a Google,

285
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.890
there's an understanding that the
software is the important part.

286
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.500
And so developers have sort
of higher status than many

287
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.200
other types of employees do
at the company. When you

288
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.110
work at the library, the
focus is not on development.

289
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.670
And so there's a huge
amount of communication, negotiation, and

290
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.590
education that has to happen
from on the part of

291
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.100
developers to make sure that
nontechnical people understand what the

292
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.380
work is that we're doing
and why and what the

293
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.190
longterm vision is of that
work. So it's actually the

294
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.070
opposite. It's less lording it
over and a lot more

295
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:25.850
negotiating and, and conversing around
and working maneuvering through bureaucracy

296
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.350
related to a very different
way of doing work. That's

297
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.300
very interesting. I think of
a company that I used

298
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.730
to work with that did,
it was a business. It

299
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.000
was a private business that
did document management software and

300
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.520
the head of the thing
was nontechnical, but he knew

301
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.450
what his vision was. And
the techie was, you know,

302
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.020
it was, was a genius,
but, but she, and he

303
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.170
had trouble with the idea
of, are we making tech

304
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.900
because it's cool or maybe
making tech for the people

305
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.600
because it was for profit
there's. It was somehow there

306
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.790
was a lack of empathy.
So this was a constant

307
00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.020
tension between kind of like
these using a Microsoft metaphor,

308
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.610
the Steve bomber and the
bill Gates. What I'm hearing

309
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.070
you say is that in
a nonprofit and particularly one

310
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.590
that is trying to serve
the maximum number of people

311
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.740
in a very diverse populace
that they, your, you as

312
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.720
a developer, having to amp
up the empathy and the

313
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.150
entire team has to amp
up the empty. Definitely. And

314
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.550
we really do have to
keep our patrons and our

315
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.550
users in the center of
what we're doing. It's not

316
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.170
about, it's not even necessarily
about numbers. It's about making

317
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.870
sure that we're providing a
service that meets the mission

318
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.630
of the library and making
sure that the people who

319
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.700
work at the library understand
that that's what we're doing

320
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.160
and understand how those things
come together. That's interesting though.

321
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.470
You just said that the
mission isn't about the numbers,

322
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.570
but like my developer brain
was like, what are the

323
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.730
KPIs, right? What are the
performance, you know, do we

324
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.070
have a a hundred thousand,
a million like what's success?

325
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.910
Yeah. I mean, we certainly
have goals and we, we

326
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.920
have metrics for ourselves and
for where we want the

327
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.400
project to be, but those
metrics are also looking closely

328
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.670
at what our users need
and expanding that user base

329
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.270
by incorporating more libraries and
making sure that they are

330
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.330
using the same accessible tools
that we're able to use

331
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.840
the library. It's not about,
I think in nonprofits, a

332
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.810
lot of times there's a
sense of wanting prestige and

333
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.850
to put your name on
everything. And this product is

334
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.300
not about that at all.
It's about getting, getting good

335
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.030
software to as many people
as possible. If you don't

336
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.440
mind. Well, maybe we can
take into a little bit

337
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.510
of the tech. Yeah, totally.
So what is, what are

338
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.560
each things written in? So
our backend is written primarily

339
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.420
in Python, and then we
have the native iOS application,

340
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.060
which is an objective C
and Swift. We're switching over

341
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.840
to Swift and we have
the Android application, which is

342
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.320
using standard Android, Java. Are
these things written kind of

343
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.540
in the classical way because
they need to support like

344
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.640
the simplest possible phones. Like,
do you have to go

345
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.110
and say, we want to
support the lowest Android and

346
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.760
the oldest iPhone. Yeah. We
don't go from The lowest,

347
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.690
but we definitely, we probably,
especially on Android, I think

348
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.310
we're doing Kit-Kat 4.1. Yeah.
I think it's, I think

349
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.560
it would be a lot.
Yeah. I don't remember them

350
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.940
all, but I think it
would be a lot easier

351
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.800
if we skip that one.
But because we have this

352
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.450
very diverse populace and, you
know, not necessarily technical people

353
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.570
who use their phones and
keep them updated all the

354
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.960
time, we have to make
sure that we're covering as

355
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.870
much as we can. So
we do work backwards with,

356
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.550
with tougher technologies And for
the technologists that are listening,

357
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.010
who may be, I don't
know, initially confused or have

358
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.860
a thought about that word,
diverse. When we say diverse,

359
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:33.200
that means age economics, phone,
their phone, their bandwidth, literally.

360
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.760
Yeah. Yeah. We mean, we
mean everything and I mean,

361
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.430
just think about the population
of a city and every

362
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.070
one of those people has
access to the library. So

363
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.700
you want to make sure
that you are reaching as

364
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.130
many of those people as
possible. And we, we try

365
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.990
to do that across a
lot of different levels, but

366
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.760
one of them is just
making sure that the technology

367
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.110
that they have in their
pocket is going to be

368
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.850
able to access the books
that they want to read.

369
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.190
Right. So, I mean, a
homeless person might have an

370
00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.260
Android phone and they want
to have it. They have

371
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.840
the right to have a
book on their phone. You

372
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.720
can enable them as well.
Definitely. Okay. So the backend's

373
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.660
written in, in Python and
understand that you're using Docker

374
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.120
as well, which again, seems
to kind of progressive for

375
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.300
a light. I just assumed
libraries with like FTP. Well,

376
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.850
listen, we're a little bit
on the cutting edge. Yeah.

377
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.090
We, we basically decided that,
you know, a lot of

378
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.580
libraries don't have development teams.
A lot of libraries don't

379
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.700
have software engineers at all,
and we would contact these

380
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.740
libraries and say, Hey, you
should use simply eat. And

381
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.750
the, the question is, you
know, well, how do I

382
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.270
get it? How do I
get it up and running?

383
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.860
Right. I want to test
version. I want it up

384
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.920
and running. And we realized
that release management was going

385
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.930
to be a really big
part of making sure that

386
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.970
other libraries were going to
be able to keep up

387
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.640
with what we were doing.
So Docker became a solution

388
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.140
for packaging up the application
and moving our instructions from

389
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.510
saying, Hey, so first you
need to run apt, get,

390
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:55.310
install these 20 things. And
instead we can say, okay,

391
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.610
install Docker, then run these
four commands and you have

392
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.850
a running application. And that's
how we manage our releases

393
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.280
and make sure that only
stable releases are going out

394
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.880
to other libraries. Is that,
is that a forgive my

395
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.790
ignorance about how Docker works?
Cause I know about as

396
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.550
much as it takes to
be dangerous. Do you just

397
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.770
update what's in the hub
and do they then update

398
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.220
their Docker files in order
to get the fresh Yeah.

399
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.840
That's how it, that's how
it works. And we're in

400
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:27.140
the process of moving into
a more continuous integration, continuous

401
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.890
deployment type of arrangement, at
least for what's on development.

402
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.500
And then, you know, keeping
up with our branches as,

403
00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.750
as we determine them to
be stable. So if someone

404
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.860
had like, you know, from
whatever and why PDL slash

405
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.150
colon latest in their, in
their Docker file and you

406
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.710
start moving towards this more
continuous integration, when, how do

407
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.450
people do people have to
write their apps to be

408
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.910
version aware in the sense
that the app knows that

409
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.390
the Docker container has been
shut down, brought back up,

410
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.310
Whoa, I'm on 4.3. Now,
I guess I need to

411
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.710
update my database. I need
to do some, I don't

412
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.150
know, internal housekeeping. Yeah. We've
done a lot of work

413
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.400
because we don't use something
like rails with a lot

414
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:11.640
of database migration builtin we've
done, I've done a lot

415
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.460
of work to make sure
that we can deploy the

416
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.660
databases via scripts, keep them
migrated and making sure that

417
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.170
past versions and future versions
match each other. And so

418
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.160
it's, it's basically now just
running the Docker container with

419
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.060
a vault, with an environment
variable that's migrate or ignore

420
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.060
or initialize, and that will
set up your database as

421
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.420
well. What is the database?
The database is Postgres. Okay.

422
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.270
Well, so that it can
scale forever. Is that running

423
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.100
in a separate container and
you have a Docker compose

424
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.970
It's RDS is what we
recommend. Sometimes when I run

425
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.160
tests, I do a Postgres
in a different, in a

426
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:53.490
different, Oh, it's the AWS
relational database service. Yeah. In

427
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.650
the cloud. So we keep
the database separate from the

428
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.460
Docker containers because yeah, because
that's not, it's not the

429
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.890
best use of a container.
Well, yeah, exactly. I was

430
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.600
wondering it's, it's, it's very
interesting that you're doing that

431
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.240
though, because there's been so
much talk over the last

432
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.880
several years about like when
the cloud is going to

433
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.830
really cause everyone to move
to the cloud and it

434
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.950
seems like databases in the
cloud make the most sense,

435
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.680
like everything in the cloud
makes sense to some, but

436
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.180
like of all the things
that we don't want to

437
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.290
think about databases, database. Yeah,
exactly. It definitely something that

438
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:26.220
I don't necessarily want to
teach us a bunch of

439
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.870
library, CIS ops people to
deal with. So the libraries

440
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.030
that you're using in the
soar, in the, in the

441
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:37.020
course of your application, do
you have to check with

442
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.150
the boss or is there
a compliance department? How do

443
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.040
you not accidentally bring in?
I don't know. Are you

444
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:47.400
GPL? Are you MIT? We
are a patchy. And we,

445
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.220
we did a round of
making sure that all of

446
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.460
the libraries that we're using,
all of the technical libraries

447
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.390
that we're using, this gets
confusing. All of the code

448
00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.360
libraries that we're using are
in a version that we

449
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.210
can distribute. But we do,
we do keep track of

450
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.490
those licenses just because we
have to be very risk

451
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:10.980
aware about our legal Yeah.
The, the apps themselves though.

452
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.840
Do I have to ask
permission if I'm on, if

453
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.000
I'm a small library, like
someone's listening and they're like,

454
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.000
Oh, I'm in Topeka. We
need to turn them on

455
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.100
to, can they just like
clone and fork and start

456
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.780
building these apps themselves or
so they check in with

457
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.450
you first. They should probably
check in with us first,

458
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.110
mainly because we are going
to have we're in the

459
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.900
process of finishing up our
library registry right now, the

460
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.830
app is multi library. So
it's one application and every

461
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.380
library that's in the system
will be in that application.

462
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.140
So you here in Portland
will open your phone and

463
00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.810
it will check where you're,
where you are. Location-wise and

464
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.560
then find the local libraries
closest to you. And if,

465
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.260
if it's Portland library or
if it's the Oregon state

466
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.410
ebook library or whatever it
is, you would be able

467
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:56.000
to immediately pull them onto
your, onto your phone. But

468
00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:00.710
otherwise you would have to
build your own application there.

469
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.910
You have to register with
Adobe for the DRM. There's

470
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.100
a whole other element to
it that you would have

471
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.410
to take on your self.
So we basically recommend that

472
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.740
library it's just hop on
with everyone else and keep

473
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.320
the keep, keep all the
work on us in terms

474
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.460
of getting people W w
which is interesting because the

475
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.700
not many libraries have enough
money, I would assume for

476
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.890
a developer on staff, much
less a full team of

477
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.190
developers on staff. Exactly. And
so when you joined the

478
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:30.580
library simplified community, a lot
of what we talked to

479
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.460
folks about is thinking about
what their contributions might look

480
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.840
like, whether they are developer
contributions, whether it's, you know,

481
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.500
getting a grant and figuring
that out, or whether it

482
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.580
is the simple contribution of
finding a way to hold

483
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.190
the host servers for the
year and make sure that

484
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.280
simply is on them. That's
I like that they don't

485
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.800
have to think about the,
the mobile apps, just the

486
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.870
keeping them updated, putting them
into the store, making it

487
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.410
multitenant is really smart. Certainly.
And we have organizations who've

488
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.170
reached out who want to
create their own unique mobile

489
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.390
application, and that's fine. And
they're happy. They're welcome to

490
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.970
use our open source projects
to get started with that.

491
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.850
It's just not something that
we have enough developer manpower

492
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:14.470
to maintain. It's all about
lowering the barrier. The, the

493
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:15.730
other thing that you're doing
is you do a lot

494
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:18.250
of testing for accessibility. Because
again, when we talk about

495
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.170
a diverse populace, it could
be people that are blind

496
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.540
or low vision that are
low bandwidth. What does it

497
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.460
mean to test for accessibility?
And what kinds of things

498
00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.010
are you doing? I mean,
we have a great user

499
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.760
research team that goes out
every two weeks on Wednesday

500
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.560
with application with different tests,
basically set up for either

501
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.860
the mobile application, the web
client, and a lot of

502
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.870
the other NYP L products
that we use. And they

503
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.270
sometimes, because we're a library,
we have all of these

504
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.150
different locations that serve different
populaces. So we can go

505
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.570
to the high school, public
library, branch that's, you know,

506
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.450
very close to young people
and see how they're, how

507
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.990
they're interacting with it. We
can use the library for

508
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.050
the blind and, and talk
to low sighted and low

509
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.740
vision people and make sure
that they know how to

510
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.020
use the application and that
it's working well with the

511
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.780
software that they're used to.
And I'm seeing lots of

512
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.670
different ways that people who
use technology differently than sighted

513
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.060
people are able to use
the application. And then we

514
00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.020
also work with just people
that walk into the library

515
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.510
off of the street and
see how they work with

516
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.020
the application as it currently
exists and different elements that

517
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.150
we add and features that
we add. So I'm hearing

518
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:32.800
formal and ongoing and basically
continuous UX testing. Yes, you

519
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.020
do have a large blind
populace in New York. New York's

520
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.360
actually very nice to get
around. I did some work

521
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.640
with the federated blind if
New York back in the day,

522
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.880
wow. They have a UX
department where you can bring

523
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.640
your application there and pay
them. And then they will

524
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.790
blind engineers and testers were
gone. I didn't know that.

525
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.700
That's great. You do more,
you said that you work

526
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.960
on all aspects of it.
Are you more of a

527
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.870
web person or you're more
of a mobile app? I

528
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.810
work on the API, so
I'm, I'm largely on the

529
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.510
backend. And then sometimes I
help with testing for the

530
00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.420
mobile application, but all of
the things that I do

531
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.420
on the backend impact, what
is capable what's possible in

532
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.250
the front end. So when
I say I work on

533
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.130
all of it, I work
on both the elements that

534
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.010
directly interface with the mobile
client and also the further

535
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:18.260
back servers that handle open
access books or handle metadata

536
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.650
management and making sure that
we know all of all

537
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.450
that we can know the
best that we can know

538
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.360
about each book that comes.
How are you handling versioning

539
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.220
your API? Cause it's been
a couple of years now.

540
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.260
Oh. So I guess we're,
we just launched the multitenant

541
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.990
version of the code base
and it's not in production

542
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:41.780
yet. So we are at
2.0 0.1 is, is our

543
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.690
most recent version. Do you
version that based on headers

544
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.790
or the URL, and now
that you have multi-tenant, there's

545
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.920
another whole dimension there because
you could have people on

546
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.260
different versions. Yeah. We could
have people in different versions.

547
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.300
I think it's something that
we're figuring out as we

548
00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.260
go, but we, we try
to keep things as backwards

549
00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.380
compatible as possible because right
now it's just NYP on

550
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.500
Brooklyn, public library on the
application. It's pretty easy to

551
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.430
maintain on the, on the
most recent version who are,

552
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.290
who are hosting in production,
but we have a bunch

553
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.360
of libraries that are getting
set up. And once they

554
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.330
start using the app, we
will see more of the

555
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:18.440
need for releases and, and,
and backwards compatible. Yeah. It

556
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.200
sounds like you are going
to learn very quickly. Yes.

557
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.020
So how can people who
are listening, who maybe hadn't

558
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.690
thought that there were big
nonprofits that they could potentially

559
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.080
work with or, you know,
social good in quotes organizations

560
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.970
that someone could potentially work
with? Because I think a

561
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.530
lot of people come out
of school with their computer

562
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.390
science degree and they go,
and they say, I'm going

563
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.400
to jump into the public
sector. You came out with

564
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.440
a double degree in English
and an anthropology and then

565
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.550
leapt into nonprofit. Do y'all
need help and nonprofits. Oh

566
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:48.380
yeah. I think nonprofit organizations
definitely need help and support

567
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.490
an engineering support. I think
that it's important to be

568
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:57.530
thoughtful about the ways that
engineers bring them help. And

569
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.930
I, I, I feel like
in my travels and in

570
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.520
the conferences that I've done,
I've met a lot of

571
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.010
people who want to do
social good coding, and that's

572
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:07.310
really important. And, but it's
also important that we think

573
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:12.320
about giving, giving a library,
just some software and not

574
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.870
the means of maintaining that
software, keeping it up to

575
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.780
date, making sure that they
can make changes to it

576
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.960
in the future is not
necessarily as helpful as thinking

577
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.120
about what the real problem
is and solving the problem

578
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.270
for more than just one
organization. So I think it's

579
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:29.570
something that you can figure
out through conversations with stakeholders

580
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.420
and figuring out the problem
and really thinking about, okay,

581
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.920
so what's the best way
for me to help? Is

582
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.840
it just to give money
to this nonprofit that I

583
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.060
know I want to support,
or is it to create

584
00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.980
an application to solve their
problem and help them become

585
00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.670
more efficient? And then finally,
I want to ask kind

586
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.440
of the most difficult question,
cause I'm sure that there

587
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.440
is someone who's listening and
saying, yeah, but you probably

588
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.980
can't make any money. If
you're a nonprofit developer, is

589
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.320
this one of those situations
where you have to take

590
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.990
a significant pay cut because
you want to do good

591
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.180
and you're always in your
mind going, yeah. But Facebook

592
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.100
could throw money at it.
I don't think it has

593
00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.300
to be that significant of
a pay cut. I think

594
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.850
that you need to be
realistic about what you want

595
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.590
out of a career. I
will say that at the

596
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.440
library, you know, I work
my hours, but if, if

597
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.570
a service goes down at
night, it's not the end

598
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.690
of the world. Unlike Facebook,
if something goes down at

599
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.300
night at Facebook, you have
to be there. You say

600
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.190
that because somehow it seems
to me like the library

601
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.360
is more important than Facebook.
I mean, in my experience,

602
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:34.590
yes. But I think, I
think that, you know, I

603
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.020
get to go to work
and work on something that

604
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.490
I feel really excited about.
And, and I don't, I

605
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.070
make, you know, enough money
to live my life and

606
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.430
be satisfied and feel emotionally
satisfied with the work that

607
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.550
I do. And then I
get to go home at

608
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.160
the end of the day
and that work doesn't necessarily

609
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.130
have to come with me
unless I'm in less, I'm

610
00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.570
trying to make something really
extra happen that particular week,

611
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.340
you know, I get to
put things down. So I

612
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.930
like the hours that I'm
able to work. And I

613
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.330
like the fact that I'm
able to commit those hours

614
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.610
to the things that are
important. That's a great answer.

615
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.980
I think also that I
see a lot of people,

616
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.080
particularly just a few years
out of school that are

617
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.520
saying, well, I want to
be a senior engineer and

618
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.560
I want to be at
whatever comes after senior engineer.

619
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.160
And like they think about
their career and this, you

620
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.460
know, that, that, that up
into the right chart, which

621
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.280
I think is a cliche.
Yeah. And at what point

622
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.700
do you stop? Why not,
you know, have a, have

623
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.350
a gentle slope and it
sounds like you could be

624
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.660
in this business for the
next 20, 30 years and

625
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.730
then be the head of
the team, the head of

626
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.760
the library technology group. There's
a lot of potential career.

627
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:42.180
Yeah, definitely. And you get
to solve problems in a

628
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:46.530
way that is not the
same as solving problems for

629
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.650
some profit margin. So it's
really exciting to be able

630
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.680
to think about problems in
the sense of, well, how

631
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.860
do we make this work
given what we have with

632
00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.680
and what we have is,
you know, we have a

633
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.930
will and a mission and
six engineers and a desire

634
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:07.440
to, to make it happen
for everyone in the United States,

635
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.630
if we can. Very cool.
Where can people check out

636
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.660
the code and explore simply?
Yeah. So we're on GitHub.

637
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:17.370
Our organization is NYP L
dash simplified, and the main

638
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.510
API code base is circulation,
but there's plenty there. It's

639
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.000
not necessarily set up for
outside contributors, but I'm hoping

640
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.590
to get it there soon
and you can kind of

641
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.480
see what we're working on
and where we're at. Very

642
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.250
cool. Thank you so much.
And people can also check

643
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.920
you out, speaking at conferences,
all of them. Yes, definitely.

644
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.030
Definitely. I'm around. Fantastic. This
has been another episode of

645
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:45.480
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week. <inaudible>.
