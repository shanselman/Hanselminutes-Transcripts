13
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.150
for coming on the show
and updating us on what's

14
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.790
going on with glimpse. No
problem, Scott. Thanks for having

15
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.200
us. Thanks for having us
so big stuff since I

16
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.330
saw you last, I feel
like I've kind of been

17
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.090
a, a watch or a
part of, in some small

18
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.910
way, this whole experience from
the moment that I saw

19
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.800
you guys at mix, I
want to say it was

20
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.280
mixed 2011 at the open
source Fest. Is that right?

21
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.550
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. It
was a pretty great experience

22
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.820
and it's, it's still very
surreal in my mind, The

23
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.990
whole experience that we had.
Yeah, it was, it was

24
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.820
crazy. Basically we were at
this open source festival. It

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.560
was, I think it was
John Papa's opensource festival. And

26
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.980
basically people were showing their
open source projects and somebody

27
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.570
grabbed me. I think it
was Phil hack and said,

28
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.000
you've got to see this,
you know, and that happens

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.650
a lot, but Phil grabbing
me and, and he says,

30
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.930
come and look at this.
And he, within about five

31
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.550
minutes, I was like, Oh
my goodness, this is going

32
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.610
to be awesome. And then
a glimpse was born, right?

33
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.060
A glimpse. It's a, it's
a client side, open source

34
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.580
tool. It looks like Firebug.
And if you looked at

35
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.790
it just briefly, you might
say, Oh, this is just

36
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.760
a plugin. It's just Firebug.
But then you start realizing

37
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.770
that this is a, you
know, a book for the

38
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.090
server and it's implemented entirely
in JavaScript. It's an amazing,

39
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.060
amazing tool. I love using
it. Nick, how do you

40
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.270
describe it? What's your elevator
speech for glimpse? You know,

41
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.930
we, we like to give
the, the For the server.

42
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.190
One of the things that
we've been talking a little

43
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.290
bit more about is it's
kind of like the, And

44
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.960
your car, it's got all
the gauges and dials and

45
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.300
information that you really need
to take to take the

46
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.460
journey. And it's By trifecta
of web development, debugging tools

47
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.860
where you have your F
12 tool Like Firebug or

48
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.070
the IAE tools, you have
a Fiddler kind of in

49
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.250
the middle and sits on
the, and then you Have

50
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.890
glimpse which sits on the
server. And all three of

51
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.530
those are very important points
of view when you're doing

52
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.130
your work. Yeah, absolutely. The
other thing that's amazing about

53
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.060
clumps that I've enjoyed was
one that you guys were

54
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.840
very early to adopt new,
get as a, a way

55
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.070
to get it installed. You
know, I always use glimpse,

56
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.300
Elma and mini profiler has
kind of like the, the

57
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.960
triumvirate of awesome open source
debugging tools. And Elma was

58
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.750
one of the first from
gosh now almost 10 years.

59
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.840
But the thing about Elmo
was that it required someone

60
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.760
to go and get a
zip file and download it

61
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.090
and unzip it and unblock
it and put it in

62
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.300
web config and do all
this work, new, get solved

63
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.660
that and glimpse, I would
guess probably glimpse would be

64
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.490
pretty hard to set up
if it wasn't for new

65
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.490
and you guys went right
for it. So you can

66
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.060
just go file new project,
install, package, glimpse, and boom.

67
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.800
You're ready to go. Yeah.
That's pretty much it certainly

68
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.370
for us new, it's been
a great release vehicle for

69
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.980
getting our packages out there.
It's got, you know, updates

70
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.310
built into it takes care
of anything we need in

71
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.600
the web config. Yeah. All
of that new get provides

72
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.970
us. And we've been very
fair. Very happy with it.

73
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
No, recently just let me
see here about a week

74
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.900
and a half ago, there
was a blog post up

75
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.560
on the red gate blog
that said that you guys

76
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.490
have quit your jobs and
you are now working for

77
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.930
red gate. Are you employees
of red gate? Technically? Yes.

78
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.770
So at the moment they're
paying out wages and allowing

79
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.850
us to, which allows us
to quit our job and

80
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.600
to be able to do
glimpse full time And quit

81
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.000
your job. So when you
say technically yes. I mean,

82
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.850
you are a, an employee,
like you'll have healthcare and

83
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.130
you'll have not a consultant.
No. Okay. So yeah, at

84
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.600
the moment, strictly speaking, we're
contractors, because we're still figuring

85
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.050
out some of the final
details because it turns out

86
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.680
trying to get international contracts
signed and all that sort

87
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.820
of stuff is a time
consuming process, but yeah, ultimately

88
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.760
all that stuff will be
taken care of. I remember

89
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.580
when having kind of candid
conversations with you guys over

90
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.300
dinner, a couple of times
that trying to figure out

91
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.760
how to make this work
with your existing jobs was,

92
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.460
was a problem. I mean,
it was almost like, you

93
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.260
know, you had this open
source thing, you were doing

94
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.480
it on the side and
the suddenly it became popular

95
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.940
and it's like, well, how
do we, how do we

96
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.720
do this right without well
finding balance, right. Do we

97
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.760
quit? Do we try to
sell it? Do we try

98
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.430
to productize it? I mean,
how many different things did

99
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.760
you think about Nick to,
to, to make glimpse more

100
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.850
than a hobby? Oh, you
know, About a lot of

101
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.180
different things we thought about
selling glimpse or selling updates

102
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.860
to glimpse or selling various
plugins that we, that we

103
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.410
could create. But I think
you hit the nail on

104
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.720
the head. We kind of
went from zero to 60

105
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.420
with glimpse. We released it
at open source fast. And

106
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.570
within a couple of weeks
we had 20,000 users and

107
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.970
supporting them and keeping up
with bugs and all that

108
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.530
kind of stuff was, there
was a lot of psychic

109
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.620
weight to having a successful
open source project. So, you

110
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.480
know, we, we had looked
around to see if anybody

111
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.480
was interested in letting us
work on this full time.

112
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.450
And everything had kind of
quiet quite a down to

113
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.100
be honest with you. I
think Anthony and I were

114
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.050
content that this was always
going to be a hobby

115
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.890
for us. And we had
learned to not take ourselves

116
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.710
so seriously when out of
the blue red gate had

117
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.050
contacted us and said, Hey,
listen, we really, really love

118
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.630
glimpse. And we'd like to
see more happening with it.

119
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.840
What can we do? And
that started that communication channel.

120
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.960
There has been some, some
backlash on comments on both

121
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.350
on your blog and on
the red gate blog. And

122
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.570
you know, a number of
people are saying, Hey, this

123
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.940
is great. Good for you.
Other folks are saying, you

124
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.740
know, wow, Nick and Anthony
just got a big old

125
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.100
pile of money. Presumably there
was like, you know, doubloons

126
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.950
and all, you know, big,
huge piles of pirate, booty

127
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.120
shit. Was this a situation
where it's just like, Hey,

128
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.890
we want to go work
on full time and we're

129
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.160
going to become like, I
wouldn't say kept, but you

130
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.950
know how you, you have
a benefactor, you know what

131
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.170
I mean? You have a
benefactor and red gate. I

132
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.390
mean, did they buy you
or buy you out? Did

133
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.120
they buy the intellectual property?
Yeah. So this is the

134
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.620
interesting thing, you know, the
best words put how this

135
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.030
is works is that red
gate is supporting us. So

136
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.810
in terms of open source
stuff, Nick and I still

137
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.260
control the licensing. So, you
know, if they, even, if

138
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.530
they wanted to, you know,
close the licensing often make

139
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.690
it impossible for people to
use. They couldn't do that

140
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.540
because that's something Nick and
I still use Nick and

141
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.530
I still control, you know,
for a get hub who

142
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.860
has contributor access and they
can't remove me and Nick

143
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.500
and all that sort of
stuff. So Nick and I

144
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.960
are still, you know, holding
the keys to the castle

145
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.990
as it were. And so,
yeah, I guess you could

146
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.790
look at the arrangement as
being a bit of a

147
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.030
benefactor, but, you know, I
choose to see it as

148
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.440
that they support us in
trying to help the community.

149
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.030
And part of that support
is, you know, we have

150
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.670
a designer working with us
at the moment to try

151
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.540
and help, you know, in
redo our website and come

152
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.970
up with a better UI
and all this sort of

153
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:30.520
stuff and other resources like
testing and whatever else. So

154
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.620
yeah, that, that's the sort
of support that we're getting

155
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.790
from them. You know, when,
when let's rotor, who I

156
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:42.700
consider a friend sold a
reflector to red gate, he

157
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.380
was in a similar situation
where he was working at

158
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.280
Microsoft, had this really popular
thing on the side, you

159
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.220
know, couldn't figure out a
way to monetize. It gave

160
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.290
it over to red gate.
Red gate says, you know,

161
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.070
hooray, we'll make this thing
free. And then, you know,

162
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.920
a year later kind of
gets nailed because they decided

163
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.560
to start charging and now
it's popping up registration. And

164
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.070
frankly, I don't even use
reflector anymore just because it

165
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.930
was just, it put a
bad taste in everyone's mouth.

166
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.120
And so everyone's kind of
picking on you and they're

167
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.430
saying that this is where
open source goes to die.

168
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.750
When, when you approach red
gate or they approached you,

169
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.880
was that your friend of
knee jerk reaction was like,

170
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.070
Oh no, not again. How
did you get past that?

171
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.180
Of course, when w so
red gate approached us and

172
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.570
when they did, we said,
Oh, Hey, you're the reflector

173
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.200
people, How's it going? Yeah,
There was a lot of

174
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.390
trepidation, you know, it was
like going on a blind

175
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.520
date with somebody for the
first time. You don't really

176
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.110
know what they're going to
look like until you sit

177
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.780
down in a room with
them and, and have a

178
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.910
meal. And that's exactly what
we did, Anthony. And I

179
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.490
went out to, to England
and we sat with them

180
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.650
for a few days. And
we were real honest with

181
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.060
them about how we were
worried. Some of the history

182
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.370
of what's happened to them,
kind of, frankly, they'd been

183
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.110
beaten up by the community
and that they have a

184
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.040
black guy. And, you know,
I have to say that

185
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.020
we came away really impressed
with how much they've kind

186
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.240
of looked back at what
they did and the lessons

187
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.920
that they've learned. And they
understand that that was not

188
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.200
how they want to be
dealing with the community. And

189
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.570
that they're trying to learn
from those lessons and move

190
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.060
forward. And I think glimpse
glimpses as much about a

191
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.880
technology as it is about
the community for red gate.

192
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:25.580
And we have, you know,
obviously we're biased, but we

193
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.170
we've had a lot of
conversations with regain. And we

194
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.600
really do believe that they're
trying to do what's best

195
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.540
and trying to move on
from past mistakes at this

196
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.390
time. So, so it sounds
like you kind of set

197
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.760
this thing up where there's
a rip cord. I mean,

198
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.060
in the sense of you
really do own the IP,

199
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.460
they are your benefactor. They
didn't buy you this. Isn't

200
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.710
like a glimpse buyout, kind
of a thing. They're there,

201
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.120
they're supporting two full time
guys and giving you designers

202
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.020
and stuff to make something
better for the community. But,

203
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.480
you know, is this an
indefinite thing, would you at

204
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.950
some, would they call you
one day and say, Hey,

205
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.770
we need you to work
on, on super widget, 2.0,

206
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.920
can you stop working on
re on glimpse for awhile?

207
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.550
Or, Yeah. So at the
moment it's an indefinite thing.

208
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.730
And I guess what you're
describing with the rip cord

209
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.300
could be accurate. I really
hope it never comes to

210
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.810
that. But in theory, you
know, discussions we've had is,

211
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.170
you know, look, if someone
does something evil or something

212
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.460
like that, you know, we,
we can walk away from

213
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.950
it, you know, and do
what's right for the community.

214
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.560
And we've even had discussions
that, you know, and this

215
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.200
doesn't make sense now, but
in the future, we'd love

216
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.470
to see a glimpse go
the way of like jQuery

217
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.500
and you know, where there's
a board of people who

218
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.070
are looking after the future
of where glimpse is going.

219
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.320
And, you know, Nick and
I may be on that,

220
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.300
or we may not be
someone from red gate may

221
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.810
be on that, but may
not be, but the community

222
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.830
is deciding the future. And
right now we does that

223
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.350
make Sense. You know, that's
a level of conversation we've

224
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.570
been having and it's kind
of like, well, you know,

225
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.630
there's not quite enough, the
same volume of people you're

226
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.980
using glimpse at the moment
is there is jQuery, but

227
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.670
that's, that's where we see
what the future to go.

228
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.000
And so, yeah, I think
it's, it's, it's really interesting

229
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.070
what's going to happen. And,
you know, I think everyone's

230
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.910
committed to the open source
nature of this. And I

231
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.670
think the other thing that
we all discovered in this

232
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.500
process was there's a difference
between something being closed source

233
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:35.050
and free and something being
open source and free. And,

234
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.050
you know, when looking at
all of this, those nuances

235
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.230
start coming out and, you
know, to the outside person

236
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.260
free is free, but you
know, to us, you know,

237
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.240
create developing open source software,
it's rather important. That's cool.

238
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.680
That's comforting to know that.
I mean, I was a

239
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.080
little, a little kind of
worried. I mean, I know

240
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.510
that I know that they're
not evil, but like you

241
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.220
said, they have a black
eye and I think that's

242
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.690
the thing. So this is
an opportunity for them to

243
00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.760
fix that, which is really
cool. So it sounds like

244
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.060
we are not going to
see banner ads in glimpse,

245
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.090
and we're not going to
see popups that require email

246
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:11.310
addresses that get harvested in
Columbia. No, yeah. That was

247
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.240
something we're very concerned about
as well. And it's amazing

248
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.520
how much back and forth
we did on some of

249
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.370
this in, in a good
way, you know, testing boundaries

250
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.320
and saying, well, what if
this happened? And what if

251
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.030
that happened? And at the
end of the day, it

252
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.540
was like, well, if we,
if we contain a remain

253
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.290
control of the licensing and
we retain control of who

254
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.590
has committed access, you know,
if someone even tried to

255
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.600
do that, whether it's red
gate or someone from the

256
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.110
community, it's like, well, we
pull your access and we

257
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.990
undo what you did. And
let's say, Nick and I

258
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.330
went to the dark side,
we've already said to all

259
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.740
of our major contributors, look,
we charge you with, if

260
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.920
something bad happens or there's
something happening that you don't

261
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.580
like, you know, please take
it in the right direction

262
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.490
for the community That is
different than reflector and the

263
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.740
reflector situation. There was no
opportunity for somebody to take

264
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.090
the code and quote unquote
rescue it. Yes. And so,

265
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:09.090
you know, that's where we
see a big difference in

266
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.760
what's going on and a
huge opportunity for the community.

267
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.730
And I think this is
kind of a first, as

268
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.330
far as I can see
for the.net community. And part

269
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
of what makes me really
excited is that you can

270
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.650
have a passion project that
is open source and, you

271
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:29.850
know, one day, you know,
it could lead to something.

272
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.850
And back when we during
open source first, that was

273
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.540
never a consideration, but it's
actually starting to happen, But,

274
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.870
but not every open source
project is big enough or

275
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.960
interesting enough or compelling enough
for, for someone to say,

276
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.920
I'll be your benefactor much
less, you know, two benefactors,

277
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.030
you know, what is it,
what's in it for them

278
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:56.050
other than rebuilding Goodwill? Well,
I mean, they're, they're not

279
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.600
going to disillusion anybody. And
they've been very honest about

280
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.480
this and it was part
of the red gate blog

281
00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.000
post on, on their blog,
because one of the great

282
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.150
things about clamps is from
day one, we've always had

283
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.660
an extensibility model. The ability
to add tabs via new

284
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.140
get, has always been there.
And so, you know, they

285
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.840
see a future in which
they could potentially take some

286
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.290
of their existing technologies and
start to build, pay for

287
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.030
plugins on top of glimpse.
So imagine something like the

288
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.690
power of ants, performance profiler,
which gets way deeper into

289
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.830
the dot and to.net than
we do. Or we can

290
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.510
imagine that technology surfacing itself
in glimpse for every request

291
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.220
or things like that. I
mean, your mind can kind

292
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.170
of run wild. Yeah. Oh
no, that totally makes sense.

293
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:46.450
Actually, that reminds me of
image, resizing imagery, sizer guy.

294
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:52.570
Do you remember that image
resizer.net is this amazing tool

295
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.170
that lets you, you know,
resize images correctly, but what

296
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.180
he does is he gives
you the free open source

297
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.010
version. And then if you
want like it to work

298
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.100
in Azure, it's like 99
bucks or something. So that's

299
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.620
actually good. So that means
that there is a truly

300
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.920
open, full opensource version of
glimpse. I would say for

301
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.670
version, the glimpse is period,
full stop, open source and

302
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.630
free. And then if you
go and buy red gate

303
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.660
products and are also using
glimpse, then glimpse lights up

304
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.890
with profiler stuff or reflect
your stuff or, you know,

305
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.080
whatever, whatever they feel like
doing, but it's all done

306
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.950
via plugins. You got it
now. Okay. And the great

307
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.350
thing is, is it's not
just red gate limited to

308
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.950
that surface area either. So
if some other company wanted

309
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.130
to create their great technology
and put it on top

310
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.020
of the glimpse platform and
deliver it just via that

311
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.540
mechanism, it's available for them
to do it as well.

312
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.990
Okay. Okay, cool. So let's
talk tech then, because I

313
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.540
know that a lot of
work has been put into

314
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.700
extensibility specifically, and you've got
glimpse a 1.0 CTP. Does

315
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.400
that mean it's like a
beta of one point, Oh

316
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.990
Yeah. It is like a
C like a beta. We,

317
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.500
we borrowed the Microsoft terminology
there. So it's a community

318
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.480
technology preview. No problem. It's
like, Hey, you, you probably

319
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.490
invented that term. I would
like to know when glimpse

320
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.840
1.0, CTP one September refresh
comes out because that's, Well,

321
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.480
we're working on magic unicorns
right now. So when that's

322
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.670
done. Okay. So this release
is focused primarily at the

323
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.590
30 or so people who
have built plugins on top

324
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.350
of glimpse already, the glimpse
that's that's live, which is

325
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.160
version zero dot eight seven,
because we've got a lot

326
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.970
of feedback from the community
and from Microsoft directly that

327
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.370
they would like to see
support for things like self

328
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.990
hosted web API, or for
web frameworks that run on

329
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.100
a stack like Owen. And
so what we've done is

330
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.230
we've completely rearchitected glimpse to
no longer have a dependency

331
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.750
on system dot web and
thus no longer have a

332
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.660
dependency on IIS because of
that, there have been some

333
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.410
interface changes, which means that
plugin authors to support glimpse

334
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.020
one dot Oh, moving forward,
they're going to have to

335
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.780
make some slight changes to
their plugins. So the CTP

336
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.480
release is not really aimed
at end users. It's aimed

337
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.910
at authors who are interested
in building on top of

338
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.680
the platform so they can
get their hands on the

339
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.460
interfaces, provide us feedback and
have time to do the

340
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.260
port before we make a
final release. Okay. So things

341
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.390
that I would think that
I would want in glimpse

342
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.030
would be like a like
page inspector, which I think

343
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:29.390
is really cool on the
Microsoft side. Have you talked

344
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.990
to those guys at all?
Yeah. Well, we have actually

345
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:38.060
talked to those guys and
they're actually wanting to extend

346
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.170
the, provide a model that
they have there to surface

347
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.080
the cool data that they're
doing a lot of hard

348
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.980
work to actually gather. And
it would mean that instead

349
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.370
of just being restricted to
page inspector inside of visual

350
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:56.570
studio, you could use any
browser on your development machine

351
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.840
to get access to that
data. And, you know, it

352
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.830
potentially depending on how, what
the implementation is like any

353
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.710
server. So you could be
running in your UAT environment

354
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.100
and hover your mouse around
the screen and actually see

355
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.320
what partial renders, you know,
rendered what content. And that's

356
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.750
pretty cool. And you just,
you said a minute ago,

357
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.810
I think it was Nick
about Owen and people who

358
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.480
are listening may not know
what that means. Oh, w

359
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.780
I N open web interface
for.net. And you talk a

360
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.180
little bit about that and
why people kind of on

361
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.750
the cutting edge are excited
about it. Sure. What Owen

362
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.110
does is it's, it's very
similar to kind of rack

363
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.080
on the Ruby side from
my understanding. I'm not an

364
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.140
expert in it by any
means, but essentially it is

365
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.700
a, yet another layer of
indirection in between the web

366
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.640
development framework that you choose
to use, whether that be

367
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.440
something like MVC or web
forms or, you know, castle

368
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.280
mano or whatever it is
and the underlying host, so

369
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.830
that hosts might be IIS,
or it might be something

370
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.440
a little bit lower level,
like a service that you

371
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:09.440
might write yourself, particularly useful
and restful type scenarios, or

372
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.530
there's a bunch of open
source implementations being written. But

373
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.270
what that allows you to
do is kind of own

374
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.100
a little bit more of
the stack and make the

375
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.820
stack more portable, as long
as we're talking about IRL

376
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.060
and web, everything that writes
to Owen is kind of,

377
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.660
kind of even across the
board. Okay. So let me

378
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.090
see if I got this
right, because I want to

379
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.440
see my paraphrase and you
tell me if I get

380
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.880
it correctly. So things like,
like WCF in the past

381
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.400
had a thing called self
hosting where you could, or

382
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.640
service activator, where you could
have a, an HTTP service

383
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.610
or a TCP service fired
up in a console app

384
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.160
or in a windows service.
And you would bypass IIS

385
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.350
entirely right now, asp.net and
IIS kind of are, are

386
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.330
married. They're kind of signed
me. I wouldn't say married.

387
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.120
They're more Siamese twins with
a little fabric of, of,

388
00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:00.100
of, of a attachment there.
And Owen, you described it

389
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.670
as yet another layer of
indirection, but it probably could

390
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.380
also be described as a
way to decouple something like

391
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.740
asp.net from any web server.
So then theoretically, I could

392
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.350
fire up asp.net in a
console app or in a

393
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.740
service or in, on Apache
even I suppose, is that,

394
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.330
is that a fair characterization?
Exactly. That's my understanding. And

395
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.840
what's really interesting about that
is because there's a common

396
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.600
way to right down to
kind of the networking stack

397
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.850
and back up to the
web app, there's a concept

398
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.120
called middleware that lives in
Owen where something like glimpse

399
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:38.220
could plug in and work
almost universally across web development,

400
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.430
frameworks and web servers or,
or your own server, as

401
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.830
you said, in the console
application. And that's, that's pretty

402
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.850
exciting to us in a
future where Owen is utilized

403
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.670
more often we could see
sequence kind of fitting in

404
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.840
there really nicely. Okay. Okay,
cool. And then web API

405
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.250
is out now and it's
kind of part of the

406
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.100
larger one asp.net. Are you
guys on board with that

407
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.760
whole concept? Yeah. So we've
actually had discussions with web

408
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.880
API guys and, you know,
we, we pretty much know

409
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.430
where we need to hook
in, and it's just a

410
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.310
matter of time trying to
find the time to do

411
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.390
that. You know, back when
we released it open source

412
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.610
first, you would have thought
it was a pretty safe

413
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.030
assumption to take dependencies on
system dot web. And I

414
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.420
S but, and, and a
lot of that drove the

415
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.230
architecture and with, you know,
web API is coming out

416
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.900
and saying, Hey, look, we,
we want to run self

417
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.660
hosted as well. It was
like, Oh no, what did

418
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.490
we do? And a lot
of people were, you know,

419
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.520
questioning the sanity of having
to go back and do

420
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.940
a rearchitecting or stuff, something
like that. But for us,

421
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.540
you know, we felt that
Owen was really important, self

422
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.540
hosted web APIs and stuff
like that. You know, are

423
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.400
they a big going to
be a big part of

424
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.120
our future and hence the
work we needed to do

425
00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.920
so now that we've almost
finished this CTP work that

426
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.310
we've, that we've been doing
either Nick or I, or

427
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.240
someone from the community or
whatever else can now develop

428
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.900
the web API plugins and
know they look the exact

429
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.420
same work that I do
is going to work. Whether,

430
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.380
you know, you're hosting NIS
or, you know, self hosted,

431
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.790
which was really important. One
of my favorite things on

432
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.480
windows is, is the mini
profiler that Sam saffron and

433
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.140
the guys at stack overflow
did. I'm a huge fan

434
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.560
of that. And it's got
plugins for entity framework and

435
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.060
linked to sequel and, and
WCF most recently, but it's

436
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.660
not something that he's working
on full time. He's, he's

437
00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.710
updating it here and there.
And he's put some, some

438
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.160
news.net features in about three
months ago. But most recently

439
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.820
he's been adding in Ruby.
So I've got two questions.

440
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.890
One, what is your thinking
about, about a live production

441
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.010
time profiler, like mini profiler
that would talk to entity

442
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.980
framework or, or any kind
of SQL backend? That's the

443
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.640
question one, and noticing here
that Sam has checked in

444
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.430
Ruby support from many profiler
two days ago. How do

445
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.870
you see glimpse dovetailing with
him and also with Ruby

446
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:19.030
in general? Okay. So let's,
we'll start with, with one,

447
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:26.200
because it usually comes from
four too. So we, we

448
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.270
think that production type support
or profiling Allah mini profiler

449
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.590
is a very common usage
scenario. And one that we

450
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.580
actually support doing, of course,
we've had a beta tag

451
00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.340
on glimpse since since day
one that will be coming

452
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.890
off very soon. And then
we'll be looking to add

453
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:48.580
more production support. Of course,
as soon as you start

454
00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.610
profiling something, you, you begin
to add overhead into your

455
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.570
requests. So that's something that
we'll caution developers to be

456
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.440
careful about, but depending on
the scenario, one or two

457
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.800
milliseconds added onto every request
is probably not that big

458
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.780
of a deal. And that's
the kind of order of

459
00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.410
magnitude of delay that we're
talking about by adding on

460
00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:12.040
a simple, simple profiling. So
I think that kind of

461
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.970
covers off number one there.
And then for number two,

462
00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.010
it's interesting that you mentioned
Ruby support. One of the

463
00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:19.960
things that Anthony and I
have always worked on from

464
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.830
day one is a really
clean separation between the client

465
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.820
and the server. Everybody laughs
because glimpse looks so much

466
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.140
like Firebug originally glimpse was
supposed to be a Firefox

467
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.920
extension and a Chrome extension
and an extension. And it

468
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.020
was really out of sheer
laziness because none of us

469
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.630
wanted to learn how to
do that, develop those development

470
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.390
models that we decided to
go with Java script and

471
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.250
it worked everywhere and it
worked great. And we were

472
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.130
like, Hey, this, this is
better. But because we always

473
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.990
knew we were going to
have separate clients, the server

474
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.680
and the client are very,
very decoupled from each other.

475
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.500
So that means that now
we kind of have a

476
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.380
universal client, we need to
start looking at other servers.

477
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.930
And so if you actually
look at our GitHub page,

478
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.790
we have people who have
already donated or contributed a

479
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.000
PHP implementations of glimpse. Somebody
is working on a rack

480
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.220
version and somebody who's also
working on the equivalent of

481
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.160
rack and the Python world.
So we're looking at kind

482
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.280
of branching out into those
other areas, Anthony, and are

483
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.100
not experts in any of
those other technologies. Although we

484
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.710
may have to become a
then as we move forward.

485
00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.550
But the w a world
where glimpse is kind of

486
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.670
universal across web development is
something that we would love

487
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.770
to see happen. We just
need to get all the

488
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:36.640
right pieces in place. All
right. That's cool. Do you

489
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.090
think that you're going to
always prefer.net or are you

490
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.740
guys going to work completely
independent? Okay. You're going to

491
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.690
give, if, if let's say
this blows up in the

492
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.820
PHP world or whatever, are
you going to respect those

493
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.920
guys the same? Yeah. I
think at the moment, the

494
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.930
client of glimpse is, is
in the.net client, but we've

495
00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:01.490
talked about potentially pulling it
into its own repository and

496
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.480
moving on from there. Then
that means from a good

497
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.570
point of view, it has
this concept of like sub

498
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:14.600
repositories, which in like a
visual studio TFS world would

499
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.140
mean that it's almost like
you can have a TFS

500
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:23.030
project referencing another TFS project
and the code to be

501
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:26.360
included. And so for our
client, that makes a lot

502
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.740
of sense. And because it
means that any other service

503
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:36.260
side framework can just reference
this sub repository and they'll

504
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.830
get the lightest code as
they go along. And, you

505
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.470
know, in terms of we'll
have one have favoritism over

506
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.800
the other, you know, Nick
and I, you know, dot

507
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.620
net guys through and through,
as he said, we'll probably

508
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.960
starting to get our hands
dirty in some of the

509
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.160
other worlds, but, you know,
it's something that, you know,

510
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.890
our passions are in at
the moment. And, you know,

511
00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:00.890
we're certainly not gonna let
it go by the wayside.

512
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:06.500
There's too many interesting things
happening in this space, not

513
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.330
to pay attention to.net. You
know, like for instance, a

514
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.170
job at plugin, you know,
has always made my mind

515
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.210
tick, you know, how cool
would it be to actually

516
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.840
show what's actually happening between
the connection to the cloud

517
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.210
from the client to the
server and, you know, the

518
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.550
various groups that are around
and all sorts of different

519
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.310
things. So, you know, a
lot of really interesting stuff's

520
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.060
happening in this space here
and now. Okay. Last question.

521
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.390
Are there any technical things
that you're bumping up against,

522
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.760
or you think that just
will never be solvable? Is

523
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.220
there something that you really
wish you could have done

524
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.000
and it's just not going
to happen? You know, we've,

525
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.290
we have actually had really
good access into the asp.net

526
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:52.190
team to get help with
all kinds of various things.

527
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.490
We run into a bit
of problems with writing to

528
00:28:55.490 --> 00:29:01.550
the response stream, particularly because
the filters mechanism built into

529
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:06.830
asp.net feels a little, it's
kind of a King of

530
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.720
the Hill, right? Like one
guy will run to the

531
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.430
top and knock the other
guy off if they're not

532
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.550
playing nicely. And so we
run into problems where we're

533
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:18.710
mixing with other open source
or closed source extensions to

534
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.840
asp.net, and that will kind
of mess things up. And

535
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.480
we're constantly kind of dancing
around that. We're also trying

536
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.350
to get deeper and deeper
into the view engines. And

537
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.090
so that's kind of a
little bit of a slow

538
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.730
and arduous process, but we've
been, we've been working with

539
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.470
some of the guys on
those teams to see what

540
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.580
access we can and can't
get, Has the open sourcing

541
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.040
of the web stack helped
at all. I mean, it's

542
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.580
good that you keep saying,
we talked to those guys

543
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.840
and were able to get
a hold of these guys

544
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.010
and gals, but have you
ever had, have you ever

545
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.810
had to just not even
call anybody because all the

546
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.080
sources just out there, Oh,
all the time. And that's

547
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.570
always been true even before
the big open source announcement,

548
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.290
because primarily our focus has
been on NBC. We do

549
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.660
support web forms, but to
be honest with you, we

550
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.760
could do a much better
job there. And that's something

551
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.430
that we're looking to improve,
but NBC has been open

552
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.670
sourced since since day one
for at least its bumps

553
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.070
has been around. So we've
always kind of had access

554
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.860
to the source code. So
I think it's great that

555
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.230
that development has happened. And
I think that great things

556
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.570
are happening in the Danette
community for open source at

557
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.090
Microsoft, at red gate. I
want to see it happening

558
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.760
at other places as well,
but that, that didn't really

559
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.030
change us because of our
focus. Okay. One thing that

560
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.670
does come to mind, however,
on that front is the

561
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:34.260
open sourcing of MVC for
instance means that if there

562
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.840
is somewhere in the pipeline
that would like to be

563
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.940
able to hook in, you
know, if we can have

564
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.370
a discussion with the guys
and say, Hey, look, this

565
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.310
is our thoughts around what
we could do differently to

566
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.250
be able to hook in
easily more easily for us,

567
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.070
so many profile or whoever
else. And they go, yeah,

568
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.470
that sounds like a cool
idea. We can actually do

569
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.770
that development and, you know,
submit the code for that.

570
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.010
And that may not be
a Microsoft priority, but it's

571
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.870
a priority for us. And
as long as everyone's on

572
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.390
the same page, you know,
it's code that we can

573
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.780
commit. So, you know, that,
that does make me really

574
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.350
excited about what's what's happened
at the moment. All right.

575
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.590
Very cool. So people can
still go and get glimpse

576
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:20.700
and hear about glimpse@getglimpse.com and
you've got new good packages

577
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.310
and you've got great documentation
and you've got an active

578
00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.540
Google groups since you've got
benefactors. I don't suppose you

579
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.100
have a tip jar, so
we really don't need to

580
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.770
help you there anymore. Do
we? No, you don't what

581
00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.410
we're doing. All right. All
right. That's great. Well, congratulations

582
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.600
guys. And thanks for, let
me know what was going

583
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.920
on. I was a little
worried about you there for

584
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.740
a minute. Thanks for having
a son. Scott, thank you

585
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:45.120
for caring, Scott. This has
been another episode of Hansel

586
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.040
minutes and we'll see you
again next week.
