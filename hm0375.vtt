Scott talks with Paul bets

8
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.950
and Justin spar summer about
the culture of GitHub. Hi,

9
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.960
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

10
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.720
minutes. I'm here in San
Francisco and get hub world

11
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.150
headquarters, world headquarters until you
move in a couple of

12
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.970
days, I guess I'm, I'm
here with Paul debts and

13
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.780
Justin spar, summers, how are
you not bad? I wanted

14
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.280
to talk to you guys
about culture. Cause one of

15
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.260
the things that I think
is really interesting about GitHub

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.410
is actually kind of two
things. One more people are

17
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.340
remote than are in this
office, which is weird, especially

18
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.680
given that Yahoo is doing
what Yahoo is doing around

19
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.230
remote workers, but also you
guys are in, I'm going

20
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.420
to say sloppy, but sloppy
is not the word you

21
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.270
lose. You're relaxed about what
people are working on. Like

22
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.280
there's a focus and there's
a laser focus on the,

23
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.200
on the mission. But at
the same time, if someone

24
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.420
really has a passion about
something, they think will make

25
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.240
the business better, you don't
prevent them from doing that.

26
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.210
So let's, let's start with
that. You have like all

27
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.390
these pieces of software inside,
you talked about like chatbots

28
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.490
and DJs and things that
I would think have nothing

29
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.920
to do with the business.
How do you guys get

30
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.710
to work on stuff like
that? Yeah. I think that,

31
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.670
I think who said this
Michael cozy RSK said it

32
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.910
was like organized chaos at
get hub. That's about right.

33
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.880
But it works though. And
that's the reason that's interesting.

34
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.110
You see what I'm saying?
Like if it, if it,

35
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.860
if it was stupid, if
it was sloppy, it wouldn't

36
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.350
be good. It would be
a failed startup. Yeah, that's

37
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.050
true. I think that it,
you know, a lot of

38
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.620
our developers talk about different,
different reasons why this method

39
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.590
works and it's like, even
though it's very surprising, I

40
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.040
think the part of it
is that we work on

41
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.100
tools that we use to
build the thing we're building.

42
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.020
And so we immediately know
what's bad about it and

43
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.790
what's good about it. And
we're all very focused on

44
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.190
kind of bringing this mission
of enabling open source and

45
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.050
doing something awesome to, to
the world. And so like

46
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.120
when you're all focused on
kind of the vision of

47
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.670
what you're building, then, then
this works, right. It doesn't

48
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.200
work. If, if 10 people
have 10 ideas on what,

49
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.670
what the company's doing as
a whole. Right. And that's

50
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.560
really a challenge. Like, especially
as you get bigger, like

51
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.860
it, when it was, you
know, 30 people, this was

52
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.170
really easy, you know, your
brains are kind of attached

53
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.900
to each other at that
size, but when you get

54
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.510
bigger, that's when it gets
more challenging. And so we

55
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.080
definitely, we build software to
make this easier for us,

56
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.700
for sure. And I think
with, with respect to some

57
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.030
of the projects you mentioned
specifically, like in particular Cuba,

58
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.730
like our chat client and
stuff like that, a lot

59
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.730
of them actually end up
functioning for our business rather

60
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.860
than just kind of being
hobby projects. Like I think

61
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.010
actually Hubert's an excellent example
because it started off as

62
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.190
just kind of like, you
know, fooling around, getting memes

63
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.020
into chat and stuff like
that. But now it's actually

64
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.120
used by our ops team,
for instance. Well, if you

65
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.120
don't mind, maybe the audience
probably isn't familiar with Hubert

66
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.090
in this intelligent agent that
you've created, maybe back up

67
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.730
a little bit and start
with you all in a

68
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.820
chat room and then What
happened. So, so we're in

69
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.910
a campfire chat room basically.
And Hubert is a, a

70
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.830
node base robot that is
in every chat room and

71
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.760
responds to commands arbitrary commands.
And we have one repo

72
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.060
where everyone in the company
can basically, it's kind of

73
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.880
funny, but commit to master
basically and add new scripts

74
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.400
or modify scripts to do
interesting things. And so a

75
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.380
lot of times, you know,
it's just for fun, it's

76
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.010
again like fooling around doing
memes and stuff like that.

77
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.620
But then, then it started
getting more interesting. It's like,

78
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.200
well, what if we hooked
up, you know, information about

79
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.230
our file server load into
chat and that all that

80
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.780
starting to be done through
Cuba. So you're saying like,

81
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.300
if some in originally someone's
in there and they say

82
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.360
some keyword, Hugh bot jumps
in and puts an animated

83
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.580
GIF of that. Me. Yeah,
Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's like,

84
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.600
<inaudible> do whatever or slash
do whatever. And so yeah,

85
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.150
we have like a huge
roster of, of builtin scripts

86
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.910
that are mostly means, but
then there's, there's more and

87
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.850
more serious stuff too. And
so I think, I think

88
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.600
it's interesting because the ops
specific stuff, for instance, one

89
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.600
to have developed without it
being a tool for fun

90
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.880
first, Right. If you said
everyone will go into the

91
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.440
chat room and here are
the 12 commands that it

92
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.010
understands, right? Yeah. Like that
it would have never evolved

93
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.990
as organically as it has
now. And now it's like

94
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.840
a hugely valuable part of
our culture. Like when, when

95
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.030
he was not present in
the chat, like we literally

96
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.090
don't know what to do
sometimes it's yeah. It becomes

97
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.930
a mayhem. What are some
functional things that you bought

98
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.240
done? So one thing he
does is he allows you

99
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.510
to deploy a branch and
this applies for many projects.

100
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.370
It applies for github.com as
well as some of our

101
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.160
internal tools. And I get
up for windows, basically you

102
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.500
can tell he's about to
deploy a branch to production

103
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.170
or to staging or whatever
the case may be. And

104
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.050
he, he, it delegates out
to another service that we

105
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.950
have, but Cuba is the
arbiter responsible for starting that

106
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.520
process that kicks it off.
Yeah. Yeah. Actually we use

107
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.650
Hubert to control all of
our virtual machine infrastructure. So

108
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.710
I can use Hubert to
create a virtual machine and

109
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.710
then everything could get, I
was automated. We go through

110
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.810
this, we use a, a
library application called puppet to

111
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.960
automate creating virtual machines. So
when I create a virtual

112
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.940
machine is not a blank
one, it has a role

113
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.240
in its puppet to be
a new file server or

114
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.970
a new front end. And
so it will immediately get

115
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.040
created in Hubert will tell
me the details of it.

116
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.300
And the interesting thing about
doing things in that way

117
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.790
is that you're learning from
others implicitly in the sense

118
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.570
that like, like if we
built that into a dashboard,

119
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.840
nobody else would see how,
you know, Jesse Newland figured

120
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.600
out our, one of our
main ops guys figured out,

121
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.700
you know, the solution to
some bug, but because he

122
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.430
did all this stuff in
chat and all the graphs

123
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.230
he looked at to determine
what was wrong and all

124
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.300
this stuff we're in the
chat while he was talking

125
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.130
about it, it means I
can go back and see

126
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.660
like, Oh, that's how he
did this and that, you

127
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.780
know, that's how he checked
for server load. So if

128
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.340
you went in and made
a virtual machine now to

129
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.850
test some feature, they would
see it, they would see

130
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.000
you doing it. Yep. Is
it one big, giant chaotic

131
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.550
chat room? Well, so there's
a, there's a lot of

132
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.060
different chat rooms. I think
there were, we have a

133
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.140
huge amount. Like it's gotta
be like at least 50,

134
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.970
but it isn't by having
a lot of chat rooms

135
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.420
that dilute the kind of
sense of community a little

136
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.520
bit, because they're organized by
topic though. So if I'm

137
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.840
doing ops stuff, I'm going
to be in the, I'm

138
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.100
going to try to do
it in the ops room.

139
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.920
And so other ops people
will be able to help

140
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.290
me out. Or if I'm
doing stuff related to, you

141
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.020
know, Mac things, I'm going
to be in the room.

142
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.450
Right. And so, so hopefully
that'll be really, it tends

143
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.190
to scope itself pretty well,
at least at our size.

144
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.850
There's certainly an aspect where
you, do you end up

145
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.770
with more of a community
centered around your team? I

146
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.050
think so like, like what
Paul is mentioning, like the

147
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.560
Mac room, it's not just
Mac work-related stuff. Like it's

148
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.580
also kind of a community
within the Mac folks, but

149
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.280
then there's also kind of
general purpose chat rooms that

150
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.070
are just for the company
wide sense of community, like

151
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.340
the danger room, which is
basically the room of memes

152
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.540
and talking about whatever. And
so it's useful for the

153
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.660
separation of like, you know,
people working on different projects

154
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.730
that don't necessarily have any
overlap. It's valuable that they

155
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.890
can go into one room
and have all the related

156
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.590
work stuff there. But then
also you still get the

157
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.630
opportunity to communicate with other
people in the company, just

158
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.420
socially. Do you guys use
email anymore or is there

159
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.900
literally like virtually no email
flying around? We use, We

160
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.410
use email com sort of
like internal blogging almost. So

161
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.320
like if, if we're planning
a big ship, for instance,

162
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.780
like a new feature, an
email will be sent out

163
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.610
to the half's mailing list,
which is kind of like

164
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.620
things that are happening at
get hub from different teams

165
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.710
that you may not be
aware of otherwise. But yeah,

166
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.490
it's really not, it's not
a discussion tool like it

167
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.370
is at most companies. I'd
like to understand if there,

168
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.250
if there is any dysfunction
here and what it is,

169
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.290
I'll give you an example
of some dysfunction at Microsoft

170
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.910
people use outlook, which is
our male client as chat.

171
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.570
And by that, I mean
that I could step away

172
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.240
from my desk for five
minutes, come back. And now

173
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.950
the thread is like nested
forked and 10 deep. And

174
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.160
it's like one line at
a time and maybe it's

175
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.340
age, maybe it's culture. But
my perspective is pick up

176
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.310
the darn phone at some
point, like just pick up

177
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.400
the phone or walk to
that person's cube. But by

178
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.530
doing that, it makes the,
the psychic weight of those

179
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.500
emails is really pressing on
your head. Well, it's interesting

180
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.440
specifically with regard to that,
because we actually kind of

181
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.300
take the opposite approach, which
is like, everything should be

182
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.790
logged. Like you should be
able to go back into

183
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.400
the past and see what
happened. But with regard to

184
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.950
your original question about, Let
me, sorry, fork off of

185
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.800
that for a second, because
everything should be logged is

186
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.440
great. But when you send
an email, now you're putting

187
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.530
a copy in everyone else's
play in, everyone else's play.

188
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.240
And then that it's sitting
there until they choose to

189
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.940
either archive it or, or
leave it in their inbox,

190
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.400
which is different from logging
stuff. Well, yeah, that's certainly

191
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.340
true. Like we, we've, that's
one of the reasons why

192
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.980
we focus on campfire chat,
where it's just like persistent

193
00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.780
chat logs that you can
browse through at your discretion

194
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.980
or a repository issues and
things like that, where it's,

195
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.990
if you're watching the repository,
you do kind of get

196
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:11.090
the notifications list, but it's
not as forceful as email.

197
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.760
This would be a good
word to describe it. Yeah.

198
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.390
But Is there dysfunction, like,
does it just perfectly work?

199
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.490
Is this magical? Should we
all who are listening stopped

200
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.320
doing so much email and
start spending more time in

201
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.520
a persistent chat room? I
mean, I think that that

202
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.510
no matter what, you have
the problem of information overload.

203
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.870
So like it get hub.
I use the notifications a

204
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.320
lot, like get up slash
notifications, but I still have,

205
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.450
you know, a ton of
information flowing through there. And

206
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.660
like, you know, you can,
you can build any tool

207
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.340
is going to have that
problem, right. As soon as

208
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.620
it, as soon as your
projects get big enough, if

209
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.570
you're paying attention to enough
stuff, it's hard to keep

210
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.650
up with. And so I
think that the bigger problem

211
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.900
we work on at GitHub
is trying not to miss

212
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.660
stuff. And so our notifications
are actually pretty good at

213
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.080
that because they're, they're pushing
notifications and you can use

214
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.950
the iPhone or Android app.
You can see a list

215
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.770
of them. They don't go
away so easily. Right. It's

216
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.980
not like they're ephemeral words,
Push notifications, you just push

217
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.300
them away and they're gone.
Right. And so that helps

218
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.800
a lot. And so it
means that you can kind

219
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.570
of use chat in a
different way than you normally

220
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.990
would. You would like if,
if somebody is not around

221
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.430
and I need to ask
them a question, I just

222
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.740
asked them a question and
then move on. Right. And

223
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.010
eventually they'll wake up and
I'll, you know, be asleep

224
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.810
or if they're, you know,
in a way different time

225
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.360
zone and they'll answer the
question, I might not even

226
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.420
be there. Right. So even
though that scrolled back, that's

227
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.070
going to show up, are
you talking about your, your,

228
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.410
your hear about chatroom or
asking the question on GitHub

229
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.320
itself in the Heba chat
room and how will, how

230
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.480
will they know they were
mentioned? And then that mentioned

231
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.310
then gets pulled out off
to the side as a

232
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.040
notification. Yup. And when they
click the notification, let's see

233
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.200
the chat in context. They
just, you don't see just

234
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.260
the line, you see The
section of what their people

235
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.170
were Talking about and how
much of this is still

236
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.940
campfire and how much of
this is some kind of

237
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.480
evil campfire with a goatee
that you've made. It's hard

238
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.620
to say, it's really like,
it's pretty. So we added,

239
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.410
we added a search. We,
we index every message being

240
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.150
sent into elastic search. And
so a lot of the

241
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.670
superpowers that we have in
chat are, are based on

242
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.510
that. So it's not really
campfire search anymore. Campfires API

243
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.980
APIs is leaves a lot
to be desired, to put

244
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.630
it mildly. And so we
definitely built a lot of

245
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.450
stuff like, like campfire doesn't
have push notifications that doesn't

246
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.230
have any, so you're just
monkey patched, all that stuff

247
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.360
here. So we either added
services that have like, basically

248
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.670
are watching every message and
the recording them and then

249
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.370
doing stuff based on them
or, or yeah. Doing all

250
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.320
kinds of crazy stuff. Doesn't
that seem like a product

251
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.540
somebody out of produce. I
mean, like, you know, it's

252
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.260
so funny that these things
go, these utilities get built.

253
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.850
Like you have Cuba, like
I can go get Huba

254
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.400
right. It's up on GitHub.
But when you have your,

255
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.240
your, your campfire plus plus
plus that's your own thing.

256
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.600
Right. I can't go and
get that. It's, it's certainly

257
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.210
true. One of the things
that we work on all

258
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.930
the time is we have
so many internal tools that

259
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.410
are not really in a
state to be released. Like

260
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.170
even just the tool that
gives you the notifications that

261
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.260
Paul was mentioning, like the
team application, we call it,

262
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.730
it's, it's hugely useful for
our organization, but it's not

263
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.830
really in a state where
we're, we would be ready

264
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.850
to release it as a
product because it's, we're still

265
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.010
in that stage where for
everything like this, we're still

266
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.550
exploring what exactly are the
useful pieces to us, like

267
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.010
what we would do or
what the alternatives would be

268
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.320
without it, what more would
need to be there for

269
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.660
other people to find it
useful. The way we work

270
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.960
at GitHub is so many
interconnected things that it's often

271
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.020
hard to extract a specific
piece and make that useful

272
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.060
to other people without having
the rest of it too.

273
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.270
My next question, that I
think that on the windows

274
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.910
side, on the windows slash
Microsoft side, we tend to

275
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.030
want to centralize things, you
know, like I've got this

276
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.070
utility and this utility and
this Chilean a windows person

277
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.930
will look at that and
say, ah, I will make

278
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.510
the integrated thing for that.
And I shall call it

279
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.500
SharePoint. And then it will
be one great, wonderful thing

280
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.500
while I think that the
Mac Unix and I put

281
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.790
messy Mac Unix, because there's
like the Mac culture that

282
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.400
appreciates the aesthetic of Mac,
the, the, like I like

283
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.360
PNGs. And then there's the,
I like command line person

284
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.870
and they happen to be
similar people. They want to

285
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.290
break the thing apart into
little reusable pieces. So I'm

286
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.810
hearing you say that get
hub is a bunch of

287
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.150
little readers will pieces that
like to talk to each

288
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.300
other. Oh yeah, absolutely. I
help the organization. Yeah. Unreservedly.

289
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.900
The problem of course, with
that is that it's hard

290
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.630
to tell whether the piece
itself is useful or the

291
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.300
sum total of them is
useful. And it's hard to

292
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.070
open things up in pieces
like that. If you don't

293
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.260
really know the answer to
that question, It also seems

294
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.020
a little overwhelming. Every time
I talk to Paul or

295
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.200
Phil hack or people I
know at get hub, I

296
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.050
get this sense of like
there's shorthand and there's acronyms

297
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.630
and there's codes. And they're
short codes. It's like said

298
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.170
an arc as an organization,
like, you know, welcome to

299
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.930
Oregon now learn regular expressions.
And that's just seems very

300
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.810
difficult. Like how do you
onboard people, especially remote people

301
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.450
who are just overwhelmed by
the, the toolkit that you

302
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.250
have. So I think one,
I'm actually not in the

303
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.100
San Francisco office. So I
might not know the answer

304
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.240
to the question, the question
to where are you? So

305
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.150
I'm in Seattle. Yeah. I'm
one of those more than

306
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.240
half of the Remote people.
Okay. You're here now though.

307
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.110
Cause I can see you.
Yeah. But so one way

308
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.120
we solve this is I
believe we have a dedicated

309
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.360
person who onboards people, which
helps, like they just walk

310
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.780
people through. That's literally a
full time responsibility. That's a

311
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.870
really cool idea. Yeah. And
then the other part is,

312
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.050
I mean, it is overwhelming.
There's definitely a fire hose.

313
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.360
Like everyone's first week is
just like mayhem, like all

314
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:49.210
this information. Yeah, exactly. But
then there are specific guides

315
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.410
constructed for new people. There's
all this like history in

316
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.730
each project like development process.
I mean, archive chats, archive

317
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.540
talks, that sort of thing
that are specifically meant to

318
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.020
improve this problem because it's
not just a, it's not

319
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.550
just when you're new to
the company. It can also

320
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.590
be when you're new to
the team, you may not

321
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.720
understand everything that's going on
and you may need to

322
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.150
get up to speed on
that specific team's context. Yeah.

323
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.180
Yeah, exactly. So even once
people are hired, we still

324
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.340
have that problem when they're
moving between teams. And so

325
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.470
we're actively trying to solve
that and in solving that

326
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.410
it helps with new company
hires as well. And as

327
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.450
a piece of context for
the listener, if I am

328
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.610
correct, you work on GitHub
for windows and you work

329
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.400
on get hub format. Correct.
So good that we've got

330
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.470
the, both of you here.
Did you have a thought

331
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.790
about that? Yeah. I mean
like onboarding is definitely something

332
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.610
we put a lot of
effort into. We fly these

333
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.620
days. We have everyone come
down for at least a

334
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.130
week when they start on
their first day. So they

335
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.020
get a chance to meet
people in person and kind

336
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.700
of move a little faster
than if they were trying

337
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.710
to do everything remote. Like
I started, I get up

338
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.720
very early. Like my first
day get up was me

339
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.660
sitting on my couch till
like 2:00 PM when they like

340
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.890
created the cramp campfire credentials
for me. So I was

341
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.510
like, Hey guys, that I
really started this company. My

342
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.740
mine not ideal. Then it
was very bad. We didn't

343
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.120
know we were doing back
then, but now we're much

344
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.700
better. So yeah. I mean,
we, we definitely have a

345
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.590
much, it's not formalized, but
you definitely have a lot

346
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.360
of, you have a list
of stuff you should do

347
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.030
the first day. And we
always like make sure that

348
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.090
every new employee has kind
of like, not a mentor,

349
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.390
but like somebody to like
ask questions like any, you

350
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.500
know, somebody that they are
specifically assigned to, like they

351
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.390
can go to this person
and that person won't laugh

352
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.300
at them when they ask
a stupid question. And the

353
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.830
other person is, is kind
of on the hook to

354
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.290
make sure that this, this
new hire does well or

355
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.230
not does well, but like
does, you know, knows what

356
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.430
they're doing. Doesn't feel lost,
stuff like that. So interesting.

357
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.000
So we've talked about tools
and toolkits and, and how

358
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.150
you, and you're enabling people
to build these though. Like

359
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.670
if you had an idea
for the great new tool

360
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.320
and you want to, I'm
going to go build tool,

361
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.040
how do you work that
into your, your existing workload

362
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.180
and how do you make
it happen? We just kind

363
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.220
of do it. I don't
know, like step one, come

364
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.310
up with a cool Step
two, build the cool idea.

365
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.230
I think that it obviously
depends on what you're working

366
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.910
on at the time. It's
kind of not, you know,

367
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.530
you don't, you try not
to, like, if I know

368
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.510
that I'm, you know, all
my coworkers are trying to

369
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.220
ship something, then I'm not
going to just, you know,

370
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.390
jump off and be like,
I'm going to work on

371
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.480
this side project. So, but
I think people would just

372
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.750
generally know what to do.
And like, you know, it

373
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.530
really relies on people knowing
what what's important at the

374
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.640
time, personal responsibility. What do
you think? Just So I

375
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.180
definitely think the like there's
no, there's no point in

376
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.340
which you're bending your current
team. Like you, you do

377
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.690
try to get to a
good state with them, like

378
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.090
Paul mentioned. And then there's
kind of the flip side

379
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.340
of that, which is once
you started on your new

380
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:51.410
thing, there's kind of this,
I don't know, controlling social

381
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.840
effect where it's like, if
you can't get other people

382
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.150
bought into your idea for
this new thing, like they

383
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.800
won't join you. They won't
want to help out. And

384
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.530
it'll just kind of fizzle
out naturally almost. I hate

385
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.790
it. Does that happen other
than like ideas that have

386
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:07.130
been built and thrown in
and people just didn't go

387
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.860
for it. They usually don't
get built out all the

388
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.690
way. It's usually like, I
have this idea, I have

389
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.810
this vision, I'm trying to
communicate it to my fellow

390
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.270
employees. And some of them
say, Oh, that's kind of

391
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.890
interesting. Maybe they work on
it a little bit. And

392
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.140
it turns out it's not
actually as interesting as it

393
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.410
was originally. Or maybe people
just don't respond with enthusiasm

394
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.740
to the idea at all.
And that's perfectly okay. Acceptable

395
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.410
and expected many times. It's
just like, okay. So I

396
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.420
guess that means that I
was the only one excited

397
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.130
about that. And it's not
actually that great an idea

398
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.740
Without naming and shaming. Can
you think of any ideas

399
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.690
that might be, that would
like, Hey, you know, on

400
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.700
paper, this was a good
idea, but, but the community,

401
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.310
for whatever reason, didn't go
for it. Because the reason

402
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.230
I asked that is that
as you were giving me

403
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.550
the tour, Paul, there's a
giant hundred inch touchscreen. It's

404
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.880
like a surface plus plus
out there. And what's interesting

405
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.040
about it is there's little
squares with people's faces of

406
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.930
where they are. And I'm
like, Oh my goodness, that's

407
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.690
amazing. You can tell where
everyone is. And then I'm

408
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.090
thinking, well, how is that
possible? They're going to need

409
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.590
to opt in. They're going
to want to run some

410
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.140
kind of a little app.
And you said that they're

411
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.660
actually pulling that from a
number of different places when

412
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.120
they chat. Well, you grab
it from the geolocation of

413
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.580
their, of their browser. And
if they happen to be

414
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.000
on Foursquare, we pull it
from there. So you're doing

415
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.400
that implicitly, which means that
they don't have any additional

416
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.080
mental baggage or any psychic
weight associated with that. So

417
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.020
the entire company now is
located on a map without

418
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.690
anyone having to do anything
about it. Which means from

419
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.280
my perspective, there's an idea
that's just going to work.

420
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.950
No one had to push
any buttons. Are there any

421
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.680
tools that are failing right
now or any ideas that

422
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.780
just never made it happen?
Are you guys just awesome

423
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.030
and you nailed them all.
You're like, you're like looking

424
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.310
up, like, I can't think
of any ideas that we've

425
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:50.740
come up with that have
not succeeded dramatically. Yeah. I

426
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.550
think the one thing that
we keep trying to, trying

427
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.400
to build something good around
and, and we'll, we'll kind

428
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.360
of get there, but not
completely is like a get

429
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.170
up for mobile phone. Like,
like iOS or Android. You

430
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.750
have lots of GitHub clients.
There's people attempting to do

431
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.880
it. Yeah. It always seems
like that's the thing is

432
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.200
like, when you, when you
go to build it, it's

433
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.880
always seems like this is
going to be amazing. Like

434
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.290
I'm going to do all
this stuff on my phone.

435
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.420
It's like, well, it turns
out that people don't want

436
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.880
to code review on their
phone. Like, I dunno, man,

437
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.640
I'll tell you this in
the last 24 hours, I've

438
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.280
accepted five different pull requests
to a project I'm working

439
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.070
on doing it in landscape
because you guys don't have

440
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.910
a mobile responsive view and
I've been using one called

441
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.630
giddy. Yeah. That's the latest
one from, I think Matthew Strickland.

442
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.500
Everything's great about it, except
the notifications pile up. And

443
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.600
I don't know how to
make them stop. I want

444
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.770
the, you know, and this
is the thing with all

445
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.300
notifications. There's the individual marketing
is red and I just

446
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.000
notification bankruptcy, which is what
I need. I should get

447
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.280
an achievement in the game
center for every time I

448
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.210
push clear, you know what
I mean? Cause I don't

449
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.600
care anymore. And Mark all
is red. So that was

450
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.640
that why there is no
mobile mobile ghetto? Well, I

451
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.980
wouldn't say that. I just
think that like from a

452
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.310
workflow perspective, it's one of
those things that ends up

453
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.160
me being not sticky once
people use it, it sounds

454
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.360
to me like, and then
we're getting a little off

455
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.390
topic, but it seems like
people at GitHub wouldn't use

456
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.810
a mobile GitHub client, but
arguably the people on the

457
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.960
real world would, that's just
way less notification. So then

458
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.750
that means that you're not
serving your business user because

459
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.130
y'all as a culture aren't
going for it. Well, I

460
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.590
think part of it is
just, there are a lot

461
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.170
of ways to skin that
cat and it's hard to,

462
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.170
you're not only trying to
get people on board with

463
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.390
the idea of doing something
on mobile, but also the

464
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.640
specific way of doing something
on mobile. And a lot

465
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.650
of times that I think
is what's fallen through is

466
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.860
like people have disparate ideas
about what it should be.

467
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.920
And it's hard to get
coordinated effort on one of

468
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.720
those, if not everyone's agreeing.
But I think also with

469
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.650
respect to the, the idea
of like ideas failing, I

470
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.440
think a lot of them
are not actually outright failures

471
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.480
as in they get completely
abandoned and never looked at

472
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.550
again. But many of them
turn into kind of like

473
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.210
culture tool things or like
internal tools that are not

474
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.680
really, I want to say
not actively maintained, but that

475
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.610
sounds bad. But like it's
kinda like one fundamental what's

476
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.870
that mean It's fundamental. Like
Cuba is, is like welcome

477
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.290
to get hub. This is
button. Yeah. It's kind of

478
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:33.960
like maybe they would languish
or they get used, but

479
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.940
they don't get it. It
was like maybe a weekend

480
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.340
hack project or a week
hack project. And no one

481
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.440
really wanted to pick it
up after that or stuff

482
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.770
like that. But then, you
know, eventually if people do

483
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.910
pick up usage of it
and it gets more widely,

484
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.270
people get enthusiastic about the
idea of something better than

485
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:54.320
it'll get steam again, maybe
get rebooted that's I feel

486
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.330
like that's sort of what
happened with play, which is

487
00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:00.190
our like kind of internal
music system. Yeah. I noticed

488
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.350
there's no music somehow. I
just assume that they would

489
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.090
be like, it'd be like
a dance party in here.

490
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.840
Cause I that's the sense
I get when I watched

491
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.840
like Zach Coleman's talks, there's
like constant deck dance party.

492
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.740
Yeah. Well I think right
now it's from trying to

493
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.950
keep the noise down, but
yeah, but like for while

494
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.870
there, there was just the
one version of play and

495
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.540
it was kind of there
because the people that had

496
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.300
been working on it, moved
to other things and not

497
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.660
because they disliked it, but
just because other things took

498
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.220
priority or whatever, We're more
important. I've got a at,

499
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.120
at Microsoft, I have a
portal that's like a camera

500
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.610
that's I try to keep
on all the time, but

501
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.450
it's amazing how little pieces
of friction will completely derail

502
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:43.060
something. So like something expired
on the, on the password

503
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.800
or whatever. And then two
weeks goes by and the

504
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.720
portal hasn't been on in
two weeks. Right. And then

505
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.730
somebody gets around to fixing
it and then it's back

506
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.320
on. I'm like, yeah, this
was a great idea. Why

507
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.470
did we ever stop using
this? And then, you know,

508
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.680
our service pack doesn't get
installed. And then it's down

509
00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.720
for another week and it's
down right now because the

510
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.750
hard drive is failing. Right?
So it's like something that

511
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.030
is so fundamental to my
life as a remote employee

512
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.690
goes away and I'm still
alive and somehow I'm still

513
00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.920
doing my job. Was it
really that important? Good question.

514
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.170
I actually, there was an
article or I guess an

515
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:18.430
interview recently with Chrissy Brautigan
who is our UX research

516
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.840
person. And she basically described
the style of testing that

517
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.870
we're starting to do more
of, which is deprivation testing.

518
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.970
So it's like the idea
that if you take away

519
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.570
a feature or a product
or something along those lines,

520
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.090
you see what the response
is. Like people are really

521
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.490
outraged about it. You're like,
Oh, that's actually pretty useful.

522
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.430
But if it's just kind
of like a phase into

523
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.590
the night quietly, then it's
like, well, okay, I guess

524
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.030
we don't actually need to
work on this anymore. Cause

525
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.730
no one really cared. Wow.
You know, that's funny that

526
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.130
you mentioned that just as
an aside, there's a, the

527
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.910
menus and visual studio, our
IDE is just completely out

528
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.180
of control and every team
wants their thing to be

529
00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.480
up front. So in, in,
in a, in a world

530
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.520
where people care and work
as a team, it would

531
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.710
be like, right. Click add.
And then that would fly

532
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.470
out and then add here
all the choices. But everyone

533
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.210
keeps wanting to be the
one that's up front. So

534
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.640
it's like, add this, add
this, add this unrelated thing.

535
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:15.790
And they're all like up
top. And I said, listen,

536
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.050
guys, let's just really like
rip the bandaid off. Let's

537
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.980
just cut the menu down
by like 50%. And if

538
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.990
anyone yells and we'll add
it back and I'm no,

539
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.720
no, we can't do that.
I love that word deprivation

540
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.840
testing. Yeah. And so see
if anybody screams. Right. And

541
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.270
so mainly it's in the
context of like control of

542
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.820
user research right now. But
like to some extent that's

543
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.870
happened with larger features too.
Like maybe the, the most

544
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.710
atrocious example in relatively recent
times, it's the fork que

545
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.250
like got removed and very
few people complained about it

546
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:49.070
because God, What is that?
The four Q was a

547
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:53.120
way to see. So you
have like your repo and

548
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.220
then all the repos in
what we call a network.

549
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.070
So like their forks and
their forks forks. And that

550
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.050
page is so slow. I
don't even visit it. Yeah.

551
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:06.200
So sorry, the four Q
yeah. We're working on it.

552
00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.510
I told him, cause he
ran out of space. We

553
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.850
have no room for computers.
It's like two minutes. I'm

554
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.100
like just open a tab
and come forget about it.

555
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.120
So the four Q lets
you see commits from other

556
00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.420
repos. Okay. But it was
from the very, very early

557
00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.630
days of GitHub and it
was not designed so well.

558
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.510
And so most, I think
most people were, did not

559
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.010
miss it or did not
even notice it disappearing. Do

560
00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.190
you think if you think
if Hubert went away, remotes

561
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.800
would be a problem like
back to remote you're in

562
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.760
Seattle, Phil hacks in Seattle,
your chat room is really

563
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.310
where you're not Skyping people.
Right? You're not video chatting

564
00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.240
your connection to this office
is Cuba. So that's something

565
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.380
that you couldn't live with
that. Yeah. Right. And that's

566
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.510
like, everyone is a hundred
percent aware of that. Like

567
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.180
we would never try a
day without Huba because we

568
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.670
know that it's an incredibly
integral part of our workflow.

569
00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.500
Like there's not even any
question, like that's not a

570
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.920
question that needs answering. This
is more for like maybe

571
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.110
features on the website or
features in our native apps

572
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.450
where it's like, well, it
doesn't seem like it gets

573
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.090
used that much. Maybe we
can try going without it.

574
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.770
And you know, we'd made,
then we don't have to

575
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.630
maintain it. Then we don't
have to keep this code

576
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:16.430
around. And depending on the
response that either stays there

577
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.460
or it gets, it gets
removed permanently. There was a

578
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.240
lot of discussion around when
Marissa Mayer was like, yeah,

579
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.670
everyone from Yahoo, you know,
come into the mothership now.

580
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.310
And people kept saying, how
do you know if a

581
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.460
remote person is not just
goofing around? And that seemed

582
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.470
like it was more interesting
to me than the other

583
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.100
discussions around remote workers. Is
that, are you measuring whether

584
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.960
or not your people are
working or not? I mean,

585
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.910
presumably if you have a
boss, I don't know how

586
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.530
flat you guys are here.
They would look at your

587
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.170
commits and they would look
at your output and the

588
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.670
fact that you shipped on
time or you didn't and

589
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.290
they go, yeah, Justin did
a good job. You can

590
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.540
see. I've never, you know,
I haven't seen him for

591
00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.230
a year, but the work
product is there. Yeah. So

592
00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.960
we are, we are extremely
flat organization. So there isn't

593
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.360
really a person in that
role that would do that

594
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.630
kind of reviewing it's it's
really kind of team oriented

595
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.420
where it's just like every,
I mean, Well how do

596
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.400
you know? Who's lasted their
class at Harvard, right? I

597
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.130
mean everyone's GitHub. Yeah. We're
all at Harvard. Somebody's gotta

598
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.590
be the one that sucks.
It's true. But it's also

599
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.020
not measurable in any ways.
Like, I mean we could

600
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.020
measure commits, we could measure
lines added and removed, but

601
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.120
that still doesn't tell you
anything. Well, yeah. I mean

602
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.220
it, MetLife measuring lines of
code is silly, but how

603
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.220
do you know who gets
the big bonus nuggets? I

604
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.080
mean, it's a team effort.
There wouldn't be one person

605
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.150
that would get an outrageous
bonus while everyone else didn't

606
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.600
like, it it's really you
can't. So your example of

607
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.310
like someone disappearing for a
year, Oh, you still know

608
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.110
they're productive because they've got
all these commits coming in.

609
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.750
Like if you're working on
a team, you can't disappear

610
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.940
for a year. Like your
code is valuable, but your

611
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.320
is also valuable. And so
in the chat yeah, like

612
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.630
being, being, I mean, not
necessarily at the same time

613
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.620
as everyone else, but being
available for questions, for discussions

614
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.720
with the rest of your
team, like it's not just

615
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.140
about the Cody, right. It's
also about, you know, that

616
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:59.500
kind of social aspect or
the vision aspect of the

617
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.430
team, like contributing to that.
Do you, do you as

618
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.210
remote and kind of talking
remote remote here that I

619
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:10.530
have a sense of fear
is almost too big of

620
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:12.390
a word, but there's just
this sense of like, I

621
00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:16.680
hope that they know I'm
working. That was to be

622
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.660
honest, that was one of
my big concerns before starting.

623
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.290
And I think it was
very quickly alleviated because we

624
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:26.700
do while we don't use
data to tell us whether

625
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.010
someone's a good worker, you
do have data on what's

626
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.560
happening and what people are
doing. So it's like, it's

627
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.490
not a, you know, like
they're productive or they're unproductive,

628
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.040
but you can see the
ways in which everyone is

629
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.950
productive. So like we can
go to repositories now and

630
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.290
use the pulse feature, which
we just recently made public

631
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.140
to see like the commits
that are being made recently,

632
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.060
the pull requests and issues
that are open and being

633
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.440
discussed. It's, it's very transparent
into what everyone's working on.

634
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.370
Even if, yeah. I don't
know, like different levels of

635
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.190
productivity aside, you can see
what's happen. And there's, and

636
00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.680
I hear about people at
Microsoft being told by their

637
00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.750
bosses, like, you know, you
need to start thinking about

638
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.480
moving to Seattle that hasn't
happened to me yet. But

639
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.470
that fear of like I'm,
you know, to use an

640
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.740
inappropriate metaphor, three fifths of
an employee. Do you ever

641
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.350
get that sense or do
you feel 100% secure in

642
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:22.380
your gig? I like in
terms of, in terms of

643
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.510
the things I work on,
I feel totally secure about

644
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:26.970
that. It's actually, I think
the biggest advantage to living

645
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.150
in San Francisco is missing
or being around for all

646
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.930
the culture or all the
social activities. Like, you know,

647
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.760
you can approximate it to
some extent with like the

648
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.100
shared chatroom stuff, but yeah.
At the end of the

649
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.770
day, there are social things
that you don't get remotely.

650
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.410
Yeah. In Seattle and I'm
in Portland and in Seattle,

651
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.230
like they went to what
iron man and they're going

652
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.320
to a Superman next week
and they go bowling and

653
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.860
there's always a kind of
like always a bridesmaid. Yeah.

654
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.600
Kind of a sense when
you see the mail go

655
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.350
out to all hands and
you're like tentative and always

656
00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.180
like, like maybe I wasn't
thinking I never clicked. I

657
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.100
never clicked. No I'm not
coming. Like I might, I

658
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:06.000
might fly up. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. There's certainly a sense

659
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.640
of like, if, if I
were to move to San

660
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.350
Francisco, that would be the
main reason I would want

661
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.170
to do it, but it
is not because like, even

662
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.390
like no one else on
my team lives here currently,

663
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.810
although someone is moving here
shortly, but so there's not

664
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.930
this sense of like I'm
missing out on important team

665
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.690
discussions or important work. It
would just be to be

666
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.240
around other good hovers. Do
you have anything you want

667
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.940
to say in conclusion? Yeah.
I was thinking about going

668
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.600
back to the, One of
our biggest challenges of like,

669
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.180
You know, finding the last
person in the class or

670
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:42.890
whatever is more, not so
much people directly not being

671
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.910
productive, but not knowing where
to contribute. So, so we've

672
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.460
had in the past, like
people kind of get kind

673
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.080
of lost. Like they're like,
Oh, I'm, you know, you

674
00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.900
know, people just kind of
poke at these little things

675
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.080
and they're not it's sometimes,
sometimes they don't feel empowered

676
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.680
to do you know, something
big or they're, you know,

677
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.390
they don't think to do
it. They're like, you know,

678
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.360
not ambitious enough. It sounds
like that that you're saying

679
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.730
that they don't feel that
they able to do something

680
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.950
or empowered so that they
come off as being unfocused

681
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.490
and not enabled, or they're
kind of used to other

682
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.990
jobs where like, you know,
they had to get a

683
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.780
manager and a managers and
managers approval before they could

684
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.550
do anything. Right. And so
they're like, Oh yeah, of

685
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.560
course I could write that
would benefit stuff as preventative

686
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.800
behavior. Of course I couldn't
build this big thing, you

687
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.990
know, or get this project
started. Like, you know, when

688
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.550
people aren't used to being
able to just say like,

689
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.530
yeah, let's do it. So
that's definitely something that we

690
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.450
have to try to be
watch out for. And we

691
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.360
try to do that by
having at least when people

692
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.320
start a very concrete idea
of what they're working on.

693
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.450
So like, like you're going
to work on, you know,

694
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.930
this is a thing you
could work on and you

695
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.310
know, we make sure they're
excited about it and then

696
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.230
they want to work on
that. So I think that

697
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.930
helps a lot. Yeah. I
think feeling empowered and feeling

698
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.690
secure is what empowered us
with the tools and the

699
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.570
culture provide and feeling secure
is what the culture provides.

700
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.670
And that's great that you're
able to work remotely and

701
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.250
I still have a job.
Thanks so much. Paul and

702
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.410
Justin for chatting with me
today. Thank you. Thanks a

703
00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:11.570
lot for having us. This
has been another episode of

704
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:20.800
Hansel minutes. We'll see you
again next week. <inaudible>.
