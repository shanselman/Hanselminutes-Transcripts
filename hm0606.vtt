<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.380
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.710
I'm talking with Camila Taylor.
She is doing an engineering

10
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.770
residence at hustle, and she
also does the tech beach

11
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.700
retreat, which is a international
technology summit hosted in Jamaica.

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.270
But before this, you were
a senior software engineer at

13
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.180
LinkedIn. You worked on the
LinkedIn app, the LinkedIn learning

14
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.770
app you worked at Wolfrem
on Mathematica with Lego Mindstorms.

15
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.750
I mean, this is all
my favorite things in one

16
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.590
place. How are you, how
are you? I'm super excited

17
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.060
to talk to you because
you've done a bunch of

18
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.230
stuff over your career. Thanks.
Thanks for having me today.

19
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.340
Thank you. The thing is
though, I'm looking at, I

20
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.980
see iOS and I go
cool. Okay. That's cool. She's

21
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.860
a Swift developer or maybe
objective C and then I

22
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.840
go back and I look
in the, in the past,

23
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.090
and then it looks like
you were working on low

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.940
level stuff on Lego Mindstorms.
Can we start at Lego

25
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.900
Mindstorms? What was going on
there? The Lego Mindstorms. Oh,

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.840
this is, this is my
first job after I dropped

27
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.660
out of my PhD program
slash took a year off,

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.450
which meant that I was
not going to go back.

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.040
So you never know you're
ABD. Yeah, yeah, no. I

30
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.440
dropped that before. That is
three years in, so I

31
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.370
finished the master's degree and
then, and then I pieced

32
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.570
out. So it was, but
it was a really good,

33
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.300
it was a really good
sort of coincidence or scenario

34
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.390
because I had done so
much like of my sermons

35
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.840
in my past. I had,
you know, that was what

36
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.040
got me into programming in
high school. I did this

37
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.070
like camp in Jamaica or
I, I was helping teaching

38
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.500
it. And then I used
it in my research in

39
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.090
grad school as so by,
you know, like really for

40
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.060
chooses a set of events.
There is a manager at

41
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.480
Wolfram who had long, wanted
to be able to program

42
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.110
Mathematica using Lego Mindstorms. And
he, they came by the

43
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.110
campus and I was like,
Oh, well just so happens

44
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.540
that I'm looking for a
job and I've done lots

45
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.550
of stuff for like advice
terms. And so I actually,

46
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.830
my first day on the
job, I had like my

47
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.710
laptop on my desk and
I had a Lego Mindstorms

48
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.570
kit and I'm always like,
Oh, well finally, after all

49
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.510
these years that I've spent
all this money on Legos,

50
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.480
it finally got you a
job. I'm really excited, but

51
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.230
yeah, That's amazing. So you
were, you've been doing this

52
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.170
a while. Like you were
doing Lego Mindstorms like 13

53
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.780
years ago, so then like
fast forward, and then you're

54
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.570
sitting at Wolfram, like at
a job you're getting money

55
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.780
and there's Legos on your
desk. Yeah. I mean, it

56
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.180
really was a dream sort
of like pinch pinch me,

57
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.490
is this real? Is this
happening actually getting paid to

58
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.380
do this? No. Did they
just give you the task

59
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.940
and say, all right, figure
out how these are going

60
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.280
to talk to each other
or had the architecture or

61
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.800
the decisions been made before?
No, it was pretty much,

62
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.780
but this is something we
want to do. We don't

63
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.790
really know how to do
it. We assume you'll be

64
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.820
able to figure out how
to do it. And the

65
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.050
theory was that at this
point, Mathematica, the, the previous

66
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.140
version they'd released had a
bunch of computer vision and

67
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.340
image processing stuff. And so
this was their play at

68
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.740
like, okay, well we have
this part. And so we

69
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.010
feel like we could start
to get people interested in

70
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.640
using this if we added
more and more functionality, right.

71
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.000
It'd be sort of a
complete set of features for

72
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.880
you. And so, yeah, it
was, it was pretty much

73
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.790
just like jump in the
weeds at first. I thought

74
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.370
it would be fine because
I knew that Lego had

75
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.780
opened, they had sort of
released like some STKs and

76
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.260
stuff to communicate with it,
but it turns out they

77
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.020
hadn't really updated any of
it for about six years.

78
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.010
So as you, when you
mentioned, like I was doing

79
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.480
low level stuff is because
after a while, and you

80
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.990
know, we were able to
sort of partially communicate with

81
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.770
Mindstorms and sort of harshly
read sensory things, but it

82
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.770
wasn't quite working and this
is on the Mac and

83
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.930
then on Linux or like,
okay, we're going to do

84
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.670
this on Linux as well.
And we have to like

85
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.430
do this driver from scratch
and it works fine on

86
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.370
Linux. And that was when
we realized that actually it

87
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.920
was a driver that was
broken. And so we're like,

88
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.510
okay, well, I guess we're
going to have to write

89
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.160
this for Mac as well.
And so that's, that's how

90
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.250
I ended up having to
do both like the USB

91
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.120
and sort of Bluetooth drivers.
And that was also my

92
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.920
first experience with objective C
was needing to ride that.

93
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.210
Why, why did you have
to do drivers if your

94
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.430
goal is to get this
amazing high level language and

95
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.230
the way that Mathematica thinks
about stuff to talk to

96
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.110
the robot, why couldn't you
call Lego and say, Hey,

97
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.960
you know, y'all need to
fix this. Or Yeah, we

98
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.200
try it. They weren't really
very responsive if I remember

99
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.230
correctly. And I think part
of that, and this is

100
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.960
something I didn't know at
the time was that they

101
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.850
were actually working on the
new version of the <inaudible>,

102
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.040
right? So this is at
a time at the NXT,

103
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.300
but unbeknownst to us, many
of the features and functionality

104
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.270
that we wanted was actually
going into the <inaudible>. And

105
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.470
so I think they had
just like stopped supporting the

106
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.690
NXT at that point. And
that was why we were

107
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.290
having trouble, trouble getting that.
But without us knowing that

108
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.360
sort of like product roadmap,
there is no way for

109
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.490
us to know that this
was why we're not getting

110
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.200
a lot of help. And
you had said, you'd spent

111
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.410
your time in high school
working on Legos. And that

112
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.620
was, was that your foray
into, into program? Kind of.

113
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.870
So I technically first programmed,
and this is in maybe

114
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.820
third or fourth grade in
Jamaica. We had a very

115
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.830
eager computer teacher who taught
tosses logo. I don't know

116
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.560
if you remember that programming
language to the triangle. Yeah.

117
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.930
Yeah. So it's technically my
first programming experience, but I

118
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.550
would say that my Lego
Lego Mindstorm, so kit was

119
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.570
maybe really my first programming
experience in high school. And

120
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.420
then we had, I went
to by this point, I,

121
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.310
so I moved around a
bunch in from Jamaica, but,

122
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.520
but I went to middle
school and high school in

123
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.690
Atlanta, Georgia, and I was
at a magnet school in

124
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.750
Atlanta and they had an
advanced, advanced Mac technology class.

125
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.060
I think they called it.
And the teacher is basically

126
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.550
using Lego Mindstorms to teach
us a bunch of stuff.

127
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.680
And so that's really when
I started to learn how

128
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.000
to program. Interesting. So that
was your first kind of

129
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.180
like real experience, like legit,
like, like logo is, I

130
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.310
think of it, like, you
know, it's loops, right? It's

131
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.940
all about teaching looping and
maybe functions. Then when you

132
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.790
get into the Mindstorms, does
it true? Is it true

133
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.640
that the Mindstorms brick, the
main brain is it's a

134
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.430
little Linux machine? Isn't it?
I think so. Or I

135
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.360
think it's a arm. If
I remember correctly, it's like

136
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.550
an arm processor and then
it has like a really

137
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.030
small, I don't, well, I'd
have to double check with

138
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.790
the <inaudible> the NSC, I
think was like a really

139
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.720
simple like S that they
had on there. Yeah. I

140
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.600
think you're right. I think
that it was the next

141
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.570
one that became a real
little compute, like a real

142
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:07.960
machine. The <inaudible> <inaudible> I
think, yeah. I'm saying, I

143
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.030
think like I don't have
one that I'm looking at

144
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.720
right now. Yeah. The reason
that I'm trying to understand

145
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.470
is that I'm teaching my
kids, you know, quote unquote,

146
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.860
how to program and it's
JavaScript and it's Python. But

147
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.170
then my nine year old
came in yesterday and saw

148
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.870
me building this little raspberry
PI Kubernetes swarm that I'm

149
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.590
doing. And we ended up
talking about trace route and

150
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.700
ping and SSH, and he
kept asking all kinds of

151
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.350
questions that I realized were
him. It was him moving

152
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.620
his brain to another level
in the stack, which, which

153
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.920
I made him, made me
realize that he is now

154
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.180
noticing that there is a
stack. And that's kind of

155
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.770
what I wanted to talk
to you about is that

156
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.680
shift when you're, you're sitting
there and you're trying to

157
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.970
get Mathematica, which is quite
a high level thing to

158
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.890
talk to this low level
thing. And then you discover

159
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.540
that the abstraction leaked the,
you know, the USB drivers

160
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.760
with a problem, and now
you're debugging, you know, how

161
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.110
you communicate on the wire.
Yeah. Yeah. And it's interesting

162
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.100
to, yeah, because I mean,
at first we were very

163
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.710
focused on like, what is
the language? Like, what is

164
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.740
the syntax, the functions that
we're going to expose to

165
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.680
people to be able to
get us to work. But

166
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.420
so we're simultaneously sort of
adding to like the Mathematica

167
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.560
or Wolfram language, but also
having to, as you said,

168
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.080
like work in the lower
stack, like, wait, like this

169
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.430
is not like something is
broken in this communication. Yeah.

170
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.790
And so sort of interesting.
And I think perhaps like

171
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.800
studying robotics and in grad
school, I guess sort of

172
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.670
helps me feel sort of
comfortable around like moving, moving

173
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:56.990
along the stack. I feel
like there's a, I was

174
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.820
gonna say a classic program,
but the classes and the

175
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.580
right word, some of us
who will program my program

176
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.810
10, 15 years and never
really move up or down

177
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.180
within the stack. Like I
know to, I know devs

178
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.120
that are amazing programmers and
they can write, you know,

179
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.890
full apps or full systems
even, but they've never written

180
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.480
a USB driver and C
they've never, you know, and

181
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.020
as you go forward in
time, what skills can we

182
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.040
develop? What ways can we
think about technology that would

183
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.710
give us more flexibility that
we could in fact switch

184
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:37.130
stacks? Yeah, I think so.
I think that a computer

185
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.770
science degree that really should
be one of the things

186
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.600
that you get from it.
I know there's a lot

187
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.630
of, you know, there's definitely
a lot of useful things

188
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.430
that you get from online,
learning online classes, boot camps,

189
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.230
et cetera, but the Freels
sort of value. What are

190
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.180
the real values that I
think you should be getting

191
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.850
from a computer science degree
is the ability to sort

192
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.360
of move around the stack
and see what those connections

193
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.440
are. Right. And I think
it's not that far for

194
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.790
jump from, I had to
figure out how to, to

195
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.570
write this USB and Bluetooth
driver, two years later, I

196
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.230
had to figure out how
to write something and the

197
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.860
networking stack for Iowa for
an iOS app, right. These

198
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.310
things are like definitely very,
very related. You have to

199
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.120
think about things in very
similar ways. Yeah. When I,

200
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.880
when I, when I teach
at the local community college,

201
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.600
there's an exploring engineering class
that I do and that

202
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.170
kind of, they bring in
guest lecturers. And one of

203
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.360
the things that I attempt
to do is let people

204
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.330
have opened the stack up
to people. So for example,

205
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.080
I might open up paint
and make a bitmap that's

206
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.300
like a hundred by a
hundred and put red in

207
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.130
it and then save the
bitmap and then look at

208
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.240
the hecks. Yeah. And you
should, it just a bit

209
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:02.800
mapped, not a JPEG, it'll
be <inaudible> repeated. And the

210
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.750
idea being to get people
to go wait a second.

211
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.600
What's is there something underneath
that, you know, and then

212
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.310
they go, well, that's very
inefficient. And then we talk

213
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.710
about compression, et cetera, et
cetera. Right. I started teaching

214
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.270
teaching by like sort of
showing what's happening as opposed

215
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.240
to like, just teaching sort
of the theory theory or

216
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.040
something. Right. These are two,
two different ways. Right. And

217
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.770
I'm hearing you say that
your computer science background from

218
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.940
graduate school all the way
back was about the stack,

219
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.850
about talking about the pieces
from the bottom up and

220
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.070
making sure that there's at
least a fundamental understanding of

221
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.290
like, okay, well there is
low-level networking and we sit

222
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.390
on top of that and
then we sit on top

223
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.460
of that, et cetera, et
cetera. Yeah, I think so.

224
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.100
Or at the very least,
I think that's how I

225
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.370
think about things. And maybe
so maybe I'm giving a

226
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.760
little bit too much credit.
I'm not sure, but I

227
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.240
very much, even if you
think of say like mobile

228
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.720
development, I, I think of
that as a little mini,

229
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.530
like full stack development operations,
because you, again sort of

230
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.590
have to think all the
way up and down a

231
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.190
and sometimes you do have
to, you have to debug

232
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.860
things that are going on
with like different sensor readings,

233
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:20.070
et cetera, and networking, networking
layer. And I think it's,

234
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.880
I think, I think it's
a really important skill to

235
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.120
be able to do that.
Not necessarily everyone has that

236
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.930
everyone has to do that,
but I think it's a,

237
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.020
it's a really interesting way
or really useful skill in

238
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:39.150
being able to understand holistically
what's happening. So, so you

239
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.830
and I, and just gonna
compare us, cause we're the

240
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:45.180
ones on the podcast have
have different educational backgrounds, right?

241
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.100
So you went right up
against the edge of a

242
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.720
PhD. And I started out
in a community college and

243
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.020
then at night eventually got
a bachelor's degree. But while

244
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.810
I was working, I was
thinking about like, I feel

245
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.730
like something's missing. I feel
like something's missing. So I

246
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:04.110
chose consciously to go and
finish my bachelor's because I

247
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.800
felt that it filled in
holes in my understanding of

248
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.640
the stack. What do I
say to people who are

249
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.730
what we would call maybe
nontraditional learners or self-taught learners

250
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.510
who have learned everything online.
And they might be listening

251
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.850
to us and saying, Oh,
look at these two privileged

252
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.520
people talking about how they
have fancy degrees. I don't

253
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.630
need to know any of
that. I can get it

254
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.140
all on, on the web.
Yeah. I think that's absolutely

255
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.740
true for most of the
things that I use now

256
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:37.350
I've learned them after school,
right? There was no, there

257
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.840
was no iOS when I
was in school. Right. The

258
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.770
iPhone was announced in my
senior year of my undergrad.

259
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.970
And so there's a lot
of like technology is just

260
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.790
like changed so much in
the last 10 years that

261
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.230
I think that's also a
really important skill. And that's

262
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.810
maybe an advantage if you
have been self-taught, if you

263
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.720
have learned everything online and
then you're used to that

264
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.720
mode of learning in a
way that maybe you're not

265
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.570
used to that if you've
only got skills. So, you

266
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.940
know, I think this is
a, it's a super valuable,

267
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.110
super valuable skillset. So you
did Legos in high school,

268
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.560
you worked at Wolf from
moving, moving your way across

269
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.260
the stack programming across the
stack. How did you find

270
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.010
yourself as a mid level
Java developer? Yeah. So about

271
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.570
a year into Wolfram, couple
of things happened. One was

272
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.020
that I sort of been
evaluating on if this was

273
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.940
the path that I wanted
to do. And I was

274
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.360
like, yes, I definitely enjoy
this much more than academia.

275
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.820
This is the right thing
for me. Now. There's like

276
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.140
another thing at this point,
right. I'm in Illinois. And

277
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.920
I, as I said, I'm
from Jamaica and I was

278
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.340
pretty much done with the
winter. So I knew I

279
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.490
had wanted. And in fact,
before I joined Wolfrem, I'd

280
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.270
almost moved to California. I
was going to take a

281
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.030
position at Honda research and
that would have been like

282
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.670
really going for robotics all
the way. But I was

283
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.600
sort of uncomfortable with how
difficult it had been to

284
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.720
find a non-military robotic shop.
A lot of robotics research

285
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.300
and even robust and industry
has, has gotten a lot

286
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.490
of funding from the department
of defense, especially at that

287
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.040
time. And that was one
of the reasons why I

288
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.590
decided to go with bull
from over a Honda research

289
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.380
and that's something I think
was like, absolutely the right

290
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.170
decision. But then I was
like, okay, now I really

291
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.160
want to move out out
to the Bay area. There

292
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.820
were a couple of other
things. So, and this is

293
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.860
again, like I said, this
is sort of my test

294
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.140
of whether or not I
would do robotics full time

295
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.260
and industry. And I knew
that there were a lot

296
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.680
of issues with funding, robotics
projects at companies, and sure

297
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.210
enough, the robotics project gods
basically like T funded after

298
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.300
about a year when my
manager had to leave the

299
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.370
company's personal, personal reasons. And
so it does still live

300
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.330
on actually they have a
more generic devices project that

301
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.700
they released a year or
two later in that sort

302
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.220
of where that was on
and still being able to

303
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.660
use Mathematica to communicate with
and program any sort of

304
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.650
generic hardware device that you
have connected to your computer.

305
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.740
But it was basically sort
of the, the writing the

306
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.780
wall. I was like, okay,
well, if this project is

307
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.580
done and I know I
want to move out to

308
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.550
California, I'm just going to
go for it. And so

309
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.040
I applied to a couple
of places out here. I

310
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.270
really enjoy the experience when
I interviewed at LinkedIn and

311
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.720
they apparently enjoyed it as
well. And so that's how

312
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.020
I ended up out here.
And when I came, as

313
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.660
I said, I'd spent a
lot of time to bargain.

314
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.450
He was being Bluetooth drivers.
And so when they asked

315
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.740
me what I wanted to
work on it, I was

316
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.950
like, I really need to
move away from being this

317
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.270
low level for a while.
And so that's how I

318
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.090
ended up working on, on
the, on the main stack

319
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.200
Java, LinkedIn is a Java
shop. So that's how that,

320
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.110
that's how that basically works
out. So from a career

321
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:07.340
management perspective, you made a
conscious decision to say, I

322
00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.320
want to exercise this different
part of my brain is

323
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.510
different part of my skillset
and get me out of

324
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:17.120
the low level USB. Yeah.
Yeah. I, it was interesting.

325
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.360
I mean, if you've worked
in that part of this

326
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.140
act, it can be, it
can be, it can be

327
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.380
a lot to sort of
be working at that level.

328
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.040
Like day after day, you
do get wins, but they're

329
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.620
sort of like far and
few in between. And in

330
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.380
between that there's lots of,
sort of like debugging, like,

331
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.590
or statements and like lots
and lots and lots of

332
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.320
Google searches to try to
figure out like, what exactly

333
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.710
is like happening. And you
get a really nice payoff

334
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.170
when things work, but in
between that, there's just like

335
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.800
a lot of pain. And
so I was mostly ready

336
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.520
to move away from that
level of pain for a

337
00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.070
while and try out Because
of long stretches of looking

338
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.820
at hex crying and, and,
and reminding yourself, you know,

339
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.410
it's not nearly as glamorous
as when they did it

340
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.000
on the matrix. And they're
like, yeah, look, I can

341
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.600
see in the matrix, not
like that looking at hex

342
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.130
does not make me feel
like that in any way.

343
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.650
No, it really doesn't. So
yeah. So you moved up

344
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.560
and at this point is,
is Apple's starting to go

345
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.870
and make that objective C
to Swift change. Cause you

346
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.760
were at LinkedIn for over
three years, Five and a

347
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.590
half years actually. Yeah, yeah.
Over half a decade. So

348
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.730
when recently said to me,
which one 20th of a

349
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.030
century, all of those make
it sound really, really long.

350
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.410
Yeah. So this was, this
was around the time when

351
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.050
I joined LinkedIn. And it
was around the time that

352
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.170
I think both LinkedIn and
Facebook were starting to believe

353
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:54.080
that their non-native JavaScript's approach
to building apps is like

354
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.310
perhaps like not super performant.
And I think both, both

355
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.120
companies came to that realization
around the same time. And

356
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.040
so I was on the
main stack, as I said,

357
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.500
I was working on the
profile. That was one LinkedIn

358
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.250
rebuilt the profile. And so
that was really great project.

359
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.920
And when it was done,
I sorta got the like,

360
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.620
okay, here are all the
things that the team is

361
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.740
doing right now. And they
mentioned an IU app called

362
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.940
context, and that was LinkedIn's
first non main app. So

363
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.340
the first in their family
or facts that they, that

364
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.810
they built and there's one
person on the team and

365
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.540
I was like, Oh, well
I like Apple devices. Sure.

366
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.590
I'll do that. I had
definitely been sort of interested

367
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.180
in it for a while
and had wants to spend

368
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.430
time sort of where to
get and hadn't had the

369
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.270
time. And so this seemed
like the perfect time to

370
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.160
do that. So I managers
said, sure. And he sort

371
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.520
of said, I, you know,
I think this will be

372
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.680
a really good decision. And
I think mobile is going

373
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.230
to be big for LinkedIn.
And a couple of years,

374
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:02.860
just like the understatement of
the decade, baby mobile, you

375
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.210
know, by about a year
or two, after that, I

376
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.050
think LinkedIn was around like
50% traffic going through through

377
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.170
mobile. We weren't there at
the time when I started

378
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.790
at all The app revolution
happened and they were right.

379
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.330
Yeah. Right. Yeah. And so
we were on objective C

380
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.730
and that was also around
the time that the LinkedIn

381
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.180
app, as I said, decided
to rewrite into objective C.

382
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.880
And so I sent this
other app and I, then

383
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.270
we launched that. And then
they went into a sort

384
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.730
of down phase as they
try to figure out like

385
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.850
how the app is performing,
what to do, how to

386
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:43.140
react. And it was during
that phase, that, and a

387
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.560
reorg that happened that I
ended up moving onto the

388
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.370
main flagship app. And then
I worked on that for,

389
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.070
I guess, about three and
a half years or so.

390
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.400
How big is the team?
I mean, that's a big

391
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.560
deal app, but that's not,
that's not, that's a non

392
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.790
trivially sized app. It's an
important app. What's, what's the

393
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:08.640
team size on something like
that Right now, I would

394
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.510
say, so I know at
the peak wonder for peaks

395
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.260
of developments. And that was
when we rebuilt the app

396
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:23.550
in Swift and that was
probably had around 50. So

397
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.090
like definitely at least 50,
maybe over 50 people committing

398
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.960
to the iOS app alone
every day. Yeah. At the

399
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.330
time it was much smaller.
So when I first started

400
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.730
doing mobile at LinkedIn, I
think I was one of

401
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:40.410
like a handful of iOS
developers. And because I ended

402
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.240
up doing it so early,
that means that I got

403
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.430
to be around for like
the, the mobilization phase of

404
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.790
LinkedIn and that happened. And
let's see. So I joined

405
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:54.330
in 2012, switched over to
the fact that I had

406
00:22:54.330 --> 00:23:00.330
in 2013. So it was
in 2014 that the company

407
00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:04.320
has started this like a
companywide mobilize effort to train

408
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.120
more developers in iOS. And
because it was not possible

409
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.870
to hire, hire people fast
enough. And I think the

410
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.910
whole industry was sort of
hurting for trying to like

411
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.990
hire enough mobile, mobile developers.
And so, because of that,

412
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.670
I got to be on
the end of, I was

413
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.000
helping to train other iOS
developers. And I think that's

414
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.910
really when I, it was
when I started to realize

415
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.160
that like other people, I
was able to help other

416
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.730
people and they were, they
were becoming their own iOS

417
00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.070
developers. That's when I started
to think of myself as

418
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.410
like, Oh, like I'm a
little bit more senior now.

419
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.470
Like I've actually, I've learned
something in the last, in

420
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.800
the last, a year and
a half. Yeah. It's funny

421
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.800
how it's a gradient and
it just of sneaks up

422
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.420
on you. And then there's
just a day, there's a

423
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.940
random Tuesday where you're like,
wait, I actually do know

424
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.810
what I'm doing. That's pretty
cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

425
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.850
that was in, that was
in 2014 and 2014 is

426
00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.670
also, I believe when Swift
was announced. Right. And that

427
00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:04.390
summer. And it was around
that time that we had

428
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.730
been, we had been sort
of making a lot of

429
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.830
noise about the app, you
know, to app when it

430
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.620
was originally architected, as they
said, it was for like,

431
00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.500
not as a native app.
And it was for it's

432
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.480
sort of different era of
apps. And we were just

433
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.990
hitting on against like all
sorts of code smell, technical

434
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.920
debt was taking a lot
longer to release features. And

435
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.530
so we had sort of
been, we had been pushing

436
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.320
for be able to rewrite
the app for a bit

437
00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:33.340
by this. And around the
time design was also in

438
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.340
product, they were also pushing
for a bunch of new

439
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.890
changes and the two things
sort of came to head

440
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.830
and it was sort of
like, well, like if we

441
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.560
really want to do this,
you're also going to need

442
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.250
a rewrite. And so we
got this rewrite approved and

443
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.130
we're having like discussions about
what our technical stack is.

444
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.700
And that like Swift's is
announced a at an all

445
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.240
is sort of all happened
around around the same time.

446
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.150
And we had this sort
of thing where like, well,

447
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.610
we don't rewrite the app
all the time. Like, what

448
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.080
are we going to do?
Like, are we going to

449
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.090
do the rewrites and objective
C, are we going to

450
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:10.750
do the rewrite in Swift?
And we ultimately voted to

451
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.560
do the rewrite in Swift.
And that's, that's how we

452
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.190
ended up doing this Swift
adopting Swifts the next year.

453
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.820
Well, technology moves fast. Yeah.
It was really a, like

454
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:27.520
a bunch of things sort
of happened at the same

455
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.060
time. And there was a
worry that we weren't sure

456
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.310
like what the support was
going to be for objective

457
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.650
C or how much we're
nice to start feeling left

458
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:40.360
out if we didn't adopt
Swift. And it seems like

459
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.580
a really attempting opportunity to
be able to start a

460
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.320
brand new code base and
also to be able to

461
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.280
do it in this new
language. One thing that we

462
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.590
talked about before that we
wanted to make sure we

463
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.800
didn't, we covered on the,
on the podcast was an

464
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.510
interesting ism sometimes on the
podcast we've talked about, about

465
00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.420
the different levels of privilege.
And we've talked about being

466
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.160
a man in tech, being
a woman in tech, being

467
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.380
a person of color in
tech. But you said that

468
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.710
recently you had a conversation
with someone about ageism, but

469
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.750
maybe not the kind of
ageism that people usually think

470
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.960
of. Yeah. They're asking about
what we thought, what I

471
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.070
thought about ageism in tech
and, and to be totally

472
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.790
clear, like that's definitely something
that suffer from the tech

473
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.100
industry. Right. There's a whole
thing. It's like, he needs

474
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.670
to be like a young
genius, you know, recent college

475
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.450
dropout or graduated from like
the right university. But I

476
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:36.100
actually think that for many
of us women in tech,

477
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:41.350
we suffer from reverse ageism.
When, when I joined LinkedIn,

478
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.650
I think I had been
at the company about a

479
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.060
year and someone who joined
the company and she is

480
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.550
talking to me and she
was like, Oh yeah. So

481
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.640
like you just graduated. Right.
I was like, no, I

482
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.490
just did a PhD. Like
I've been working for like

483
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.070
three areas now. Like I
just felt like she just

484
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.490
like subtracted like five or
six years of like, experience

485
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.900
that I'd had like completely
away from me. And it's

486
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.410
sort of funny because I've
talked to other friends out

487
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.180
there. So, you know, I
have a friend who, she's

488
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.440
a VP of engineering at
a startup and she's in

489
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.240
her mid thirties now. And
regularly people assume that she's

490
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.080
in her twenties and ironically
they'll, they may like defer

491
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.420
to say, like, I'm the
CTO at the company who

492
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.810
is actually in his mid
twenties. They like do like,

493
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.470
it's a very interesting sort
of thing where they, like,

494
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.350
it's fine for him to,
to look young and be

495
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.470
young. But for her, like
if they think that she's

496
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.290
young, then they're like automatically
giving her less respect Is,

497
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.960
and I'm, I'm, I'm trying
to, I'm not, I'm not

498
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.430
trying to dance around this,
but I'm trying to make

499
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:57.080
sure I pick the right
words. Is this a, for

500
00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.270
lack of another word, men
are not very good at

501
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.170
maintaining themselves or moisturizing or
whatever. Like, you know, I'm,

502
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.020
I'm over 40, but if
I shave, I could maybe

503
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.240
pass for 35, but if
I don't, I've got gray

504
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.850
in my beard and night,
somebody might assume I'm 45.

505
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.260
You, you, on the other
hand could easily pass for

506
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.960
25. And that could cause,
you know, cause you problems

507
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.210
from a career perspective when
someone doesn't realize you've been

508
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.210
doing this for 15 years.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know,

509
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:26.750
I, it's interesting because, so
I think there's definitely a

510
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:31.100
part there's definitely an interesting
sort of race aspect to

511
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.050
this. And you know, I
definitely, I know I get

512
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.420
this from my mom. My
mom like tells me all

513
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.730
the time that when she,
when she was pregnant with

514
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.610
me, that people used to
give, like my dad likes

515
00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.670
eyes. Cause they thought that
he had like knocks up

516
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.680
this woman who was like
way younger than that. When

517
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.530
in reality there's like two,
three years between them. Right.

518
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.810
But she just looks so
much younger than she is.

519
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.840
And my friend, I was
just mentioning, right? Like she's

520
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.390
Asian, et cetera. And I
think there's like a fair

521
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.790
amount of people, like from
different races where you often

522
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.820
look younger than your, and
your age is sort of,

523
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:07.400
it's an interesting kind of
like intersection thing where you,

524
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.980
you cross like being a
woman in tech and maybe

525
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.400
people assuming that you don't
have as much experience. And

526
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.360
then also looking at your
age for various reasons, genetics,

527
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.380
whatever it is you end
up in this scenario where

528
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.520
sometimes for you're around for
a while and people make

529
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.010
a lot of assumptions about
what you do or do

530
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:32.180
not know. Right. There are
definitely, there are genetic aspects

531
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.730
of things. There are, I
should say, there are, there

532
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.990
are potentially racial issues. My
wife is, is from Zimbabwe.

533
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.370
She's black, she's in her
mid as well. But she

534
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.640
recently started a new career
as a nurse. Yeah. Every

535
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.290
everyone assumes she's 25 and
this isn't like sometimes it's

536
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.110
flattering, but sometimes it's like,
you know, as though when

537
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.910
they hear that she has
a 12 year old son

538
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.590
and they think she's 25,
then a lot of really

539
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.200
weird assumptions happen. And they
also forget that she's got

540
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.340
an MBA and deliver the
other advanced degrees. And then

541
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.650
you can, she says that
you can see a visual

542
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.950
shift in their posture and
their behavior towards her when

543
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:17.230
they literally go, Oh, you're
20 years older than I

544
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.140
thought you were, you are
almost double know. And then

545
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.360
from an experience perspective, it's
like, Oh, I thought you

546
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:27.220
had two years experience. You
have 10 times that. And

547
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:32.130
then they behave differently around
I actually, I, so I

548
00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.580
waited a while to take
my driver to get my

549
00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.580
driver's license. And when I
finally did, I actually failed

550
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:43.050
it the first time and
the guy driver, he, the

551
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.180
instructor gave me this weird
feedback. He said, Oh, I

552
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.850
think you're moving your hands
on the, on the steering

553
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.410
wheel too much. I was
like, what does that even

554
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.690
mean? And so I went
back to my dry reading

555
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.940
structure and I did one
more thing. And he was

556
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.130
like, I don't know what
that means. Go back. Hopefully

557
00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.110
you'll get like somebody else.
But of course, you know,

558
00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.720
I'm in champagne, Illinois. And
I got the same guy

559
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.560
again. And this time he
made this comment near the

560
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.080
beginning, the first time he'd
been sort of furiously taking

561
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.020
notes the whole time. And
this time he looks at

562
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.880
me and he said, he
goes, Oh, so are you

563
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.180
cutting school? And I listened
to him. I said, no,

564
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.600
I, I work. I work
at Wolfram research, but yeah.

565
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.600
And so I'm just coming
in late today and he

566
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.740
goes, Oh, and his entire
demeanor shifted, he stopped taking

567
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.130
notes. And this is again,
like less than a week

568
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.280
since like the first time.
And he passed me. He

569
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.500
just like assumed that I
was a high schooler and

570
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.920
was like, grading me on
this like extra curve because

571
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.900
he thought that it was
17. And I was about

572
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.880
to like crash my car
or something. I don't know

573
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.850
what it was. It was
very, it was very interesting

574
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.990
to see like that shift,
like the same person. Very

575
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.170
interesting. Well, that is all
the time we have, but

576
00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.360
I really appreciate you chatting
with me today about, you

577
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.650
know, programming across the stack.
Oh yeah. Thanks time. Time

578
00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.760
flew by. Surely did. This
has been another episode of

579
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.220
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
