00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.000
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number 524. In this episode,

10
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.380
Scott talks with venture capitalist,
Arlin Hamilton about investing in

11
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:11.270
underrepresented tech founders. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

12
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.910
another episode of Hansel minutes
today. I'm talking with Arlan

13
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.690
Hamilton from backstage capital. We
met at a startup event

14
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.030
and you are a VC
and that's just VC is

15
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.560
just such an impressive thing
to me because like, it

16
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.560
just seems like it would
be inaccessible people in ivory

17
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.070
towers with bags of money.
That's right. Yeah, that's me.

18
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.680
Is that pretty much? It
that's it that's the interview

19
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.620
is over. We're in your
ivory tower right now. Where's

20
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.940
the bag of money though.
I'm still chasing it. So

21
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.020
when, when someone is a
VC, does that mean that

22
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.990
you are sitting on some
pile of money, whether it

23
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.140
be yours or someone else's
Right. So the reason that

24
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.620
I'm venture capital and not
angel is because I am

25
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.520
investing other people's money. So
other people have entrusted me

26
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.390
with their, you know, amount
of money. It's a small

27
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.750
amount of money compared to
most VC funds. Okay. But

28
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.720
it is VC. It's just,
the definition is, is investing

29
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.740
in other people's Cash. Okay.
So then an angel investor

30
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.860
would be someone that just
on a one on one

31
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.970
basis, like, you know, let's
say that you had $10 million

32
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.790
of your own money, and
I have an idea. I

33
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.830
come to you and you
are my angel and give

34
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.020
me that money. And then
there's a contract involved that's

35
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.350
angel. Right? So yeah, so
most angel investors, I mean,

36
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.880
it ranges, but most angel
investors invest anywhere from five

37
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.030
to 10 K to a
million of their own money.

38
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.940
Usually it's in the 10
K to a hundred K

39
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.940
range and they do so
either pre-seed before you've raised

40
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.060
from outside sources. So like
usually an angel, that's why

41
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.250
they're called angels because they
kind of swoop in and

42
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.070
save the day a little
bit and kind of get

43
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.990
you to the next step
so that you are then

44
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.580
able to get the metrics
where you can talk to

45
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.770
VCs. So, because my fund
is so small, I kind

46
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.850
of, I'm kind of in
the middle there. So people

47
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.130
seem, I like to call
it VC money with an

48
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.640
angel vibe, you know, so
people kind of see me

49
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.410
early, see me earlier than
they would see a lot

50
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.530
of VC. Am I allowed
to ask how big your

51
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.030
fund is? Yeah. So it's,
we're raising a few million.

52
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.120
I'm gonna just leave it
at that. Okay. So it's

53
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.130
less than 10 million, more than
one and yeah, it's going.

54
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.160
So you said that an
angel might invest like 10

55
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.650
K that's. Right. Like when
I hear a number like

56
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.450
that, you know, I mean,
I don't have big money,

57
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.970
but if I wanted to
buy like a Honda, I

58
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.220
could probably raise 10, 15
grand and go and buy

59
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.590
my Honda. Why would I
want to go to an

60
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.070
angel? If I could go
to the bank As a,

61
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.280
as a founder, As a
person who's founding something. Well,

62
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.810
a lot of times it's
really hard to get money

63
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.900
from the bank coming in.
So sometimes you can't, it

64
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.000
just depends on your personal
profile. A lot of times,

65
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.580
you know, I don't know
too much about the, the

66
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.270
lending space, but except, except
for my experience and what

67
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.000
I've heard. And sometimes it's
just simply hard to access

68
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.610
more than 10,000. And lot
of times you need, you're

69
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.970
raising like, you know, at
least 50 K if you're,

70
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.900
if you're very early, right.
And so you don't necessarily

71
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.150
just have one angel you'll
have, you'll try to put

72
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.090
together around maybe three or
four angels that know each

73
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.900
other that you can convince
to come along. And so

74
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.470
an individual or two founders
who are working on an

75
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.730
idea, they're not necessarily going
to be able to convince

76
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.350
their local bank to entrust
them with that. And they

77
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.270
don't want to take on
that sort of debt either.

78
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.270
In most cases, you don't
want to take on, you

79
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.630
know, that sort of personal
debt. And I would guess

80
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.580
a kind of answering my
own question that if I

81
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.560
was going to buy a
car, at least if the

82
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.930
thing goes bad, they're going
to take my car. Right?

83
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.770
Yeah. Yeah. So it gets
really murky when you kind

84
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.950
of, especially early on, you
know, that there's a lot

85
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.520
of debt that happens later.
And in fact, a lot

86
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.770
of these early rounds of
angel money and VC money

87
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.590
are convertible notes, which is,
which is convertible debt into

88
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.060
equity. So it starts off
as you're writing a note

89
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.740
to someone that says I'm,
you're lending me a 25

90
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.190
K angel note. And if
I hit certain, keep, you

91
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:42.270
know, certain milestones, milestones, thank
you then that, that converts

92
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.910
to equity. So most of
the time it's like if

93
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.060
I, if we're raising and
you're saying that my company

94
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.460
is worth 500,000, you're giving
me 10,000. If I raise,

95
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.700
well, you don't actually put
a value on it, but

96
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.640
that's sort of what's, what's
what it's where it's coming

97
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.100
from. But you're saying if
I raise 500,000 on a

98
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.370
2 million valuation, then your money
turns into your debt that

99
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.940
you've given me, turns into
equity. It converts convert to

100
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.440
equity. And you're getting a
better rate than the person

101
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.740
who comes in later Because
you came in early and

102
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.190
You took more of the
risk. Usually you ask for

103
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.140
a discount and this is
from like a, an angel

104
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.690
energy point of view. Usually
you ask for some sort

105
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.220
of discount somewhere between 10
and 25% discount. So you

106
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.800
know, something. And I think
that's, that's great for both

107
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.750
sides because you're, you're taking
the most risk. You know,

108
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.170
if that person decides to
go to Mexico, it, you're

109
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.720
not necessarily going to be
able to get your, your

110
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.440
loan back, even though it
is a convertible. Nope. So

111
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.990
then people at that level
need to be like, it's

112
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.720
like plan roulette. It's like
all or nothing. You're you

113
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.850
have to be totally ready
to lose everything. Oh, absolutely.

114
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.860
You have a, I forgot
who called it this, but

115
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.460
it is like a lottery
ticket. I'm sure a lot

116
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.080
of people call it that.
But if someone particularly can't

117
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.810
remember, but yeah, it is
like, you know, if you're,

118
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.320
if you decide to invest,
I know it was David Rose

119
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.760
and his book angel investing.
If you decide to invest

120
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.810
in five companies, you know,
and you spend 50,000, you

121
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.490
just kind of have to
assume that you never going

122
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.400
to see that money again.
And that's why you have

123
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.220
to, if you're an angel,
you need to be doing

124
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.930
this for something other than
just returns because it's such

125
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.420
a risk. It's why it's
called, What does it say

126
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.270
about the lottery that it's
for entertainment purposes. Yeah, exactly.

127
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.040
Right. And you know, it's
also important to have a

128
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.350
large portfolio and to kind
of hedge your bets, especially

129
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.480
if you're dealing with, if
you're doing this on the

130
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.660
side, if this is something
you're trying out and you're,

131
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.930
you're, you're, you know, investing
in friends or people in

132
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.790
the community community that, you
know, definitely don't put all

133
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.130
of your eggs in one
basket. Cause you're just gonna,

134
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.510
you're, you're really playing roulette
at that point When someone

135
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.610
invests and we're still talking
about angel and we'll kind

136
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.260
of go from Angela VC
in a second, when someone

137
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.920
invests like that, how many
strings are attached? Is it

138
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.170
all pendant depend on the
person's personality? Like if I

139
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.940
gave money, I might say,
all right, well, call me

140
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.260
in a year and let
me know how it goes,

141
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.240
right. Or am I going
to start rolling in every

142
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.090
week and like leaning over
your shoulder and looking at

143
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.000
it, looking at your PowerPoint.
Yeah. So hopefully you don't

144
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.610
do that because you'll really
start to annoy a founder.

145
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.370
If you do that. So
additional, it depends also like

146
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.420
what your, what your value
add is as an investor.

147
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.830
So a lot of times
when you start investing angel

148
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.860
money, it's because if you're
in the position to do

149
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.890
so, you know, you're accredited,
which means you make 200,000

150
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.270
a year or more, or
you have a million in

151
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.190
assets, usually that's the case.
That means that you have

152
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.530
some sort of, some level
of success and you have

153
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.680
some level of expertise. So
you want to share that

154
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.890
with other people. And this
is a way to do

155
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.040
a friend of mine calls
it, angel investing, like paying

156
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:14.520
to work because she invests
money. And that kind of

157
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.050
gives her the access to
the, these exciting founders, working

158
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.260
on exciting things to her.
And then, because she has

159
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.820
worked on something, you know,
some in some way, she

160
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.950
has this expertise that she
can give and this knowledge,

161
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:35.790
but you also really want
to be aware of if

162
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.450
you're needed, you know, it's
one thing to say, yes,

163
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.090
I'm available. Call me or
email me. If you have

164
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.510
a question or we can
do like a, a quarterly

165
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.660
meeting or a monthly phone
call or something. It's another

166
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.110
thing to have someone who
put in 10,000 to a

167
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.360
$200,000 round who is calling
you like every other day

168
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.360
and asking how things are
going. That's not okay. It's

169
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.060
just, you're getting, you want
your company, these companies to

170
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.970
do the best they can.
Right. And two things. One

171
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.150
is you're getting in their
way. The second is if

172
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.970
you have to help them
that much, you've probably made

173
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.790
a bad investment out the
gate. They need to be

174
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:20.730
self sufficient and you need
to ex to be a

175
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.020
nice accessory to that and
be helpful. And certainly I

176
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.850
see. So you're not buying
your way into being a

177
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.750
third founder, unless you are
bringing big money. Exactly. And

178
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.400
it goes both ways because
sometimes founders can be needy,

179
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.120
especially early and they can
ask too much of you

180
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.350
as an investor. So there
is sort of, it has

181
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.420
a lot of, there's a
lot of variables, but it

182
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.620
is sort of figuring out
that how, you know, that

183
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:55.160
balance. Okay. So that's what
angels do, you are running

184
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.040
a VC fund, right? So
then you are the VC,

185
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.620
right? And do you have
kind of two jobs, you

186
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.050
have to go around and
find companies that are worthy

187
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.150
of investment, but then you
also need to find people

188
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.310
who want to invest. So
you you're kind of the

189
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:12.590
middle, the middle person. Yes.
So, and every, the, the

190
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.450
cool thing is, I think
that's why I was kind

191
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.110
of fascinated by this is
that, you know, founders go

192
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.030
around. If they, if they
make it to the point

193
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.840
where they're past angel or
they're needing also an addition

194
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.480
of VC money, they're going
to hear a lot of

195
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.000
nos and they're going to,
you know, sometimes take it

196
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.170
personally and wonder, you know,
why, why me, but every

197
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.950
single venture fund venture fund
that they have asked has

198
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.260
had to do the same
thing. They've had to go

199
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.900
around and ask other people
for money and that those

200
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.720
are LPs or limited partners.
And that can be a

201
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.120
variety of, of types of
entities and individuals, but they

202
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.470
they've gone through that whole
process too. And the goal

203
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.520
is to re raise the
fund, have the fund raised

204
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.580
and go out and deploy
capital. And then maybe two

205
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.060
to three years later after
you've done, done great things

206
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.730
with that fund and you've
deployed 75% or so of

207
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.520
it, you go out and
raise another one. What usually

208
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.400
happens though, is that you
finish raising a fund or

209
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.200
you, it takes you months
and months and months to

210
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.680
raise a fund. Maybe a
couple of years, you're investing

211
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:23.050
as you go. And by
the time you're done raising

212
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.260
very soon after you need
to raise your second fund,

213
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.270
either to have more seed
money or to follow on

214
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.170
and, and support the companies
you've already invested in and

215
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:40.060
the next round. So it's
a constant, it's constant Lee

216
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.480
boat. Isn't, isn't that kind
of like the balance of

217
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.300
campaigning to become a Senator
and then actually doing the

218
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.980
work of a Senator. Cause
sometimes I'm like, are you

219
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.350
all working or do you
just want to get elected?

220
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.230
Yeah. And you know, I
keep hearing people, you know,

221
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.790
I'm, I'm, I'm not very,
I'm not an insider Silicon

222
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.430
Valley insider or anything like
that. But I hang around

223
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.410
with a lot of people
in Silicon Valley. And I

224
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.820
keep hearing this thing about
founders who are supposedly falling

225
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.550
in love with fundraising, and
I want to meet them

226
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.480
and ask them why they
fall in love with it.

227
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.270
I didn't get it. The
people are, if you have

228
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.550
a hot product and people
were throwing money at you

229
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.740
and you have to decide
between this million dollar check

230
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.330
on that million dollar check,
I guess that could be

231
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.960
fun. But I find it
to be my least favorite

232
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.720
part. All I want to
do is work with founders

233
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.800
and the capital is that
tool that, that makes that

234
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.810
happen. But all I want
to do is work with

235
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.090
founders. I don't want to
go to dinners and schmooze,

236
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.790
and I just want to
innate help enable founders to

237
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.580
do what they're great at.
And so I feel their

238
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.360
pain when they're raising. I
think, yeah. I think if

239
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.720
it's especially feature first time
raising it's, it's not this

240
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.080
fun, fun thing. You're not
into the glamour and the

241
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.050
cocktail parties you're into the
ship shipping. Yeah, absolutely. You

242
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.970
know, it's, it's, it's great.
I mean, it's not, I'm

243
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.090
not saying it's bad or
that other people shouldn't do

244
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.280
it because I have to
do that sometimes. And I

245
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.870
get it, but it's just
not, it's not my favorite.

246
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.070
There's better things to be
doing with your time. Oh,

247
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.880
I can see where someone
can get kind of caught

248
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.820
up in the glamour of
it all. And I, I

249
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.460
tweeted something recently that cut,
we've got a lot of

250
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.420
retweets that was that someone
said I'm a founder and

251
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.880
someone else said to them,
this was at a Panera.

252
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.890
They said, well, Hey, you're
at a Panera bread and

253
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.730
you just registered a domain.
So you need to bring

254
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.120
it and bring it down
a bit. It seems like

255
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.610
people are exactly. People need
to understand that there are

256
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.490
those that just love to
say founder. And they love

257
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.590
to say VC and they
get all wrapped up in

258
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.410
the clamor of all that.
But there's, there's, there's real

259
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.270
work to be done. It's
not just flying all over

260
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.430
the place. Right. I assume
there's a lot of legal

261
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.890
frameworks and stuff. Yes. There's,
I've signed so many documents

262
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.520
and I've learned so much
over the past year and

263
00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.320
a half, especially that I
never imagined I'd have to

264
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.790
understand, you know, these inner
workings. I mean, everyone sees,

265
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.640
Oh, you ha you're raising
money and you have money

266
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.030
and then you deploy money.
That's great. There's so much

267
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.180
more that goes on behind
the scenes with lawyers and

268
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:20.810
back office accounting and so
many regulations. And so in

269
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.300
fact, you know, it's, it's,
I have to think very

270
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.760
carefully about what I can
say here. Oh, well, while

271
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.960
I'm still raising the funds.
Interesting. So it kind of

272
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.600
makes me think about like
the, the abstract idea of,

273
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.850
I want to buy a
house and then the, all

274
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.460
right, I'm going to sign
50 pages. There's like huge

275
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.910
stack of paperwork and all
of the legal framework within

276
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.070
getting a mortgage. Yeah. I
would imagine so I've never

277
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.920
bought a house, but I
would imagine it's pretty close

278
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.500
to that. Yeah. Or maybe
it's like, I want to

279
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.710
buy like a neighborhood because
you think of it, like

280
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.000
not only forming the fund,
but then dealing with dozens

281
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.570
of companies And you'll find
that there's really nothing. Really.

282
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.020
Yeah. I could do this
on my sleep. Yeah, that's

283
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.030
right. Yeah. So it's, it's
a lot of paperwork. It's

284
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:11.500
a lot of managing personalities
and not too much ego

285
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:18.580
on the founder side, especially
really, really sincere, interesting unique

286
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:24.400
founders, but it's, it is
a little bit difficult when

287
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.820
there's so much going on
at once. So yeah. I

288
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.880
am doing this a little
bit differently than most funds

289
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.980
do, so that's Okay. So
let's talk about that. So

290
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.170
why are you doing things
differently? I assume that there

291
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.920
are other people with multimillion
dollar, you keep saying not

292
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.080
too big, but feel, it
feels like a lot to

293
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.660
me, but you know, I'm
sure there are billion dollar

294
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.590
funds and hundred million dollar
funds still multimillion dollar funds.

295
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.830
Are there a lot of
small ish funds out there

296
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.350
that are Well there's there?
I mean, there are a

297
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.580
lot of first time quiet
funds that don't kind of

298
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.270
make a big noise that
are somewhere between two and

299
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.380
$10 million. And they're doing what
I'm doing, which is establishing

300
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.280
a track record. And so
they, they can raise a

301
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.770
bigger fund, which is kind
of the route. But for

302
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.880
the most part, when you
say micro VC, you're talking

303
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.150
about anywhere between 25 million and
a hundred million, that's a

304
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:23.170
micro, That's a microbes. Wow.
So you're a nano. Yeah,

305
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.230
exactly. You nano. Okay. I
was thinking, trying to figure

306
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.120
out the word for it,
but yes, I'm a nano

307
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.940
fun. I like that. It
reminds me of the old

308
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.100
iPods, but yes. So, and
then, so I know some

309
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:43.180
people who have two, three,
$6 million funds and that's kind

310
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.390
of where I'm going to
be. Okay. So when, when

311
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.490
someone, and again, we can
speak in the abstract. So

312
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:49.410
I don't want you to
feel I'm putting you on

313
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.030
the spot, but when someone
has a fun and you're

314
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.000
the middle person or the
middleman, as they say colloquially,

315
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.460
then how do you pay
the rent? How does the

316
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.760
fund person get paid? When
you have founders who want

317
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.920
to get paid and ship,
when you have investors who

318
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.660
very likely want to get
paid a lot, because they

319
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.870
invested a lot and then
you are, you know, overhead

320
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.410
and management, but you still
have to leave. Right? So

321
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:15.890
the, the normal model is
taken from the hedge fund

322
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.680
model, which is two and
20. That's kind of like

323
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.580
your basic average way to
do it, which means 20%

324
00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:27.050
carry, which is the pro
the profit share that the

325
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.530
fund managers get to enjoy
at the end of the

326
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.200
day, The thing becomes the
next Facebook and you get

327
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.470
20% of that Pretty much.
And so that's all I'll

328
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.340
tell you. So the 22%
is the management fee per

329
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.210
year, and it tapers off
the longer the fund goes.

330
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.920
So if the fund is
10 years and you know,

331
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.510
in your fifth year, you
start to get like maybe

332
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.940
one and a half percent
could, you're doing less with

333
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.130
that fund. And then you
start to have stacked funds.

334
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.200
Hopefully if you've done a
good job, you have two

335
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.940
or three funds going at
the same time. So you

336
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.760
don't need to be charging
these LPs or these limited

337
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.010
partners who invested in you.
You don't need to be

338
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.160
charging them to a full
2%, six years into the

339
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.740
game. If you've already done
all the work three years

340
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.280
ago. So the 2%, if
you do the math on

341
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.180
like a $50 million fund, that's
enough to have a couple

342
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.560
of partners to have an
assistant, to have an office

343
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.710
travel, pay the bills, keep
the lights on. It's not

344
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.410
a great amount, but it's,
it's a good solid amount.

345
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.450
And then do the math
on that when it becomes

346
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.530
a $200 million fund or a
billion dollar fund now a

347
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.880
$10 million fund or $5 million fund,
like more like what I'm

348
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.870
doing that is. So I'm
just going to be poor

349
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:46.070
for them for seven years.
So I have enough to

350
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.770
let me go meet founders
and meet potential investors and

351
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:56.690
to take some potential investors
bowling, which is my preference.

352
00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.930
I made sure that that
was in the budget and

353
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:05.180
I can eat and I
can sleep soundly and, and

354
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.830
bring on a couple of
people to help me. But

355
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.880
it's very, very, very bootstrapped
and very kind of great,

356
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.370
Interesting. So when we think
about number like I'm listening

357
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.730
and people are probably listening,
going, Oh, $10 million funds, big

358
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.460
numbers, that's amazing. And you
know, we're bowling and going

359
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.820
to Chipotle. Absolutely. Yeah. I
mean, and also, I mean,

360
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:27.530
someone who's doing a $25 million
fund 500,000 a year when

361
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.930
you have one or two
partners and you have to

362
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.090
travel, you have to pay
for all these conferences, you

363
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.960
have to pay for your
whole back office, everything it's.

364
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.290
I mean, these people aren't,
you know, I don't feel

365
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.500
sorry for them, you know,
but it is, you have

366
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.480
to really think about the
math of it. And so

367
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.390
someone who's raising anywhere between,
I'd say two and 40

368
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.360
or $50 million, and it's just
them or a couple of

369
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.350
people they're doing it for
some really interesting reasons, not

370
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.290
to say that bigger ones.
Aren't, I'm just saying kind

371
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.450
of really know that the
ones that are doing a

372
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.120
small ones are now, the
carrier is interesting too. And

373
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.740
that's, you know, I'm certainly
not doing this strictly out

374
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.590
of the goodness of my
heart. Well, so it sounds

375
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.080
to me like this is
an investment by you as

376
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.210
well. You are investing five
to seven years of your

377
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.090
time. You could go and
get a job, you know,

378
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.980
making more, being more successful
early on, but maybe the

379
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.100
long seven, 10 years down
the road, It's very much

380
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.840
so like a founder who
believes in their company. That's

381
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.090
another reason I can relate
to the founders. It's very

382
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.900
much so like that. I
believe in what I'm investing

383
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.910
in. I believe this is
the way to do it.

384
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.800
This is the way that
I will have the most

385
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.650
success at it. And I
think that in five to

386
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.550
10 years, I will be
a millionaire because of it.

387
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.050
So I'm very excited about
that. It's not why I'm

388
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:56.580
doing it, but it's, it's,
it's part of why, I

389
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.380
guess it's part of why
I'm doing They're building. Right.

390
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.690
And it's funny that you,
it seems so obvious. And

391
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.480
this is the thing about
hindsight, right? Hindsight in this

392
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.720
case is two minutes ago
where I was thinking, Oh

393
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.930
wow, this lovely VC, all
this money, you're the, you're

394
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.810
a founder as well. Right.
And you are founding your

395
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.420
startup and you're a startup.
Is this investment portfolio that

396
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.730
is you. And you're in
it, not for a year,

397
00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.740
not for two years, but
for a decade or more.

398
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.550
Yeah. The, the legal length
or the legal life of

399
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.030
the fund is 10 years.
Oh, wow. And so that's

400
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.240
also when the LPs limited
partners are thinking about putting

401
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.360
their money and they're thinking
it's going to be illiquid

402
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.950
for that amount of time
feel liquid, which exactly it's

403
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.530
going to be for the
most part, unless, you know,

404
00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.320
there may be this there,
the Instagrams of the world

405
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.870
that come along and 18
months into it, you're, you're

406
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.310
sitting pretty, but that's very
rare. You don't, please don't

407
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.830
go into it thinking that
as an LP or as

408
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.960
an angel. Well, the thing
that struck me also, that

409
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.750
was when you said that
you might spend a year

410
00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.390
or two raising money that
made me think about the

411
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.700
opportunity cost of the money
that you, that is being

412
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.650
invested, where those, those investors
kind of upstream have given

413
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.840
you X million dollars. And
they're not going to see

414
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.050
anything for years. And even
for the first two years,

415
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.270
they could be calling you,
Hey, two years later. Hey,

416
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.730
so did you deploy, I'm
going to use your terminology

417
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.220
now that I've learned to
deploy that money? Well, no,

418
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.700
we're still raising that's opportunity
costs for them to, and

419
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.070
that money's not going anywhere.
Well, well, yeah. So in

420
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.670
some cases I have to
figure out how to say

421
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.550
this without getting in trouble.
My lawyer will never hear

422
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:36.540
this hopefully, but in some
cases you don't deploy until

423
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.330
you've done a first close
or you've raised a whole

424
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.540
fund. But in other cases,
you deploy right out the

425
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.700
gate, which is what I'm
doing. I'm, I've invested in

426
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.010
at this point, it's in
six companies. I don't know

427
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.590
when this is going to
play, but this point I've

428
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.880
invested in six companies and
got my first LP check

429
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.240
in September. So six, less
than six months ago. So

430
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.030
I'm on a tear. Is
this a new way to

431
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.070
do things? Is this risky
or is this just a

432
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.680
new way? I think it's,
I don't think it's a

433
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.900
new way. I'm sure other
people have done it before.

434
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.590
It's just, again, I'm doing
the reason that what I'm

435
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.550
doing is different is that
as someone I recently met

436
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.660
said she had never seen
someone start a VC fund

437
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:25.570
from a standing start, like
from, from scratch. Usually you

438
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.880
start a company, you start
a VC fund because you're

439
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.940
already an angel investor. You've
invested in lots of companies.

440
00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.100
You have your own money.
You have, you know, maybe

441
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.470
10% of the fund you
put in yourself, or you

442
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.920
have people around you, you
can put in, or you've

443
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.680
worked at a major fund
and you want to do

444
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.000
your own thing now. And
again, you have this access

445
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.970
to, to, to money and
to other people that have

446
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:54.970
money and you were, you
know, that's how you start.

447
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.190
And that's not to say
that it's easy, but it

448
00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:02.200
is easier than starting with
nothing. I mean, last year

449
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.770
I was homeless for several
days. I mean, I say

450
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.320
days and it actually was
much longer than that. I

451
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.670
was homeless for awhile. So
to start from nothing to

452
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.090
go here, that's why it's
different. So that's why I'm

453
00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.640
doing it the way I
am, because I'm con I'm

454
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.930
hacking my way into venture
capital, But we're still talking

455
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.130
about multimillion dollar funds, which
is what's. So what's cool

456
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.900
about it. So when I
think about qualifications and, and

457
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.710
you know, like friction, it's
funny, someone was saying like,

458
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:40.000
what is, tell me, what
is Batman superpower is that

459
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.120
he's rich. Exactly how to
think about that for a

460
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.570
second. Yeah. He's rich White
privilege is Bruce rains, that

461
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.030
stats and that's his power.
That's pretty crazy to think

462
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.620
about that. So when I
think about like, well, you

463
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.000
know, if I meet some,
why aren't you a VC?

464
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.610
Who are you? Why are
you so fancy that I'm

465
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.320
not a VC? Are we
going to do this kind

466
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.830
of armchair quarterbacking? And I
might think to myself, well,

467
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.380
this person is super rich
because they made money on

468
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.340
Facebook. And that is simply
their qualification, which is arguably

469
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.160
either luck or skill or
a little of both. Sure.

470
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.790
And then, or maybe they
are like a Ivy league

471
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.300
graduate that worked for a
big fund and has an

472
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.910
MBA of some kind. Maybe
they're not rich, but they

473
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:23.230
are like rich, adjacent. You
know what I mean? I

474
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.520
know a lot of those,
you know what I mean?

475
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.160
Like, cause I, again, thinking
of myself as an armchair

476
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.290
quarterback, I look and I
hear, Oh wow. This 27

477
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.270
year old is now working
at such and such a

478
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.550
fund. Like how in the
heck did you pull that

479
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.790
off? Sure. You know, again,
armchair quarterback like, man, why

480
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.350
am I not like that?
But then I realized, I

481
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.080
don't know anybody. I don't
have any money. So that's

482
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.370
kind of how it starts.
You just said that there

483
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.410
was a time when you
were homeless. That's not the

484
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.980
kind of thing that a
multimillion dollar Facebook type person

485
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.690
would say nor is a
type of person that a

486
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.170
Yale graduate would kind of
say, is that coming from

487
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.500
zero, your unique qualification that
allows you to spot a

488
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.990
founder, that's going to maybe
have it be more hungry

489
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.370
than other ones. Let's one
of the things. Yeah, it's

490
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.780
that relate-ability, I mean, in
a lot of cases, you

491
00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.330
know, kind of seeing tougher
times and some of the

492
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.730
founders that I invest in,
but I mean, come on,

493
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.870
I hear, I hear some
amazing stories from people and

494
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.540
it's not everyone that I'm
investing is like down and

495
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:26.660
out, but there's a grit
that is, yes. That is

496
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.910
just, they're built in two
founders who have something against

497
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.250
them when they walk out
the door every morning, you

498
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.360
know, like for me, I'm
black, black woman who's gay.

499
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.540
And so I have to
figure out, okay, when I,

500
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.940
when I leave the house
or the wherever, you know,

501
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.070
I have to say, okay,
what am I going to

502
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.560
be faced with today? What
is going to come at

503
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.290
me today? Because of one
of those things or a

504
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.580
couple of those things. Right.
And when you, it becomes,

505
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.150
it's almost like it's, it's
so normal now, so normalize,

506
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.490
I'm going, something's going to
happen. So when you have

507
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.790
people who have had, there's
a lot of people that

508
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.860
start on, they say they
started on third base, so,

509
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.080
right, Right, right. I always
talk about playing the game

510
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.110
at the easiest difficulty setting.
Yeah, exactly. So when you

511
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.470
have people who just, they
figured out, they have had

512
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.050
to figure stuff out their
entire life they've had to

513
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.710
survive. They've had to maybe
be two or three times

514
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:28.040
faster, better, smarter, just to
be seen as equal. Like,

515
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.300
you know, there's a lot
of like Ivy league grads

516
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:36.680
that I, that are underrepresented
and they, you hear them

517
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.200
talk and they had to
do so much more just

518
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.420
to get, just to be
kind of in the room.

519
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.670
Those are the kind of
people I want to invest

520
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.160
in. Right. And those people,
I can spot a mile

521
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.740
away. I can have a
15 minute conversation with someone.

522
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.290
And I know that, you
know, we talk about the

523
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.710
downturn in the market being
so, so horrible right now,

524
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.190
these people aren't running scared.
They're like, okay, bring it

525
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.220
like we'll, we'll turn 10 cents
into a dollar. Let's make

526
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.710
it happen. We'll make it
stretch. Those are the people

527
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.140
that you want to invest
in. You want to invest

528
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.600
in, you want to invest
in the Mark Zuckerbergs of

529
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.910
life. Of course you do,
but you don't want to

530
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:15.350
dismiss or overlook the ones
who are saying, how would

531
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:20.150
I have done Facebook, 10
times cheaper and 10 times

532
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.600
faster. That's an interesting place
than a lot of people

533
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.600
that I'm seeing are in.
People might think, hear numbers

534
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.100
like that. And think that
that's silly. But if you

535
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.780
look at some of the
smaller boots, like there's a,

536
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.660
there was a bootstrapped dating
site called plenty of fish.

537
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.060
I was like, yeah, it
was like one guy, you

538
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.420
know? And he was making
like 50 million a year. He

539
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.730
hacked his way through it.
Right. And without any, any

540
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.460
funding, the other thing that
makes me think about it

541
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.350
is it is not about
a culture of exclusion. It's

542
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.600
a wider net about including
it. Yeah, Exactly, exactly. And

543
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:54.870
that that's big for me
too. Like I, I, you

544
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.910
know, one of the things
that has happened that I've

545
00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:01.140
been turned off by is
if someone is like dogging

546
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.520
another company, or like other
founders are underrepresented and like

547
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.180
there's enough room for a
lot of people here and

548
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.730
we all need to kind
of we're all in this

549
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:15.450
together. So, you know, there's
no need for that sort

550
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.450
of energy. I think. And
I, I mean, some of

551
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:22.410
my best friends were white.
You know, one of the

552
00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.360
things that I thought was
interesting is I recently read

553
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.630
an article where a Trevor
Noah who now took over

554
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.880
the daily show was trying
to get a little more

555
00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:34.080
of an inclusive group of
people into his writers room.

556
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.640
And he went out and
said, all right, you know,

557
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.380
let's, let's mix it up
a little bit. And he

558
00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.220
wasn't getting any resumes. And
he tried to figure out,

559
00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.290
well, what's going on. Like,
I mean, here I am.

560
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.170
And I'm, you know, black
man, I'm running a TV

561
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:50.070
show and I want to
have a nice inclusive group

562
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.500
of people who are my
writers. And I've asked for

563
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.690
that and I can't get
them. And it turned out

564
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:58.530
that it was that the
people he wanted to hear

565
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.320
from didn't have agents. Sure.
So there was this, there

566
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.240
was this new thing. So
there's something as simple as,

567
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.040
I don't even know what
door to knock on lips.

568
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.730
So he actually went out
and leapfrog the agents and

569
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.160
found, you know, comedians. He
knew working in the neighborhoods

570
00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.960
and he's like, Hey, did
you hear that? I'm hiring

571
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.390
writers? And they had no
idea we had no. Well,

572
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.520
how come didn't your agent
tell you? I don't have

573
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.220
an agent. Yeah, no, that's
a really interesting thing. I

574
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.010
mean, I'm actually doing that,
but I hadn't really figured

575
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.780
out a way to kind
of explain it. That's really

576
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.920
cool. Cause I, I, I
call myself, like, I want

577
00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.150
to be like the OnRamp
for underrepresented founders who, who

578
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.960
don't have networking. You know,
they're always saying, they're always

579
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.720
saying like, you know, get
a warm introduction to the

580
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.060
VC and that's the best
way to do it. Because

581
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.010
if you can get a
warm introduction, then you have

582
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.090
pluck and you have, it's
not sometimes not that easy

583
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:54.260
to get a warm intro
to two Andreessen, you know,

584
00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.640
like, Yeah, yeah. Catch him
coming out of an elevator

585
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.800
in a hotel. I want
to talk to you. So

586
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.710
plus he blocked me on
Twitter, so that's not going

587
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.670
to happen. He's lovely. No,
I like, I like Mark.

588
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.850
Mark is an investor in
my fund. Yeah. Yeah. He's

589
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:15.000
very quietly did that. And
you know, he he's controversial.

590
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.370
Like he, well, there's, there's
a lot of people that

591
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:21.120
are, that I yell at
a lot on Twitter who

592
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.580
are also investors in my
fund. So I'll, I'll yell

593
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:29.040
at them and tell them
that they're being asses. And

594
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.610
while you, while you work
with them professionally. Yeah. Because

595
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.860
I mean, there's some people's
money I won't take. Absolutely.

596
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.780
Like I just won't and
I won't say who those

597
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.760
are, but of course I,
yeah, there's, that could be

598
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.270
a, probably a whole episode
about You get to choose

599
00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.190
who you invest in. You
choose who you take money

600
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.090
from and presumably the kinds
of companies that you want

601
00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.240
to invest in, people have
come to you for that

602
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.850
reason that you're finding the
gems. You're finding the yeah,

603
00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.970
That's right. Yeah. A lot
of, a lot of my

604
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:06.040
investors are excited that I
have the, the access to

605
00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.780
so many founders that they,
they thought weren't there. You

606
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.720
know, in some cases they
weren't looking hard enough. I

607
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.760
mean, in most cases that's
what it was. But in

608
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.700
some cases it's like, it's
the same thing. It's, it's

609
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.530
the same thing I said
about like having the access

610
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.920
to oral warm intro. Like
sometimes they don't know exactly

611
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.790
where to go, so I
can then be that bridge

612
00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.090
on both sides. And I'm
happy to, So where can

613
00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:34.240
people who are listening learn
about backstage capital. Yeah. So

614
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.710
we have a new website
it's backstage capital.com, which is

615
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.980
pretty handy. Yeah. Pretty pretty.
Yeah. I like that. It's

616
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.190
<inaudible> dot co or.io. Nope.
Not going to do it.

617
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.250
I'm not going to do
that. No. It's backstage capital.com,

618
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.400
which is kind of like
our little, our hub. And

619
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.000
then I'm all over personally,
all over Twitter and Instagram

620
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.730
and all that at Arlin
was here. A R L

621
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.870
a N was here and
you know, everything links back

622
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:05.350
to backstage. So, and I
truly, I know I probably

623
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.270
don't sound like you, but
I truly love being behind

624
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.480
the scenes and letting, letting
the founders sort of shine.

625
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.880
That's my deal. But I'll,
I'll still yell at people

626
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.750
on Twitter. I just that's
