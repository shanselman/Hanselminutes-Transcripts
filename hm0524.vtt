This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number 528. In this episode,

10
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.290
Scott talks with Rob Eisenberg
creator of the JavaScript framework.

11
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.660
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

12
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.450
Hanselminutes today. I'm talking with
Rob Eisenberg, JavaScript programmer Xtrordinair,

13
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.180
and I've actually known you
for, for many years. We

14
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.490
bumped into each other at
conferences all the time. Yeah.

15
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.560
Yeah. When did you start
getting into JavaScript in earnest?

16
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.310
I think, you know, Charlie's
group specifically, it was probably

17
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.100
about 2010. Interestingly enough, I
was at mix that year

18
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.000
talking about MVVM the design
pattern model view view model,

19
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.370
and in the context of
XAML apps and I demo

20
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.040
a kind of a simple
framework and like 500 lines

21
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.230
of C-sharp and for building,
for building apps. And I

22
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.720
was walking away from this
conversation talking to a few

23
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.840
guys, Glen block was actually
one of them and they

24
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.220
said, wouldn't it be cool
if you could do this

25
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.000
HTML? And I thought that
it wouldn't be, that would

26
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.720
be sweet. And so I
actually, I actually started looking

27
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.830
around that time personally, deeply
into what was happening in

28
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.260
the world of JavaScript and
HTML. What were the real

29
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.630
big problems, which, you know,
at that time, they kind

30
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.950
of different from today, but,
and I started prototyping and

31
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.830
building stuff and, and I
had made a kind of

32
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.520
personal commitment to learn JavaScript
the way I had learned

33
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.530
C sharp and.net to actually
really learn the language, to

34
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.460
really learn browser API APIs,
to take time and to

35
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.260
dig that, and then do
a lot of research about

36
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.170
what was kind of going
on in the community and

37
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.350
who had solved what problems,
and then figure out how

38
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.160
to kind of put together
a solution for building apps

39
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.980
that would solve the real,
real problems that were going

40
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.990
on. And I was doing
XAML work, but I was

41
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.550
also doing a lot of
web work and I was

42
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.230
building a product of my
own at the time for

43
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.330
the web. And so I
kind of built then a

44
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.160
framework in the context of
my own application development called

45
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.070
<inaudible> and that kind of
showed up more officially, I

46
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.130
think, around 2012, but I'd
spent about two years behind

47
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.910
the scenes, you know, kind
of training myself and building

48
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.340
on that and building products
with that, and then working

49
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.270
with customers who wanted to
use when I was building.

50
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.230
And so that's kind of,
that's kind of the story

51
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.140
of how things kinda got
started for me, I guess

52
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.620
really I'd done JavaScript of
course, in the past, but

53
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.490
that was when I really
said, okay, let's treat this

54
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.770
like a real platform and
that's to learn it the

55
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.980
way I would learn a
real platform let's build tools

56
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.410
like it's a real platform
and, and see how far

57
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.970
we can take this. Wasn't
that a little intimidating though,

58
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.340
because it was starting as
I recall, to get a

59
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.030
little bit crowded and like
JavaScript, you know, people were

60
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.310
starting to rise up and
you could talk to seeing

61
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.000
the stars of JavaScript and
it was already a weird

62
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.870
and complicated kind of language
that people were looking at

63
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.460
at different angles to come
in and say, yeah, here's

64
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.980
a framework that I think
is a way to write

65
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.700
apps. It's a, it's a
declaration. It is. Yeah. I

66
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.340
mean, there is an aspect
of, of that, I guess,

67
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.100
but I think, you know,
in technology now it's sort

68
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.100
of, it's kind of an
ongoing thing. You're always kind

69
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.210
of coming into a preexisting
context and saying, well, here's

70
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.360
something new and different, and
here's why, you know, I

71
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.970
think that you should pay
attention to this or think

72
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.700
about this or consider this,
or try it out and

73
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.660
JavaScript, you know, as particular
interesting since the platform it's

74
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.750
when it, you know, when
JavaScript first emerged back in

75
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.130
the nineties, it was just
intended for something different. And

76
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.700
it's, it's an interesting scenario.
Cause people have built apps

77
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.760
on it, of course, very
large and complicated apps, but

78
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.830
the platform has evolved so
radically underneath everything as that's

79
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.180
been going on. Yeah. The
platform meaning browsers and JavaScript

80
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.040
support. Yeah, absolutely. And so
I think that because of

81
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.500
the nature of that ecosystem,
if you will, it means

82
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.380
that the tools and frameworks
and libraries actually can we'll

83
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.970
end up evolving a lot
faster or the trends that

84
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.170
ended up moving faster. Because
if you think say there's

85
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.940
something like.net. I mean, when
even 1.0 is released, you

86
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.630
know, C sharp was a
fairly full featured language, but

87
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.360
of course then if you
fast forward to several versions

88
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.630
later, there are many better
ways to do things, both

89
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.130
in the language and in
the base class libraries and

90
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.240
different things like this. But,
but, but even in say

91
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.550
C-sharp 1.0, it's a fairly
well established language in terms

92
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.280
of its capabilities, in terms
of things like how you

93
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.470
handled modularizing code and what
you could actually with it

94
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.660
just sort of out of
the box, right? But then

95
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.030
you take with JavaScript, it
kind of had a very

96
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.370
minimal base class library. If
you will, you know, very

97
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.400
minimal standard library missing a
lot of language features, you

98
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.140
know, no real modularization, a
lot of things that modern

99
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.630
languages have that just weren't
there. And then you say

100
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.430
you want to build a
library or platform on top

101
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.620
of this. And then a
few years later, all of

102
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.100
a sudden the platform or
the language itself gets infused

103
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.220
with all this stuff that
was missing core stuff like

104
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.230
modules and those kinds of
fundamental pieces having been missing

105
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.730
and then appearing really transforms.
Then the kind of things

106
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.940
that you can build on
top of the language and

107
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.340
how you would go about
building those. And because this

108
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.240
process is kind of ongoing,
ongoing for 20 years, about

109
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.570
with Java script, there's been
a lot of churn in

110
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.960
the frameworks. And so I
just kind of stepped into

111
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.990
that and said, well, we're
kind of at a, at

112
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.360
least with respect to a
really I, which, which, you

113
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.780
know, we want to talk
about a little bit, there's

114
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.870
been a transitional period recently
with JavaScript where there was

115
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.910
kind of a big upgrade
to the web, you know,

116
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.140
with 2015. And we went
from, it's kind of the

117
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.410
biggest upgrade to the language
almost since it was first

118
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.380
established, if you will, and
we've got, we've got modules,

119
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.310
we've got classes, we got
Lambdas. The whole process was

120
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.370
sort of reinvigorated with how
to evolve the language. And

121
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.960
then when you kind of
come and you look at

122
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.360
the platform, you know, the
web platform in terms of

123
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.600
these raw capabilities now being
there now, you can really

124
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.410
imagine a different way of
building apps and you can

125
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.270
start to see these things
that maybe you did on

126
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.740
native platforms before that were
extremely difficult or impossible on

127
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.200
the web. Now become easier,
are built in if you

128
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.990
will. And so it's at
that point where you can

129
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.970
say, okay, it's time for
kind of, you know, a

130
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.450
new entry into this space
that starts with the modern

131
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.640
web as a foundation, and
then says, okay, what can

132
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.390
we build on top of
this? And so that's kind

133
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.910
of where I, where I
kind of come in with

134
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.310
some of the stuff that
I was doing back then,

135
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.250
and as I was looking
forward into the future and

136
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.510
kind of planning, that's where
I wanted to kind of

137
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.360
stake ourselves, if you will,
is kind of in this

138
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.320
modern web and how can
we make modern web development

139
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.450
as good as, or better
than native and to end,

140
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.570
you know, development experience PR
performance, everything. So, So at

141
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.900
the time in 2010, 2011,
people were starting to do

142
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.560
things. People were trying to
solve problems in silos, individual

143
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.040
problems. They hadn't yet built
like major frameworks. They were

144
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.770
trying to do things like,
you know, templating where it's

145
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.450
like, you know, here's a
string and I need to

146
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.360
put some data in there.
Then templating kind of became

147
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.000
more about data binding. And
then there was two way

148
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.090
data binding, you know, deciding
how you're going to make

149
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.330
a call to the backend.
A lot of people use

150
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.430
jQuery and then there's two
or three or four different

151
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.980
ways. And now there's the
new fetch API APIs. You

152
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.750
know, things are continuing to,
to, to grow individually. People

153
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.730
would put together individual solutions,
they'd say, well, I'm gonna

154
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.910
use handlebars for my templating.
I'm gonna use jQuery for

155
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.070
my Dominic violation. I mean,
you use this, can we

156
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.400
use that when you look
at things like de Randall,

157
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.840
which then became Raylea or
angular, Ember, these are more

158
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.420
prescriptive aren't they, they are,
they are a declaration that

159
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.650
says here's a solution, a
style and architecture, a framework.

160
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.050
Is it almost like a
base class library for app

161
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.160
development on the web? Yeah,
there's a sense in which

162
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.490
it is that it's a
set of philosophies and approach

163
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.210
a methodology for building things.
It's a base class library.

164
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.960
And instead of, you know,
kind of core capabilities for

165
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.550
building for building apps, and
it definitely is more prescriptive.

166
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.200
And I think that just
comes out of the fact

167
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.960
that, you know, like I
was saying, things have evolved

168
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.020
so radically, even in the,
in the foundations that then

169
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.720
the libraries and everything on
top of that have evolved

170
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.180
so radically. And that has
just created such a huge

171
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.800
proliferation of things that for
the average developer kind of

172
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.420
going out there and saying,
okay, I want to build

173
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.550
an app. They're immediately shocked
by the breadth of, of

174
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.190
options. And so in a
really it comes along and

175
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.640
says, well, you know, here's
a solution. You can just

176
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.400
start with running and we've
gone and we solved, you

177
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.300
know, problems, X, Y, and
Z. And you can just

178
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.940
go and it'll work for
you. And we've solved the

179
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.290
problem of not only technically,
but philosophically, like here's how

180
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.150
you're gonna structure your app.
Here's how you're going to

181
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.340
put the pieces together. And
we've gone, we've done the

182
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.220
performance work and made sure
all the pieces integrate well,

183
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.830
you know, we're doing the
words work of, you know,

184
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.080
tracking the standards and making
sure we're kind of in

185
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.540
line with, you know, not
what's just happening now and

186
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.300
what's happening in the future.
And so I think you

187
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.560
kind of come into a
space like that into a

188
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.300
community like that. And you
get a lot of assistance,

189
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.830
a lot of help, not
again, not just from the

190
00:10:54.830 --> 00:11:01.520
technical perspective, but prescription guidance,
community involvement, even frankly, just

191
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.670
learning about web standards, at
least with the really, because

192
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.650
we try and stay so
close to the standards. We,

193
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.260
part of what we do
when we teach people a

194
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.800
really is teach them the
overall web. You know, we

195
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.860
want them to understand that
because that's kind of the

196
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.540
longest lived knowledge that they're
going to have, you know,

197
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.120
compared to a framework, you
know, frameworks may stay around

198
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.100
for a good number of
years, but the web will

199
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.560
be around longer than any
particular framework. So we want

200
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.780
them to learn that. So
you kind of get all

201
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.270
those kinds of things. When
you, you know, you come

202
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.250
to pick one of these
frameworks and it helps to

203
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.720
alleviate the, the complexity of
having to weed through a

204
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.750
million different libraries and then
piece them together and then

205
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.560
keep them working together and,
and all these different things.

206
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.450
So there's still a lot
of options, even in the

207
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.280
framework space, but drastically kind
of reduces what you have

208
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.800
to worry about. And then
you just kind of pick

209
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.350
a path and usually, you
know, which framework you pick

210
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.320
is going to have that
guidance and, and all those

211
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.810
pieces that you can just
really hit the ground running

212
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.700
and, and build stuff. So
on the way to earn

213
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.120
Raylea de Randall was a,
another framework that was a

214
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.540
stepping stone. It was built
on other frameworks. It had

215
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.050
jQuery, it had knockout, it
had required JS at its

216
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:20.730
heart Raylea and forgive my
ignorance. But looking at the,

217
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.180
at the package, Jason, looking
at the code appears to

218
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:30.720
have fewer fundamental dependencies. Yes.
Which speaks to what you

219
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.870
just said, that it is
just JavaScript and it sits

220
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.150
on top of JavaScript as
opposed to sitting on top

221
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.860
of a stack of other
dependencies, Right? Yeah. With the

222
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.940
Randall, I kind of identified
a bunch of problems at

223
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.900
the time that needed to
be solved to build apps.

224
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.050
One was modularity. One was
like templating and binding. And

225
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.560
another one was just like
dealing with cross-browser issues. And

226
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.430
so instead of building everything
from scratch with Toronto, what

227
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.740
we said is we would
take J query to deal

228
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.500
with the cross-browser issues. We
would take knockout to deal

229
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.900
with binding and templating, and
then we would take required

230
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.210
JS to deal with the
modules. And we can put

231
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.010
that all together. And then
we kind of put a

232
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.190
thin layer on top of
it that solved the issue

233
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.500
of how to put those
pieces together the right way,

234
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.920
and then add some opinions
and some additional capabilities for

235
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.650
building apps. And then of
course that's has been, and

236
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.010
it still is very successful
and why they use, but

237
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.380
we hit kind of the
limits of what we could

238
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.860
do at the same time.
The web was evolving quite

239
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.050
a bit. And so we
said, you know, what could

240
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.790
we do if we actually
started from, from the raw

241
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.740
web, as I like to
call it, you know, with

242
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.540
pure JavaScript, with no browser
abstractions and just use modern

243
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.710
domino APS and modern JavaScript.
And re-imagined how these capabilities

244
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:53.040
could be implemented. And we
knew that we could solve

245
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.020
a bunch of problems and
our own implementation. So we

246
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.980
could gain a lot of
performance, flexibility, standards, compliance, all

247
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.320
kinds of stuff, and provide
a more solid trustable foundation

248
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.560
for people to build apps
on where they would kind

249
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.390
of trust that some third
party X dependency wasn't going

250
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.430
to change and break their
whole apps. You know, where

251
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.920
we could guarantee that the
framework would work. Cause we

252
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.010
kind of owned all the
code, basically. So the chain

253
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.550
of trust apply. It doesn't
apply to that, to their

254
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.040
project and your project and
then jQuery. And then the

255
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.540
thing that jQuery sits on
top of et cetera, et

256
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.980
cetera, but they do have
to trust you. I mean,

257
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.580
with all open source projects
they are buying into, But

258
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.330
we reduced the number of
people that the trust. And

259
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.790
we've also put ourselves in
a position where if there's

260
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.520
an issue, we absolutely can
address it as opposed to

261
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.430
being in some other library
that we then have to

262
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.860
go to the political process
of working with them and

263
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.530
wait for them to fix
it. You know, some other

264
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.070
library, we don't want some
other library to break our

265
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.180
platform, which then breaks X
number of our customers. We

266
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.640
want to be in a
position where we actually can

267
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.320
fix the problem. And so,
you know, that was, you

268
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.030
know, that was actually kind
of part of the problems

269
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.160
that we wanted to solve.
If you look at the

270
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.280
grid, the JavaScript space is
kind of crazy and you

271
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.920
see, you know, companies are
spending, spending millions and there's,

272
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.410
you know, hundreds of millions,
probably billions of dollars being

273
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.080
spent in software development on,
on, on top of the

274
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.330
web and the frameworks and
tools that everybody's using, some

275
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.660
of them are sort of
like stitched together with toothpicks

276
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.830
and duct tape, you know,
and it's, it's kind of

277
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.400
terrifying. I mean, there's been
recently some activity around MPM.

278
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.710
I'm sure you're aware of
the, you know, the one

279
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.790
issue where the guy pulled
his package and affected something

280
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.240
like 10,000 other packages. And
it was all crazy because

281
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.060
if you look at that
kind of the way that

282
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:53.180
the node ecosystem works, no
one JavaScript packages has a

283
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.100
dependency on another, which has
a dependency on another, which

284
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.890
has a dependency on another.
So there might be 10

285
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.280
levels, deep of dependencies for
some package that you're using

286
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.740
that you're not even aware
of. And if something happens,

287
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.330
you know, anywhere along that
line, you know, you can

288
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.040
have a problem. So we
wanted to, at least to

289
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.070
the degree that it was
reasonable for us, we wanted

290
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.740
to try and eliminate those
issues. That's why actually it

291
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.890
really itself, the core has
no third party dependencies. We

292
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.670
maintain our own polyfills. We
have our own binding engine,

293
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.360
our own templating engine. Everything
is owned by the relay

294
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.120
team. Of course it's all
completely open source, MIT licensed,

295
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.850
but we just reduce our
dependency so that we can

296
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.540
take responsibility for, you know,
our own issues basically, and

297
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.510
deal with them. And we're
doing the same kind of

298
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.210
stuff. We're building some new
tooling, some CLI tooling and

299
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.390
whatnot. And we're just being
careful not to have dependencies

300
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.360
on others so that we
can go to our customers

301
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.230
and say like, we can
guarantee that this works. And

302
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.170
if it doesn't, we can
actually, we can't actually fix

303
00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.320
it, you know, and we
can do it in a

304
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.470
reasonable amount of time. You
know, let me, let me

305
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.730
ask you this though, when
people are getting started, if

306
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.560
someone is not steeped in
the JavaScript culture, or maybe

307
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.380
as an enterprise developer, who's
trying to make the right

308
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.780
decision for their, for their
company and is trying to

309
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.750
figure out what they're going
to pick. And they've got

310
00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.020
a, you know, they've got
angular, which seems to have

311
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.350
the support of Google and
they've got Ember, which has

312
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:35.020
a lot of big personalities,
you know, behind it. Why,

313
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.630
how, how would they pick
one and feel like they

314
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.140
were like educated enough. Like
I don't have two years

315
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.810
to become a JavaScript expert
and then develop an opinion.

316
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.250
It's almost like picking a
religion and you know, you

317
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.650
believe your religion is the
best and else believes their

318
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.130
religions The best. Yeah. That's
a difficult choice for sure.

319
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.830
I think, well, the first
thing I think is realized

320
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.760
is that, you know, it's
not a zero sum game

321
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.450
when it comes to frameworks,
there are a lot of

322
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.390
good choices. I think where
people need to begin is

323
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:12.030
thinking about the non technical
aspects. In other words, think

324
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.960
about what is it that
your business is doing? What

325
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.390
kind of product are you
building? What is the culture

326
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.690
of your team? What is
the experience of your team?

327
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.190
And that can actually help
guide you because certain frameworks,

328
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.510
frameworks have personalities, if you
will. And they're going to

329
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.290
align better with different groups
of people or, you know,

330
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.560
in different contexts. And even
within the same company at

331
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.720
the same team, you might
find that a particular framework

332
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.760
or library is going to
work better for one product

333
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.330
or another. So I think
it actually comes down to

334
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:50.330
starting with really kind of
understanding the needs That you

335
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:55.730
have for them, The application
development that you're doing, understanding

336
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.150
the unique qualities of your
team and your company, and

337
00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.580
then starting to see, even
from a high level, how

338
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.840
different technologies align with, with
those things. Some technologies are

339
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.190
going to get more in
your way, are going to

340
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.100
hinder you. And they may
have the same kind of

341
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.000
raw capabilities, but maybe the
way that they go about

342
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.680
presenting them or using them,
or prescribing them is going

343
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.980
to be more difficult for
a particular product or for

344
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.070
a particular team to work
with. So you can start

345
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.920
by just thinking in terms
of those things. The other

346
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.140
thing is, I would say
what I try and encourage

347
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.310
people is realize that you
can transfer all the knowledge

348
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.490
and experience you have from
whatever other platforms you've been

349
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.910
working on to the web.
So, you know, separation of

350
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:46.490
concerns is a great principle
to follow.net land. And so

351
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.460
it's also, it has anyone
land. Yeah, exactly. So I

352
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.260
would say, so I would
tell people is, look at,

353
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.980
look at the frameworks and,
and look to see, you

354
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.500
know, if you're looking at
their component model, because all

355
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.600
of these farmers have a
component model, well, how, how

356
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.030
well do they deal with
separation of concerns and the

357
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.130
design of their component? And
you can actually see it

358
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.100
and you can see it
if you, if you think

359
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.260
about looking for those kinds
of things. So I would

360
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.010
say, you know, The ways
that you evaluate, You know,

361
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.370
libraries and farmers and tools
and, you know, non JavaScript

362
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.340
land, you want to bring
those same types of evaluations

363
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.130
to JavaScript land in terms
of business things, in terms

364
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:27.680
of technical considerations, all these
aspects, you want to kind

365
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.780
of transfer to the JavaScript
realm and ask the same

366
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.710
sorts of questions. And that
can help you quite a

367
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.500
bit because I think what
happens is people are immediately

368
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.320
thrown off by some language
or platform that they just

369
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.560
don't know as well. And
they kind of revert back

370
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.170
to an earlier stage where
maybe they hadn't yet learned

371
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:55.390
the real crosscutting or more
general or universal principles. So

372
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.130
I have to be reminded
to come back to those

373
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.490
universal things that you've learned
and apply them to that

374
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.060
new context that you're investigating.
And that can help out

375
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.180
a lot too. And there's
open source projects where it's

376
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.210
just a random person out
there in the world, you

377
00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.850
know, like with a Simpson's
avatar, I have no idea

378
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.940
who they are. One of
the things that's pretty extraordinary

379
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:23.550
about Raylea is that your
docs are just Holy crap

380
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.330
best in class. I mean,
they're just amazing build those

381
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.970
in Australia. Yeah. The ducks
are built in a really,

382
00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.530
one of the things we
want to do is dog

383
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.580
food, our own framework publicly.
So as soon as we

384
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.250
launched beta, we had this
new version of the docs

385
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.050
that were implemented in a
really, and actually we're about

386
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.030
to launch a new version
two pretty soon, which is

387
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.900
going to make these look
pretty, pretty shameful. But really,

388
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.210
yeah. One of the things
that I love about the

389
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.310
docs and people should check
this out just because I

390
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.230
think it's a pattern that
is going to be stolen.

391
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.870
I'm planning on stealing it
and taking credit for it.

392
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.270
I know what you're going
to say. Go ahead. Yeah.

393
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.820
It's the part where the,
at the top of the

394
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.620
tree on the left side
where it's a list of

395
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.570
all of the topics, there's
a filter and it says

396
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.080
I am a web developer
or an architect or a

397
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.540
manager, and I love it
because there's like 16 high

398
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.060
level topics. And then if
you're a manager, you click

399
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.460
it and there's like two.
Yeah. It's almost like saying,

400
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.100
Oh, you don't know anything.
And it's like hide all

401
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.700
the hard stuff, but it's
such a brilliant A UI.

402
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.670
Thank you. Yeah. We had
this idea, actually. I've been

403
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.560
thinking about this for a
while and we have a

404
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.960
chief design officer at the
company we've been thinking about

405
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.570
this, but different people, you
know, come to your site

406
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.790
and they're interested in different
things. They care about different

407
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.520
things. And we, you know,
we're building technical projects. We

408
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.010
often think about the technical
docs, but you know, a

409
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.040
CTO or a manager is
going to make is probably

410
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.440
going to make a decision
on what gets used actually

411
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.320
a lot of times. And
they need Val valuable information

412
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.900
to help them. So, yeah.
So we kind of have

413
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.520
these, these different profiles, if
you will. And there's actually

414
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.320
more, we're going to have
a lot more of those

415
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.540
too, because we think we
want to help our community

416
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.580
too. So we're going to
have profiles. Like I am,

417
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.270
you know, integrating with other
technology or I am, I

418
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.600
want to contribute, you know,
It's nice because I liked

419
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.400
it. And I hope that
you, you maintain it as

420
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.880
a filter because it's not
a, it's not a, a

421
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.610
view in the sense of
you have to click them

422
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.040
all to see everything. We
assume that if you're a

423
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.090
web developer, you see everything,
but you hide the things

424
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:29.520
that are, that are outside
your scope. Yeah. Yeah. So

425
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.710
we're actually working on some
new stuff for this too,

426
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.320
where we'll actually have kind
of homepages for each of

427
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.160
these profiles that kind of
give a bit of descriptive

428
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.920
tax and different table of
context and some other resources.

429
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.980
And of course we're always
working on the content, expanding

430
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.450
it out as appropriate for
these different kind of vantage

431
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.710
points. But yeah, we, I
was, I really wanted something

432
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.490
like this and a number
of other people on the

433
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.450
team did too. So yeah,
I think that's, it's really

434
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.410
important that people be able
to kind of identify and

435
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:08.260
find what they're really looking
for. I, I had on

436
00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.100
the show last week, naughty
act ball, talking about financing

437
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.940
and paying for and supporting
open source. And she talked

438
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.970
about the infrastructure of the
internet and not about like

439
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.030
the wires and the telecoms,
but you know, things like

440
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:25.180
JavaScript and things like the
browser that fundamentally make things

441
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.580
work. And, you know, here
we are in an environment

442
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.330
where there's like two, maybe
three browsers, you know, there's

443
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:37.030
two, maybe three JavaScript VMs.
We're gonna eventually get down

444
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.810
to just a couple of
JavaScript frameworks. How important do

445
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:44.200
you think it is to
have companies, corporations behind it?

446
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.020
Because the fact that Australia
is open source, but also

447
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.560
has a really rich consulting
group. And you have actually

448
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:56.860
consulting partners like enterprise partners,
like node in the enterprise

449
00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.530
is kind of hard, but
node source is a company

450
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.720
that will give you enterprise
support. You know, they give

451
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.300
you someone told me that
they give you a throat

452
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.830
to choke. You know what
I mean? Where are we

453
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.580
going to yell at? Right.
So with an opensource project,

454
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.130
you know, you get issues
where someone's like, Oh, this

455
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.490
sucks. And it's like, well,
sorry, you probably shouldn't have

456
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.970
built your entire company around
it. The company has to

457
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:23.380
really be deeply entrenched in
open source, but with something

458
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.310
like a Orelia you can
treat it like a product

459
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.580
can't you? Yes. And that
was definitely part of what

460
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.800
we wanted to do that
I saw that was kind

461
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.680
of missing in the JavaScript
space is we really wanted

462
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.990
to build up a company
to support the open source,

463
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:40.690
to build the whole ecosystem
out, to have partners. And

464
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.780
so that people that wanted
to use it to build,

465
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.480
we could say like, yes,
here's our official resources, or

466
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.730
yes, we can put you,
you know, Oh, you need

467
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.650
a consultant where we've got
a core team member that

468
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.450
can work right with you.
Or we've got an official

469
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.970
partner that you can connect
with or, Oh, you need,

470
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.250
you want commercial support because
there's a lot of people

471
00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.220
that are getting started that,
you know, they just want

472
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.380
kind of a safety net
because it's, they're treading into

473
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.410
waters that are unfamiliar with,
you know, so they just

474
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:09.040
want a safety net. Or
there are things like government

475
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.780
agencies that some of them
won't use open source unless

476
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:19.000
they can literally pay, there
are some agencies that they

477
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.320
have to purchase a commercial,
something, which is kind of,

478
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.860
it's kind of seems kind
of odd, but, but honestly

479
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.020
that's neat that we can,
we can solve that problem

480
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.420
for you. We can make,
you know, we can, we

481
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.780
can solve that problem pretty
easily. So there's, we wanted

482
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.300
to build up this whole
ecosystem. And in my mind

483
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.870
I looked like at a
company like Microsoft or Apple

484
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.230
who has a native platform,
that's very rich. And I

485
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.440
look at the ecosystem that's
built around that. And that's

486
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.080
kind of my vision for
really, we want to build

487
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.500
that same kind of fidelity
of an ecosystem if you

488
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.600
will, around a JavaScript platform.
So that all the things

489
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.060
that you would expect from
any native platform you'll find

490
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:05.100
there, you know, whether it's
great documentation consulting, commercial support,

491
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.740
you know, commercial products, partners,
training, and a whole bunch

492
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.160
of other stuff that we're
working on that, you know,

493
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.720
I can't really talk about,
but we've got a lot

494
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.020
of ideas. I think the
business side is really important

495
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.260
because like I was saying
earlier, you just think about

496
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.890
the millions and millions of
dollars that companies are spending

497
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:30.540
building apps on top of
these frameworks. And, you know,

498
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.600
there's, it's kind of like
building the house on the

499
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.550
sand, right. That the, the
foundation technically maybe pretty decent,

500
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.830
but there's nothing really behind
that to support it longterm

501
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.990
or to say, yes, well,
we're going to give you

502
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.450
an LTS support on this
and we're going to, we're

503
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.730
going to hold your hand
and help you move through

504
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.360
migrating across versions or, Oh,
you've got a critical bug.

505
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.030
Well, you know, you're a
commercial support customer, so we

506
00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.580
can like issue you a
patch and we can do

507
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.130
it, you know, give you
some SLS around that. And

508
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.380
you know, all these kinds
of things. So a lot

509
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.720
of the infrastructure's just kind
of missing from the JavaScript

510
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.180
world. And we said, well,
we're going to build an

511
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.910
awesome platform from a technical
perspective, but we're also gonna

512
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.820
look at all these other
issues that kind of surround

513
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.560
that. And we're going to
make sure that we have

514
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.480
a plan to address them,
you know, and we're just

515
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.910
kind of rolling those out
in stages now, but I

516
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.930
think it's really important. It's
like, it's, it's, it's working

517
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.150
out pretty well. I mean,
you you've got a company

518
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.610
and you're like, it's the
real thing that was that

519
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.590
a big leap of faith
to say, we're going to

520
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:34.400
build a whole consulting and
training and team around, around

521
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:36.500
this open source project. Was
that a, like a leap

522
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.120
and how long did it
take before you were like,

523
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:43.730
yeah, this actually works. Yeah.
It's definitely a leap just

524
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.000
like starting any business. There's
zero revenue at the beginning

525
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.800
and you've got a lot
of time. You gotta put

526
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.880
in to get something, you
know, out the door, so

527
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.500
you can start turning that
around. And then you've got

528
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.510
to build up the community
around that to a certain

529
00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:00.140
kind of critical mass, you
know, that, that things start

530
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:05.810
generating. So yeah, there's definitely
a leap about, you know,

531
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.580
it has to do with
that. It's, it's scary. It's

532
00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.910
also super exciting at the
same time. It's just a,

533
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.660
it's just kind of a
mixture of many, many emotions

534
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.740
that are involved in that
process. What's been really exciting.

535
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.990
What there really is just
to see the community grow

536
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.930
and to see people join
in the effort. I mean,

537
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.590
we have, in the first
year we had over 300

538
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.550
contributors to the project. And
so now we've got about

539
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:38.480
300 and 260 or so.
So we there's a new

540
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.490
contributor, every one or two
days, something like that. So

541
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.080
to me that, that just,
it's exciting. It's really exciting

542
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.450
to see that. And we've
got a core team now

543
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.030
of that's male, about 20
people. It's a mixture of

544
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.760
developers and people that are
writing books and people that

545
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.960
are just kind of evangelizing
in the community and working

546
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.950
with them. They're all, they're
all great and really awesome

547
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.520
people. And you know, when
I started this project, I

548
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.040
kind of, I seeded the
first version of the code.

549
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.100
You know, I had kind
of an alpha product built

550
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.570
and then the team came
on board. And now what

551
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.550
really is today is absolutely
something that I could not

552
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.400
have accomplished on my own.
We've got people doing stuff

553
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.460
on the team that are
just doing incredible work, and

554
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.750
it's really exciting to, to
just see the, you know,

555
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.380
the inception of it and
then see it grow and

556
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.510
see the community grow and
see people getting involved and

557
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.000
see the business take flight
and to see people start

558
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.230
to prosper, you know, individual
people and companies and, and

559
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.080
to see people would just
be successful building awesome things.

560
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.180
And I mean, it's really,
it's really cool when somebody

561
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.580
hops in our chat room
and there's just like post

562
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.370
like a YouTube video. It's
like with some awesome music

563
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.990
behind it. And it's like,
here's the app we built

564
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.290
in like one week, you
know, or we got one

565
00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.520
of our core team members
that has company has put

566
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.190
seven apps in production in
the last year, but with

567
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.550
a really, really big company
doing really cool stuff. And

568
00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:10.180
they Hilson, you know, screenshots
of like, here's our launch

569
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:14.110
party, you know, and that
kind of stuff, it gets

570
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:19.090
you really pumped. And you
know, I I'm building a

571
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.040
business, but there's also the
other aspect of it for

572
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.200
me, which is that I've
been doing open source for

573
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.470
over 10 years. And so
it's not, it's not like

574
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.390
it's about the money. Obviously
we have to, we have

575
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.190
to survive. I have a
wife have kids. We need

576
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.290
to pay the bills. I'm
not trying to get rich.

577
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.160
I like to help people
though. I like building solutions.

578
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.090
I try to transfer my
knowledge and experience and building

579
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.420
software into these frameworks to
help other people be successful.

580
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.450
So I just get a
ton out of the whole

581
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.540
process of seeing people like
I, like I said, I've

582
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.750
seen people prosper, seeing companies
prosper by using our technology

583
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.810
and seeing what they've done
with it. So that's totally

584
00:31:55.810 --> 00:32:00.550
exciting. And that's all kind
of around this whole process

585
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:05.350
of starting with the idea
of the framework, business, bringing

586
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:09.340
those things together, jumping out
there, taking that risk and

587
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.280
then just kind of going
with it and encouraging people,

588
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.160
getting the community involved and
just watching it kind of

589
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.700
bloom. This has been really,
Let me ask you, let

590
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:22.320
me ask you one question
in conclusion, and there was

591
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.160
a time when you worked
on angular for 10 months

592
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.700
and you thought that maybe
you could bring some of

593
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.460
the, your, your learnings from,
to Randall to angular and

594
00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.670
make that, make that something
else, but it didn't work

595
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:39.710
out. You went back and
continued to work on, on

596
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.920
your project. Yes. Can you,
can you briefly give us

597
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.080
a sense of, you know,
was that, was that good

598
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.170
time? Was that wasted time?
Was that just a, you

599
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:52.310
know, architectural disagreements? It was
so many things and I

600
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.290
can't, you know, I have
to be careful how I

601
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.510
talk about this. Cause some
things I just, I can't

602
00:32:56.510 --> 00:33:01.100
even talk about really from
a legal perspective and in

603
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:06.920
a sense, from an emotional
perspective, because for me, the

604
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.980
things I've built and the
opensource I've done, you know,

605
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.100
is very important to me.
And I have a vision

606
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.500
I've always had a vision
for, you know, what I

607
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.170
want to build and, and
trying to help people. So,

608
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.560
you know, I'm not going
to call that wasted time.

609
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:30.620
I think that any experience
in life, you can, you

610
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.370
should try and draw something
out of. I definitely identified

611
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:39.440
things that I definitely identified
problems in the JavaScript ecosystem

612
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.030
and in the framework space
that I hadn't thought as

613
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.920
clearly about before that experience
and that, that does happen

614
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.480
to do with some of
the business side of things,

615
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.790
which are where I realized
that things were lacking or

616
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.240
where things weren't really being
addressed. So I'm not, I

617
00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.610
won't say it was wasted
time at all. I definitely

618
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:03.710
try to draw a lot
out of that experience. And

619
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.370
when I came out of
that, I was in a

620
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.420
sense, I had a lot
of emotions, of course, coming

621
00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.330
out of that, but in
one way, I was invigorated

622
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.450
to, or at least pumped
to work on my own

623
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:21.590
stuff again, because I knew
for a certainty that I

624
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.440
had a very clear vision
of what needed to be

625
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.160
built and that I felt
very sure about the problems

626
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.640
that need to be addressed.
And maybe I knew the

627
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.830
portion of that before, but
I had a certain amount

628
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.410
of confidence coming out of
that as well, that I

629
00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:40.850
had a deeper understanding and
confidence about what needed to

630
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.610
happen, I guess. And that's
pretty, that's valuable on its

631
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.550
own. Of course, especially kick-starting
a new company, you know,

632
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.800
you kinda, you kind of
have to be in that

633
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.890
frame of mind from the
get go or else there's,

634
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.200
you know, you have no
hope of really succeeding. Very

635
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.050
cool. Well, we appreciate you.
And we appreciate what you

636
00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:00.650
do to the community. And
really is a, is a

637
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.640
great framework. People should explore.
It's a U R E

638
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.180
L I e.io on the
homepage there, there's about a

639
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.640
30 minute video. It's very
technical. It's a walkthrough from

640
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.740
start to beginning, start to
finish. It tells you exactly

641
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.420
what you need to know.
And like I said, the

642
00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.240
docs are something to aspire
to looking forward to seeing

643
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.370
what you do with the
next docs. And I appreciate

644
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.130
you talking with me today.
My pleasure. Thank you. This

645
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.290
has been another episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

646
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.130
again next week.
