00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.430
Hey friends. I want to
introduce a new sponsor to

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.520
you. H M a VPN.
It's a VPN you can

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.990
count on. As you know,
I do a lot of

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.330
travel and I tend to
connect to a lot of

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.600
untrusted wireless networks. And I
probably shouldn't, but I can

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.800
use HMA as the world's
largest VPN service offers. The

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
most server locations worldwide covers
190 countries. There's always a

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.290
server nearby it. Doesn't log
your IP address and allows

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.340
me to connect five devices
simultaneously works on basically all

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.350
platforms, Android, iOS, Mac, Linux,
windows routers, wherever it's actually

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.770
been completely redesigned recently to
make it even simpler and

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.440
more fun to use. And
there's even a smart kill

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.770
switch. That'll turn the VPN
automatically on when you launch

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.130
sensitive apps, here's your call
to action. My friends try

15
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.140
HMA VPN risk-free with a
30 day money back guarantee.

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.010
This deal is for Hanselman
its listeners. That's HMA, vpn.com/offer

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:20.120
hyphen Hansel minutes. That's HMA
vpn.com/offer-hansel minutes. Hi, this is

18
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.460
Scott Hanselman. This is another
one Sort of Hansel minutes

19
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.330
today. I'm talking with Freya
holler. She makes amazing math

20
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.840
visualizations that are all over
Twitter. And is you do

21
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.770
Twitch streaming. I've seen also
math for game day of

22
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.430
you're like a four hour
improvised live course. You just

23
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.670
live in an eat and
sleep math and game dev.

24
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.680
It's so amazing. Thank you
for coming on the show.

25
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.650
Thank you so much for
having me, you know, how

26
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.290
you bump into somebody on
Twitter and you're like, Oh,

27
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.300
this seems like a nice
thing. And then you start

28
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.180
scrolling and he starts scrolling
and it's like, Oh my

29
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.270
goodness. Oh my goodness. And
then you just infinitely scroll

30
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.690
through the media part of
their Twitter. You're like, what

31
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.460
is going on? How did
I not know this person

32
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.750
existed? That's how I felt
when I started scrolling through

33
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.350
your Twitter, because you have
all of these really cool

34
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.090
visualizations that explain really complicated
math problems in a way

35
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.260
that I had never seen
before. The only person that

36
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.830
does this, or is there
math, visualization, Twitter? I, I

37
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.890
don't know if there's a
community for it on Twitter,

38
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.100
but I mean, there are
some things that I've seen.

39
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.650
There's a YouTube YouTube for
your call, three blue, one

40
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.000
Brown who does like really
cool math visualizations. He goes

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.790
very in depth on stuff,
but he visualizes it in

42
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.550
a very intuitive and nice
way. So I think that

43
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.850
was probably one of my
inspirations for doing like math

44
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.300
visualizations. But I think the,
the primary motivator for me

45
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.080
was just that when making
gains, there are so many

46
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.750
complex systems that interact and
a lot of them are

47
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.620
like mathematical or geometrical. One
of the ways to debug

48
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.220
that, to find out whether
something wrong or not Is

49
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
the visualize it. And I
found that sharing those visualizations

50
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.840
with people, or just showing
that it resonates with people

51
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.620
somehow just seeing the underlying
data, seeing the underlying patterns

52
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.800
that emerge sort of, and
I think there's a strong

53
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.060
appreciation for that. What do
people use to make these

54
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.580
animations and do you know,
off the top of your

55
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.690
head when that started? Because
the first visualizations I ever

56
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.440
made would be 20 or
30 years ago and visualization,

57
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.390
when I say visualization, I
don't just mean a graph.

58
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.340
I mean, over time, the
first ones I ever made

59
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.000
would be like on a
TBI 83 or 89 calculator,

60
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.680
very one frame, every five
seconds type visualizations. But you

61
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.780
know, when did math animation
really start blowing up? I

62
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.320
don't know. Really. I remember
that there was one math

63
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.630
animation that was making his
rounds for on Twitter that

64
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.460
look really old. It looked
like it was made like

65
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.750
through some oscilloscope or something.
So I guess it's been

66
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.730
around for a long time,
but it doesn't seem to

67
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.180
have been like very well
established. Like you're not gonna

68
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.190
open a math textbook and
see animations. Right. But it

69
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.700
seems to be pretty obscure
at this point, which is

70
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.760
kind of why I wanted
to make more of it.

71
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.030
Cause it seems to resonate
with people. Like I just

72
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.360
made this very simple animation
showing the signing co-sign relationship

73
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.900
with a unit circle, very
simple animation, you know, a

74
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.440
vector's spinning in a circle
and then showing how sign

75
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.470
and cosign, you know, how
those functions relate to that

76
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.660
vector. And that, that tweet
just like blew up and

77
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.930
everybody was like, Oh, why
weren't you not, where were

78
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.860
you? Not my teacher in
high school or whatever. And

79
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.050
that seemed to be like,
it was not just one

80
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.420
person that seemed to be
like ubiquitous in all of

81
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.740
the replies. And so I
thought that, you know, okay,

82
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.750
so given how, how much
traction this got given how

83
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.660
much people seem to learn
just by me playing around

84
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.460
with like vectors. Like, it
seems like there's a space

85
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.890
where I could make educational
content. That looks pretty. And

86
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.830
I think that really resonates
with people because too many,

87
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.640
I think math is just
very boring and daunting. And

88
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.860
I think that's partially because
it's presented in a very

89
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.010
boring way. Mm. I feel
also as I have a

90
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.900
12 year old and a
14 year old, and as

91
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.600
I try to get them
at, you know, ideally of

92
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.160
course excited by math, but
worst case scenario not deeply

93
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.830
offended by math, right? Like
there's a low bar when

94
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.050
you're trying to teach children
math here, like not hating,

95
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.020
it would be success. The
biggest thing that they're having

96
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.920
trouble with is visualizing things
over time, because math is

97
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.380
such a dynamic thing. It's
the continuum that they can't

98
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.200
see. So why are we
giving them black and white

99
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.830
textbooks and saying, here's, you
know, graph X graph, Y

100
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.770
do that. And now visualize
it over time. It's ask,

101
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.430
that's a big jump to
ask someone to do. It

102
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.960
really is. And I think
there is something like that

103
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.690
jump I think is very
under, like, not under appreciated.

104
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.970
I don't know the word
for it, but like showing

105
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.790
a graph of something like
a trajectory and you have

106
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.430
time on some access like
that, like conceptualizing that is

107
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.580
pretty difficult. Cause you have
this layer of abstraction where

108
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.940
you've like mapped out time
over an axis, which is

109
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.640
kind of weird. Like that's,
it's probably difficult to get

110
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.310
a grasp of that unless
you like intuitively know these

111
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.250
things very well. So I
think making that connection takes

112
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.640
time, but being able to
show an animation next to

113
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.160
that and then showing the
line, the moves with time

114
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.040
that immediately you can see
that, Oh, this is connected

115
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.710
to time. This is not
a spatial dimension or whatever.

116
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.100
That's a really interesting point,
right? Like we have all

117
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.500
this three dimensional stuff that
we try to present to

118
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.010
people on two dimensional medium,
and time is a fourth

119
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.800
dimension. And we still try
to show that to people

120
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.590
in two dimensions and it's
like, Oh, well we can't

121
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.840
make it move. So let's
put it on an axis

122
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.770
and let them what animated
in their heads. Yeah, exactly.

123
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.320
And I mean, there's still
use of having it on

124
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.330
an axis. It's just that
it's not the best way

125
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.740
to introduce something to people.
So these are gorgeous and

126
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.170
they feel very, they are,
they are reliably the same

127
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.480
kind of style and font
almost as if there's like

128
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.650
a Microsoft word or a
Microsoft Excel of math animations.

129
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.600
Are you using Mathematica or
is this a thing of

130
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.460
your own creation? It's kind
of my own thing. It's,

131
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.570
it's a long story. So
if I had any development,

132
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.750
that would be amazing. You
could tell them. So my

133
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.980
background has been very strongly
in like knee deep in

134
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.970
game development for a very,
very long time. So that's

135
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.600
sort of been my approach
to everything I make. And,

136
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.570
you know, I would, I
would always say that or

137
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.630
I w I always considered
games to sort of be

138
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.690
probably one of the most,
or if not the most

139
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.410
advanced, you know, media forum
we have today, it incorporates

140
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.310
so much from like, you
know, from radio, from movies,

141
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.480
from theater, from even arcade
games or playing physically with

142
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.240
people or whatever. Like it
incorporates all of these things

143
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.780
in one place. So the
amount of things you need

144
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.240
to know in order to
make a game or a

145
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.690
complete experience, it's massive. There,
there are so many things

146
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.820
you need to learn when
it comes to, you know,

147
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.650
visuals when it comes to
audio, when it comes to

148
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.750
design, when it comes to
even, you know, all the

149
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.040
business stuff with marketing and
all of that. And the

150
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.480
way I've navigated games is
usually through the lens of

151
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.080
an indie developer. So that
means making an entire game

152
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.720
on your own. So that
means I have to learn

153
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.310
all of these separate things
and, and, and I think

154
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.520
many people sort of narrow
down their scope to, you

155
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.660
know, either do programming or
tech and then they just

156
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.330
do that or I do
art and then I just

157
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.640
do that. And then there
aren't a whole lot of

158
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.940
people, I think, who spread
themselves wider across the whole

159
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.800
spectrum of things you can
learn. So I think one

160
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.740
thing that's happened is that
given that I've sort of

161
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.010
spread myself across all of
these different, you know, aspects

162
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.280
of making games, I sort
of have a view of

163
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.660
what, what would a game
version of a math animation

164
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.920
be? So then it's not
just about showing what signing

165
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.280
co-sign is, that's what textbooks
do, right. They have this,

166
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.870
you know, the shape of
the curves and then they

167
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.450
kind of leave it at
that, but you know, what

168
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.050
happened to art direction? You
know, where did that department

169
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.180
go? What I'm doing, marketing,
how do we present this

170
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.480
in an interesting way? How
do we make sure that,

171
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.150
you know, this is engaging
and I think that's something

172
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.830
that's strongly lacking in, you
know, textbook math. So I

173
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.950
feel like I approach these
things as if they were

174
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.750
like an interactive video game
experience. So right now you're

175
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.260
using primarily Twitter for your
kind of like letting us

176
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.390
know it's the fire hose
of all the things that,

177
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.090
that, that fray is working
on. But I want to

178
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.790
like stop the gifts and
I want to seek forward

179
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.350
and I want to go
forward and backwards. I want

180
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.000
to interact with these. I
want them to be a

181
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.130
video game, but then when
I see what my kids

182
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.200
are learning, it's just like,
they'll have an iPad. And

183
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.480
I'm like, Oh, we're learning
math on an iPad. And

184
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.420
the teacher gave them a
PDF. So there's this gap,

185
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.730
you know, either like your
gifts are read only, and

186
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.890
I can't interact with them
or play with them. And

187
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.990
then my children are on
an iPad or a tablet.

188
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.840
And it's just a PDF
which serves no purpose at

189
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.930
all. We're definitely not playing
math games right now and

190
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:41.810
really playing with this information.
Yeah. I think the, there

191
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.330
are a lot of like
interactive math things out there

192
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.140
as well. So usually they're
web based. Mine are not,

193
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.710
which is why I haven't
really done interactive stuff. But

194
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.520
I think in my case,
I think I stuck to

195
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.120
Twitter because that was probably
my biggest platform. And I

196
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.310
got most traction there and
I have the biggest reach

197
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.890
and there's no interaction on
Twitter in terms of like

198
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.430
interacting with, you know, graphics.
So, so I kind of

199
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:12.380
just like stuck to making
animations, but I've also found

200
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.020
that I feel like interaction
is a tool like any

201
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.280
other, right. And you don't
have to use interaction. And

202
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.250
if I, if I can
get a concept across, without

203
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.820
interaction, that's better than having
people have to interact with

204
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.760
that thing. So I feel
like just being able to

205
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.940
scroll through Twitter and leisurely,
look at something and learn

206
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.120
something is, that's a good
thing I think, but if

207
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.120
they would have to pull
some handle, then that requires

208
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.900
more time and attention from
them. But yeah, A good

209
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.030
point. So how are you
making these? Are you, are

210
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.700
these unity little unity projects?
Do you just like, Oh,

211
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.530
I just had an idea
for an animation file, new

212
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.940
project unity, or is this
in your engine? So this

213
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.050
is an unity. I do,
I do a scary amount

214
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.300
of things in unity that
I shouldn't do in unity,

215
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.530
but here we are. So
I kind of started out,

216
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.150
let's see, where did I
start out? I think I

217
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.260
started off making a recorder,
basically a way to capture

218
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.050
footage inside of unity and
then export that as some

219
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.320
sort of animation or an
animated GIF or a video.

220
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.950
So that's where I started.
And then as that one

221
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.940
became more and more sophisticated,
I noticed that I added

222
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.780
a feature that's sometimes called
motion blur or the temporal

223
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.160
super sampling where I capture
frames between frames so that

224
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.580
I get proper interpolation between
frames, making it look way

225
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.550
more smoother than you would
be just capturing single frames.

226
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.440
And that also made it
what's called rendered offline, which

227
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.230
means that you let your
computer take all the time.

228
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.590
It needs to render a
single frame of animation. And

229
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.630
then you move on to
the next frame instead of

230
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.760
live recording, which means that
your computer is going to

231
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.920
run the game and then
try to keep up with

232
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.230
recording, which generally never works
consistently. So what happened was

233
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.380
that the automations turned out
really smooth and they look

234
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.440
kind of pretty just for
being like a simple, you

235
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.050
know, camera animation or whatever.
From there, I, I kind

236
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.370
of, I started to get
interested in making some sort

237
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.770
of like math automation. I
don't remember which one was

238
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.360
the first one could have
been assigned co-sign thing. So,

239
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.420
so I started out thinking,
you know, OK, how, how

240
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.280
do you make shapes? Like
how do I make it

241
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.220
line in unity? How do
I make a circle? And

242
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.860
I didn't really have a
good way to do that

243
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.020
using the built in tool.
So I started writing my

244
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.050
own and I was also
like, at the same time,

245
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.510
I was getting really interested
in something called signed to

246
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.140
distance fields, which I don't
know if I should get,

247
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.940
go into details about what
that is, but a little

248
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:51.340
bit. Well, I, I started
learning how scientists this feels

249
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.040
or work and how you
can use those to make

250
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.390
two dimensional shapes in a
very nice way. And from

251
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.480
that, it kind of grew
at, you know, especially as

252
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.350
that tweet exploded, I kept
working on the BI vector

253
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.590
rendering library and, you know,
it grew into something that

254
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.160
is pretty sophisticated at this
point. Yeah. So that's kind

255
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.200
of the, the route that
I took and, and, you

256
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.840
know, combining the, the recorder
tool that I made and

257
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.760
the vector animations, making these
animations, make them look like

258
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.550
they have, you know, twice
the frame rates, even though

259
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.760
they're all 50 FPS, but
given that they have this

260
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.940
motion blur or interpolation between
frames, it looks super smooth,

261
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.190
which is kind of a
trick to make it look

262
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.870
better than it quote unquote
actually is. But yeah, That

263
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.060
is really interesting because I'm
like, for example, I'm looking

264
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.460
at your animation and I'll
put all of this in

265
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.520
the show notes, which is
a, the area of a

266
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.860
circle one where you have
a circle and it unfolds

267
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.350
kind of, it's kind of,
I keep staring at it

268
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.800
because a circle turns into
a triangle and you keep

269
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.260
watching it and you go,
Oh, is that how it

270
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.030
works? Like, I kind of
see what's going on here,

271
00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.260
but it is preternaturally smooth.
And I just assumed you

272
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.650
were using Camtasia, but you're
right. Like forcing the computer

273
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.170
to put all these frames
on the, on the screen,

274
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.870
in a frame buffer, and
then capture that. It just

275
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.600
seems silly. You should just
generate them directly directly, which

276
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.430
would explain why they are
so smooth. You don't drop

277
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.020
a frame. Yeah. I mean,
I do. When I make

278
00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.060
them, I usually have a
slider that I can pull.

279
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.640
So while I'm making them,
I can interactively, you know,

280
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.010
scrub the time of that
one to, you know, figure

281
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.900
out how it looks at
a given point in time.

282
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.930
So, so what does a
render in real time without

283
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.210
the motion blur, but as
soon as I want to

284
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.760
have that motion blur, it
takes like, you know, depending

285
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.800
on how, you know, how
good of a quality I

286
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.900
want, it can take like
a minute or two to

287
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.270
render a single one. Right.
Is that motion blurs? Something

288
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.310
that just humans want to
see? Like, it looks weird

289
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.880
without it, or does it
add information? It adds a

290
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.810
lot. So, so generally when,
if you look at like

291
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.680
a 60 frames per second
animation, the, the problem is

292
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.270
that you get incorrect information
between the frames, right? So,

293
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.640
so, so you have a
dot, so you have a

294
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.960
dot that is moving left
and right. And you're looking

295
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.100
at this animation at 60
frames per second. You're when

296
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.700
it goes from one frame
to another, it renders that

297
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:18.100
dot for a one divided
by 60 seconds. And then

298
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.080
it skips to the next
frame where the.is in a

299
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.010
different place. Right. But what
we're trying to emulate is

300
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.040
that that dot moved from
one position to another, but

301
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.450
frame by frame, it's actually
teleporting. Oh yeah. I guess

302
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.730
it would, it, depending on
all kinds of things, as

303
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.610
far as DPI and PPI
of the screen, et cetera,

304
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.550
et cetera. Oh yeah, yeah.
But, but presuming is it

305
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.400
presuming it's moving quickly, then
you will likely have a

306
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.510
large gap between those. So
w what happens is that

307
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.250
you, for, you know, one
divided by 60 seconds, you

308
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.950
will look at incorrect data
most of the time, because

309
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.410
it will be stuck for
that amount of time until

310
00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.460
you hit the next frame.
Right. So if you compare

311
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.400
an animation that has motion
blur, and one that doesn't

312
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.190
the, one of the motion
blur obviously looks much, much,

313
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.070
much better, and it looks
so much smoother because then

314
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.710
you're not like you don't
have that incorrect data anymore.

315
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:14.710
Yeah. I don't know if
you worked a lot with

316
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.320
VR and some of the
techniques they've used there to

317
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.270
help prevent this. I haven't
done it, but I do

318
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.850
have three different VR headsets
here in the house. And

319
00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.730
I'm looking at an HTC
vibe pro right near on

320
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.920
my desk here. So I
have familiarity as a user.

321
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.620
Oh, gotcha. Okay. So, so
there's a, there's a similar

322
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.380
technique you can do too.
So, so in my case,

323
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.430
like blending between frames, using
motion player, that is kind

324
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.220
of like I'm interrelating between
those frames and I'm averaging,

325
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.980
you know, all the data
between those two States. And

326
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.050
that gives you a much
more smoother and much more

327
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.740
realistic view of what it
would like if you saw

328
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.770
it in reality, right? There's
a neat little trick. You

329
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.070
can do VR actually, where,
or actually outside of VR

330
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:00.660
too. So the problem is,
again, that you're showing incorrect

331
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:05.130
data, but instead of interrelating
it, you could just not

332
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.920
show data. And that's something
you can do in VR,

333
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.190
for instance, to, to make
it look smoother than it

334
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.070
actually renders because in VR,
your head movements and everything

335
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.920
is really important to have
tight because otherwise you're going

336
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.850
to get nauseous. So what
they do is that they

337
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.820
show the frame and then
they turn it off before

338
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.550
showing the next frame. So
they just turn off the

339
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.730
display, it's completely black. And
then they show the next

340
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.620
frame for a very, very
short amount of time. And

341
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.110
then to turn it off
again. And just by doing

342
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.480
that, it looks much smoother,
but just kind of an

343
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.180
interesting, yeah, it's a super
interesting way that your brain

344
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.300
sort of fills in the
gaps there. You're saying that

345
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.850
they would rather show you
nothing and your brain would

346
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.180
rather see nothing than see
wrong information. Yes. It looks

347
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.150
much better. There's you can
actually do this without VR,

348
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.050
too. I do have an
animation on that. Heck I

349
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.870
forgot where I put it,
but I can probably dig

350
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.420
it up at some point.
I could pick it up

351
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.520
now To dig it up
later and put it on

352
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.710
Twitter and people will, who
are listening to the show

353
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:04.970
will have a reason to
go and follow you on

354
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.930
Twitter. Yeah. Alright. It is
on Twitter somewhere. Very deep.

355
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.170
We'll go looking for it.
Oh, wait. I found it.

356
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.090
There we go. Impressive. You
can put it in the

357
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.560
chat right now. That's the
motion blur versus not. So

358
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.620
the left one does not
have motion blur the right

359
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.670
one does. Wow. Okay. So
what's interesting. I'm looking at

360
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.900
this and I'm going to
put this in the show

361
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.640
notes to you as well,
who are listening on the

362
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.560
show will be able to
see this as well. The

363
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.340
one on the right feels
very consistently blurry and natural.

364
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.440
One on the left feels
very, I don't know if

365
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.950
the word is jitter, but
my, my brain is seeing

366
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.980
almost like there's another white
dot. It's like, there's more

367
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.000
dots as this dot moves
through the sign waves. It's

368
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.430
different each time, because I
feel like I'm running at

369
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.130
one sink and it's running
at another sink. And my

370
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.750
brain is trying to figure
out like, are we at

371
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.880
what frame rate are we
at? And we're fighting. My

372
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.770
brain is fighting with itself.
Just to try to see

373
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:03.050
that. Yeah, that's very effective.
Hey folks, I'm taking this

374
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.970
episode advertise for other podcasts.
If you enjoy stories about

375
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.400
the people behind the technology
that we use, you should

376
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.300
check out the greater than
code podcast. They focus on

377
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.330
the human side of software
development with stories of diversity

378
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.780
and inclusion, accessibility from people
that you don't normally hear

379
00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.040
from search for greater than
code in your favorite podcast

380
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.740
app, or check out greater
than code.com. I also found

381
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.830
the other one, sorry. So,
so that one is not

382
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.430
the one that turns off
the pixels between that one

383
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.680
is just the, the motion
blur and the interpolation. And

384
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.200
that's the one that I
used in my render. And

385
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.880
we, this is the one,
this is the technique they

386
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.040
use in VR, but in
this case, it's outside of

387
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.200
VR. So, so this is
an example of using a

388
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.050
very low frame rate. I
think this is like 12

389
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.830
FPS, right? And the lower
one is also 12 FPS,

390
00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.570
but the motions that like
the lower one looks so,

391
00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.150
so, so much smoother, right?
Yeah. So it's, it is

392
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.090
blinking cause you're doing it
on purpose. It's strobing effectively.

393
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.040
Cause you're trying to make
the point, but if you

394
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.750
ignore the strobing, it doesn't,
it, it feels very consistent.

395
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.820
It has a heartbeat to
it while the standard one

396
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.690
is just teleporting, as you
said before. Exactly. So, so

397
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.150
what happens is that you,
that the trade off is

398
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.610
that your display, the net
effect is that it's going

399
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:27.600
to look darker when you
have this low persistence. Interesting.

400
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.510
I know that when you
watch, when you watch 3d

401
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.910
shows, they're flipping things back
and forth 3d movies. It

402
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.890
has less luminance because they
only have half as much

403
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.520
brightness going into one eye
as they flip 3d back

404
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.770
and forth. Oh yeah, exactly.
Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. So

405
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.230
this is interesting because now
you're kind of combining neuroscience

406
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.930
and how the brain works
with how the computer is,

407
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.930
is, are, is, are limited
in displaying pixels. And you're

408
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.510
combining all of that with
math. That's a lot of

409
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.880
stuff that one needs to
understand in order to be

410
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.240
effective in this, in this
world. We're asking a lot

411
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.200
of young people to start
to start out. Yeah. It's

412
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.680
you certainly don't need to
explore all the stuff that

413
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.810
I've done. That's mostly because
I've been very curious to

414
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.150
do that in game development.
And because I liked being

415
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.790
able to do all the
things on my own for

416
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.400
some reason, which is not
super great, but I enjoy

417
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.030
it. So, but yeah, it's,
it's kind of come from,

418
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.890
you know, I, I work
at a neat corporation where

419
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.720
we're making VR games and
we, yeah. Like making VR

420
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.060
games is very challenging in
many ways. And one of

421
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.570
them is that, you know,
learning about headsets, learning about

422
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.320
motion sickness, learning about vestibular
mismatch and all that stuff

423
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.410
they need to read about.
It's a lot, but it's

424
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.810
really interesting, I think, to,
to learn about how all

425
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:50.970
of that works. So yeah.
Vestibular mismatch, it's that your

426
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.240
eyes say one thing and
your ears say another thing

427
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.950
and you don't know why
you just know you don't

428
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.730
feel good. Exactly. How do
you put that into math?

429
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.560
Like, I mean, like we
know that that's a thing,

430
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.730
like it's, it's basically like
car sickness or seasickness and

431
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.550
that's one, it's why I
can only do 15, 20

432
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.050
minutes of VR and I
just need to take a

433
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.400
break and almost like, just
breeze. How can you solve

434
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.360
that? If you're all sitting
around at the neat corporation

435
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:21.900
going yeah. That's a thing
here's some ass. Yeah. Kind

436
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.320
of. Yeah. So, so what
the, so what happens is

437
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.770
that you see something happen,
right? Like you say, you

438
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.660
are sitting in a car
and you're reading a book.

439
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.450
That's like a common case
for a motion sickness or

440
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.300
looking at a smartphone. That's
a more modern take, I

441
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.200
suppose. Anyways. So, so let's
say you're in a car,

442
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.750
you're looking down at something
and you don't see the

443
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.500
outside at all. Like your,
the windows are outside of

444
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.160
your peripheral view. So what's
happening is that you are

445
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.120
seeing a mostly static world.
The car is not moving

446
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.240
relative to you for the
most part. And then the

447
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.970
world outside is moving a
lot. Right? There's a lot

448
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.360
happening. So people get motion
sick there, because then there

449
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.150
is that mismatch, right? You
see one thing, but he

450
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.910
feels something else. And then
people can, can get motion

451
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.390
sick from that. The motion
sickness you get in VR

452
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.600
is sort of the opposite
of that. It's reverse car

453
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.880
sickness, sort of where you,
you see a world that

454
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.490
is moving. If you're moving
a character or something is

455
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.370
happening with a camera in
game, but you don't feel

456
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.650
that at all. So it's,
it's the same, it's the

457
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.380
type of mismatch, but it's
reverse in terms of which

458
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.860
one is moving, right? So,
so the whole, so when

459
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.830
you need to solve is
how do you move the

460
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.660
player without costing vestibular mismatch,
which is a difficult problem.

461
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.590
So, you know, in most
games you have some character,

462
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.080
they can move around or
you look around or, you

463
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.590
know, run around a level
or whatever. That's really difficult

464
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.870
in VR, if you don't
want to get people sick.

465
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.370
So it turns out the,
the biggest problem is that

466
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.110
the biggest problem is acceleration
and expected. Acceleration. You don't

467
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:07.310
really sense linear movements. So
you can sense if you're

468
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.720
changing your direction or changing
your speed or velocity, but

469
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.160
you don't detect just having
a constant motion that will

470
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.520
generally not get you motion
sick. So say you're standing

471
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.060
on a train. That's just
moving forward linearly. Then that

472
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.130
generally doesn't get you motion
sick. Cause then there's no

473
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.280
mismatch. The mismatch is only
in terms of acceleration of

474
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.210
forces, right? That's why it's
more comfortable to be on

475
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.790
a plane that's cruising. And
you can read your book,

476
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.800
but when it starts to
bank or make a big

477
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:41.320
turn, you just like, Whoa.
Oh exactly. Yeah. Interesting. So

478
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.880
figuring out how to, how
to counteract that there are

479
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.240
there, there are now a
mathematical ways to understand those

480
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.810
things Or the mathematical ones.
I think it's more about

481
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.110
physics, you know, like figuring
out, well, what is, what

482
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.020
is movements? What is acceleration
and how do we make

483
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.850
that not happen? Right? So
if you, if the only

484
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.620
thing you can do is
linear movement, then you need

485
00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.400
to incorporate that into your
game. So, okay. Let's say

486
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.880
we cannot move forward with
a character continuously or something

487
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.030
where we could teleport. Right.
We could just, you know,

488
00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.810
instantly go from one place
to another and there's no

489
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.130
acceleration involved there. It's just
an instantaneous moment that happens.

490
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.300
So that doesn't cause motion
sickness. So, so then were

491
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.820
like, okay, so now we
have some tool we can

492
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.360
use to move throughout the
world. Right? This is when

493
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:38.500
I'm like, I've done Skyrim
in VR and it's just

494
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.860
awful. You're your head bobbing.
You're walking around. There's, there's

495
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.980
half a dozen different things
that are making you nauseous.

496
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.530
But then if you switch
telephone, Oh, it's really it's

497
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.040
horrendous. And then, but then
the teleport model that was

498
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.190
kind of like discovered in
VR is the, you, you,

499
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.470
you throw a parabola out
in front of you and

500
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.790
you say, I want to
be over there and you

501
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:00.690
go, and then suddenly you're
there, you've teleported. This, this

502
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.770
reminds me of some documents
that I read about early

503
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.040
filmmaking when they were trying
to figure out whether or

504
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.490
not a, a sharp edit
or a sharp cut would

505
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.820
confuse the viewer. Like, should
everything be in a continuous

506
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.060
cut, like our lives, right?
There's no cuts when I

507
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.810
live or, or if you
have, here's a person on

508
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.700
the screen. And then I
cut and now there's a

509
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.660
person over here with the
brain and be like, what

510
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.040
just happened? And apparently we're
really good at that. We're

511
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.530
totally okay with lots and
lots of fast cuts. And

512
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.330
we absorbed those things really
quickly. Yeah. Which is kind

513
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.000
of weird. Right? You wouldn't
expect the human brain to

514
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.790
be fine with that. Cause
it never happens in nature.

515
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.430
Yeah. I would expect the
human brain to be totally

516
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.120
fine with head bobbing while
walking around in Skyrim. And

517
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.860
I would, I would assume
intuitively or counter-intuitively that the

518
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.890
more realist, the more walking
in a game was like

519
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.460
walking the better. And in
fact, the less it's like

520
00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:03.170
walking the better isn't it?
Yeah, exactly. Interesting. One thing

521
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.610
I wanted to ask you
that was on my list

522
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.440
and it would be a
good way to close is

523
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.680
that one of your, one
of my favorite animations of

524
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.900
yours is the area of
a circle. One that we

525
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.360
mentioned a little bit, where
you have the circle, you

526
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.610
look at the radius, you
look at the circumference and

527
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.040
then you unfold it and
you show the relationship between

528
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.680
the area of the circle
and the area of a,

529
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:27.890
of a triangle. You, you
use something that's towel the,

530
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.080
the Greek letter towel. And
I have not seen that

531
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.890
before. I'm used to saying
PI times the radius squared,

532
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.230
but you have to bow.
And a lot of people

533
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.840
were also confused by that.
Was that, is that an

534
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.560
American versus European math? Like
how you're taught or what's

535
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.010
the deal with Tao? I
wish it was as popular

536
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.010
as that. So this could
be like an entire podcast

537
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.240
on its own. Really the
podcast about Tao. Yeah. There's

538
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.920
a, there spend sort of
a little movement to replace

539
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.220
pie with a different Constance.
Not really replace, I suppose,

540
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.320
but when, when it comes
to angles to use a

541
00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:08.240
different constants instead. So if
you measure angles, quite often,

542
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.820
you, you're probably used to
measuring, using degrees, right? You

543
00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.660
have zero degrees, 90 degrees
for right angle. And when

544
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.520
he did raise and then
three 60 for a full

545
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:20.120
turn, right, right. Scientifically and
quite often in programming. And

546
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.810
you know, whenever you're doing
tech and mathematically, usually you

547
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.680
don't really use degrees anymore.
There's a, another unit called

548
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.200
radiance and the radiance unit
for angle has a different

549
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.200
relationship for, you know, what
is a full turn? So

550
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.030
a full turn in radians
is the number of times

551
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:46.090
your radius of any circle
repeats around the circumference. So

552
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.830
turn silent. That number is
6.2 something, something right. So,

553
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.870
okay. So now we have
this new way of measuring

554
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:57.100
angles that goes from zero
to six points, something. So

555
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.740
if you have this relationship
or if you use this

556
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.950
angle, there's a really clean
way to convert, you know,

557
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.880
to get our callings from
angle and vice versa. There

558
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.580
are many, many relationships that
work out really well if

559
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:14.570
you use radiants instead of
degrees. So, so, okay. So,

560
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.170
so what is that number?
What is that 6.2 something?

561
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.060
Well, you're probably familiar with
the constant PI. So PI

562
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.440
is the ratio of the
circumference and the diameter of

563
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.790
a circle. So here we
run into this weird situation

564
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.110
where we have defined our
circle constant to be, you

565
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.770
know, using the diameter as
base, but our angle unit

566
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.370
radiants are using the radius
as the base. So what

567
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:47.230
happens is that if you
want a full turn, that

568
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.790
constant six point whatever is
equal to two PI. So

569
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.670
now we have this weird
situation where we have a

570
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.090
two there that is kind
of ugly, right? You want

571
00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.670
a full turn to not
have a constant of two

572
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.860
cause then you get, get
run into all sorts of

573
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.580
problems of like, okay, how
much is a quarter turn

574
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:10.270
is like, Oh, let's see,
is it hold on, is

575
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.990
it half PI? Is it
1.5? You know, you get

576
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.810
these conversion issues in your
head. So you have this

577
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.570
really weird units. So then
this turns up in so

578
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.350
many places in math where
you have two PI just

579
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:30.460
scattered throughout almost every equation
out there related to angles.

580
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.640
And then, you know, you
kind of run into this,

581
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.610
you know, why, why do
we use this? You know,

582
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.490
why do we define two
pious being a full turn?

583
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.190
Why not have a single
constant to represent a full

584
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.300
turn? Right. Well, and you
keep saying full turn, full

585
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.250
turn as a lay person
or as a more lay

586
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.190
person. I'm thinking to myself
pie is like the thing

587
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.880
I associate with circles, but
it's really half a circle.

588
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:57.630
Exactly. It's it's half a
turn when measuring in radiants

589
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.680
A second. So you said
6.2, something, something, well, PI

590
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:11.180
is 3.1415926. That is TA.
So this is 6.283. That,

591
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.730
that at da. Exactly. So,
so tile is exactly equal

592
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.890
to two PI. So then
you can take all of

593
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.340
these two pies, outerwear equations
and just right. Tile. And

594
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.670
the, the nice thing about
using tile is that if

595
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.520
you want the quarter of
a turn, well, that's a

596
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.890
quarter, a times town, if
you want half a turn,

597
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.890
that's, you know, half times
town, you get this very,

598
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.400
very intuitive way of, you
know, thinking about angles using

599
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:42.530
town. Whoa, she is something
I think math, well, I

600
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.980
don't know. You're teaching it
on Twitch and that's, what's

601
00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.580
exciting. I am teaching it
on Twitch and yeah, I

602
00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.500
also do it on Twitter
I suppose, but mostly on

603
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.500
Twitch and aggregate, I suppose.
Cause I, yeah, given my

604
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.800
life streaming and whatnot, there's,
there's quite often people who

605
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.960
come into the stream and
they're like, Oh, how much

606
00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.270
math do I need to
know to make games? And

607
00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.640
then I usually talk for
a bit too long about

608
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.780
that. Well, in fact, speaking
of you speaking for a

609
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.900
bit too long, you did
a really great math for

610
00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.690
game development live course. You
just kind of pulled it

611
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.060
out of thin air and
then ended up being about

612
00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.300
four hours. It's on your
YouTube. We'll put an include

613
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.550
a link for it. You
call it an improvised live

614
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:26.710
course. You also have a
Patrion and folks can find

615
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:33.340
you at twitch.tv/ <inaudible> a
C E G I K

616
00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.290
M O. I'll make sure
again, links to all the

617
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.970
show notes. We're going to
have a lot of great

618
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.060
links on this show. You're
doing a ton of stuff.

619
00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.160
And are you hoping to
put all this together into

620
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.860
one medium? So there's one
link that we can go

621
00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.930
to to learn more about
the work that you're doing.

622
00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.110
I hope I do that
one day. I don't know

623
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.390
when I'm going to do
that. As for my math

624
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:56.440
stuff, I have considered writing
a, like an online book

625
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.230
about math. I think that
one would incorporate a lot

626
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.020
of the, you know, the
useful math animations that I

627
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.210
do because I do a
lot of math animations that

628
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.560
are just arts. But, but
yeah, so I have this

629
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.580
idea of, you know, kind
of re-imagining a textbook and

630
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.180
sort of thinking about, okay,
what, what would a modern

631
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.970
textbook for math be? And
how can you make this

632
00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:22.840
practical instead of being, you
know, technical and covering all

633
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.500
the topics like a week,
a PDF page. Right? So

634
00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.740
yeah, I've been really excited
to try to do that

635
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.200
and try to, you know,
make something that feels more

636
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.920
modern and interesting. That would
be cool. Well, for now,

637
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.140
I'm going to enjoy your
Twitch and your Twitter and

638
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:42.640
look forward to this theoretical
future, a math book. I

639
00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.100
really appreciate you chatting with
me today. Yeah. Thank you

640
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.290
so much for having me.
We've been talking to Freya

641
00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.660
holler. You can check her
out at the show notes

642
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.140
and at ACE gizmo on
Twitch, this has been another

643
00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.840
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.

644
00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:07.180
