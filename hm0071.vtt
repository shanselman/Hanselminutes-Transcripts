this episode, Scott talks with
windows home server general manager,

9
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.370
Charlie Kendall. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman and this is

10
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.430
another episode of Hansel minutes.
I'm sitting down here with

11
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.310
Charlie Kendall, the general manager
of the windows home server

12
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.740
team. We've talked a little
bit about home server before.

13
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.810
I think I was able
to mention that I was

14
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.630
a beta tester, but it
was all NDA there for

15
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.220
a long time. So I
wasn't able to talk a

16
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.430
whole lot about home server
and rather than just me

17
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.920
talking about my experience now
that we can speak about

18
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.340
what we're, what we're experiencing
at home server. We actually

19
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.890
want to sit down with
Charlie and talk about the

20
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.860
product what's the, the developer
story is the, some of

21
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.800
the different extensibility APIs and
what the plan is for

22
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.980
the future. Thanks Charlie, for
sitting down, I really appreciate

23
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.380
it. I'm looking forward to
the conversation. Now, this was

24
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.620
originally called, was it project
X or something? No, it

25
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.250
was actually originally when it
was just a, an incubation

26
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.470
project. The code name was
Quatro Quatro. Yeah. And then

27
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.010
as we became a product
group within Microsoft, we renamed

28
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.530
the, the code name for
the product was Q it's

29
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.540
a letter Q Q that
I knew it was a

30
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.240
letter, a single letter project
queue. And I remember that

31
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.530
people were putting on their,
their messenger ch their messenger

32
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.510
nicknames that they were running
project queue. And it was

33
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.280
starting a lot of buzz
around people. This was a

34
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.770
beta that a lot of
people wanted to be on.

35
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.420
Yeah. Now when I got
on it, I actually took

36
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.410
an old media center PC
that I didn't, I wasn't

37
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.440
using and turned it into
a, a windows home server

38
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.640
found every external hard drive
that I could find in

39
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.790
my house and plugged them
all in. And that's the

40
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.670
thing that I think that
people notice the first, when

41
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.920
they plug in a home
server, is that it turns

42
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.120
everything into a big chunk
of storage. Yeah. So I'm

43
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.950
curious, how many hard drives
did you end up with?

44
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.400
I think I ended up
with six varying sizes from

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.700
20 gigs up to 500.
Yeah. We had one machine

46
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.850
that we named Fred that
had 23 drives attached to

47
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.240
it at One point, just
as a kind of a

48
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.850
stress test. Yeah. So drive
extender the technology that enables,

49
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.080
you know, we're just talking
about is pretty cool and

50
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.390
we're pretty proud of it.
It, it, it, it gives

51
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.540
you this virtualized storage pool,
the idea that you have,

52
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.090
you know, you can just
add drives in, and you

53
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.310
have a single namespace for
all of your files and

54
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.050
folders. And on top of
that, it provides redundancy with

55
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.360
duplications so that if you
have a failure, you don't

56
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.880
have a hard drive, you
don't lose any data. And

57
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.940
it gives you the benefits
that we've seen from raid

58
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.000
and Ray technologies in the
past with a fraction of

59
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.330
the complexity and far more
flexibility. So forgive my ignorance.

60
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.310
As I only know what
I learned when I've, you

61
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.130
know, learned about rate as
a user and as someone

62
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.910
who's read about it, but
why is it? Is it

63
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.150
that complicated? What is so,
I mean, from everyone I've

64
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.910
talked to about drive extender,
it is really a pretty

65
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.950
amazing piece of software. And
it really is that it's

66
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.100
a software solution. How is
it different from a software

67
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.220
raid solution? Well, first, I'll
start off by saying, you

68
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.670
know, this product is built
for consumers and it's their

69
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.250
primary target are consumers who
are not technical and they're

70
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.850
not geeks. And when we
go talk to these customers

71
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.240
and we, we early on,
we asked them about raid

72
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.760
and, you know, this was
mostly in the U S

73
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.160
and of course their initial
reaction is, well, isn't that

74
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.650
something that kills bugs that
you, you know, you kill

75
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.540
cockroaches with brand recognition because
cause they have, they have

76
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.020
no idea what rate is.
And, you know, a normal

77
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.600
consumer who uses a PC
would never see such horrific

78
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.830
technology and raid really was
designed to solve a problem

79
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.890
in the, you know, in
the corporate computing space, it

80
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.500
was never designed as a
consumer technology. And, and, you

81
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.330
know, it was also, you
know, the, the different grade

82
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.100
levels have been designed over
the years, but it's, it's,

83
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.550
it's a fairly old technology
and it turns out to

84
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.410
be very fragile. It's fragile
from a perspective of, of,

85
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.160
of what, when you do
have a failure, what that

86
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.000
failure looks like. So for
example, if you have a,

87
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.560
a raid one system and
you, so you have mirroring

88
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.440
between two drives, if you
want to replace the, the

89
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.240
drive, the fails, you have
to replace with a drive,

90
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.240
that's basically the same size,
Right. I remember doing rate

91
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.510
early on when I had
a driver one size and

92
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.330
a smaller drive, and I
ended up getting two smaller

93
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.270
drives. That's right. And then,
and then on top of

94
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.420
that, it's, it's usually restricted
to a, you know, a

95
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.110
single bus type. So if
you want to have a

96
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.900
rate array, it's gotta be
all Satta drives or all

97
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.980
IDE drives or all scuzzy
drives. And with drive extender,

98
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.080
we allow you to use
drives of any type and

99
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.020
mix them together and any
size and mix them together.

100
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.930
Yeah. With my, with my
beta that I had, I

101
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.150
ended up with a couple
of 'em external USB drives,

102
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.860
two FireWire drives two internal
IDE drives. And I think

103
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.590
I ended up with something
like 800 Meg, a hundred,

104
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.430
800 gigs who was some
unusual number. It was like

105
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.900
864 gigs or something like
that. Right. I, you know,

106
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.450
we started the project back
when it was still Quatro.

107
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.450
We, we did some prototyping
and had a, had an

108
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.990
early alpha that was actually
based on using software raid,

109
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.110
you know, windows, windows includes
a software raid stack. And,

110
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.480
and we actually use that
initially. And what we found

111
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.120
was that it would be
very difficult for us to

112
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.510
deliver the end user experience.
We really wanted to provide

113
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.860
on top of raid. And
we decided, and we, what

114
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.560
we discovered is that we
could apply our engineering resources

115
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.250
and our IQ to designing
something that actually met the

116
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.090
requirements we had. And in
the end, at the end

117
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.790
of the day, it would
actually be easier for us

118
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.900
to accomplish that, given the,
the expertise that we had

119
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.300
within Microsoft on this topic.
So we're, we're, again, we're

120
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.670
really excited about the idea
that we can, we can

121
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:12.970
remove so many concepts from
a consumers repertoire. So, you

122
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.580
know, w when you use
windows home server, and you

123
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.520
think about the storage aspects
of it, all, you know,

124
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.030
that you have is you
have hardware, hard disks, and

125
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.050
you have shared folders, right.
And it's really no more

126
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.390
complicated than that. You add
a new hard drive and

127
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.600
your storage pool gets bigger,
and you can have that,

128
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.230
that storage pool is available
to your shared folders. Yeah.

129
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.840
One of the things that
really convinced me that this

130
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.440
was something entirely different was
the first time I opened

131
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.460
the start menu. And there's
only one thing in the

132
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.910
start menu. Yeah. That, that
just, I was like, Oh

133
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.270
yeah, this is an appliance.
I'm not supposed to be

134
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.960
in here at all. That
was pretty amazing. And then

135
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.850
the way that you use
remote desktop, one of the

136
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.710
things that I like about
this is that you installed

137
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.740
a little connector application on
each of your machines in

138
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.620
your home, basically registering each
computer with the home server.

139
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.520
And that, that single tray
icon handles back up handles

140
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.970
health notifications and lets you
connect to the console when

141
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.100
you connect to the console,
you're basically doing what appears

142
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.250
to be a remote desktop
connection into a single application.

143
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.940
So you remote desktop over
to this home server console.

144
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.790
So whether you're logged in
remotely or whether you're logged

145
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.910
in locally, there is only
one application you ever really

146
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.980
need to care about on
a home server. It's that

147
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.110
main console. Yeah. It allows
us also because we've, we've

148
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.120
we built a solution the
way you describe where the,

149
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.630
what we call the home
server console, which is the

150
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.900
tool that the homeowner is
going to use to configure

151
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.070
the server, to change settings
relative to the server that,

152
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.050
that it's, you know, you
think of it. And now

153
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.180
in analogy it's like the
web page you get when

154
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.010
you buy a router and
you go and configure a

155
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.770
router or a wireless point.
Right. Right. Well, that experience

156
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.520
we decided to build using
on top of the remote

157
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.140
desktop technology. And one of
the advantages that it gives

158
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.540
us is the ability for
us to write native windows

159
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.480
code for our administrative console.
We just that, that code

160
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.310
that the whole console is
written using C sharp and

161
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.000
the.net framework and wind forms.
And we're able to do,

162
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.880
you know, be able to
use all those great windows

163
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.120
tools to do that and
not have to go to

164
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.740
the lowest dominant denominator of
a, some server HTML representation,

165
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.990
which is what most, most
of these, these types of

166
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.590
products do. And in addition
to that, it made it

167
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.650
really easy for us to
enable a third party story

168
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.010
where third parties could build,
add ends that that added

169
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.660
into our administration console or
the home server console for

170
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.160
their value added for configuring
their value add What, what

171
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.020
kind of third party things
have you seen developed so

172
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.050
far? I know I've been
pressuring the guys@mozy.com that do

173
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.560
online backup to, to basically
back up my home server.

174
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.800
Well, it's, it's been interesting,
you know, when you, when

175
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.470
you, when you bring out
a new product that has

176
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.650
extensibility and platform capabilities, you
never really know what you're

177
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.470
going to get. You certainly
can try and, you know,

178
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.510
have some targeted efforts to
try and get the people

179
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.430
you believe should be on
the platform to get there.

180
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.970
What we've discovered is that
people are doing some pretty

181
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.050
exciting stuff. There's a couple,
a good list of add

182
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.180
ins that are available on
the internet. There's a blog

183
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.350
called, we got served.co.uk, and
he's got a nice list

184
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.640
of the ones that are
out there, but here's a

185
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.080
couple examples. There's a company
called I think it's called

186
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.290
keep vault. And they have
an online backup service on

187
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.110
internet backup service. So we'll
back up your shared folders

188
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.810
to their service, you know,
on the internet. And they

189
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.700
have a very nice ad
in that, you know, presents

190
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.950
a new tab in our
admin console allows you to

191
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:55.160
configure that there is an
add in for being able

192
00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.170
to upload your photos automatically
to flicker. It's called a

193
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:05.240
sync. Oh shoot. I think
it's called photo sync. That

194
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.850
was very clever. I didn't
see that one coming. Yeah.

195
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.400
And another one that, that,
you know, that is really

196
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.950
good for the more enthusiast
crowd is wake on land.

197
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.650
There's actually two of these
where people have built add

198
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.970
ins that allow you to
wake up your client computers

199
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.240
from the home server console.
And what that means is

200
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.520
that you can connect into
your house remotely via our

201
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.210
remote access solution. And if
your home computer is turned

202
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.000
off, you can actually wake
it up and turn it

203
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.580
on remotely. So it's not,
it doesn't have to be

204
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.310
on all the time. No,
that's a feature of, of,

205
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.250
of bio of the bios
that has been out for

206
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.350
years, but no, one's really
come up with a great

207
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.250
way to do it. Exactly.
The, the remote access thing

208
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.820
is, is a, is a
really quite extraordinary. The initial

209
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.640
betas, I would go up
and go to like dynamic

210
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.920
DNS org, get myself a
nice dynamic DNS name, like

211
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.970
Hanselman dot something. And then
I would basically connect into

212
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.340
my home server just by
punching a hole in the

213
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.190
firewall. I did my own
port forwarding, and then I

214
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.990
could look at the home
server console and then you

215
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.930
would proxy remote desktop. And
I thought that was the

216
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.150
greatest thing ever. And I
used it all over the

217
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.000
place. It was a much
better solution for me than

218
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.020
using things like hamachi or
go to my PC. And

219
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.640
then I said, well, this
is great. This is brilliant.

220
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.540
And then the release candidate
came out and I noticed

221
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.470
that you guys put up
your own system. I think

222
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.430
it was called live node
that would give people like

223
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.860
my mom or my dad
who would not have the

224
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.370
ability to, you know, bust
holes in their firewall, much

225
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.160
less come up with a
dynamic DNS name. You'll use

226
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.270
their windows live ID, sign
them up for their own

227
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.960
sub domain under something like
live node.com and then they

228
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.050
can get secure access to
their machines. And then you

229
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.960
used a UPNP to talk
to the router, to bust

230
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.300
the hole in the firewall
yourself. I thought that was

231
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.430
about the slickest user experience
I'd seen in a long

232
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.030
time. Yeah. You know, this
is one of those features

233
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.180
that, that we'd plan for
long time and, and knowing

234
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.390
what I've known, knowing about
home networks and the internet,

235
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.430
and, you know, my experience
in building a lot of

236
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.530
software, I knew that this
would be really hard to

237
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.370
get, right. So I was
always a little skeptical, but

238
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.330
the team just delivered and
in conjunction with the windows

239
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.780
live team, what we've delivered
is this out of the

240
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.750
box with windows home server,
you get a free name

241
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.290
on the internet for your
home. And it comes in

242
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.150
the form right now in
the beta and the RC

243
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.840
it's under the tier Terry
domain name of live node.com.

244
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.660
But when we are TM,
that will switch over to

245
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.710
home server.com. And so, so
just like you can sign

246
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.080
up for a Hotmail address
or any other address, you'll

247
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.150
be able to sign up
for whatever you want off

248
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.840
of home server.com. So for
example, you know, I would

249
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.530
be able to get Charlie
Kendall dot home server.com and,

250
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.600
and anywhere I am in
the world, I'll be able

251
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.300
to access my home server
by using that, that URL.

252
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.630
And as you said, we
also will automatically configure your

253
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.760
router if it supports you
UPNP to open the appropriate

254
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.460
ports and make that work.
So what's the security story

255
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.860
there. Now that seems like
a giant honeypot for evil

256
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.350
people to run around it,
you know, in certain name

257
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.420
here dot home server.com. How
are you going to keep

258
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.630
people from using passwords like
password? Yeah, well, one of

259
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.340
the things we've done on
the product is we've we've,

260
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.880
we, we have, you know,
secure, secure by default in

261
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.250
services or off by default.
And so this whole remote

262
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.890
access capability is off by
default. It has to be

263
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.160
explicitly enabled. And if a
user does choose to enable

264
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:41.610
it, we then enforce complex
passwords. And we think that

265
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.170
that's very important that people
get educated on using complex

266
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.230
password passwords for things where
there's, there's a potential for

267
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:54.350
people to do brute brute
force as well as actually

268
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.480
us do, you know, going
into the next step of,

269
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.370
of making it so that
it's a requirement that they

270
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.900
do. So Now, one of
the things that I've personally

271
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.180
had a little trouble with
as I recently switched from

272
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.800
Comcast to Fios and or
files Verizon, and they won't

273
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.140
let me run anything over
port 80. So in the

274
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.240
last few weeks, as I've
upgraded to the latest version

275
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.280
of home server and simultaneously
got this new Verizon or

276
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.460
any ISP that blocks port
80, I've become really a

277
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.730
neutered in my ability to
use this thing. What kind

278
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.550
of alternate port abilities will
we have either in this

279
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.460
version or a future version?
Well, fortunately in, in the

280
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.740
first version of the product,
the, the, the, the secure

281
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.550
aspect of our remote access
runs over the SSL port,

282
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:42.520
which is port four 43,
and port 80 is actually

283
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.630
not necessary. If it's blocked,
the product will still work.

284
00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.840
You just can't go to
the, the unprotected homepage. You

285
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.860
have to use an HTTPS
URL. And so for the

286
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.930
situations where the ISP is,
are blocking port 80, it,

287
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.040
it works fine. And the
other, the other part of

288
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.370
this is it turns out
that, that, that from a

289
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.010
worldwide basis, the number of
IPS that are blocking port

290
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.180
80 is actually relatively small,
although that could change, or

291
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.190
it could change for the
better. I, we think that

292
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.500
our product demonstrates that there's
a demand for this type

293
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:20.050
of thing. And that the
ISP is, you know, our,

294
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:24.050
our, you know, may choose
to change the way they

295
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.590
think about this. You know,
in the future, we will,

296
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.610
we will continue to improve
this solution. And there's there's

297
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.120
techniques that you can use
for doing, you know, port

298
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.180
redirection and so forth when
you do have a DNS

299
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.970
name. So we will be
looking into those things. So

300
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.820
as a, as an advanced
user myself, if they block

301
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.240
four 43, I could certainly
figure out ways to do

302
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.080
port forwarding and still possibly
use the solution in a,

303
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.510
in a situation like this.
I recognize that a lot

304
00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.750
of ISP is aren't blocking
80. It's just that Phylos

305
00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:00.280
is becoming so popular with
their high bandwidth solution. It's

306
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.590
going to be a challenge
to convince people that opening

307
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.320
up port 80 for home
server doesn't necessarily open up

308
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.630
people for running their own
web servers, you know, behind

309
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.110
the firewall, Right? And again,
with the first version of

310
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.420
the product, if you have
the RC right now, if

311
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.310
you are, if you're on
a service that is blocking

312
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.060
port 80, the product actually
worked just fine. And only

313
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.940
problem you have is that,
that, that during our test

314
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.270
where we're testing your internet
connection, we are, our dialog

315
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.880
box will come back and
say, Hey, I can't see

316
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.660
your home server from the
internet. And, but the, the

317
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.980
subsequent tests has pet tests
pass. And what that means

318
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.540
is that as long as
you access your own server

319
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.870
with the HTTPS URL, it
will work fine. So what's

320
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.600
the security story. Then, as
far as my issuing myself,

321
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.930
my own SSL certificate, or
did this home server.com have

322
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.430
a wildcard cert, no, we
are, the home server itself

323
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.670
Is generating a self sign
cert in the RC, and

324
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.640
it will do so also
in our TM, the, the

325
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.880
downside of this solution. And
we recognize that there's an

326
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.110
issue here is when users
go to access that page,

327
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.080
they will be asked to,
you know, effectively ignore a

328
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.830
warning about the validity of
that certificate, because it is

329
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.550
self signed and most internet
browsers don't trust, self sign

330
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.410
certificates. We, you know, we
haven't announced anything here yet,

331
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.080
but we, we are working
on a solution to this

332
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.390
problem that will be made,
made available in the very

333
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.760
near future. And I don't,
I don't want to talk

334
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.970
any more about it. We
haven't announced any details, but

335
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.070
we recognize that this is
an issue. And it's something

336
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.660
that we've been working on
for a long time. And,

337
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.840
and we've got, I think,
a very creative solution that's

338
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.860
in the works Well, I
solve the solution by simply

339
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.340
explicitly trusting it, and then
everything was good. Great. Yeah.

340
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.480
And for, for, for PCs
that are, that have been

341
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.090
joined to the, the windows
home server using the connector

342
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.400
software, right. If you were
to take them on the

343
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.960
road, we automatically install our
cert on those, those client

344
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.140
PCs. So they, they automatically
trust their own home server.

345
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.870
So it's really only when
you're, when you're in an

346
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:07.370
internet cafe or using someone
else's PC. Now back to

347
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.290
the drive, extended thing. One
of the things that really

348
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.600
struck me when I went
and backed up all the

349
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.820
machines in my house, when
I did the complete, it's

350
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.290
a complete image backup, right?
Correct. The amount of space

351
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:23.390
that was used up seemed
an unbelievably small on, on

352
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.210
the, on the home server.
I mean, I was backing

353
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.720
up what I thought was
hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes.

354
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.960
Right. And it did not
feel like it also went

355
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.230
so fast. It didn't feel
possible. What am I missing?

356
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.050
Well, here, this is, this
is another one of those

357
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.000
places where I get to
say, I'm extremely proud of

358
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.960
my team because we've created,
we've done some very innovative

359
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.500
stuff. There's really four places
where we have some deep

360
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.300
innovation we're proud of, and
this is one of them.

361
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.660
We talked about drive extender.
We talked about remote access.

362
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.110
And this is the third
one, which is the, the,

363
00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:02.480
the, all the full computer
PC backup. What happens, you

364
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.270
know, we, we, we recognized
very early on one of

365
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.910
the core value propositions we
had to deliver against was

366
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.060
protecting people's data. And we
thought about this from the

367
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.270
perspective of, you know, do
we need to protect the

368
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.060
people who accidentally delete a
file and want to get

369
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.280
that file back? That's the
thick finger delete scenario. We

370
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.860
thought about protecting people who
have a client PC that

371
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.020
goes wrong, and they want
to get that client PC

372
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.950
back because not necessarily because
it has precious data on

373
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.720
it, but because getting it
back to the way it

374
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.320
was yesterday, normally is going
to take days and days

375
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.490
of re reinstalling and reconfiguring.
So it's really protecting time.

376
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.910
And then the third scenario
is the, you know, Oh

377
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.060
my, my house is burned
down or something catastrophic has.

378
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.620
And, you know, fortunately everyone
is safe. And fortunately all

379
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.380
my precious data was backed
up somewhere else. And those

380
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.990
are the way we are
the three areas that we

381
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.450
want to protect against. It
turns out in the first

382
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.360
version, the third one we
did not, we did not

383
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.300
have the time to address
and we will address it

384
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.640
in the future. The other
two, we think we've nailed.

385
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.620
And we think the, the,
the second one I talked

386
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.010
about we've really nailed, which
is the all computer, the

387
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.270
whole computer backup. And here's
how it works. We take

388
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.050
each PC in your house
and we scan all the

389
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.290
hard drives on that PC.
And we take the clusters

390
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:27.490
that are really, they're generally
four kilobyte clusters. And we

391
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.100
take those, those clusters and
we back them up to

392
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.320
the server, but we do
it in a way where

393
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.140
we only transfer CLA clusters
to the server that have

394
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.040
never been seen by the
server before this is called

395
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.790
single instance, storage. Every cluster
is tagged somehow uniquely Yes.

396
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.510
That it's, it's actually using
a hashing algorithm. Okay. So

397
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.600
you're very standard way of,
you know, taking a block

398
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.930
of data and saying it's
unique or not. And, and

399
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.240
so effectively on the home
server is this database of,

400
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.680
of clusters along with all
the metadata that would be

401
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.860
required to take all those
clusters and turn them back

402
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.590
into the original file system
at a point in time.

403
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.640
And so what this, what
this means is that you,

404
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.150
you have this, this, this
great savings in both what,

405
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.540
how much data is transferred
over the network, but also

406
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.180
how much is actually stored
on the server. And so,

407
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.270
like you, a lot of
people who, who, who run

408
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.360
windows home server with multiple
PCs, backing it up. If

409
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.400
you were to sum up
all the use space on,

410
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.040
on, you know, your four
or five PCs, it may

411
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.620
be two or 300 gigabytes
of data. But if you're

412
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.510
looking at the actual amount
of data, we're storing on

413
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:40.830
the server, it's in the
50 or 60 gigabytes, which

414
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.450
frankly it is creepy. It
is very creepy, but there,

415
00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.950
what was the, there's a
famous quote about the only

416
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.300
difference between magic and technology
is something to do with,

417
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.650
no, it wasn't Any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from

418
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.960
magic. There you go. That
was Robert a Highline, I

419
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.530
believe. Yeah. That's exactly what
it feels like though. The

420
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:10.170
backups are, are ridiculously fast.
And there's a certain sense.

421
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.400
I don't know if maybe
you could solve it in

422
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.590
a UI way, but there's
a certain sense that, well,

423
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.090
nothing really happened. And am
I really protected? It's kind

424
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.550
of, it's, it's, it's interesting,
but it's also nice because

425
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.560
it freed up space for
things like, you know, my

426
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.950
MP3s and my videos. So
when I was thinking, wow,

427
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.900
I don't think a 700
gigs is going to be

428
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.830
enough. It turned out to
be more than enough. Yeah.

429
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.530
I'm glad to hear that,
that you mentioned something that

430
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.560
I think is fascinating is
the UI challenges or user

431
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.290
experience challenges around this. And,
and it, it is a

432
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:44.640
challenge. And we, we spent
a lot of time with

433
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.890
multiple designs on, on how
to present this. And, and

434
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.880
I'm not convinced we've completely
gotten it right, because as

435
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.810
you, as you mentioned, it's
a, it's, it still doesn't

436
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:04.910
necessarily present, you know, the,
the complete confidence. But one

437
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.040
of the nice things about
getting the product out there

438
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.200
is we'll be able to,
you know, hear from actual

439
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.900
customers who pay for it,
which, which is a great

440
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.590
way of being able to
iterate. Now, every once in

441
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.200
a while, my home server
will announce that it's balancing

442
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.150
storage. What is that? That
is a part of drive

443
00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.700
extender. And what it's doing
there is it is making

444
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.210
sure that one, if you
have a shared folder that

445
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.260
is marked for duplication, it
is actually duplicated. The data

446
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.950
is all, all redundantly stored.
And two, it is making

447
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.730
sure that we are using
your desks that you have

448
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.160
on the most effective way
possible. Okay. So if I

449
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.960
yanked a drive and I
was protected because of duplication

450
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.840
at some point, either at
the point that I yanked

451
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.380
it, or as soon after
a rebalancing would occur and

452
00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.930
a redistribution of, of, of
the bites to make sure

453
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.280
that they were, they were
effectively duplicated again, Corrected the,

454
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.870
the actual steps that would
would happen in that case

455
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.880
is, is if you just,
if a drive failed or

456
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.550
you literally just yanked it
out without telling us about

457
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.450
it, your storage status would
go from green to red,

458
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.150
indicating you have a health
problem on your home server.

459
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.980
And then any shared folder
that had files that was,

460
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:26.380
that was duplicated onto that
drive would go from green,

461
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.510
healthy to yellow failing, which
indicates that, Hey, you know,

462
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.520
your, your, your data's still
here. I still got a

463
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.310
copy of it, but if
you were to lose another

464
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.570
drive, that would be bad.
That's what failing means. And

465
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.660
then if you said, okay,
yeah, that drive is actually

466
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.450
gone. It's dead. And you,
you told us to remove

467
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.050
it via the, the remove
command. We would then go

468
00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.040
about making sure that your
data was reduplicated across the,

469
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.920
the other drives you still
had, or the new drive

470
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.080
you, you potentially have added
to replace the one that

471
00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.380
was bad. Now, a number
of people have commented to

472
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.800
me that they were surprised
how little hardware they needed

473
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.660
to run home server. And
there's been a lot of

474
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.240
confusion in the blogs about
whether or not home server

475
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.450
would be available to the
moderate to advanced user, or

476
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.120
if it was going to
be exclusively in OEM hardware

477
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.390
agreement. What's the story there
I'll address the question about

478
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.500
the hardware requirements. First, you
know, remember windows home server

479
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.130
is, is, is, is based
on the windows server 2003

480
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.340
code base, which is, you
know, derive from the windows

481
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.590
2000 code base. And, you
know, if you go back

482
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.130
to when windows server 2003
was released, which was, I

483
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:41.710
believe in, in late 2002,
and you think about the,

484
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.720
the, the high end hardware
that was available that time,

485
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:52.260
it was 900 megahertz Pentium,
three processors, and the most

486
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.590
advanced workloads on the planet
were running on that hardware

487
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.700
at that point in time,
SQL server I S exchange

488
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.330
and so forth. And so
that the actual Rico resource

489
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.710
requirements for a windows server
2003 server are pretty meager

490
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.090
Heightened. I mean, there's virtually
nothing running on it. You've

491
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.870
hardened it clearly. So, so,
so our resource requirements are

492
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.600
also meager because of that.
So that, that addresses the,

493
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.210
you know, the fact that
it only requires effectively a,

494
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:25.790
a one gigahertz Pentium, three
equivalent processor and half a

495
00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:31.100
gigabyte of memory. The, the
question about, you know, how

496
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.950
people will be able to
buy the product it's pretty

497
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.590
straight forward. The primary way
that we will, the product

498
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:41.270
will be sold is through
standard retail channels where consumers

499
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.180
will buy a product built
by an OEM, you know,

500
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.620
Hewlett, Packard, median, see the
other ones that have announced

501
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.070
that they're going to be
building windows home servers. You'll

502
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.170
be able to walk into
your favorite electronic store and,

503
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.810
you know, best buy whatever,
and buy a box, bring

504
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.660
it home, plug it in
and off you go. That's

505
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.440
the primary way. But, you
know, when we, I helped

506
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.590
build windows media center edition.
And when we shipped windows

507
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.070
media center edition, we realized
that we had a, you

508
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.130
know, a core part of
our, our audience, our customer

509
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.000
base, some would argue the
most important part, which is

510
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.270
the enthusiasts really kind of
liked to build their own

511
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.990
hardware. They like to go
and buy, you know, components

512
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:27.980
from Fry's or new egg.com
or whatever, and, and piece

513
00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.010
the machine together the way
they want, and then install

514
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.650
the software on it. And
when we did media center

515
00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.750
edition, we didn't make it
available in a way that

516
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.630
that enthusiast could do that.
There were good reasons for

517
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.640
that at the time, the,
the, the hardware for tuner

518
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.890
cards and so forth was
really flaky at that time.

519
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.440
And, and it was so
there are good reasons for

520
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.060
that, but, but it was
a lesson learned. And so

521
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.910
when we started this project,
we applied that learning. And

522
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.190
we said from the beginning
that we would make the

523
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.790
software available in a way
that enthusiasts could build their

524
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.640
own hardware on them. We
are doing that. And we're

525
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.120
doing that through the system
builder channel, which, which, which,

526
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.510
which enables people to, to
buy hardware from a system

527
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:09.620
builder, the hardware that they
want and, and then install

528
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.270
the software themselves. So we
think we buy by doing

529
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.180
that, we get a, you
know, focus on our primary

530
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.390
market again, which is the,
the, the, the end users

531
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.720
that just want to buy
a, you know, a device

532
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:28.130
and as well, satisfy the
enthusiast base. It will be

533
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.900
challenging just to get the
software, if I want to

534
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.230
repurpose an existing machine. I,
it's not really. I mean,

535
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.690
it's just, just like today,
if you wanted to go

536
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:42.610
buy windows, media center edition,
it's possible it's channels. That's

537
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.140
where I just go to,
you know, go to any

538
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.790
of the system builders that
are available online, for example.

539
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.540
Excellent. Excellent. And do you
see this as competing with

540
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.330
something like a <inaudible> or
any of these other kinds

541
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:58.110
of a single purpose backup
systems, or do you think

542
00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.080
it's because of the addition
of the remote access and

543
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.640
the shared, you know, shared
users and all that kind

544
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.580
of stuff, does it, it,
it appears to be more

545
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.330
than just a backup robot.
It's so much more, but

546
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.120
do you think that people
will compare it to those

547
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.370
kinds of appliances? Well, it's
hard for me to say

548
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.650
what people will do in
terms of, of comparing things.

549
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.620
I, my personal belief is
that we are building a

550
00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.490
product that is very unique,
and it has, you know,

551
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.800
from, from a scenario perspective
of what the, the value

552
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.970
it delivers to the customer,
nothing comes close. And, you

553
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.730
know, it ranges from the
fact that we provide centralized

554
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.870
storage for all of your
PCs. We provide a comprehensive

555
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.620
data protection system that, that
isn't some app you install

556
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.710
on a, on a client
PC and configure, and, you

557
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.500
know, and then have to
manually do stuff. The product

558
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.740
does it for you. It
provides a rich remote access

559
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.650
capability. It allows you to
access your PCs and your

560
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.710
files remotely. And then on
top of that, it is

561
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.160
a platform, right. We've already
seen evidence of the, the,

562
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.280
the third party ad-ons that
are coming online. You know,

563
00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.440
there's already, you know, more
than several dozen in the

564
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.290
work. So we're aware of,
right. It was definitely a

565
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:20.070
test that the developer SDK
is very cool and creating,

566
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.830
you know, editing the manifest
files and creating your own

567
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.060
extensions onto the UI are
really very, very easy. Yeah.

568
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.010
So, so, you know, I,
I think all of that

569
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.190
combines to a product that,
that is, that is very

570
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.590
unique. And, and I don't
think there's anything out there

571
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.620
that you can compare it
to. I think that you

572
00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.470
could take any one of
our, our, our solutions, and

573
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.360
you may be able to
find a product in the

574
00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.270
market that, that, that tries
to deliver that particular part

575
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.670
of the solution, but not
nothing that does it in

576
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.940
such an integrated way. Great.
I'm going to put up

577
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.550
on the website links to
the home server, STK the

578
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.250
home servers site, some of
your channel nine videos in

579
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:59.130
the past. I'm personally, I've
talked about this when it

580
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.370
first came out and I
was allowed to talk after

581
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.820
the NDA was lifted, but
the I'm, I'm totally excited

582
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.130
about this. I, I actually,
I got a little trouble

583
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.750
for it, but I made
the statement that was more

584
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.750
excited about home server than
I was about Vista. And

585
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.240
frankly, I'm kind of still
there. I mean, this, this

586
00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.290
it's, it's changed the amount
of, I call it psychic

587
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.900
weight. You carry around a
certain amount of psychic weight.

588
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.810
If your stuff's not backed
up and knowing that your

589
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.900
entire house was backed up.
Yeah. There's a certain amount

590
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.770
of lightness of being that
occurs when you're, when, when

591
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.780
everything you have is, is
backed up and, and I'm,

592
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.870
I'm really excited about HomeServe.
And I really appreciate you

593
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.740
taking the time to talk
with me today. No, I'm

594
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.490
gratified To hear you say
that, because I think that,

595
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.200
you know, that was one
of our goals going in,

596
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.530
and I also, I appreciate
you taking the time as

597
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.220
this is a good conversation,
and I enjoy, I really

598
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.380
enjoy listening to your podcasts.
Well, thanks. This has been

599
00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.200
Scott Hanselman with Charlie Kendall,
and this was another episode

600
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.790
of Hansel minutes. We'll see
you again next week.
