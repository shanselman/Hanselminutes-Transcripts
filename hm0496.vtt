<inaudible> A weekly discussion with

8
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.700
web developer and technologist. Scott Hansen,
Lawrence Ryan, Let me show number

9
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.040
500. In this episode, Scott
talks about Kyle series of

10
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.020
books entitled. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

11
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.440
episode of Hansel minutes. And
today I'm talking with, Gedifa

12
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.860
also known as Kyle Simpson, the
author of a number of

13
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.240
really great books about how
I don't know JS. In

14
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.490
fact, you, the audience don't
know JS is that right?

15
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.790
Kyle? None of us really
know Java script, Including myself.

16
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.610
I still don't know it,
but I I'm. I'm trying

17
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.670
to help people embrace that
notion and not be scared

18
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.040
of the fact that there's
always more to learn. That's

19
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.160
a pretty bold title for
a series of books. I

20
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.800
mean, just to basically, you
know, you're walking at Barnes

21
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.440
and noble at a bookstore,
you pass by a book,

22
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.660
there's all sorts of books,
like learn JavaScript for 24

23
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.910
hours and then you pass
the one that just says

24
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.350
you don't know JS. Yeah.
So the title was designed

25
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.300
to go along with the
tone of the book. And

26
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.960
the tone of the book
is to gently challenge developers,

27
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.130
that there are some things
that we assume we understand

28
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.790
because we have been coding
in it for years. I,

29
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.120
I, in my job is
teaching JavaScript. I see developers

30
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.310
that have been at it
for a decade and they've

31
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.150
been successful at rolling out
what we would with air

32
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.230
quotes, say production, quality applications.
But when you push on

33
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.460
understanding of how those things
work, most of them stumble

34
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.090
through like, Oh, I kind
of understand closure, or I

35
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.450
think I know what prototypes
are. So they understand just

36
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.240
enough of the surface to
get things done, which is

37
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.060
the great part about JavaScript.
We can get a lot

38
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.660
done because it is a
very low barrier to entry,

39
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.930
but it's also it's negative
sign. It's the other edge

40
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.170
of the sword because a
lot of developers just stop

41
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.890
there and never go any
further. So the book series,

42
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.500
the trainings, everything I've done
over the last several years

43
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.680
has been dedicated to this
notion that we should take

44
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.640
those tools as seriously. Any
other tool that we'd use,

45
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.520
which means we should push
beyond that surface. We should

46
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.270
go into a deeper level
of understanding. And as I

47
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.600
went through that journey, I
realized that I was in

48
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.410
that boat that I didn't
know JavaScript. And it's, it's

49
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.020
one of those things like
the more, you know, the

50
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.660
more you realize you don't
know. And that was definitely

51
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.270
true for me. So that's
what rang out with the

52
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.850
tone and both, both the
tone and the title of

53
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.620
the series. Is this a
problem that's unique to JavaScript

54
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.110
because JavaScript has such a
low barrier to entry. I

55
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.480
mean, I don't remember people
thinking of doing this about

56
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.880
C I think I'm not
sure I would be prepared

57
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.060
to call it a unique
problem to JavaScript, but certainly

58
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.900
it is much more heavily
weighted in an observable of

59
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.170
the JavaScript community. It, it
surfaces itself and things. When

60
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.890
I ask a question of
a JavaScript audience, I will

61
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.530
ask a question like how
many of you have ever

62
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.650
opened up and read any
part of the JavaScript specification?

63
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.440
And I might in a
room of 30 people get

64
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.460
one, maybe two hands of
people that just don't really

65
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.670
take it that seriously. But
if you ask that same

66
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.220
question of a room full
of C plus plus developers

67
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.210
or Java developers, you'd get
most of the hands up

68
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.930
because developers in those communities
tend to take it more

69
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.490
seriously, understanding how something works,
not just that it works.

70
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.840
So I do think that
there's something interesting about how

71
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.800
approachable JavaScript is. I think
there's an expectation from the

72
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.450
industry that what's really what
we incentivize is rapid develop,

73
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.330
get something done as quickly
as possible. And there's so

74
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.230
many resources of code pens
and just, and other things

75
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.270
like that, that you can
just simply grab a snippet,

76
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.510
tweak it a little bit.
It works and your boss

77
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.270
is happy and you're going
to get raises because you

78
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.900
made your boss happy. So
why, what incentive is there

79
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.320
really to understand how that
thing worked? And I think,

80
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.260
again, I don't think that's
necessarily unique to JavaScript, but

81
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.010
it's certainly much more pronounced
in the JavaScript community. So

82
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.920
then it's not as much
the language or the design

83
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.990
of the languages. It's the
environment that we happen to

84
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.910
live in and the time
that we are in and

85
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.120
the code pens and the
ease of copy paste, the

86
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.180
stack overflow. Yeah, it's, it's
really, it's all of it

87
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.240
from, from, even back in
the early two thousands when

88
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.600
JavaScript was, it was present
in the browser, but it

89
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.320
wasn't really treated as a
serious language. And then we

90
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.780
started to see JavaScript frameworks
treated a little bit more

91
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.570
seriously. As soon as we
saw that, what we saw

92
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.200
was we added a layer
of abstraction where to get

93
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.480
something done in Java script,
you no longer needed to

94
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.590
understand the core mechanisms you
just needed to learn the

95
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.880
jQuery or the prototype or
the dojo or the Yui.

96
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.240
And that's what an entire
set of, you know, maybe

97
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.080
two generations worth of developers
really grew up learning was

98
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.220
learned that part and not
so much worry about the

99
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.810
JavaScript. You were always writing
JavaScript. jQuery is JavaScript, but

100
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.820
you didn't have to understand
what you were writing because

101
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.150
it did a lot for
you that simultaneously helped people

102
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.480
do a lot of very
good, quick coding, but it

103
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.140
also insulated them from needing
to learn. And when there's

104
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.440
no incentive, most developers don't
really circle back and push

105
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.760
themselves to learn deeper. You
know, you just said something

106
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.900
as a throwaway statement that
kind of hit me hard,

107
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.490
like, Oh, you're right. You
said jQuery is JavaScript. Like

108
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.180
what I feel like jQuery
is one of those things

109
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.130
where of course it's built
on JavaScript. And of course,

110
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.900
like, what does that dollar
sign thing mean? And why

111
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.480
are we hanging stuff off
of it? And, but it,

112
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.160
it, it is it's, it
feels like it's such a

113
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.330
complete layer of putty on
top of the language it's

114
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.230
as such, this is a
clear layer of abstraction that

115
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.020
is treated as its own
entity, its own thing. The

116
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.020
interesting thing about jQuery is
that it wasn't, at least

117
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.390
in my observation, obviously not
being part of the core

118
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.230
team, I can't super speak
to it. But from observation

119
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.850
from the outside, jQuery was
more about abstracting, the bad

120
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.720
parts that weren't actually JavaScript
anyway, the bad parts of

121
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.570
the Dom API, that, that
parts of the events, API,

122
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.030
the bad parts of the
Ajax API, those were the

123
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.970
things that were really difficult
to do. And we're really

124
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.650
different cross-browser because those parts
were never actually JavaScript itself.

125
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.400
They weren't part of the
JavaScript specification. So every browser

126
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.940
did them slightly differently and
jQuery was designed to fix

127
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.170
that problem. But in the
process of putting that layer

128
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.620
of putty, as you say
over those ugly parts, it

129
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.640
also created a layer of
abstraction where you, you almost,

130
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.150
you, for example, you use
a function past to a

131
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.490
jQuery method and you don't
even realize that that's a

132
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.460
function expression with its own
set of closure and that

133
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.920
it may be called multiple
times, and it may be

134
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.460
changing variables and its surrounding
scope. You just gloss over

135
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.150
those ideas entirely. When, if
I take that same developer

136
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.610
and take or out of
the picture, and we talk

137
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.090
about a function as a
callback with closure, when we

138
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.130
talk about those principles, they
seem to get it. But

139
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.080
when you put it back
in the context of jQuery,

140
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.080
it's magical to them. That
that's the same thing, but

141
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.740
it really is. It really
is just an application of

142
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.700
an understanding of JavaScript that
people that wrote jQuery really

143
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.790
do understand JavaScript and they
understand it so well that

144
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.360
they created a fantastic library.
I don't really call it

145
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.660
a framework, but a library
on top of JavaScript and

146
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.600
generations worth millions of developers
found JavaScript and front end

147
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.250
web development significantly more approachable
as a result of that

148
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.190
action. I'm a big fan
of those things. What I'm

149
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.950
not a big fan of
is almost the lazy approach

150
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.110
that says because you made
me a tool that makes

151
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.450
it so easy that lets
me off the hook and

152
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.670
I never need to circle
back and go deeper. One

153
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.410
of the analogies that I
use a lot when I'm

154
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.460
talking about like how modern
web development uses, how modern

155
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.060
web development works is that
of driving an automatic car

156
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.570
or a stick shift. And
how deep does your understanding

157
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.090
of the driving of the
car? The getting from point

158
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.630
a to point B go,
as it relates to how

159
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.470
an internal combustion engine works
or how a gearbox works

160
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.580
in, in my relationship, I
happened to be the one

161
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.500
that can drive a stick.
It could have been the

162
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.930
other way. It doesn't matter,
but my wife can't drive

163
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.910
a stick. Moreover, she doesn't
really understand the revving of

164
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.200
the engine and what the
automatic is doing as it

165
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.830
shifts gears and things like
that. She might argue that

166
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.230
she simply doesn't need to
do that because the automatic

167
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.880
transmission is such a perfected
thing that, yeah. Okay. I

168
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.880
mean what, it would do
nothing to enhance her life.

169
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.420
So apply that same thing
to jQuery and JavaScript. Why

170
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.410
should I learn how to
drive a manual stick? Fantastic

171
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.170
analogy. And I actually, I
use a similar one with

172
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.260
re with respect to cars,
but maybe in a simpler

173
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.470
approach. So you've probably heard
and I'm sure the audience

174
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.680
has heard this notion of,
I don't want to go

175
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.440
reinvent my own wheels. Somebody's
already made a really good

176
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.290
wheel, so I'm not going
to reinvent the thing. And

177
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.030
I completely agree you shouldn't
go around wasting time, reinventing

178
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.780
new things, except for the
fact that reinvention is a

179
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.220
really good quote unquote vehicle
for learning. So what I,

180
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.290
the way I put this
as I don't want you

181
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.690
to reinvent your own wheels,
but I do want you

182
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.360
to understand how the wheel
works before you bolt it

183
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.720
onto the car. Simply treating
everything as a black box

184
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.200
means that you don't actually
have mastery over that thing.

185
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.930
It is no more different
than magic. Arthur C. Clark is famous

186
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.750
for his, among other things,
his three laws, but his

187
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.580
third law, which is most
often quoted any sufficiently advanced

188
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.360
technology is indistinguishable from magic.
I like to repurpose that

189
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.010
slightly and say any sufficiently
unlearned technology is indistinguishable from

190
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.920
magic. If you treat it
as a black box and

191
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.860
some sort of voodoo magic
thing happens inside of the

192
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.710
black box, that's okay. But
you need to be aware

193
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.540
of the fact that you
don't have mastery over that

194
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.850
thing, no matter how good
you are at putting that

195
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.980
box in different places. If
you don't know how it

196
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.220
works, you don't have mastery.
So back to the car

197
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:27.410
metaphor, understanding how a combustion
engine works is not necessary

198
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.500
to drive a car correctly,
but it is necessary to

199
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.110
claim that you have a
mastery over the concept of

200
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.840
what a car is. And
I think that's the difference

201
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.020
between say, for example, and
I hope I'm not painting

202
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.390
with too broad a brush
here, but I think that

203
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.150
maybe some of the difference
between a developer and an

204
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.480
engineer, I like to say
that a developer seeks first

205
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.930
to solve a problem. And
then perhaps later understand the

206
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.280
problem better. Whereas an engineer
may those two and seek

207
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.670
first to understand the problem
and then perhaps solve it

208
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.150
later. So when we are
faced with the pressure, I've

209
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.040
got to get this feature
out. My boss just wants

210
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.680
it to work. We bolt
a wheel onto the car,

211
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.440
which is great because I
want everybody listening to have

212
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.200
great flourishing careers. I want
them to get great jobs.

213
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.450
I want you to keep
being successful in the industry,

214
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.270
but I hope that at
some point you sort of

215
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.570
circle back to how did
that wheel actually work? What,

216
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.690
what were the properties of
it that made it correct?

217
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.710
And in that process, you'll
learn deeper how wheels work

218
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.680
or you'll learn deeper how
a combustion engine works. So

219
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.260
you said that you, you
drive a stick and your

220
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.080
wife drives an automatic I'm
I'm in your wife's, but

221
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.440
I don't drive a stick.
But I do understand the

222
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.400
concept of shifting gears is
changing things inside of a

223
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.400
transmission and moving things around.
And I know, I know

224
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.950
that the automatic is doing
those things for me. So

225
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.400
I think I have an
understanding enough of this black

226
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.350
box that it isn't a
black box magic As with

227
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.900
all good analogies, we should
stretch it. Absolutely two things.

228
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.470
So this is perfect. But
one could argue though, that

229
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.080
is the intent of the
driver to get from point

230
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.300
a to point B or
is the intent of the

231
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.290
driver to create new and
more innovative cars. Yeah. And

232
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.240
I would argue that if
you're just trying to drive

233
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.310
from point a to point
B, there's no scenario where

234
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.290
you need to care about
wheels. You just need to

235
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.510
know it's an effective car,
has three wheels, it's got

236
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.370
five. It doesn't matter. It's
driving and I'm getting to

237
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.420
point B. Yeah. So again,
let's keep stretching that scenario

238
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.360
when something goes wrong with
your car and you have

239
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.720
absolutely no idea how the
car works. It's just simply

240
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.150
a black box. Then you
are at the mercy of

241
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.700
taking it to some other
person who is an expert

242
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.830
in saying, please just fix
it for me. Right. And,

243
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.090
and that's a problem. If
you call yourself an engineer,

244
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.060
if you have something that
you literally have no clue

245
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.250
what to do. I, I,
I tell my students all

246
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.770
the time, if you do
not know how a piece

247
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.250
of code works, then you
have no hope of understanding

248
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.480
why it broke or fixing
it. You'll never accidentally exceed

249
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.500
your own understanding of this
thing. So I think it's

250
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.950
really important for us as
engineers to take some responsibility,

251
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.130
to understand. So I don't
fix my own cars, but

252
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.350
I think I have an
understanding enough of them that

253
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.840
if there's a problem, I
know, Oh, that's a problem

254
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.090
with my brakes or, Oh,
that's a problem where my

255
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.720
transmission transmission is messed up.
It's not shifting correctly so

256
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.030
that I'm not completely at
the mercy of somebody else.

257
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.140
So in that stretched metaphor,
I am using the tools

258
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.590
available to me. I E
car mechanics shop, who I

259
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.110
know has the expertise to
do something that I don't

260
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.960
have expertise on, but I
still come to the table

261
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.630
with enough of an understanding
that I'm not completely lost.

262
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.890
And I think that's where
this cements in my mind

263
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.340
that this isn't fantastic fricking
metaphor as metaphors go. This

264
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.130
is solid because you know,
you roll into the mechanic

265
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.830
shop and you don't understand,
you know, even a cursory

266
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.190
understanding of how your car
you are at the mercy

267
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.600
then of that specialist, which
I think we've all found

268
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.900
ourselves in those situations and
building applications where we go,

269
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.000
we go, as far down
the call stack, as our

270
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.310
knowledge allows us to, we
hit that one limit where

271
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.230
it's like, all right, I'm
a, I have no idea

272
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.530
what's happening. I sure hope
that I trust my consultant,

273
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.000
that they won't lie to
me To circle back to

274
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.400
software, just to kind of
make this a little more

275
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.260
concrete for the listener. If
we observe something about the

276
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.140
history of programming, we know
that programming languages have been

277
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:28.000
organized into roughly into generations.
So the first generation software

278
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.660
was the machine language. The
second generation software was assembly.

279
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.770
Third generation was the C
programming and the variance of

280
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.560
C language, the fourth generation,
which is where a lot

281
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.650
of our listeners will be
playing in the fourth generation

282
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.830
of languages or higher level
programming languages of which JavaScript

283
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.620
is a great example. There
are others, of course, and

284
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.690
then even a fifth generation
on top of that, more

285
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.530
natural language, things like SQL
or things like that. So

286
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.950
if you're playing at the
fourth level, the fourth generation

287
00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.090
of programming languages, as many
people do, I think to

288
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:05.080
call yourself a true engineer
of that level, if that's

289
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.470
your chosen level, maybe you're
deeper in the stacker or

290
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.060
whatever, but if you choose
the fourth generation, I think

291
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.870
you need to understand all
of how the fourth generation

292
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.440
works. So if you use
an angular or an Ember

293
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.470
or backbone or whatever, you
should be able to open

294
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.390
up the source code of
every one of those frameworks

295
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.120
and know how every single
line works so that you

296
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.390
make proper decisions about it.
You should also have a

297
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.530
good working knowledge of the
generation below. So if you're

298
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.690
working at the fourth generation,
you should be a master

299
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.120
of the fourth generation and
a working knowledge of the

300
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.640
one below. And I think
that's what makes somebody a

301
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.150
solid engineer. So I don't
know all of the details

302
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.130
of how assembly works, but
I have a working knowledge

303
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.680
of that and have a
working knowledge of C so

304
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.860
that when I make a,
a, a language level decision

305
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.160
in JavaScript, I do have
some intuition about what it's

306
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.920
going to do about allocating
and allocating memory. Even though

307
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.750
I don't have to do
that in my own program.

308
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.000
That's what I think makes
a good engineer. That is

309
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.330
that's really good. I like
that a lot. There are

310
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.550
those multiple levels and you
have to ask yourself how

311
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.950
far down the call stack
or the layers of abstraction

312
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.440
that you want to go.
It's funny that you're, you're

313
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.990
giving me all this knowledge
and information, because I think

314
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.000
that we're very similar in
the way that we express

315
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.870
ourselves. I've used the Arthur C. Clark
metaphor before, except I've used

316
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:24.580
it to express a sufficient,
a sufficiently abstract layer of

317
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.020
abstraction is indistinguishable from magic.
And the, the, the example

318
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.540
that I gave once, and
I think the listeners are

319
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.210
probably sick of hearing. This
was that one time my

320
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.740
wife lost her wedding ring
down the drain and her

321
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.220
working knowledge of how the
plumbing works is starts at

322
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.880
the faucet and ends at
the drain. But my working

323
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.920
knowledge ends underneath it, the
little bendy thing, the trend,

324
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.240
and then it disappears into,
into a mist. So when

325
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.400
I pulled it out of
the bendy thing out of

326
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.040
the trap, she thought that
was a miracle. She thought

327
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.900
that was amazing because in
her mind it was at

328
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.440
the sewage treatment plant. It
was already there. Yeah. There

329
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.570
was nothing to me. That's
the kind of feeling that

330
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.640
you get when you have
a problem, you, you think

331
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.590
you're an engineer and then
you meet someone who does

332
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.600
have a working knowledge of
that layer, that one layer

333
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.690
of abstraction farther down. And
you're like, that's amazing whether

334
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.540
they opened like, you know,
wind DBG or some core

335
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.530
level debugger, or whether they're
looking at some hex code.

336
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.900
And it's like watching someone
watched the matrix and you're

337
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.210
like, how do you understand
what all those falling symbols

338
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:31.940
mean? Right? Those are a,
but it also, isn't something

339
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.860
that you, you can learn
those things like it may

340
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.470
seem scary now, but then
you learn that layer and

341
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.380
then it's not scary anymore.
That's exactly right. And I

342
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.470
really think that it pays
off in the long run

343
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.560
to have those deeper understandings
of stuff. It's not to

344
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.770
say that those abstraction layers
that are built within the

345
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.460
generations are bad. Abstractions are
not bad. They're very good

346
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.670
and very effective tools. What's
bad is when they're completely

347
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.310
painted and some opaque color.
And you never look under

348
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:02.750
the hood. Hey folks, I
wanted to take a moment

349
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.840
to tell you about Reagan
and their new product called

350
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.260
pulse. Reagan is an error
and crash reporting software provider

351
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.790
and their new product pulse
to realtime user monitoring product.

352
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.850
It gives you performance data
and user insights. Lets you

353
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.570
understand exactly what's happening when
users interact with your software.

354
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.810
So you're never left guessing.
Reagan provides you with the

355
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.620
answers to your performance questions
and they've found over 10 billion

356
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.920
that's billion with a B
bugs and customer apps with

357
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.310
their crash reporting product. And
now Reagan will help you

358
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.570
understand application quality. Like no
one else over 30,000 developers

359
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.210
worldwide, can't be wrong. I
use Reagan and all the

360
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.580

look under the hood and

364
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.210
at that, well let me,
let me say this. I'm

365
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.790
always blown away by the
amount of stuff there is

366
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.140
to learn though. And this
is where it gets a

367
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.330
little bit overwhelming. Cause we
are kind of sitting at

368
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.840
the top of the, of
the mountain here and underneath

369
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.790
the iceberg below is really
huge. There's a, a really

370
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.390
talented debugger at Microsoft and
her name is Tess Fernandez

371
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:25.790
and she does those kinds
of bugs that are so

372
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.250
obscure that they make their
way up. Like first level,

373
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.230
second level, third level of
support, right? She's at the

374
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.380
peak of, of the support.
She writes these blog posts

375
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:39.890
that are like, you know,
like CSI level of debugging,

376
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.110
you know like where they'll,
you know, a fingerprint leads

377
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.150
them all the way down
the rabbit hole. And it's

378
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.470
just like, Oh my God,
how'd you know that, aye,

379
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.250
it's completely overwhelming. How do
you choose what to know?

380
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.940
You said a good working
knowledge. When I read Tessa's

381
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.350
posts, I am left overwhelmed
with how much I don't

382
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.180
know about how things work.
Yeah. So I guess maybe

383
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.820
the difference between me and
somebody else that may be

384
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.030
listening would just be that
when I was fascinated by

385
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.360
somebody that, that knew something
that I didn't, instead of

386
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.450
just taking that at face
value, that presented me with

387
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.710
a question. So I followed
that question and maybe what

388
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.250
was different is that, that
answer to that question, asked

389
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.130
another question and instead of
stopping and taking that one

390
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.060
at face value, I just
kept asking more questions when

391
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.310
I was dealing with JavaScript.
And I decided to write

392
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.160
that book series, the, you
don't know, JS series. I

393
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.610
started with a basic set
of principles that I understood,

394
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.500
but I didn't know why
they worked that way. I

395
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.930
just knew how they worked
and I wanted to know

396
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.850
why they worked that way.
So I asked, how does,

397
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.830
why does this work that
way? What does this work

398
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.690
in that way? Why does
this statement do that? Why

399
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.120
does closure work? Why does
the object prototype chain work?

400
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.670
And each one of those
questions lead to another set

401
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.700
of questions and I just
didn't stop. And to, to

402
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.890
be honest to this day,
I haven't stopped. I keep

403
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.100
going down those trails and
asking more of those questions,

404
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.490
But devil's advocate a little
bit. And I hate that

405
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.490
term. And I don't like
being devil's advocate. Don't wouldn't

406
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.740
that indicate that you either
have a lot of time

407
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.930
on your hands or a
job that enables you to

408
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.970
have that level of curiosity.
I think that it might

409
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.620
be argued that there are
people who are under the

410
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.260
gun who don't have the
eight hours to put their

411
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.630
head down and learn how,
you know, object prototypes were.

412
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.470
Yeah. Unquestionably. And I've said
this publicly on many occasions,

413
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.820
unquestionably, I have an uncommon
level of privilege among my

414
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.580
peers that I've had the
opportunity over the last four

415
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.850
years to shift my career.
Prior to that, I spent

416
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.540
12 years as developer. So
I do get, and in

417
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.540
small and big companies consultancies,
all that stuff. I do

418
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.660
get the pressures of those
things. And I, I feel,

419
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.180
I like to believe that
I haven't lost track of

420
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:52.500
that. I do understand the
pressures that exist there. And

421
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.810
I have the privilege that
four years ago, I decided

422
00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.980
to go independent and teach
and teaching affords me that

423
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.940
privileged to benefit learning because
you can't teach. If you

424
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.710
don't learn and you can't
learn if you don't teach.

425
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.100
I think so. There's unquestionably
that level of privilege there.

426
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.230
But I would, I would
almost fall back on, on

427
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.620
kind of a, a silly
statement that I know has

428
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.380
been made many, many times
before me, but you might

429
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.600
say, well, what if I
don't have time to learn

430
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.540
this thing? And that's the
question on everybody's mind? What

431
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.290
if I don't really have
time to learn it? What

432
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.240
if you don't have time
not to learn it? I

433
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.000
mean, my, my approach here
is I'm trying to help

434
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.060
people learn, not just for
the sake of being an

435
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.960
academic, but because in the
deeper learning you become a

436
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.310
more effective engineer and it
takes you less time to

437
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:45.030
fix problems. When you understand
the code first and you

438
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.670
better more performance code the
first time when you have

439
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.920
the instincts based upon actual
understanding and not just based

440
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.870
upon well, I've stubbed my
toe and enough of these

441
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.240
places that I know, not
where to walk. You know,

442
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.760
I know where not to
walk. If you can turn

443
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.680
on the lights and understand
the layout of the room

444
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.320
and not just stuff, you
know, stumble around, you will

445
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.860
effectively do that path better.
So a path to being

446
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.810
a better engineer inevitably involves
being a path to being

447
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.600
a better learner and to
be a learner means to

448
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.760
also, you don't know something
until you can teach other

449
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.300
people. So teaching through whether
that's writing about things or

450
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.030
going to local meetups or
being a conference speaker or

451
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.660
being a book author, whatever
those things are, learn something

452
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.970
a little bit deeper. And
that doesn't, that doesn't mean

453
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.130
that learning should ever get
in the way of doing

454
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.900
your job. You've got to
get a paycheck. You got

455
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.340
to be a doer, but
take those extra moments wherever

456
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.930
you can find them and
say, I don't want to

457
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.020
leave that thing behind. I
want to circle back and

458
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.710
figure it out more deeply.
And that is a, that

459
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.410
is a conscious decision that
I am hearing you encourage

460
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.260
people to make. Not only
is not only a conscious

461
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.170
decision, but a challenge that
I put to everyone to

462
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.980
say, doesn't, doesn't, isn't that
what distinguishes us? Isn't that?

463
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.590
What will keep you fresher
in the industry? If you

464
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:06.520
have that uncommon level of
asking why and taking and

465
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.920
making the sacrifice to go
and learn something a little

466
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.200
bit more deeply than you
understood, you may not have

467
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.450
to go write an entire
book about it, but you

468
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.310
should go and learn it
more deeply than what you

469
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.460
understood the first time you
did it. So let's, let's

470
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.820
challenge ourselves a little bit
in this discussion to understand

471
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.520
that people who are listening
might be hearing words like

472
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:30.370
sacrifice, challenge yourself. And they
may be thinking that Kyle

473
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.800
is asking them to stay
up late and spend less

474
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.590
time with their kids. And
that they're, they're not really

475
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.290
an engineer. If they really
like to go hiking at

476
00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.110
five o'clock and at five
Oh one, they like to

477
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.250
punch out are I think
that maybe a one solution

478
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.800
would be to force your
bosses to give you some

479
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.610
training time. Like I used
to take Friday afternoons from

480
00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.930
noon to five and just
read and study. And if

481
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.840
my boss challenged me, I
challenged them back and I

482
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.970
said, listen, I need to
do this. And then you

483
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.710
get into those kinds of
discussions with your boss. Like,

484
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.390
well, it's on your own
time for training. It's like,

485
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.890
well, you want me to
be effective? And then you,

486
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.440
not, everyone has that luxury.
How do we enable people

487
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.960
to do that? I think
that's an absolutely fantastic point.

488
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.270
And I'm glad you redirected
because I don't want anything

489
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.780
that I'm saying to be
construed as I'm trying to

490
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.900
take you away from your
families. I have a family,

491
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.690
have a wife and kids,
and my family is incredibly

492
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.000
important to me. And, and
the work that I do

493
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.530
has me on the road
a lot. I'm away from

494
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.680
them when I'm home, I'm
very dedicated to my family.

495
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.250
So I completely agree and
sympathize with people that want

496
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.360
to do that. And even
if you don't have a

497
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.250
family, if it's just that
you like to mountain bike,

498
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.190
that's great. I want people
to, to have those lives.

499
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.470
So I should explain some
context newly in the, of

500
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.320
head of curriculum with maker
square, which is an engineer

501
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.740
training school. Our job is
to take people that understand

502
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.990
some programming and make them
super highly effective engineers that

503
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.110
get jobs. And so we
work very closely with developers,

504
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.320
not just to teach them
the raw skills of JavaScript

505
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.990
programming, but we work with
them to understand what it

506
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.230
means to be an effective
employee in the workplace. And

507
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.690
the challenges that I give
are the people that graduate

508
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.390
from our school are things
like when you get that

509
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.970
job two or three weeks
in after you've kind of

510
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.770
learned the lay of the
land, you should go to

511
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.900
your boss and say, would
you let me do a

512
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.140
Brown bag lunch once a
month or once a quarter

513
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.590
with my fellow coworkers? And
I'll take something, I'll take

514
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:30.330
the initiative to learn something
on company time that relates

515
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.370
to the work that we're
doing as a team, I'll

516
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.890
learn it more deeply. And
then I will present what

517
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.780
I've learned to the rest
of my team members. That's

518
00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.440
an in context job, you're
going with the flow of

519
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.280
your job. And you're doing
exactly what you said. Scott,

520
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.920
taking time, not away from
mountain biking or from your

521
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.130
family, but taking the time
at your job and using

522
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.940
it, I think in, in
ways more effectively, because somebody

523
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.150
needs to do that. Somebody
needs to challenge everybody to

524
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.090
be better at learning and
using, even if it's like

525
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.410
the code review process, which
if you're listening, I think

526
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.780
you should have a culture
of code review at your

527
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.420
company. I'm very firmly in
that, in that boat. I

528
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.390
think code review is really
important. The code review, again,

529
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.970
is another tool for learning.
You set the bar high

530
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.640
for what coach should be,
and when someone more junior

531
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.040
to you submit some code
and a code review, and

532
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.960
maybe they make some mistakes
or they use something in

533
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.860
a slightly more naive way.
Instead of just pushing that

534
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.130
back and say, rejecting a
code review, it's an opportunity

535
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.100
to teach so that everybody
is learning. You can do

536
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.620
that within the flow of
your job without ever having

537
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.460
to give up those free
moments. Did I sacrifice time

538
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.650
away from my family? I
absolutely did, but I'm not

539
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.230
saying that you have to
do that to be engineer.

540
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.550
I'm simply saying you should
have the courage to take

541
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.150
this challenge to say, how
can I learn more effectively

542
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.410
through the job that I
already have? Yeah. I think

543
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.680
it is a challenge to
have that courage, especially with

544
00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.570
one isn't a new job,
or if one is a,

545
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.210
you know, a junior person
to build themselves up to

546
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.840
have that, that audacity or
that privilege to say, you

547
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.780
know, Hey boss, you need
to let me do this,

548
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.930
But, but in the, in
the same vein while that

549
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:16.250
does take courage, it's also,
it's also kind of a

550
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.010
measuring stick for the position
and the job and the

551
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:22.730
team that you're on because
I believe that a really

552
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.400
good company and a really
good boss to work for

553
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.490
would fall out of their
chair. Excited if they had

554
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.180
an employee that said, I
want to be uncommonly good

555
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.460
at this, I want to
learn more deeply. And I

556
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.160
want to help everybody around
me understand things more deeply

557
00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.400
so that we're more effective.
That's lower total cost of

558
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.030
ownership for our software when
we write things the right

559
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.000
way, the first time. And
if your boss didn't get

560
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.880
excited about that, if they
said, nah, it doesn't really

561
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.670
matter to us. That's a
measuring stick by which you

562
00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.680
can gauge. Are, am I
going to be effective here?

563
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.380
Is there another team? Is
there another way that I

564
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.290
can be more effective somewhere
else? I think that's what

565
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.520
will make better industry. I
think we can change industry

566
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.680
from the inside out by
getting more and more people

567
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.130
hooked on using our jobs
and our job functions as

568
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.750
a vehicle for learning. Very
cool. Very cool. And as

569
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.260
we end, help me understand
the scope of these books

570
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.680
are these full-sized books. They
seem like, like what I

571
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.970
buy a 300 page book
on scope and closures or

572
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:24.840
these booklets. Give me a
sense of the, what I'm

573
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.550
biting off when I decide
to buy one of these

574
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.560
books on you don't know
Jay. Yes. Yeah. That's a

575
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.620
fantastic question. So the book
series, there are six total

576
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.560
books in this series. The
very first book is called

577
00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.350
up and going and that's
designed for somebody who's never

578
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:41.340
done any programming before to
literally get up and going

579
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.610
and within the context of
what JavaScript does. So I

580
00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:49.410
talk about functions and comments
and variables and values. The

581
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.080
book series then launches into
the main meat with scope

582
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.800
and closures and this an
object prototypes and types and

583
00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.540
grammar and coercion. Those books,
each individual book is ranges

584
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.650
between 102 hundred pages in
length. So they're, they're shorter

585
00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.320
than your average tech book
at three or 400 pages

586
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:11.670
each in total six books,
there's 1100 pages. So there's

587
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.820
plenty of information there, but
they're in smaller bite sized

588
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.660
chunks. And the goal for
that was I always, whenever

589
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.380
I was learning development, years
back, I would always go

590
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.570
to a bookstore and buy
a book that was like

591
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.960
1200 pages because there was
one or two chapters in

592
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.210
that book, one or two
topics that I really wanted.

593
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.250
So I buy the whole
book just for that one

594
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.460
piece. I didn't want anybody
to be facing that challenge

595
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.860
with my set of books.
If the thing you really

596
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.040
want to understand now is
scope and closure. You should

597
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.160
be able to buy that
100 page book and just,

598
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.890
and have just that to
digest. And many people say

599
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.450
that they can get through
one of these books in

600
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.740
this series in an extended
weekend, you know, worth of

601
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.980
time. So the books are
divided that way on purpose.

602
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.160
They're very focused on just
that one topic taken in

603
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:04.980
whole. I think they represent
a complete dissertation if you

604
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.570
will, if I can be
so bold as to call

605
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.960
it that on what Java
script, the core languages and

606
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.690
the appropriate ways to apply
it. So the sixth and

607
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.480
final book in the series
is on the new stuff

608
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.780
that just landed with ESX,
as well as peering beyond

609
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.990
telling a narrative about where
JavaScript is headed in its

610
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.570
evolution in the future. So
you start from the very

611
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.180
beginning and by the end,
I think you really do

612
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.080
have that solid foundation about
what Java script is. And

613
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.810
you know, then the things
you don't know and the

614
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:37.080
things you need to learn
better, Very, very cool. And

615
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.760
I will make sure to
put links to this stuff

616
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.570
in the notes and people
can read these books online

617
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.540
for free, but certainly I'll
have links where you can

618
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.460
go and buy those books.
And it's also worth pointing

619
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.090
out that the up and
going book, the ebook format

620
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.920
is free, which I think
is a very nice thing

621
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.990
for you to have done
for beginners support. We can

622
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.600
go and get that right
away. Yeah, that's true. The

623
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.480
entire book series is actually
available for free on the

624
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.380
GitHub repo. You don't know
js.com redirects to the GitHub

625
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.720
repo where all the books
were written for free. So

626
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.420
you can read the entire
1100 page series for free.

627
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.870
They were also professionally edited
and published through a Riley.

628
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.680
And as Scott said, as
you said, Scott, the first

629
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.450
book of the series, the
up and going one, because

630
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.280
that's the one where I
want to be able to

631
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.320
get more people in. It's
the bridge to getting you

632
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.490
into JavaScript. The ebook form
itself, the edited ebook form

633
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.850
published form is free. And
the print version is I

634
00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.670
think four 99. So I
specifically said, I don't want

635
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:32.590
any royalties from this, make
it as cheap as you

636
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.110
can at costs so that
as many people can have

637
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.170
access to that book as
possible. Very, very cool. Well,

638
00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.910
it's been just a joy
chatting with you today. I

639
00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.580
really appreciate your time. Thanks.
It's a super huge honor.

640
00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.440
I have listened to the
