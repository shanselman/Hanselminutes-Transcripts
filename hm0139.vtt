behind Moonlight. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman and this is

11
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.990
another episode of Hansel minutes
this week. We're talking to

12
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.230
Joseph Hill and Miguel de Caza
from Novell from the mano

13
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.450
project. Thanks guys for taking
the time to talk to

14
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.670
me today. Thanks. Thanks for
having us. How am I

15
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.950
go? You're on vacation. So
you're calling in from Mexico,

16
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.340
right? Yes. That is correct.
Are you like in a,

17
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.280
in a you're in your
hotel or? No, I'm staying

18
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.470
at the, at a friend's
at a friend's place. So,

19
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.330
you know, it's nice to
have friends that can cost

20
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.640
you when it comes here.
Yeah, that's great. Well, thanks.

21
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.920
I didn't realize that you
were on vacation. I appreciate

22
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.080
you taking time out of
your, out of your day.

23
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.820
So we've got some Moonlight
announcements here. Yes, that's right.

24
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.090
We're finally, you know, we've
been working one light for

25
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.820
a little bit more than
a year now in the,

26
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.420
in the first version of,
of Moonlight. And as you

27
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.670
probably know, it's, it's, it's,
it's an implementation. Silverlight 1.0

28
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.420
right now. And we're about
to, we're about to launch

29
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.840
it. Initially we started this
project because we're really excited,

30
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.530
not by <inaudible>, but by
Silverlake one, one, which was

31
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.880
announced in mixing Oh seven,
I think. And so we

32
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.790
got really interested about the
Silverlight one, one, but as

33
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.670
it turns out in a
lot of the technology that

34
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.760
you need, it was, you
know, the foundation of existence

35
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.830
of a low 1.0. So
we've been working towards that

36
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.900
goal first sheet, that version.
And, and what was interesting

37
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.300
is that when we started,
when we started the project,

38
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.190
when we started the project,
we showed this to a

39
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.430
few guys with Microsoft and,
and we thought that it

40
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.650
would be interesting. We thought
that it would be interesting

41
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.400
for Linux world that to
have an open source implementation

42
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.310
of silver lights, something that
would fit more naturally with,

43
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.450
with what the community does
there. So, so Microsoft actually

44
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.470
offered, offered of help. And
so they gave us access

45
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.970
to their test suites for
silver lights, 1.0 and now

46
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.260
for 2.0, and they also
gave us, you know, one

47
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.750
of the, kind of, one
of the more, most complicated

48
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.100
problems with silver, like really
was the, the media pipeline,

49
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.850
you know, the media codex,
because you know, many companies

50
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.120
own, you know, many companies
own patents and they actively

51
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.010
licensed those media patterns for,
you know, MP3 of VC

52
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.600
one and WMC and all
of that stuff. So for

53
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.260
us to have a successful
implementation of Silverlight for Linux,

54
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.720
one of the kind of
sticky points was how do

55
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.910
we get, how do we
get the media to Linux

56
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.450
users in a fully legit
way? So you're now fully

57
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.350
licensed version of the codex.
So Microsoft actually stepped up

58
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.310
and, and, and they are
actually providing the codex is

59
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.910
not novel that provides a
codex. That is the one

60
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.930
piece that, that is the
one kind of a piece

61
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.840
that is not open source,
the actual video codecs and

62
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.700
audio codecs. So the way
it's gonna work is when

63
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.940
you, when you install server,
let them, your system through,

64
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.350
you know, through, through a
plugin for Firefox, the first

65
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.330
time that you, that you
tried to play any media,

66
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.050
any MP3s or any videos,
it will, it will ask

67
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.910
you whether you want to
download the codex from Microsoft.

68
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.060
I will go and fetch
the codex from Microsoft, and

69
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.610
he still goes on your
system. And, and then that

70
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.250
way we ensure that every
year that every user of

71
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.510
Silverlight and Linux will have
a fully licensed media stack

72
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.430
in addition to the Moonlight
engine then. So, you know,

73
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.530
so it's, it's been quite
interesting working on this because,

74
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.120
you know, I, we started
just with the, with the

75
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.170
sample codes and when Microsoft
came in and gave the

76
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.890
test suites, we finally have
something, you know, very comprehensive

77
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.490
to aim for. And, you
know, we've worked for the

78
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.270
past nine months and making
sure that, that our Silverlight

79
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.710
one point, is there a
path every one of the

80
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.190
Microsoft test suites, the only
thing that is the only

81
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.430
test that we can have
not run perfectly are the

82
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.160
ones that are related to
fonts, because the default set

83
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.110
of funds that come with
Linux are different than the

84
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.450
defaults that are fonts that
you can have windows. But

85
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.150
other than that, we're, you
know, we're fully compatible at

86
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.900
this point. I fully compatible
as you can, you know,

87
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.050
as you can, as you
can, as you can do

88
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.030
it with, with, with functional
tests, That's pretty slick. Now,

89
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.310
why, why do you prompt
them? Why do you have

90
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.560
to pull the codex down
later? I'm curious. Well, because,

91
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.710
so, so it has to
do with the way that

92
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.530
these products are licensed. Microsoft
is already a license or

93
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.430
an already, you know, well,
I guess, I guess we

94
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.380
could download it immediately, as
soon as you installed one

95
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.810
day as your question, I
guess we could do that.

96
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.550
Well, I guess, I mean,
I don't quite understand software

97
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.040
licensing and that complicated, but
I suppose that if there

98
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.020
are, if there a set
of people who are using

99
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.080
it, but are not using
it for media, then I

100
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.150
guess someone doesn't have to
pay someone. Yeah. Well, so

101
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.010
yeah, it's a little bit
more complicated than that, about

102
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.520
who pays for room, but
because right now it's Microsoft

103
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.290
that, you know, is this
shooting the codex. So it

104
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.360
goes into whatever Microsoft agreement
has with, with, with the

105
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.340
media owners. I mean, codec
owners, but I don't, I

106
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.800
don't actually know the details
of that, but you're right.

107
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.690
We could, we could make
it so that the first

108
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.730
time he installed one night,
as soon as he fell

109
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.900
one night, he also gets
the codex and, and you

110
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.000
know, right now it's right
now, it's either Dawn the

111
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
first time you do it,
or when you explicitly request

112
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.630
to get the codex. So
I, I've got a couple

113
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.750
of <inaudible> machines around here,
but I'm not deeply familiar

114
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.040
with, with Linux as a
user. What is the experience

115
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.210
like? I mean, it's just
something that you have to

116
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.890
do. You have to jump
out to the command line

117
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.020
and SU this and that
and pseudo this in that

118
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.300
to get this installed or
Not at all. We actually,

119
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.270
we're actually very proud of,
of, of the solution we

120
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.910
came up. We came up
with, it's very similar to

121
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.840
the windows experience right now.
You know, we're recording this

122
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.930
and truly before we go
live. So the right now

123
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.210
you can see the experience,
but you will end up

124
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.310
on the backs of several
lights sites. It will detect

125
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.980
your browser based on your,
you know, when you get

126
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.440
these little lights that says,
you know, you're missing, Silverlight

127
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.370
click here to install. You
will click there. And when

128
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.050
you get to the Microsoft's
website, it will detect that

129
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.630
you're running a Linux system.
So it will forward you,

130
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.990
depending on the architecture that
you're using, it will send

131
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.600
those, it will send you
the directly to one of

132
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.330
our servers. And then a
little pop up, comes up

133
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.440
and just ask you the,
just ask you to install

134
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.450
it, that the, you agreed
to install this piece of

135
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.610
software that has been signed
by novella, then you say,

136
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.000
okay, and then that's it,
it downloads it. The only

137
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.760
difference that we, the only
difference with the, with the

138
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.600
Silverlight experiences, that we are
not able to, to restart

139
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.770
the browser ourselves. So we
need to, you know, it,

140
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.860
it will tell you the
plugging will lack the activist,

141
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.940
and as you restart the
browser, So how many architectures

142
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.390
and how many browsers we
use support? So at the

143
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.120
lunchtime, we're going to support
the exit is six and

144
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.850
actually six 64. And I
think, you know, if it

145
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.340
wasn't for, well, I think
it's gonna be really good

146
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.000
because, you know, we're coming
out with both, both of

147
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.740
the major architecture support is
from the get go, and

148
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.050
we're going to support Firefox
two and Firefox three, we

149
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.850
do have experimental bindings, but
they're not completed. We have

150
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.630
to complete them in the
future opera bindings. And WebKit

151
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.950
bindings in particular. WebKit because
it's becoming very popular on

152
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.410
Linux. So we will have
a support for the other

153
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.870
browsers, but right now there
is no major really, there's

154
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.160
no product, a productized version
of WebKit right now available

155
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.260
to the public. So, you
know, as soon as that

156
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.710
happens, we'll have a web
version as well, or multiple

157
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.050
web conversions. So we design
it kind of with a

158
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.200
little bridge that, you know,
the plugin is the shared

159
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.600
infrastructure is, is all the
same plugins. And then we

160
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.500
have little, little modules that
are different across browsers. The

161
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.680
plugin architecture on Linux is
pretty much same as is

162
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.510
it DP, API, or an
API rather We use the

163
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.030
MPA API for Mozilla. So
here's the thing. The problem

164
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.990
is that not every browser
uses the same API. So

165
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.630
the F the foundation level
for the most basic things,

166
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.340
everybody uses MP the Mozilla
and pea API. But the

167
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.950
problem is that Silverlight actually
takes advantage of a lot

168
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.670
more features in the browser.
Then the basic plugin API

169
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.530
provides, for example, Silverlight applications
are able to communicate with

170
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.990
the Dom, right? So you
can manipulate the Dom from

171
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.140
Silverlight right. Then make changes
to the Dahmer extract data

172
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.510
from the Dom. And it
gives it a very seamless

173
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.350
experience between the Dom and
the silver light application. So

174
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.500
you can, you know, the
distinction between what is Silverlight

175
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.040
and what is the browser
is, is blurred. But the

176
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.610
chief that the, you know,
you need to speak browser

177
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.400
specific KPIs in each one
of those. So in the

178
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.350
case of Mozilla, we speak,
we speak through these APA,

179
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.540
they call XP com. So
we have to speak with

180
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.240
Mozilla, with X speak, Tom,
but that obviously doesn't exist

181
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.460
in WebKit and doesn't exist
in Oprah. So we need

182
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.830
to use in the opera
case, the upright PIs that

183
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.140
would give them the same
integration and the same thing

184
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.470
goes for WebKit. Does this
get pretty complicated or do

185
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.560
you have a nice provider,
a abstraction to make that

186
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.290
not so hard? Yes, yes.
Yes. It's very nice. So,

187
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.100
you know, we're, I mean,
kind of we're looking forward

188
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.860
for the web kids wants
to come out and also

189
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.250
Microsoft has agreed. I mean,
you guys have agreed to

190
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.210
also publish a codex for
other architectures. So for example,

191
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.600
Linux and power PC and,
and, you know, Linux on

192
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.820
spark computer. So we can
distribute Moonlight and Monday, not

193
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.680
only for Linux machines, but
we also want to get

194
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.510
it on freebie as the
computers, when to get it

195
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.990
in Solara racing up in
Solera. So we kind of

196
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.080
went to see, we kind
of went to see Monday,

197
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.780
go into all of those
platforms that are not, you

198
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.690
know, that are not supported
directly by, you know, all

199
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.660
those unique says that are
not the most popular ones.

200
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.390
And it's relatively easy for
us to do that. We're

201
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.300
already getting some contributions from
the community to do that.

202
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.000
So, so, you know, we'll
be very happy to fill

203
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.820
in the void of all
those other platforms Now, from

204
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.560
the, from the point let's,
let's let me play devil's

205
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.440
advocate for a second, from
the point of view of

206
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.390
a Microsoft user, not, not
an employee, but just I'm

207
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.690
a guy who use windows.
Windows has like 90% share

208
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.590
and a Mac has, you
know, 9.9, 9% share, and,

209
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.350
and then Linux has everybody
else. And then when you

210
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.030
start talking about subgroups within
Linux, you know, Solaris, and,

211
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.160
you know, you must be
talking about fractions of a

212
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.190
percent of as far as
when you put it in

213
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.290
the entire bucket of all
the different computers out there

214
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.050
that are windows, is that
a lot of work to

215
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.190
support some of these more
obscure and hopefully obscure is

216
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.870
not an offensive word, but
these more obscure platforms? Well,

217
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.050
I think it's a really
good point. The, I think

218
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.770
that at the end of
the day, the shared idea

219
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.660
that we have with the
Microsoft guys right now is

220
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.200
we really like Silverlight as
a developer platform and we

221
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.580
want to make it available
everywhere. So, you know, we

222
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.140
don't want it to come
down to, I mean, if

223
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.540
the developer has to, at
some point it has to

224
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.460
come down as to, you
know, it has to run

225
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.680
on for lotteries. We wouldn't
want the fact that it's

226
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.740
not there to stop it.
Now, of course, I dispute

227
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.410
the claim that we're so
small to Linux fashion. I

228
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.590
think we're drawing and striving,
maybe another growing and striving

229
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.450
at like other ones, but,
you know, I think we're

230
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.620
growing, but so, but when
it comes to the actual

231
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:31.270
differences between Solaris and BSB
and Linux, they are, you

232
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.630
know, the DNAs almost exactly
the same. It's you, you

233
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.190
should probably think of it
in terms of what is

234
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.700
the difference between making a
freedom, working windows 2000 and,

235
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.670
and windows Vista, right? So
there's certain things that you

236
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.230
probably want to make a
little bit different if you

237
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.230
want to take advantage of
Vista and fall back gracefully

238
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.450
when you're running a windows
2000. So you think of

239
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.330
it the same way, because
the graphic system is the

240
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:59.290
same. It's always X, 11,
X, 11, the, you know,

241
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.100
the Unix facilities, the operating
system facilities are almost identical.

242
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.520
There's probably, you know, four
or five, if that's in

243
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.980
the source code that deal
with differences between those two.

244
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.030
And the third piece is
the kind of the hardest

245
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.880
part deport. And that's really
among like 2.0 issue. More

246
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.330
than that one, like 1.0
issue is porting the darkness,

247
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.290
the darkness, you know, the
core CLR to these operating

248
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.340
systems and those operating systems.
We already support. And I

249
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.220
agree they're probably not the
biggest or the largest operating

250
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.340
systems, but I think that
having, being able to say,

251
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.220
we're going to run on
all of those Unisys, regardless

252
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.590
of which one you have.
I think it's a really

253
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.200
useful, and kind of the,
the part that happens to

254
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.090
you is that we didn't
really have to do all

255
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.970
of the work ourselves. What
is really interesting about the

256
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.360
nature of open source here
is if someone really, really,

257
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.230
really needs it ancillaries or,
you know, specific variants of,

258
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.890
of BSB, you know, they
can always, they can always

259
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.450
do the work and we'll
be, you know, we'll be

260
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.790
happy to be Frank how
to build for them or,

261
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.730
and, and get the codecs
over to Microsoft so that

262
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.720
they can distribute those. Yeah.
It's pretty cool that you're

263
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.220
saying that they're gonna be
able to go up to

264
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.850
server lite.net and they're going
to get detected and be

265
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.240
a first class citizen like
everybody else. Have you found

266
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.320
anybody at Microsoft to be,
for lack of a better

267
00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.870
word, evil? No. Well, you
know, the contract that I

268
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.420
have with Microsoft with the
Microsoft guys has been through

269
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.380
mono and through and through
silver light. And I think

270
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.420
that everybody that I've interacted
with at Microsoft, with everybody

271
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.520
I've interacted at everybody, I
talked to Mike about Moonlight

272
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.890
or silver light. They've been
always been great. And I

273
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.920
think that they share the
same passion that we do

274
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.620
for 'em for the technology.
You know, I absolutely love

275
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.260
working with, with all of
them. I think that, you

276
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.140
know, when people would talk
about evil, I mean, you

277
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.150
know, I don't think we're
playing Dungeons and dragons. And

278
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.660
I think that that's completely
blurs in the actual rational

279
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.440
discourse. Know it's not a
black and white world. There's

280
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.020
all of these, you know,
it's a, it's a gamma,

281
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.120
you know, it's a complete
spectrum. So yeah. You know,

282
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.130
I have never had a
problem with this. You know,

283
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.920
I happen to like Linux.
I happen to believe that,

284
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.050
you know, I want to
run an open source operating

285
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.410
system, but, but then if
somebody wants to run, windows

286
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.820
wants to run a Mac
or wants to run for

287
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.460
Larry's, you know, more power
to them. So, you know,

288
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.400
I kind of, don't like
to take that position, you

289
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.510
know, Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman with a word from

290
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.180
our sponsor. Do you know
how to build web 2.0

291
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.960
Ajax applications with web 1.0
components? You really can't. If

292
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.360
you want to do the
next generation web applications you'll

293
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.910
need next generation components. Just
like the ones that our

294
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.880
friends at Telerik have got
their rad controls for ESPN

295
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.700
at Ajax. It's a huge
pack of web controls built

296
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.260
on top of asp.net Ajax.
That'll add previously impossible performance

297
00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.040
interactivity to your next project.
The new controls mirror, the

298
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.480
Ajax API from asp.net. So
development is really straightforward. The

299
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.700
client scripts are shared. So
loading time is not a

300
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.130
problem. If you just set
a couple of properties and

301
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.360
you'll be able to automatically
bind a web services for

302
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.230
a really efficient operation, the
new rad editor from ESPN

303
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.820
Ajax, Telerik loads up to
four times faster than before.

304
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.460
And the new rad grid
handles thousands of records and

305
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.340
just milliseconds, but as always,
it's best to try for

306
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.300
yourself. So you can visit
<inaudible> dot com slash ASP,

307
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:33.010
net Ajax, and download a
trial. Thanks a lot. Yeah,

308
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.260
it's interesting. A lot of
people, they feel very strongly

309
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.030
about one, you know, Microsoft
one way or the other.

310
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.340
And I've always said, one
of the reasons that I

311
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.400
came to work for Microsoft
a year ago was that

312
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.670
things are changing and that
the attitude towards open source

313
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.940
is, is dramatically changing it.
And I, I've always said

314
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.090
that the next couple of
years, we're going to see

315
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.460
big changes at Microsoft. We've
already seen them with, with

316
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.770
MVC. And I, I could
only imagine that those things

317
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.140
are going to get it
going to get even bigger.

318
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.710
I think that the interactions
that Microsoft has with, with

319
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.350
the Moonlight team and the
mano team is maybe not

320
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.440
as, as public and as
visible as some of the

321
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.600
other open source stuff we
do. And I don't know.

322
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.990
I wonder there was some
way to explain to people

323
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.320
how, how those interactions work.
I mean, do you just

324
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.750
call up a dev whenever
you need something and how

325
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.910
do they make sure that
they don't accidentally, you know,

326
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.030
taint you? They're always concerned.
We're always concerned about mano

327
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.220
people seeing something they're not
supposed to see, and then,

328
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.260
you know, you have to
be killed. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

329
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.640
I've worked now. So the
so kind of, it's been

330
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.300
a really organic relationship. It
kind of began, it kind

331
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.440
of began with, with Oz,
getting involved with eczema at

332
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.730
the time Microsoft was pushing
C-sharp and the.net VM through

333
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.770
the eczema standards process. And
she's what, we're a tiny

334
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.320
little startup. We actually were
invited by IBM as guests

335
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.530
to the meetings. And, you
know, you get this, you

336
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.200
started meeting people and you
start, you know, they become,

337
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.170
you know, you, you keep
a couple of email addresses

338
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.820
and whenever you have a
question, you drop them an

339
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.160
email. And so you'd be
gone kind of under a

340
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.840
very organic thing, just like
when you go to a

341
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.510
conference and you meet people,
it was the exact same

342
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.870
thing, just popping up and,
and, and talking to folks.

343
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.440
And, you know, over time
when we, when we decided

344
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.980
to work with Microsoft together
on this, you know, I

345
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.320
got a, I got a
bunch of more email addresses.

346
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.110
So Brian golf arcs, I
always, you know, I always,

347
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.700
I drop an email to
Brian and say, Hey, Brian,

348
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.130
we need help with this.
And he, he usually just

349
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.630
points us in the right
direction. So it's all you

350
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.820
need to talk to this
person, that person, and, you

351
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.580
know, it's, it's very organic.
I mean, it feels very,

352
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.860
I mean, at least our
collaboration with Microsoft feels very

353
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.000
open sourcey in that it's
the exact same process that

354
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.890
we follow with anyone else
in the community. Right. There's

355
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.020
really no different from our
standpoint. I think it's an

356
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.990
incredibly open source that way.
And, and it goes back

357
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.070
to what you're saying. I
think that not only, I

358
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.790
think that not only Microsoft
is changing, but you know,

359
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.280
the whole industry is, you
know, 10 years ago there

360
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.890
was none of this, right.
So everybody has to adapt

361
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.220
and change to, you know,
the internet being ubiquitous sounds,

362
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.310
being ubiquitous, you know, all
of these things. I think

363
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.880
that Microsoft is doing great,
that, you know, keeping up

364
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.160
with all of this stuff
that is happening. Yeah. Yeah.

365
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.990
I don't know how the
listeners would thought that this

366
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.810
interaction was going to be,
but I guess I somehow

367
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.480
imagined that you guys would
come to a table and

368
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.910
there'd be some, put some
tape on the table. And

369
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.260
the open source people would
stay on that side of

370
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.910
the table. It would be
very formal and there'd be

371
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.890
all sorts of lawyers and
people worrying about stuff. So

372
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.990
there are some, you know,
they gave us specifications and

373
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.810
they said, we have very
clear agreement. They gave us

374
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.080
specs and, and this is
a certification that must be

375
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.480
implemented. And the rest we
really do on our own,

376
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.090
the only piece that we
kind of been exposed to,

377
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.760
which is proprietary code is
a codex because we had

378
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.620
to do some work on
that. Other than that, you

379
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.160
know, I think we've maintained
a very clear separation between

380
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.300
Microsoft ideas and technology and
the way we implement ours.

381
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.030
So, so let me ask
you this, and this might

382
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.160
be a question for Joseph
who's been pretty quiet so

383
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.670
far is what is it?
What's in it for you

384
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.010
guys? I mean, why is
Novell going to so much

385
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.700
effort to make mano a
mano? I mean, where's the

386
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.850
money come from? Well, I
mean, I think, you know,

387
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.970
first and foremost, it's, I
mean, it's really about enriching

388
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.720
the desktop story for a,
I mean, we have, you

389
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.800
know, we have a desktop
Linux, you know, we're out

390
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.640
there promoting, and I'm not
having, you know, not having

391
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.160
access to Silverlight content on
our desktop is not a

392
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.620
very appealing proposition. So, I
mean, just from, just from

393
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.800
that standpoint, it's a, it's
a pretty compelling case to

394
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.200
say, Hey, we know we
can be the people that

395
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.980
are gonna, you know, that
are going to enable, you

396
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.810
know, not only for our
desktop, but, you know, for

397
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:55.240
all Linux desktop, you know,
beyond that, you know, it's,

398
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.950
well, I mean, that's, that's
pretty much the Nobel story,

399
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.020
but beyond that, I mean,
it's, it's very, it's very

400
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:04.120
interesting, you know, technically, and,
you know, as far as

401
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.430
the avenues that it opens
up for us for, you

402
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.490
know, an interesting way to
leverage mano and, you know,

403
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.990
interesting Avenue for the, you
know, for the joint work

404
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.440
that we do with Microsoft.
So, you know, I think

405
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.800
initially it just started building
out that desktop story, but

406
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.280
it opens up a lot
of pathways that weren't there,

407
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.730
you know, particularly before the
collaboration, are there any examples

408
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.310
of stuff where you've taken,
where when Novell, the larger

409
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.510
company has taken stuff out
of the team code, intellectual

410
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.060
property, whatever, and pushed it
into some other thing, or

411
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.120
where maybe, you know, someone
inside of Novell said, Oh,

412
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.760
I'm going to write that
in mano. And, you know,

413
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.740
wouldn't have done that. Had
you not been part of

414
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.400
the larger company? Yeah. I
mean, there are a number

415
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.700
of projects that we built
inside Novell that were all

416
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.310
based on Monarch. And I
don't think that had they

417
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.490
not acquired Simeon, they would
have done those projects and

418
00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.760
Monarch. So I guess thinking
kind of a little bit

419
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.510
step back to why we're
building it, there were two

420
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.060
elements. One of them is
we really liked the technology

421
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.520
in terms of what Doug
net could do for developers.

422
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.100
And, you know, I started,
I always sell, which is,

423
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.160
I was kind of jealous
that the windows people were

424
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.760
getting this fantastic developer technology
and, you know, Linux was

425
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.810
lagging behind again. So we
wanted to bring up acknowledges

426
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.210
Linux. And, you know, on
the other hand, it allows

427
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:25.860
us to, it allows us
to run a lot of

428
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.350
very interesting code on Linux.
So not only you can

429
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.480
run applications, but you have
access to all of those

430
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.480
stuff. And the libraries that
exist out there that you

431
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.600
can build your software with.
So it can give you,

432
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.280
it gives you, it gives
you the, you know, the

433
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.400
possibility of moving your software
around and not the entirely

434
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.550
tied to windows. And it's
funny, some of the software

435
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.150
that we're building now is
for the first time, for

436
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.190
the first time we're transporting
the software was built for

437
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.670
Linux only and is going
into windows and the Mac.

438
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.980
And it's something that we
didn't plan on initially. I

439
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.570
mean, it would have been
nice, but we never thought

440
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.110
about that. And, and now
it's finally, you know, crossing

441
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:05.190
the trusting the, you know,
to the other side. And

442
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.530
in fact, there's a couple
of, you know, we work

443
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:11.820
with, with a company in
Denmark called unity and their

444
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.120
product is their product. Wasn't
entirely, you know, micro is

445
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.820
base with mana only my
course, it wouldn't even run

446
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.530
on Linux where it's just,
you know, a hundred percent

447
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:24.690
microwave. And, and thanks tomorrow,
they're going to start offering

448
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.460
their product, which I think
is a killer product. They're

449
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.980
going to start offering it
on a windows now. So

450
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.370
it's, it's an interesting, it's
an interesting situation where you

451
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.470
have a lot of good
mobility going back and forth.

452
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.180
Oh, now what's, what's the
future of that. I mean,

453
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.050
it seems like there's a
lot of speculation around unity

454
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.070
and everyone's talking to everyone,
seeing, you know, videos of

455
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.400
Mano on the iPhone. And
w are you thinking we're

456
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.960
going to get Silverlight on
the iPhone at some point,

457
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.190
is that the goal We
definitely want to kind of

458
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:56.350
the problem with the, with
the problem with the iPhone

459
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.770
is the easy Apple terms
of, of, you know, it's

460
00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.650
really the license that Apple
gives you to develop applications

461
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.910
for the iPhone. And they've
basically stated both at the,

462
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.950
you know, at the legal
agreement that you signed with

463
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.490
them. And, you know, at
the kernel level, they disable

464
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.270
jet a jet engine. So
you can really adjusting time

465
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.200
compile code for that thing.
And you can really, and

466
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.450
they don't allow you to
use any interpreter, which is

467
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.390
not provided by them, which,
which is the reason why

468
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.370
you can have flash and
what you can have silver

469
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.890
light and what you can
have in a Python on

470
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.760
the iPhone. It's a, it
comes down to a, to

471
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.410
a legal issue and also
the kernel enforcing some of

472
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.720
those pieces. So one of
the things that we want

473
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.230
to do to be completely,
you know, within the, you

474
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.760
know, completely legit and completely
following Apple's requirements is do

475
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.140
aesthetic compilation of silver light.
Now the upside is you'll

476
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.450
be able to bring silver
light applications to the iPhone.

477
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.890
But downside though, is that
you is not going to

478
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.140
work inside the browser. It's
not something that you're going

479
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.690
to go to webpage and
it's going to work. The

480
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.370
only way that is going
to work is you're going

481
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.370
to have to build your
Silverlight app. And then, you

482
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.850
know, distributed through either the
Apple channel, you know, through

483
00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.210
Apple's distribution challenge, the app
store, or you use the

484
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.830
enterprise deployment feature that allows
you to deploy your applications,

485
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.210
your own internal users, but,
but there's not, you know,

486
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.890
it's not going to integrate
into the web. You will

487
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.110
be able to build Silverlight
applications that they just want

488
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.600
to be inside a web
browser. So that is a

489
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.790
little bit of a, you
know, it's a little bit

490
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.540
sad that those restrictions are
in place, but on the

491
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.730
other hand, you know, if
you've built that sort of

492
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.350
light up, at least we
were going to be able

493
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.360
to bring it to, to
a phone and it will

494
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.400
be, you know, you were
going to get more of

495
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.410
a desktop experience with it
than a, than a web

496
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.280
experience. Can you speak a
little more about how they

497
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.420
are preventing this? I'm not
clear if these are guidelines,

498
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.460
like don't be naughty, or
if there's something that they've

499
00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.850
actually physically changed to prevent
someone from doing what you're

500
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.970
saying to doing. Yeah. There
are two pieces, the tech

501
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.810
on the technical side, they,
you know, when you adjust

502
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.630
in time compile code, you
basically transformed the byte codes

503
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.170
that you get these, you
know, common, intermediate language codes,

504
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.960
and you translate them on
the flight to native, you

505
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.890
know, exit DCX or in
this case, arm, arm code.

506
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.940
And you're right. That stuff
into memory. Once you've compiled

507
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:28.480
the function, let's say the
function, you know, print test,

508
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.810
right. Once you've get some
pallet function print test, the,

509
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.660
the next step is you
need to turn that page

510
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.360
from writeable, right? That, that
chunk of memory that you

511
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.670
just wrote into, you need
to slip on a bed

512
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.770
that tells us if you
can execute the code on

513
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.970
this page. And the thing,
the tech, the technology that

514
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.520
just compilers use, what they
do is they write into

515
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.310
memory. And once they're done,
they fit this bit and

516
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.090
they let the CPU executes
build there. So in the

517
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.450
iPhone operating system, one point
now you were able to

518
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.420
do that with two point.
Now, starting with 2.0 2.1,

519
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.750
two point. Now they disabled
that feature. So you're not

520
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.950
physically able to implement the
jet engine. That means that

521
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.910
nothing like benign or Java
or.net can actually run using

522
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.600
just technology. So what we
do have, or we think

523
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.310
that is a kind of
a unique offering in mono

524
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.640
is we're able to do
a full static compilation of.net

525
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.920
code without having any just-in-time
compilation like Java or.net or

526
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.950
flash or <inaudible>. So I
think that that's, that's the

527
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.870
reason why we were, we
were going to be able

528
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.660
to do that, to do
that for, for silver light

529
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.360
on the iPhone. Now, the
other piece, the other piece

530
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.660
is a legal piece. And
they basically, the, the, the

531
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.090
Apple agreement is that you
will not run the, do

532
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.640
you agree that you will
not implement the interpreter or

533
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.060
implement the JIT compiler that
will let you execute arbitrary

534
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.890
code that has not been
approved by Apple. And I

535
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.990
don't know the reasons I
suspect that they want to

536
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.260
make sure that everything that
runs on the iPhone will

537
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.290
go to the app store
through the app store. And,

538
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.120
and I guess that if
you were able to basically

539
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.000
just shift flash or Silverlight,
then any apps can make

540
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.940
it to the iPhone. So,
you know, we can speculate

541
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.910
why Apple did that, but,
but those are the two,

542
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.950
the two restrictions, one is
legal, the other one is

543
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.570
technical. So the way that
you're getting around the jetting

544
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.790
part is you're basically, if
I understand correctly, you're doing

545
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.430
like an end gen of
the, of the code yourself.

546
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.020
Exactly. You think of Amgen
plus. So engine engine still

547
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.770
needs a tiny little bit
of, of, of runtime support.

548
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.420
And we can, and basically
what we did is we

549
00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.050
took this extra step where
we completely, you know, we

550
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.600
completely Repub the jet engine.
There's not even a jet

551
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.730
engine running on the, on
Mon on the iPhone at

552
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:48.920
that point. Hmm. So do
you, do you anticipate, you

553
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.600
know, in six months or
a year, someone's gonna be

554
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.270
able to just fire up
an IDE and go file

555
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.300
new iPhone application and then
start writing away in C

556
00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.320
sharp, maybe using Monat developer
eclipse. Yes. Yes. Well, so

557
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.590
today it's already possible. You
can do it today. I

558
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.350
mean, the unity guys have
basically done the entire work

559
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.830
for the pipeline. Now, the
they're focused on gaming. So

560
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.200
you really kind of, you
know, all the API that

561
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.960
you have accessible ours, you
know, Emma's core lit plus

562
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.500
gaming API, which, you know,
if you're a gamer, it's

563
00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.590
perfect. If you're not, then,
then, then, then it's not.

564
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.800
But so unity already has
that on it's selling the

565
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.410
product right now. They've been
selling it for a month

566
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.170
now. So that, that does
exist today. But what we

567
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.380
want to do is, is
effectively, you know, make a

568
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:36.950
more interesting offering for the
iPhone. You know, at some

569
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.340
point we thought, well, what
about complex framework? And, you

570
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.550
know, bringing a compact framer
to the iPhone. And we

571
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.910
thought, and we didn't think
that, I mean, we think

572
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.280
that the future is silver
light, not really windows forms.

573
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.100
So I think what we're
going to go, what we

574
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.030
want to do eventually is
do a silver light. Basically

575
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.100
you build your Silverlight application
and we'll have a tool

576
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.160
that, you know, will transform
your zap file into a,

577
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.740
into a binary that you
can give up for distribution.

578
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.610
So you will continue to
visual studio you'll instead of

579
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.250
designing, you know, against that
huge canvas you'll designing is

580
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.990
the canvas that is, you
know, the size of the

581
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:15.370
phone, I dunno, 300 by
600 or 500. And then,

582
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.670
and then just convert the
zap into a, into a,

583
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:23.220
into a native application. Now,
when you've got both, if

584
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.830
you get both mano and
server light running on an

585
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.840
iPhone, is there a reason
for both? Or would you

586
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.240
just say, well, we'll just
know server light will be

587
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.820
our way. We'll do things.
I think silver should be

588
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.700
it. You know, we talked
about this because I think

589
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.680
that the iPhone is a,
is a, is a hot

590
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.270
gadget, but right now, you
know, we think, I mean,

591
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.430
all of our efforts are
really in silver lights. So,

592
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.030
so we had a couple
of options. One was build

593
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:51.660
native, you know, build native
API for, for the, for

594
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.540
the iPhone. But then, you
know, the testing becomes very

595
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.440
cumbersome. It will be a
macro, it's the only solution.

596
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.770
And, you know, it's a
lot of work and, you

597
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.570
know, we've built a bunch
of toolkits in the past.

598
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.640
You know, this is our
third or fourth tool kit

599
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.310
that we're building. So we
really don't want to go

600
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.040
down that path of doing
all of that work. It

601
00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.380
seems like a lot of
work and it would also

602
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.810
be, you know, it would
be another API that developers

603
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.970
will have to learn it,
you know, we would be

604
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.870
limited in how, you know,
there would be no books,

605
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.750
there will be zero reference
materials. So it, I mean,

606
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.460
somebody might be able to
do that, but I think

607
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.490
that really the feature is
just to, just to build

608
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.160
it on silver lights, because
Silverlight is, well-documented, there's tons

609
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.500
of books, you know, you
can get help anywhere. You

610
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.600
can go to stack overflow
and, you know, a hundred

611
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.580
people will answer your questions.
So, I mean, there are

612
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.430
probably other ways of doing
things on the iPhone. I

613
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.520
just don't think they're very,
I mean, considering the size

614
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.370
of our team and considering,
you know, just the dynamics

615
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.960
of the market, I think
it would be better to

616
00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.720
just say, we'll get you
silver light. And what we'll

617
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.600
probably do is we'll do
a template that makes the

618
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.110
application looks like an iPhone
application. Right. Right. And that

619
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.600
would, that would mean a
series of controls. And basically

620
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.180
you'd be doing owner draws,
AML that would look iPhone

621
00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.390
ish and ultimately people would
be, it'd be pixel by

622
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.360
pixel. Perfect. But it wouldn't
really be the native APIs.

623
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.660
That's right. That's right. So
people will continue to use

624
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.070
Silverlight API and, you know,
we can, what we can

625
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.170
do is we can take
the Microsoft, you know, you

626
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.670
guys open source the controls
for, for silver light. So

627
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.500
what we have to do
is, you know, learn from

628
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.480
the source and kind of,
you know, build a nice

629
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.300
template that would look iPhone
ish and then ship it

630
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.370
on the iPhone. So that
way nobody would be able

631
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.760
to tell the difference between
the Gina Silverlight app and

632
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.890
the knife on nappy if
they don't want to. Right.

633
00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.830
Right. Exactly. Now last question
is a, is Moonlight, does

634
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.900
it have, does it have
a reason to live on

635
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.790
windows or is it not
going to be a windows

636
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.590
thing? There's no reason to
have Moonlight on windows. If

637
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.060
you've got silver light on
windows already. Well, you know,

638
00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.430
we said the same thing
about Mona. We thought we

639
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.530
should never bring it to
a, we will never bring

640
00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.460
it to, to windows because
it's, you know, windows have.net,

641
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.070
but it turns out that
people actually use mono on

642
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:06.370
windows a lot, but maybe
when they will bring it

643
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.980
right in our focus is
really, really on Linux. But,

644
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.350
you know, it's open source
if somebody really cares and

645
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:14.110
has a, you know, a
reason or a business reason

646
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.150
to do it, I don't
know what that reason would

647
00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:18.910
be today. But, you know,
that's kind of the, what

648
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:24.880
happens with this, you know,
incredibly democratize, you know, hacker

649
00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.740
universe that we have these
days, you know, so many

650
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.740
people are doing so many
different things for God knows

651
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.430
what reasons. Yeah. You know,
when someone was commenting that

652
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:37.240
they really wanted to have
a tiny, tiny CLR for

653
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.390
windows that was like X
copy deployable. And, you know,

654
00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:45.070
you could strip down mano
or use a Moonlight and

655
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.730
have a little portable application
that would have nothing. It

656
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.160
would have no install. You
just basically, you know, a

657
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.980
single statically linked app that
would be using mano as

658
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.500
it's, as its engine or
Moonlight as its engine. I

659
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.590
suppose you could do something
like that. That's actually what

660
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.640
the use cases today for,
for the windows case. And,

661
00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.070
and it's been done mostly
by the gaming people, by

662
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.530
people that build games. So
it's funny, it's one of

663
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.500
those situations where people are
using Monarch and they're not

664
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.450
even bringing their apps to
Linux. You know, it's a

665
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:17.110
very windows centric, you know,
it's a windows app. They

666
00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.560
just happen to embed a
tiny CLR for their gaming

667
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.710
there, you know, when they
shipped. So yeah. Maybe something

668
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.050
like that would happen with
one light. Yeah. So you're

669
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:27.670
saying I might be running
one of these right now

670
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.770
and have no idea that,
that model's on my machine

671
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.800
and running in a game.
Yeah. Well, the first, you

672
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.230
know, the first major game
that I know of, but

673
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.630
I can't say their name
in public is coming in

674
00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:43.750
late February. Oh. But I'll
never know. Yeah. It's a

675
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.150
major game. So until late
February, I don't think you

676
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:48.160
have it right now. Or
if you go to a,

677
00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:51.010
you know, if you're into
a, if you have kids,

678
00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:55.150
you know, five to five
to eight, I think it's

679
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:59.980
a cartoon network is using
it now for a phone

680
00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.930
call or some bomb or
fun ball or funds, something

681
00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:09.190
like that. It's yeah. It's
one fusion fault. Fusion fault.

682
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.050
Yeah. So you get the
fusion full and you sign

683
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.530
up for fusion fall. It's
a massive multiplayer online gaming.

684
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.480
It's a little bit like
the world of Warcraft, but

685
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.940
for, you know, for young
kids for toddlers. Yeah. It's

686
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:29.350
exactly what we're Warcraft for
toddlers. Exactly. That's fantastic. Cool.

687
00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.810
Well, Miguel and Joseph, thanks
so much for sitting down

688
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.460
to talk with me today
on the show. I know

689
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.740
that again, you're on vacation.
We go, so I'll let

690
00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.130
you get back to the
beach or the mountains Or

691
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.500
wherever you are in Mexico.
Thank you very much. Cubby

692
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:44.280
was a pleasure. All right.
This has been another episode

693
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.680
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
