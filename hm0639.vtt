Mo next Mo is an
API platform that allows developers

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.560
to integrate communications features like
voice and SMS into their

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.110
projects. Next most comprehensive set
of tools includes powerful API

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.200
APIs, libraries, and SDKs that
allow developers to build and

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.470
iterate quickly in the language
of their choice, whether it's

Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

12
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.170
Hansel minutes. And today I'm
talking with Julia Evans. She is

13
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.150
a infrastructure engineer at Stripe
and a famous Xen creator.

14
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.210
I love your zenes and
I'm excited every time I

15
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.490
see one go by on
my timeline. Thanks so much

16
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.510
for having me on the
show. Yeah, absolutely. So you

17
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.140
make zenes, they are kind
of hard to define. What,

18
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.360
how would you call what
is a Xen from your

19
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.750
perspective? I think a lot
of the time people confuse

20
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.420
the word, like Xen and
comic, if that makes sense.

21
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.270
So what I need to
do is it's like usually

22
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.990
a handmade 20 page ish
thing that you make, and

23
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.350
you either like giveaway yourself
to people or is like,

24
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.860
it's something which is usually
independently published. It's not like

25
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.350
the production values are not
usually that high, right? Like

26
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.270
when I make scenes, I
like print them on my

27
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.790
home printer and like give
them to full or sell

28
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.550
them to people. Sometimes I
go to my local print

29
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.030
shop and I'll print like
200, but it's like, it's

30
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.950
like an independent undertaking where
you write like a small

31
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.620
booklet about something that you
love or that you think

32
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.970
more people should know that
this makes me, it makes

33
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.500
me feel like I was,
I was in like in

34
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.110
the eighties when I was
in school, I would print

35
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.410
out like, like I couldn't
afford like trading cards for

36
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.330
like, you know, garbage pail
kids or whatever. So we

37
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.700
just make our own like,
and cut them out with

38
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.230
scissors and give them to
our friends. And they're all

39
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.930
black and white. And if
you could find someone's copy

40
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.150
machine where you didn't have
to pay 5 cents a page,

41
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.550
like all the better. Yeah.
I think that's the, that's

42
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.760
the aesthetic. And then so
like I make scenes, which

43
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.750
are collections of comics. And
sometimes people refer to those

44
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.880
comics as deans, but as
Dean, as like a, it

45
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.590
has multiple pages, like a
thing, and some of them

46
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.830
are, have a lot of
text. Like there's like some

47
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.660
of the, some of your
Linux comics you have like

48
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.460
really cool, 24 page scene
of comics, Lennox. And sometimes

49
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.680
there'll be like an, a
whole page with like one

50
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.590
stick figure, but then you'll
do other ones, like you

51
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.500
have a whole Xen on
TCP dump, which is like

52
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.860
totally different art style. And
it's very, very sophisticated. Your

53
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.630
art style seems to with
the topic, Is that true?

54
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.520
I think that, that those
two are the same, like

55
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.550
their covers, the cover of
the TCP Dempsey in is

56
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.510
different, but Oh, okay. So
the cover has a different

57
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.240
style than the inside. Yeah,
because I hired illustrators to

58
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.880
do the covers, but I
did everything inside to myself

59
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.310
and I only know how
to draw stick figures. Oh,

60
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.870
okay. I w I was
always wondering that, cause I,

61
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.940
when I saw they're kind
of your most famous one

62
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.440
and you want to be
a, so you want to

63
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.110
be a wizard, like I'm
like, wow, she can draw

64
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.380
stick figures and this, this
like totally comic front end

65
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.240
front end. So that's cool.
So the cover art is

66
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.270
by another person. Yeah. I
can only draw stick figures

67
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.440
actually. For sure. It's still
a successful Xen art doing

68
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.320
only stick figures, DDM on
the computer or is it

69
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.510
like an iPad pencil or
something? I do them on

70
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.380
an iPad with the Apple
pencil. Yeah. Yeah. I'm looking

71
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.620
at one for example. And
I'm thinking to myself, okay.

72
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.580
Like, let's say, how does
DNS work? Right. It's like

73
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.050
four frames of a comic
and it's got a minimal

74
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.020
amount of text and some
stick figures. If I copied

75
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.050
it as a PowerPoint, I
have a feeling it would

76
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.900
not go viral and no
one would care and it

77
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.930
probably wouldn't teach anyone. But
it's so fun in the

78
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.990
style. Like why does a
Xen work when a PowerPoint

79
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.530
doesn't? So, one thing that
I actually think is really

80
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.620
important about deans is kind
of like the physical nature

81
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.680
of them. Like, like I
write, I definitely like have

82
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.900
them on the internet and
like, I let people read

83
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.750
them on the internet and
you can read it on

84
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.950
your screen. Of course. But
the reason I started writing

85
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.380
scenes is that I was
going to a conference. I

86
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.090
was going to pike on
actually. And I was giving

87
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.070
a talk at Python, which
was a big deal. And

88
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.110
I was very excited and
I decided to bring it

89
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.480
a long and hand it
out to everyone in the

90
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.670
audience. Right. So I went
to the fringe drop, like

91
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.270
paid $200, like printed, a
few hundred scenes. And then

92
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.910
I gave them out to
everyone. And like, people have

93
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.320
told me, they were like,
Oh, I still have that

94
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.390
scene. And I still like,
look at it like four

95
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.270
years later. Right. And of
course it's never going to

96
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.490
happen with a PowerPoint. Right.
Or the, or they'll say

97
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.430
like, Oh, I saw your
Z. And like someone gave

98
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.200
it to me or I
saw it in someone's office

99
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.910
and I picked it up
and then I learned something.

100
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.160
And I think that, like
the fact that it's like

101
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.170
an artifact in the world,
but you can like pass

102
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.360
around and give to your
friends. It makes it something

103
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.040
that I think is a
lot easier to learn from.

104
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.490
Interesting. That it does. It's
interesting because you want it

105
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.710
to seem small and personal,
but if it's scales, like

106
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.260
if you became super famous
Jean person, how would you

107
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.810
make them all small and
personal for a million people?

108
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.230
Well, I don't know. This
is a good question, but

109
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.580
I feel like I've read
a lot of books, which

110
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.180
did feel like small and
personal to me, if that

111
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.790
makes sense. Like, cause like
sometimes when you, when you

112
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.680
read a book, it like,
it feels like the person

113
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.560
is just speaking to you.
Right. And you're like, Oh,

114
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.450
this is like, this book
was written for me. How

115
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.660
did you know? And I
think that's kind of the

116
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.600
feeling I want in part
is like, hello, I wrote

117
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.140
this for you. Yeah. That's
really cool. And I think

118
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.880
that's like the amazing thing
about print. Right. And, and

119
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.660
about writing, Do you even
like this, this started out

120
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.550
and you print it out
for 200 people, but do

121
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.070
you do like thousand print
runs now? And like it's

122
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.580
become a big thing. Yeah.
So I spoke at deconstruct

123
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.850
recently, which is this conference
in Seattle and we printed

124
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.340
two thousands genes. Oh wow.
Which was really fun. Yeah.

125
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.890
We've like we printed copies,
like maybe 300 copies of

126
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.190
all of, all of my
scenes. Do you consciously try

127
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.040
to make them like, and
forgive the way I'm phrasing

128
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.700
this? Like not polished, like
for example, if a Xen

129
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.120
is like you photocopied and
then slightly a skew, it

130
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.360
just means it has personality.
Right. But if you did

131
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.790
like an actual print run
for like a New York times

132
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.340
bestselling something and it was
a skew, people would like

133
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.930
lose their minds. Yeah. It
do. Is it intentional? I

134
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.180
mean, it's kind of a
matter of like, I'm not

135
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.370
an extremely good designer or
artist. Right. Like, so I

136
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.990
think that there's kind of
like an upper limit to

137
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.570
like the metaphors. I'm probably
as close as you can

138
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.370
go into produce, especially because
I do it in my

139
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.880
spare time. Right. Like I
do it after work. So

140
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.030
I think it's just not
going to happen. Like maybe

141
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.950
at some point that'll make
things that are more polished,

142
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.000
but I think people really
like it too. Like I

143
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.460
think having something handwritten is,
is, is a huge deal

144
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.620
in like the fact that
like, like, I think a

145
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.050
part of a part of
it is like, people are

146
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.910
like, Oh, you took the
time to write all this

147
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.680
information down by hand. It
must be important. Oh, that's

148
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.310
interesting. You think that people
are like a scribing depth

149
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.490
to something that's not, that's
consciously not deep because it

150
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.960
was handwritten. I think so
like, well, cause I think

151
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.670
if you read something by
hand, it does make it

152
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.040
more important. Right? Cause it
takes me like five times

153
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.750
longer to write something by
hand than at which type

154
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.330
it, How many times do
you have to do these

155
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.070
before? You know that you've
got it right. Because it's

156
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.040
not just like, you didn't
just scribble you. Like there

157
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.640
is structure and thought because
there is a learning style

158
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.240
where you ask a question,
you present a problem and

159
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.880
then you make a helpful,
you, you walk someone through

160
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.940
it, like there's, there's a
linear as Asian to this.

161
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.600
That is important. Yeah. So
what, like one hard thing

162
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.730
is like, so let's say
like you're writing a comic

163
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.730
about some important concept. Like
I don't know, virtual memory.

164
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.420
Right. And like in these,
like, especially in these six

165
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.360
panel comics, I do, I'll
often only write something like

166
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.430
50 words in that. Right.
So you have this huge

167
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.030
topic and you to describe
it in 50 words and

168
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.100
how do you do that?
And so what I do

169
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.360
a lot of the time
is it like, sit on

170
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.730
my couch with this like
paint, look on my face

171
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.310
and I'll be like, what
can I say? Like, what

172
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.590
are five words that I
can say that are true

173
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.580
about this topic? It's really
hard. Right? Cause like making

174
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.260
statements that are like, at
least like 90% true that

175
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.690
are short and that are
understandable is so hard, but

176
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.280
it's possible. Right. And then
once I do it, people

177
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.280
are like, Oh wow, I
understand this now. And so

178
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.080
maybe like sometimes it'll take
me an hour to write

179
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.480
like a 10 word sentence.
Like I usually, usually I

180
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.140
can come up with something
faster than that. But Yeah,

181
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.240
like I'm looking, for example,
like the memory allocation one,

182
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.820
like we've all read like
entire books on memory allocation,

183
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.940
but you're, you're getting it
down to the essence. And

184
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.220
it's clear that you didn't
just like bang that out

185
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.540
in five minutes. Well, it
says at any given time,

186
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.640
your program has a fixed
amount of memory. And then

187
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.850
it shows like a kind
of a, defragmentation kind of

188
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.040
a thing where it shows
pieces of memory, some of

189
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.080
which is used in some
which is free. And then

190
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.630
it says, and you can
ask the OSTP for more

191
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.580
memory. And then you've got
like this happy figure that

192
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.210
represents Google Chrome taking two
gigabytes of your Ram, which

193
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.060
I thought was funny. And
then it has like a

194
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.790
person who's allocating. It's like,
Oh, can I allocate some?

195
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.150
And then you basically show
pieces of memory being Malak.

196
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.290
And then you talk about
different alternatives to Malik with

197
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.590
Facebook and Google having different
Malik's Right. And like this

198
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.440
thing where you can ask
your operating system for more

199
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.830
memory is like, it's like
not a trivial piece of

200
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.610
information. Right. And like, it's
not obvious that like this,

201
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.830
this interaction where you're like,
Hey, offering system, can you,

202
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.100
can I have more memory
is something that your program

203
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.340
is doing, but then you,
like, when you explain it

204
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.350
like that, it seems simple.
And I think it's cool

205
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.400
that you always have the
little people having a conversation

206
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.820
with the computer, which somehow
makes the computer more approachable.

207
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.340
What I think is interesting
is that since you are

208
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.610
a infrastructure engineer and you're
a backend engineer and you're

209
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.840
a low level Linux engineer,
you're talking about like CIS

210
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.050
calls, which for a lot
of people is a scary

211
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.870
thing. Right. And we have
these happy little people making

212
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.730
six calls and I'm like,
Oh, well, is that all

213
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.140
it's just called? It is.
That's not as scary as

214
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.990
I thought it was. Right.
Because there's this thing that

215
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.270
like where you asked for
more memory, you're either using

216
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.300
like the Burke, like BRK
Siskel or you're using the

217
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.480
map Siskel. And it's not
like, I mean, I guess

218
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.520
if you, if you, like,
you could write it in

219
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.430
a way that sounds really
unapproachable, but really like computers

220
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.890
are just communicating all the
time. And so I think

221
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.590
comics are a really good
way to show that because

222
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.620
you're always doing networking. Right?
Like your program is talking

223
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.600
to your operating system, your
programs are talking to each

224
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.940
other. And so I, what
I like to do is

225
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.070
kind of like break down
what the interfaces are, right?

226
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.350
Like, like the system college
or phase, and then just

227
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.030
like show that with a
comic. And you're like, okay,

228
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.670
here's piece one and here's
piece two. And then here's

229
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.320
like the interface where they
talk to each other. And

230
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.810
then here's what they're saying.
Cause that's just what happens

231
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.750
on computers. Right? Like that's
how I think about it

232
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.630
is you just have these
different components interacting. And I

233
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.520
think trying to explain it
with comics makes it seem

234
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.800
a lot just like makes
it a lot more straight

235
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.920
forward. Yeah. I like also
that some of the comics

236
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.800
are kind of unapologetic about
stuff. So for example, you've

237
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.960
got one on the OSI
model for networking. I'm like,

238
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.510
Oh, she's going to explain
like all the layers, right.

239
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.440
Layer seven. And she's like,
Oh, well layer five and

240
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.660
six. No one ever talks
about these. Like you just

241
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.700
like, we're not going to
talk about those two layers

242
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.180
because they suck. Yeah. I
thought that was awesome. They

243
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.010
do layers five and six.
Are, are you willing to

244
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.220
speak with them again? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. One thing that

245
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.110
I kind of think is
important is I try not

246
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.030
to use metaphors. Cause I
don't understand metaphors like, like

247
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.550
I try to make things
simple, but I don't try

248
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.020
to be like, Oh, this
is like this other thing.

249
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.230
Cause often it's like not,
Hmm. Probably people use metaphors.

250
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.000
I'm like, I don't understand
what you mean. Like, That's

251
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.280
really interesting because like I
think of myself as a

252
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.210
teacher and all I have
is metaphors. So that's very

253
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.940
interesting. So here we are
two people presenting information in

254
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.460
two different ways and sometimes
it's effective and sometimes it's

255
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.760
not. Yeah. Yeah. And I
mean, obviously other people use

256
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.890
metaphors effectively, but I don't
understand how to use them

257
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.780
at all. So I just
try to simplify things and

258
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.090
then like the simplest version
of the truth that I

259
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.010
can come up with. And
then I just say that,

260
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.440
Hmm, this is a tough
question. But have you ever

261
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.050
had a Xen? That was
just a huge fail. Like

262
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.880
you put it out there
and nobody got it and

263
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.400
no one understood. And then
you just like made that

264
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.650
gene disappear and recruited. I
don't think so. Well, I

265
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.350
don't know. I mean, I've,
I've written like seventeens, right?

266
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.030
But you've written hundreds of
hundred comics. I've written a

267
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.310
lot of comics. I mean,
some of, some of the

268
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.040
comics are of course bad.
Well, yeah, let me, let

269
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.780
me back it up. So
not I'm misused, but I

270
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.520
see, I actually did what
you want me to, I

271
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.300
misused zenes are collections of
comics. Have you done an

272
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.670
individual comic that just didn't
land the way you wanted

273
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.730
to do it? I can't
remember a specific one that

274
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.910
I thought, okay. He here's
like, this is more of

275
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.090
a blog post. Maybe there
are all these Linux tracing

276
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.660
systems, which let you basically
trace what your operating system

277
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.880
is doing. So like there's
like F trays and they're,

278
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.750
they're all, they're all a
little bit obscure, I guess

279
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.570
have like, most people don't
know about them. And I

280
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.790
was really upset that I
couldn't like find like a

281
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.710
summary of like what all
the like Tracy's sister she's

282
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.630
of some floor. So I
wrote this really long blog

283
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.730
post kind of summarizing, like
at a high level, like

284
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.100
what all these systems do.
And I thought, I think

285
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.200
that it would be, everyone
would be really excited about

286
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.450
it. And what I forgot
is that like, I don't

287
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.990
think most people really care
about clinics, tracing systems. I

288
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.230
think it's mostly just me.
And like, I mean, people

289
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.300
do like, I mean, my
partner just told me the

290
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.830
other day, he was like,
Oh, I saw someone like

291
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.260
link your blog post on
this mailing list saying that

292
00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.760
it was really useful. And
I was like, Oh cool.

293
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:05.130
Like somebody did care. But
like, I think like I

294
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.790
forgot how Nisha topic it
was in a way fine.

295
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.540
Like I like to write
about things that are niche

296
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.170
topics, because I guess, cause
I think that those things

297
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.320
often end up being really
underserved. And like I was

298
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.120
in a way rather write
about that than write about

299
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.790
something like Jason, cause I'm
like, well, people understand Jason.

300
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.330
Like I don't need to
explain Jason. There's a lot

301
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.640
of material out there. I'd
rather write about political tracing

302
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.250
systems and explain what's going
on with like after race.

303
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.860
It is kind of frustrating
though. Like I've, I've been

304
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.200
blogging for a long time
and I'll feel like I'll

305
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.450
spend a week on a
blog. It's like sample code

306
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.080
and charts and graphs and
tables and like timings and

307
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.180
I get no comments and
no one cares and you

308
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.850
get like 10 likes, but
then you write a blog

309
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.080
post about like character turn
line feed, and get internet

310
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.910
loses their mind. Yeah. I
try To sort of time

311
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.530
box how much time I
spend on it on any

312
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.830
given thing. Like this is
part of why I like

313
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.040
to post like individual pages
on Twitter as I go

314
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.860
to sort of like see
what the reaction is and

315
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.720
just like get a sense
of what people think about

316
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.420
it. And sometimes you will
find mistakes also, which is

317
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.230
great. It's very helpful. But
yeah, like for any individual

318
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.030
comic, I think I try
not to spend more than

319
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.440
a couple of hours on
it. Cool. And you're publishing

320
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.510
these though. Now, like you
started making these and you

321
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.340
would just like put them
out. You'd hand them to

322
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.900
people like a couple of
hundred here. You'd print them

323
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.720
all yourself, but I can
go up now and I

324
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.450
can buy these, like get
the print version. If I

325
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.040
like do the, get the
print version. Do you want

326
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.230
me to print this out
or should I buy it

327
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.120
from kind of buy it
from Amazon? Are you selling

328
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.300
them? You can't buy a
printed version right now. That's

329
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.530
a project that I need
to discover an extra few

330
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.000
dozens of hours. Get to
have it. I haven't figured

331
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.160
out how to do it
yet, but yeah. So is

332
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.450
it right now? If you
buy it, you can print

333
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.020
it out. It does. Does
it feel like it's a,

334
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.950
there's a business here though.
Like I could go and

335
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.850
get like t-shirts of zines
and comics. I don't know.

336
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.660
So I'm like, I feel
like apparel is exciting. People

337
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.740
love apparel, but I'm really
excited about selling like printed

338
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:10.300
stuff and like educational material,
because I feel like there's

339
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:15.070
a huge need for it.
And like, I guess I've

340
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.320
been writing for free for
a long time. Right. And

341
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.600
that's been great and I
love doing it, but I've

342
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.070
kind of realized, I think
that there's sort of like

343
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.810
an upper bound, like how
much you can do for

344
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.910
free actually really like, well,
yeah, because like, if you

345
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.950
want to make something really
good, you know, spend time

346
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.480
on it. Yeah. And there's
like only so much time.

347
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.640
I think that it's possible
to spend doing things for

348
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.550
free. If that makes sense.
It's like, I've been thinking

349
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.670
about like, like sometimes I
go to conferences and I

350
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.380
feel like frustrated with the
talks, but what I realized

351
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.540
is like people don't get
paid to give talks. Right?

352
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.760
Yeah. Well, most, well, some
people, I guess, I guess

353
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.250
there's like there are paid
like famous people that get

354
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.150
money, I guess. Yeah. Yeah.
Right. I believe like the

355
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.870
incentives are sort of misaligned,
right? Like, like people aren't

356
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.600
being paid to give educational
talks. Yeah. And like, I

357
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.150
mean, to the extent that
people at tech conferences do

358
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.080
get paid to give talks,
they're getting paid to like

359
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.530
Market. Thanks to you. That's
a good point. That's a

360
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.360
good point because the famous
people all have a book

361
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.930
to sell or whatever. Yeah.
And so I've been thinking

362
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.000
about sort of like, how
can you structure like a

363
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.880
business so that the incentives
are correctly aligned so that

364
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.200
you can actually like focus
on education, which I feel

365
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.630
like isn't really true in
the publishing industry right now.

366
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.460
Because if you publish a
book with like a mainstream

367
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.580
tech publisher, you're not gonna
make that much money. And

368
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.460
so like, it's like your
financial incentives are not actually

369
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.580
set up to really focus
on it. Right. Right. Well,

370
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.590
and they're going to go
and sell red trees and

371
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.690
they'll sell the dead tree
for like $40 to a

372
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.510
teacher who can't afford it
and you'll get a dollar

373
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.170
or two and then their
next year, they're going to

374
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.760
want you to update all
of your stuff with the

375
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.840
latest version and they can
sell more. Yeah. And part,

376
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.670
part of the reason I
think scenes are exciting is

377
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.880
that they're pretty fast to
produce. And because like technology

378
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.270
is always moving, you can
write something like fairly quickly

379
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:06.950
about something maybe even relatively
recent, which is, I mean,

380
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.390
I don't do this. Right.
I read about things like

381
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.700
Sri are like 10 years
old or about like GCP

382
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.360
that I actually write about
extremely, relatively old stuff. Most

383
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.430
of the time that hasn't
changed and probably isn't going

384
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.550
to change. But, but, but,
but you can write and

385
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.740
I think it's a lot
easier to write something short

386
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.380
and then people will actually
read short things, unlike books,

387
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.050
which I think they mostly
won't read. No, that's a

388
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.740
good point though, because like
I've had, I have memorized

389
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.200
like every single line to
Hamilton and the OT and

390
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.090
the audio book. And I
follow the guy on Twitter

391
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.970
and I've been sitting on
the actual book of Hamilton.

392
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.400
I think the one that
he based the musical on,

393
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.750
it's like 600 pages. It's
been moving around my house,

394
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.390
but it's never actually been
read, which is stressing me

395
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.910
out. I feel like Twitter
has ruined my ability to

396
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.720
read long form stuff, but
I'll read your zenes there,

397
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.540
you know? Cause they're not
600 pages. Yeah. Yeah. And

398
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.490
I think even some of
my favorite tech books, I'll,

399
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.120
I've only read like two
chapters of that. Yeah. Code

400
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.860
complete Steve McConnell's code complete.
Right. And some of those

401
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.100
chapters are really good. Like
they're not bad books, but

402
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.840
I've been thinking about like,
well, like what if we

403
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.360
focus on smaller things and
like really focused on being

404
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.980
like, what if we just
make 20 pages, we'll make

405
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.850
those 20 pages so good
and make them like really

406
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.520
what you need to know.
Yeah. Like, like some of

407
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.590
your, like I could read
an entire chapter on like

408
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.980
how the Linux proc directory
works, but I read your

409
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.630
Xen and I feel like
I pretty much get it.

410
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.180
And there's probably a hundred
words on the entire thing.

411
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.210
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And then
you can always go to

412
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:39.170
the man page, right? Like
if you want Exactly. Hey

413
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.870
folks, Intel is a sponsor
this week and I welcome

414
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.470
them because they're bringing some
high performance developer tools for

415
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.640
all of us check out
Intel's parallel studio X, E

416
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.430
I've talked about parallelism before
on the show and the

417
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.270
importance of using the complete
instruction set, unlocking the power

418
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.280
of the process or that
your code is running on.

419
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.980
Now, you all might be
writing C or C plus

420
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.670
plus Python or even Fortran,
but is your code building

421
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.320
in such a way and
written in such a way

422
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.780
that it uses the latest
techniques for vectorization multithreading multi-node

423
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.790
parallelization or memory optimization? Intel
parallel studio ECC has a

424
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.730
lot of new stuff for
2018 across all these languages.

bitly.com/parallels, studio X, E. So

430
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.430
you know, you're, you know,
you're somewhat senior. Would you

431
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.580
call yourself an intermediate developer?
Him? How long have you

432
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.990
been in developing Helen? So
I learned from him 15

433
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.380
years ago. Okay. So do
you feel like there's a

434
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.790
special place for like that
10, 15 year intermediate developer

435
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.810
learning where we want to
learn more a certain way?

436
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.160
Like, I feel like there's
so much material for beginners

437
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.320
right now. Like if you
want to learn a programming

438
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.900
language, there's like these like
learn Python the hard way.

439
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.320
Right. Which I've heard really
good things about. And there's

440
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.910
so little material, I think
for, for intermediate to like

441
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.660
maybe advanced developers. I think
I had this really sort

442
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.740
of formative experience five years
ago where someone told me

443
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.020
that Estrace, which is this
tool that traces system calls

444
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.720
on Lex. And I didn't
know. Well, I didn't know

445
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.300
that system calls existed. Like,
I didn't know how Perkins

446
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.220
talked to the operating system
at all. And I didn't

447
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.350
know that you could trace
them with Estrace. I think

448
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.930
at that point I'd been
programming for 10 years and

449
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.270
I felt kind of like
angry almost like I was

450
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.600
like, why didn't anyone tell
me before? Right. And like,

451
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.750
where was I supposed to
learn this? And I realized

452
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.250
that for a lot of
things, there's sort of no

453
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.920
way, like, I mean, of
course, like someone could have

454
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.560
told me, right? Like it's
possible that I guess I

455
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.300
could have met someone who
told him, but I didn't.

456
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.480
Right. So I was like,
wait, how am I supposed

457
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.540
to learn these straight? Like,
how are we supposed to

458
00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.200
learn new things that are
pretty fundamental, right? Like the

459
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.270
fact that like system calls
or how your program talks

460
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.100
to your operating system, it's
like a pretty fundamental fact

461
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.620
about how computers work. And
of course, like you can

462
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.450
say like, Oh, well Julia,
you should have taken the

463
00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.120
operating systems class in university
instead of not taking it.

464
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.320
Right. But like university classes
are not, I don't think

465
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.440
are like the solution to
like ongoing developer education. Right?

466
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.840
Like once you graduated from
university, you will have learned

467
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.570
some things. But like, no
matter what university you went

468
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.820
to, you're still going, I'm
not learn some like important

469
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.430
and fundamental things anyway. And
so it's like, well, how

470
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.830
do you, how, how, how
does it happen that you've

471
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.960
learned those things? Right? Well,
like I was talking to

472
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.380
my, to my spouse a
couple of days ago and

473
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.450
it turns out that she
doesn't know how to change

474
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.990
her oil. Now here's a
person who's been driving for

475
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.770
20 years. Right? Yeah. I
could. So she's a senior

476
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.640
driving engineer. Yeah. Who am
I to say? How do

477
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.950
you not know how to
change your oil? Like, but

478
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.110
that seems to be the
way the community approaches, stuff

479
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.330
like that. Like how do
you not know that she

480
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.490
also doesn't know how to
drive a stick shift? I

481
00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.100
could like lose my mind
and, and like, I don't

482
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.680
know, stick shift to shame
her for not knowing how

483
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.720
to drive a stick, but
at the same time, shouldn't

484
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.570
I be happy that automatic
shift cars work and they

485
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.730
work great so much so
that she doesn't need to

486
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.950
own to know that. So
then the question is as

487
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.440
an intermediate developer, what am
I supposed to know? And

488
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.210
what's a waste, like, do
I need to know how

489
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.100
to change my own oil?
Or do I just hire

490
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.190
someone to do that? Yeah.
Right. So it's like, how

491
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.140
do you figure out what,
what you do need to

492
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.390
know? And like, once you
decide, you want to know

493
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.220
those things, like what are
the resources you're going to

494
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.770
use to learn? Yeah. Yeah.
There's no, like you wouldn't

495
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.560
go and find Python for
intermediate people. There's not like

496
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.400
that book doesn't exist. Yeah.
And I think Like I

497
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.410
was reading the C plus
plus programming book a little

498
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.760
bit. Cause I wanted to
learn a little bit of

499
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.440
C plus plus. And it
was like, Oh, here's what

500
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.200
a variable is. And I
was like, Oh, what, like,

501
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.560
what is this book? Like,
I'm not reading this. Right.

502
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.690
Like I'm not reading someone
like explain to me what

503
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.660
a function is for 10
pages. Like I want to

504
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.520
learn like what I need
to know about people's pluses,

505
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.310
someone who knows like these
like eight other programming languages

506
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.100
already, but I don't know
C plus plus, right? Like

507
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.990
they're their list is like
tricky things about C plus

508
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.860
plus that are really surprising
someone coming from another language.

509
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.170
But yeah, I dunno. I
was like, this is really

510
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.100
hard. It is. It almost
feels weird. Like I learned

511
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.400
that I was mispronouncing a
word for the last 40

512
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.680
years of my life, like
yesterday now that my wife

513
00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.210
is not, you know, she's
like, how did you make

514
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.420
it this far? So if
that's happening to me as

515
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.720
a native English speaker, like
imagine how much computer science

516
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.660
or software engineering that I've
gotten wrong. That I'm like

517
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.680
walking around thinking I know
X, and it's actually why

518
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.260
it's going to blow my
mind. And there's not only

519
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.640
like, where do I go
to learn it? And where

520
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.230
do I learn to fix
that? But also like as

521
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.540
a community, we should be
able to be public and

522
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.580
be comfortable to say, Oh,
I never learned how to

523
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.650
do that. Right. But if
you told someone, you didn't

524
00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.180
know how to do a
bubble sort, you probably lose

525
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.480
your job. Yeah. That's interesting.
You know, I feel we

526
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.090
should be more kind of
supportive of people in their

527
00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.900
learning. And I always appreciate
you on, on Twitter because

528
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.360
I know you are know
what you're talking about. It's

529
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.090
clear in your writing, you
have a great blog and

530
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.610
a mediums and all of
your jeans are fantastic. But

531
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.830
at the same time, I
feel like you're very enthusiastic

532
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.580
about learning stuff. And I
wonder if people are ever

533
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.770
like, Oh, you should have
known that Juliet. How did

534
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.720
you get this far? I
hate it when people do

535
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.570
that kind of stuff, because
I'm always learning new hotkeys

536
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:33.910
and new SIS calls. Yeah,
I guess so I think,

537
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:38.050
I think I've spent a
lot of time getting better

538
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.140
at learning. I think it's
really exciting to come up

539
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.550
with like questions of things
that I don't know. It's

540
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.050
like, to me, it's exciting
to learn new things, right?

541
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.480
Like it's not exciting to
say that like, Oh, I

542
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.150
know everything already. Cause like
that's not true. And also

543
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.550
it's pretty boring. Like if
I knew everything in programming,

544
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.120
I would probably quit. Like,
I don't know. It sounds

545
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.980
awful. I would much rather
be learning new things. And

546
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:07.660
so like, I think the
idea that it's like even

547
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.990
desirable to know everything is
something that I don't believe.

548
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.860
And like, I mean sometimes
like maybe someone, a hacker

549
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.980
news, it would be like,
Oh, like, I can't believe

550
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.950
he didn't know like such
and such. That's your hacker

551
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:25.390
news accent, But it's just
kind of silly, right? Like,

552
00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.850
I mean, and like a
lot of people don't know

553
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.850
a lot of things and
like, it's like an exciting

554
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.070
opportunity to learn that thing.
Right. You're like, Oh great.

555
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.910
Today is today that today's
the day that I guess

556
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.090
lose that thing. And that's
fine. Exactly. And that's, that's

557
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.950
the way we all should
be. You know, we should

558
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.390
be positive that stuff. And
because not everyone has, like,

559
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.190
we may all have 10
or 15 years of experience,

560
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.190
but not everyone has the
same years. Yeah. We're doing

561
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.140
different stuff. What were you
doing before? You were an

562
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.790
infrastructure engineer. Okay. Machine learning.
Okay. I switched from machine

563
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.850
learning to doing infrastructure engineering
two years ago. Oh wow.

564
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.710
But like in like machine
learning is like the new

565
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.810
hotness that everyone's talking about.
So you're doing it before

566
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.390
it was the hotness. Well,
I don't know. I think

567
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.130
it was good because it
was also the hotness two

568
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.380
years ago. I don't know.
I don't have a sense

569
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.450
in my mind. Like when
machine learning started being amazing,

570
00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:18.350
Cool for a minute, My
bed, my bed. So you

571
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.810
also do a lot of
open source and you actually

572
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.690
took a sabbatical from work
to write a profiler. How

573
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.420
did you do that? Actually,
I sort of don't do

574
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.000
a lot of opensource. I
took a sabbatical from work

575
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.010
to do opensource for three
months, but the reason I

576
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.170
did that was that I
don't do open source. Am

577
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:37.130
I spare time at all?
Really? Yeah. Well I do

578
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.230
a lot of other like
writing in my spare time.

579
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.690
So if I also programmed
in my spare time, in

580
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.750
addition, it would, I think
it would not be healthy.

581
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.390
I think it would be
too much, but yeah. So

582
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.340
I have this profiler I
want to write and I

583
00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.150
was like, well, I wanna
do this programming project. And

584
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.610
it, realistically speaking, I'm not
going to do it in

585
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:56.660
my spare time. So I
applied for a fellowship and

586
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.820
they gave me the fellowship
and then I took three

587
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.240
months off work and wrote
this real violet. Wow. Was

588
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.660
that stressful? No, it was
great. That's a good sign.

589
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.060
Amazing. I must be. That's
something that only Canadians could

590
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.500
do because I don't know
if I could get healthcare

591
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.630
if I took three months
off work. Oh yeah. That's

592
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.230
true. I don't know about
that. I think so someone

593
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.430
asks you, they're like, Oh,
do you get health care

594
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:17.570
here? Your tobacco? And I
was like, I have no

595
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.900
idea. I didn't think about
that at all. Yeah. That's

596
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.670
what I got another whole
podcast right there. If it's

597
00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.380
like, Oh my goodness. A
three months sabbatical to work

598
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.060
on something I want to
work on. That would be

599
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.720
amazing. Yeah. Yeah. I just
asked my manager for permission.

600
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.810
I'm like six months. Oh
really? Okay. So you like

601
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.720
paused your job and came
back to the same job.

602
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.100
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's amazing.
That's amazing. So you made

603
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.620
a RB spy and people
can go and Google for

604
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.710
our Spire go to Arby's
by dot get hub.io. Have

605
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.860
other people gotten involved with
this profiler? Cause it it's

606
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.320
got lots of, lots of
forks and stars, but are

607
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.840
people using to and digging
it? People that are using

608
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.660
it. Yeah. They've told one
person left this really delightful

609
00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.660
comment, but maybe happy where
they said that they'd had

610
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.150
this like really bad performance
problem and the Ruby program.

611
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.730
And then they used our
baseline and then the, then

612
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.200
it was wrong right away.
And they fixed it and

613
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.750
their boss thought that they
were a genius, Which is

614
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.930
exactly like become a wizard
programmer. Like they've done an

615
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.090
exactly what you told them
they could do. Yeah. Which

616
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.310
is what you want. Right.
I feel like it's like,

617
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.980
it's exciting to build tools
to tell people like, it'd

618
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.730
be better and like make
them feel like, I don't

619
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.290
know, like I don't want
people to feel like they

620
00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.900
can do anything. Right. And
was it a, was it

621
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.180
a problem that had existed
before? Like was there, is

622
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.300
there just no good profiling
for Ruby right now Are

623
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.490
there is a good profiler,
but it doesn't work the

624
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.800
same way that Arby's fireworks.
So the way RVs fireworks

625
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.660
is you can just attach
it to any running Ruby

626
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.310
program, no matter what. And
the other profilers that already

627
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.110
existed, you need to just
kind of like edit your

628
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.230
program source code. And so
being able to just like

629
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.000
poke it something that's already
running and be like, Hey,

630
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.160
what are you doing? What
are some is something that

631
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.460
wasn't possible before. Cool. And
I understand that it's a

632
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.530
sampling profiler, so you can
actually run it like in

633
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:59.730
production without fear. Yeah, that's
right. That's pretty sweet. And

634
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.140
are you continuing work on
it or do you, have

635
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.060
you developed a community and
a team around it or

636
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.120
is it just you? It's
mostly, it's mostly just me.

637
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.180
I'm still working on it
a little bit. And I

638
00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.010
understand that you were trying
to do some flame graphs

639
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.830
as well. Like it, it
produces like information that you

640
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.080
can then use to go
and visualize. Yeah. Yeah. So

641
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.980
it produces visualizations by default,
which was an early important

642
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.430
design decision I made actually,
because I think like a

643
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.710
lot of profilers will require
you to do like extra

644
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.740
work, to get a visualization.
And I thought, well, that

645
00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.630
doesn't really work for people
because I think people who

646
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.990
are profiling usually like if
they're doing profiling, they probably

647
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.630
haven't done it for like
two years. Right. Like they've

648
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.520
just decided, okay, today is
the day that I'm going

649
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.870
to do profiling. And I
don't know how to do

650
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.660
this. What's going on. So
you really like want to

651
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.280
give them, like, you want
to make the experience as

652
00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.100
easy for them as possible
because profiling is something that

653
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.860
people do do something frequently.
Right. So I thought it

654
00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.410
was really important to create
the visualization by default. And

655
00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.910
people have said, they're like,
Oh wow. I didn't know

656
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:56.340
that you could make this
kind of visualization. And so

657
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.900
I think they wouldn't have
thought to go do it

658
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.870
themselves. Cause they didn't know
that it existed. Right. Yeah.

659
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:02.070
Like, and if you have
to go and do a

660
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.080
bunch of setup, just because
you want to ask like,

661
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.680
answer and ask a question,
then we won't bother doing

662
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.990
it. So the flame graph
comes out of the box.

663
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.590
Yeah. That's cool. Awesome. And
that you did that in

664
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.840
just a, in three months.
Had you been working out

665
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.450
before or did you do
it all like beginning to

666
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:22.080
end in three months I
built a prototype before, so

667
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.730
I kind of had an
idea that it was possible,

668
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.740
which is what kind of
gave you the confidence to

669
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.480
actually take three months off
work, to work on it.

670
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.820
Right. And did the, when
you did the grant, like,

671
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.080
do you have to then
go to the grant people

672
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.090
and say, look, I did
a thing. Yeah. I mean,

673
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.550
I said like, I think
I I've been blogging about

674
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.230
it. So they obviously knew
that I had been working

675
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.480
on it. And so I
think like at the end

676
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.560
I just sent them an
email and I was like,

677
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.300
Hey, I did the thing.
Can you send me the

678
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.930
money? It was, it was
pretty simple. They were there.

679
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.730
They were really great to
work with. That's that's really

680
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.370
cool. I didn't even realize
that one could like ask

681
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.110
for a grant and get
it and do something like

682
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.450
that. And that's inspirational to
know that you can do

683
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.930
that. Yeah. Yeah. The program
was called the segment opensource

684
00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.930
fellowship. There's this analytics company
called segment that ran it

685
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.560
So people can check out
your zenes. Should they just

686
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.170
go to JV and s.ca
or is there a better

687
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.170
homepage for your jeans? Yeah,
they can go there. Cool.

688
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.930
So you can just Google
for Julia Evans, jeans, your everywhere

689
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.540
and follow you on Twitter.
And you're kind of working

690
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.520
on comics all the time
and I follow you on

691
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.310
Twitter and see those things
go by and RB spy

692
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.670
of course is RB spider
github.io. Thanks so much for

693
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.740
chatting with me today. Thanks
so much for having me.

694
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.590
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

695
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.030
you again.
