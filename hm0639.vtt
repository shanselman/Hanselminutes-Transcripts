00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey folks, Intel is a
sponsor this week and I

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.690
welcome them because they're bringing
some high performance developer tools

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.590
for all of us. Check
out Intel's parallel studio X,

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.710
E I've talked about parallelism
before on the show and

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.340
the importance of using the
complete instruction set, unlocking the

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.380
power of the process or
that your code is running

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.110
on. Now, you all might
be writing C or C

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.590
plus plus Python or even
Fortran, but is your code

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.600
building in such a way
and written in such a

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.460
way that it uses the
latest techniques for vectorization multithreading

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.130
multi-node parallelization or memory optimization?
Intel parallel studio XE has

12
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.590

X E. Hi, this is

18
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.650
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes today.

19
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.110
I'm talking with Maurice cherry.
He's a designer and a

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.470
producer at glitchy fog Creek,
and he recently won the

21
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.830
Steven Heller prize for his
podcast revision path from the

22
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.140
AGA the American Institute of
graphic arts. How are you,

23
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.290
sir? Darn pretty good. Scott,
how are you? I'm doing

24
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.130
pretty well. I've known you
for a while and just

25
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.740
like my podcast, your podcast
has been chugging along for

26
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.430
a long time. You are
definitely been in the podcast

27
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.680
game for a while. You
have to almost 250 episodes

28
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.270
at this point. Yeah, we
are actually, I think factoring

29
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.730
in our bonus episodes. We
might be right at two

30
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.310
50, but we're getting up
there. We'll hit, we'll definitely

31
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.230
hit 250 regular episodes in
July. That's fantastic. Like I

32
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.690
know that having hit, you
know, I'm over 500 now,

33
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.420
basically every week is your
show weekly or biweekly. It's

34
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.720
weekly, weekly. So you've been
doing this now five years.

35
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.360
Plus there's so many podcasts
that are out there where

36
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.450
people get into it for,
you know, 11, 12, 15

37
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.660
episodes. They miss one and
then they miss another. And

38
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.000
then, you know what I
mean? Then their weekly show

39
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.310
is a monthly show. And
then it's like, it's just

40
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.620
sad. How did you stick
with it for so long

41
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.550
and, and, and not stop.
It really helps to have

42
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.040
a plan and a schedule.
The good thing with these

43
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.710
interviews is that I do
a lot of them ahead

44
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.470
of time. So I usually
try to put at least

45
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.680
maybe about a month between
the interview and when it

46
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.980
airs, which gives me more
than enough time to juggle

47
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.100
scheduling, to handle any sort
of editing issues or things

48
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.740
like that. And I've really
just been able to kind

49
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.520
of keep on that particular
path now for five years.

50
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.760
And you've been doing this
for a while. You switched

51
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.850
to weekly in April of
2013, are you producing all

52
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.200
of by yourself? No, no.
I do have an editor,

53
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.050
so that also helps my,
my editor, RJ is worth

54
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.000
his weight in gold and
he is the one that

55
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.360
sort of takes the raw
conversations that I end up

56
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.700
having. And he sort of
edits and shapes them into

57
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.970
something. Now I still produce
the episode every week. So

58
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.720
while he may handle the
actual interview part, I still

59
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.110
record every intro and outro
and every ad every week.

60
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.540
And I package the show
together and export it and

61
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.790
schedule it. Yeah, my editor,
Mandy, who is hopefully listening

62
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.220
to this right now, if
she's editing a is also

63
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.950
worth their weight in gold.
And so you won the

64
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.340
Steven Heller prize, which is
actually for cultural commentary and

65
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.310
you've also won awards, like
most inspiring design pockets. It's

66
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.000
a design podcast for about
and by designers, but it's

67
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.380
250 episodes and it is
black designers. So for someone

68
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.040
who says there aren't 250
black designers, it sounds to

69
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.660
me like you've still got
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

70
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.400
of shows to do beyond
this. You don't have any

71
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.790
trouble finding guests. Oh no,
there's no trouble with, with

72
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.000
finding guests. And I should
say it's mostly designed, does

73
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.010
that all designer? So I
say it's probably a good

74
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.200
mix of some designers, developers
and just overall creatives. I

75
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.970
mean, we've had presentation designers,
apparel designers, we've got software

76
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.060
engineers, we have design educators.
We've got a pretty good

77
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.040
cross section across, I think,
design and development in terms

78
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.230
of who we had on
the show. And it's of

79
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.790
course not just here in
the U S we've had

80
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.950
people throughout Europe, throughout Africa
through the Caribbean. I'm hoping

81
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.260
this year to get to
Asia and South America working

82
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.020
on that. So it's really
kind of a good mix

83
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.860
of what designers are doing
around the world. And are

84
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.130
you like me? My podcast
is a side thing. I

85
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.830
mean, I have a job.
This is still a side,

86
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.830
a side hustle, Actually. No,
it's part of my job

87
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.260
now. Seriously. How did you
hook that up? I need

88
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.590
to get that up. That's
cool. Shower. I don't know.

89
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.690
Well, fog Creek is, is
a, is a, is a

90
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.580
sponsor, but they're also gracious
enough for me to do

91
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.420
this right alongside my regular
work. So with that, you

92
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.430
know, we're also able to
kind of bring the revision

93
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.190
path audience along for things
that we're doing at fall

94
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.870
Creek, as it relates to
glitch, you know, if there

95
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.410
are certain campaigns that we're
doing or a certain, you

96
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.840
know, audience or segment that
we're trying to hit, then

97
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.970
the revision path audience is,
you know, kind of a

98
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.270
built in component of that.
That's great. And glitch, of

99
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.240
course, everyone's learning about and
hearing about glitch on Twitter

100
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.380
because you're CEO and Neil
dash is like the King

101
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.860
of Twitter right now, glitch
calm. It's a, it's a

102
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.440
friendly community where you build
the app of your dreams.

103
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.000
It's not code pen, but
it's also not an IDE

104
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.540
it's something else. Yeah. It's,
it's something else. All right.

105
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.390
I mean, what we're trying
to do with glitch has

106
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.880
really kind of opened up,
you know, design and development

107
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.200
for new audience. We want
to eliminate the barriers that,

108
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.390
you know, kind of prevent
people from wanting to learn

109
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.880
how to create on the
web. So you can either

110
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.730
create a brand new blank
project. You can remix any

111
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.220
of the projects that we
have on our website or

112
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.670
in any of our collections.
It's really open for people

113
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.290
to just explore and learn
and, you know, have a

114
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.250
good time on the web.
You know, we we've taken

115
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.970
out all the, you know,
kind of barriers and jerky

116
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.490
stuff that sort of prevents
people from wanting to learn

117
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.860
how to code or to
really get active on the

118
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.690
way we want to bring
the fun back. We want

119
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.900
to bring back that sort
of, you know, late nineties,

120
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.490
geo cities, angel, fire, tripod,
kind of fun with creation

121
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.350
on the web. Yeah, it's
interesting because it is clearly

122
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.410
designed in that it is,
it is thoughtful, right? It

123
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.050
doesn't look slapped together. It
has a design language, the

124
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.920
buttons, the hovers, everything is
clean, but it also has,

125
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.240
and I don't mean this
in any way in, in

126
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.840
a to insult it. It
has a, a nineties kind

127
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.540
of silliness or sloppiness almost
like I was looking at

128
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.040
a little, a little cat
popped up, you know, and

129
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.430
you don't really think of
a corporate site with little

130
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.650
cat in the corner, click
on the cat. And then

131
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.840
it talks about like, here's
some new stuff. And then

132
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.820
there's like a little dog
with this. And then there's

133
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.520
like, Oh, here's a animated
gift from no limit records.

134
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.450
Like it does. It is
both simultaneously well-designed and thoughtful,

135
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.620
but also silly in its
color scheme and its use

136
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.560
of animated gifts and stuff.
It's kind of got a

137
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.300
foot in both worlds. You
know what I mean? Yeah.

138
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.790
I think the kids these
days would call that aesthetic.

139
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.040
Is that the aesthetic is
that the glitches Imagine aesthetic

140
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.520
and like a, like a
model line font spaced out

141
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.260
people who are listed might
know what I'm talking about.

142
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.200
It's very, we do intentionally
make sure that we have

143
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.840
that kind of fun design.
So it becomes more approachable.

144
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.540
You know, I really want
to empower people to create.

145
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.200
And if it just looks
like some boring staid, IDE,

146
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.540
then people might not want
to want to use it.

147
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.330
Yeah, exactly. And this is
a great way to pick

148
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.470
up, you know, node programming,
JavaScript programming, whether it be

149
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.300
on the back end or
the front end and then

150
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.120
maybe graduate to a, a,
an IDE like visual studio

151
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.340
code at some point know
down the road when you've

152
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.520
learned what you want to
learn. Yeah. And, but the

153
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.530
way that we have set
up, you can even, you

154
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.930
know, export to get hub.
If you are more familiar

155
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.360
with GitHub or you want
to graduate to using, you

156
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.060
know, kind of a different
environment like that, you can

157
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.240
even do that. You can
import repos from GitHub just

158
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.210
to kind of play around
with and test out. It's

159
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.380
really flexible. It's really, really
flexible. What is this rewind

160
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.330
feature? I'm trying to understand
what I'm looking at is

161
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.120
this like source control, but
it's done like a DVR.

162
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.600
That's a, that's a good
point. So glittery wind is

163
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.270
a new feature that we
came out with not too

164
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.880
long ago because we just
came out of beta. And

165
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.820
what glittery wine does, is
it reinvents version control and

166
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.420
undo, you know, when you're
learning something or when you're

167
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.590
really kind of trying to
figure something out, we want

168
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.380
to put that confidence back
into coding. So with rewind,

169
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.440
you can undo any of
your mistakes at any time,

170
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.310
just by clicking the rewind
button and dragging the scrubber

171
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.310
across the timeline back to
a point or a state

172
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.030
in your code where things
were were better. Yeah. And

173
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.730
it's interesting because you know,
I've been, I've been running

174
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.320
around and trying to break
it, figure out what I

175
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.630
can do to break clips.
Cause you know, hackers always

176
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.270
kind of my fear and
I was moving too fast

177
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.710
maybe, and I got some
kind of an error and

178
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.890
it looks like you are
using get underneath. So you're

179
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.520
almost teaching them source control
without making them think about,

180
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.600
get that's right. That's pretty
slick. That's a really nice

181
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.420
way to get people up
to speed, but it's in

182
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.330
a safe place for lack
of a better word. Yeah.

183
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.580
It's a safe place. It's
very easy to share your

184
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.150
work. You can invite others
to, to work on a

185
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.550
project with you. And even
if you get stuck on

186
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.430
anything, there's also another new
feature that we have put

187
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.980
out. I think we're sort
of internally calling it hand

188
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.960
raise or at least that's
how I've heard it called

189
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.810
internally where you can highlight
a line that you might

190
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.510
be having a problem with
and a little icon will

191
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.610
appear next to it. And
you can click that and

192
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.640
get help from other members
of the glitch community, Right.

193
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.220
I'm inside of a server
dot JS right now. I

194
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.270
there's a line here that
says app express. I, if

195
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.960
I don't know what that
means, I can click next

196
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.300
to it. And then a
little person pops up. I

197
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.400
can click on it. It
says, ask for help from

198
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.340
the community. And it gives
me a URL. That means

199
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.470
the community could be with
English or it could be

200
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.180
on Twitter. And I could
say, Hey, what's this line

201
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.450
what's going on here? Yeah,
absolutely. This is cool though.

202
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.000
But I am fascinated to
understand how you're going to

203
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.710
make money off of it,
but it's certainly got people

204
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.140
excited. Well, you know, I
don't know if I'm, I'm

205
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.270
a really qualified to talk
about how we'll make money

206
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.300
off of it, but certainly
we've gotten people excited about

207
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.520
building on the web. Again,
that's really, I think our

208
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.700
primary goal right now. Exactly.
Well, it definitely feels like,

209
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.190
like the geo cities of
the past. And it's also

210
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.160
nice that the name of
your project becomes then the

211
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.930
sub domain. So I could
then pass, you know, you

212
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.940
know, food-bar.glitch.me off to someone
and put it in my

213
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.790
portfolio. So this could actually
allow someone to build a

214
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.250
project and then put it
out there and say, look,

215
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.800
I made this, stick it
in their LinkedIn or a

216
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.100
tweet about it. Yeah. That's
pretty slick. I'm digging it.

217
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.060
So you are working as
a content producer and a

218
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.990
designer, but I noticed when
we were setting up for

219
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.460
this podcast, you were running
windows. Is that, is that

220
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.460
weird? Do you feel like
out of sorts, I thought

221
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.980
you, I thought you required
as a designer, like to

222
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.640
run back. Oh Boy. Oh,
the dilemma of being a

223
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.440
windows only designer, I've been,
I've been wondering A windows

224
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.900
developer or windows designer feel
about that. I mean, so

225
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.990
I I've just always been
more comfortable with using windows.

226
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.470
I have used, you know,
max before. I mean, certainly

227
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.140
I think everyone of a
certain age has probably used

228
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.220
the Apple Toohey. And when
I was in high school,

229
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.180
we had like power max,
I think, or Macintoshes. But

230
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.190
once I got into college,
I just switched over to

231
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.310
windows. And at that was
that, I mean, for me,

232
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.370
it's just been a more
comfortable environment to work in.

233
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.010
I wish that there wasn't
this weird, stupid division that

234
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.550
I think parts of the
design community put up between

235
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.950
windows and Mac, as it
relates to the tools that

236
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.810
we use. I, I hate
that it's gotten divisive to

237
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.530
that point where Mac users
have these special design tools

238
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.960
that only they use that
they're trying to sort of

239
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.260
make industry standard, but they
can't become industry standard. If

240
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.960
windows users can't use them.
Yes. I'm talking about sketch.

241
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.520
I don't like that kind
of, sort of weird division

242
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.010
with, with kind of the
way the design tools are

243
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.590
right now. But I don't
think being a designer and

244
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.490
being on a Mac are,
are like, requirement's, you know,

245
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:53.590
I think it's that way
because perhaps I think it's

246
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.050
more of an, I use
that word aesthetic again. I

247
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.300
feel like it's another kind
of aesthetic choice. People think

248
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.080
that, you know, max just
look better. They, you know,

249
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.870
render the fonts better or
what have you, maybe the

250
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.690
tools are better, et cetera,
blah, blah, blah. But I

251
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.490
mean, at the end of
the day, you know, as

252
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.240
a designer, it's it doesn't
really it, the tools that

253
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.130
you use, I think are
not important. You know, if

254
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.530
you're on a Mac or
on windows, if you can

255
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.780
design, you can design. So
I don't like the fact

256
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.260
that the tools are kind
of furthering this weird separation

257
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.050
when it's, it's sort of
standing in the way of

258
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.460
having designers create. That's how
I feel. At least I

259
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.350
think the idea of the
aesthetic or the sense of

260
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.600
like I brought into this
ecosystem. Like, I mean, I'm

261
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.830
team iPhone because I, I,
I say we approve of

262
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.900
the aesthetic, but you know,
it just, it feels like

263
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.690
my space, it feels like
my place. And presumably you

264
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.030
use windows and I use
windows because we also feel

265
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.910
like that. But then you
feel like, well, but now

266
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.310
this tool I want to
use, isn't available to me

267
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.020
on this platform. So what
do you do when the

268
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.570
app you want is on
the other platform, but that

269
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.980
doesn't feel like home, You
know, I'm not all windows.

270
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.980
So like my main, my
main computer and my work

271
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.790
laptop are windows, but I
also have a iPad mini

272
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.380
that's mounted to my desk.
I'm looking at it right

273
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.380
now and I have iPad
pro. So there are some

274
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.900
things that I will still
kind of use the Mac

275
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.230
ecosystem for now. Granted, I
don't, I mean, I don't

276
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.390
think sketches of no, it's
not available for iPad pro.

277
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.100
So there are some things
that I still would not

278
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.800
be able to use because
there's a difference between, you

279
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.220
know, Mac iOS and iOS.
So I mean, tool wise,

280
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.710
I don't know. The only
issue I really run up

281
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.130
against is sketch. I found
that there are, there's always

282
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.010
going to be a crafty
developer that might create a

283
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.400
windows version of a Mac
only kind of tool hasn't

284
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.020
really happened with sketch it.
I guess you could call

285
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.990
Adobe XD that, but I
don't use that either. So

286
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.010
it's Are you like a
creative cloud person? I am

287
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.960
a creative cloud person. I
mostly these days in Photoshop,

288
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.250
illustrator, InDesign, and premiere, and
a little bit of after

289
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.530
effects and audition, of course,
for, for audio. Yeah, exactly.

290
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.170
Myself as well. I got
the, getting the creative cloud

291
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.210
subscription has been super useful.
I actually, I liked the

292
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.980
way that everything is moving
to subscriptions like this. I

293
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.810
know some people don't dig
it, but back in the

294
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.800
day I didn't have $500
to buy word or $500

295
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.350
by Photoshop, but I can
probably swing 1995 and yeah.

296
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.090
Yeah. And I mean, for
me, my job pays for

297
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:24.350
it. So that's even better.
Great work on your podcast.

being a, a windows developer.

315
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.970
You are a windows developer
in the fog Creek offices,

316
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.670
but you're still cool with
your choice. And it hasn't

317
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.800
been a huge problem with
this kind of, you know,

318
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:44.500
design monoculture. I mean, it
really hasn't because the work

319
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.410
that I'm doing is at
least the deliverables I can

320
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.600
do them easily in Photoshop.
I mean, there might be

321
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.780
an issue where maybe something
export it from sketch might

322
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.930
look a little wonky in
illustrator, but even then I

323
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.080
found a workaround because there
might be someone else on

324
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.570
the design team that has
Mac, so they can kind

325
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.940
of work with it. If
I can't now I don't

326
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.520
know what everyone else remotely
is using. There might be

327
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.520
some other remote windows users,
but certainly I think with

328
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.700
the design elements that we're
doing with fall Creek, we're

329
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:18.070
mostly Mac. And then I'm
the, I'm the outlier, These,

330
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.190
these new design sites that
are out there, like people

331
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.380
see my blog and they'll
try to steal the design

332
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.570
or they'll steal my CSS.
And that is what it

333
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.820
is. But the thing that
I'm noticing the most right

334
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.550
now online are these, these
design sites where I can

335
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.210
buy a theme for five
bucks. Don't make it difficult

336
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.400
when in the past you'd
have to pay a designer,

337
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.800
you know, for their hourly
wage or a, you know,

338
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.540
their time, $500 thousand dollars
or thousands of dollars for

339
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.400
a full site. What do
you feel about these, these

340
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.970
inexpensive logo sites and theme
sites and what that says

341
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.500
about design on the web
today? I mean, I think

342
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.610
that those marketplaces certainly have
a purpose. I think the

343
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.060
problem becomes, or I think
the problem happens when consumers

344
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:04.160
tend to think that equals
design. A lot of people

345
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.130
might think that these marketplaces
have kind of cheapened design

346
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.870
because of that. But if
anything, I think it's only

347
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.890
further commodity commoditized it to
the point where they will

348
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.770
go to a designer that
maybe doesn't ask something on

349
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.870
theme forest, but they think
that they're able to kind

350
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.770
of use these same types
of tactics and bargains. Like,

351
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.650
do you have discounts or
do you have packages or

352
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.350
things like that where most
designers, at least I know

353
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.870
independent ones will try to
come from a place of

354
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.660
value as opposed to just
a strict, you know, sort

355
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.830
of dollar amount. Like it
costs exactly this much. I

356
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.350
don't, I don't, I think
there's a place for them.

357
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.990
I mean, I've used them.
I'm not gonna lie. I've

358
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.200
definitely used them before, because
sometimes you just need that,

359
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.350
that $5 thing for something
really quick and dirty that

360
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.790
you need to just throw
it together and put it

361
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:54.470
up there. I mean, but
then it depends, I think

362
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.200
on what the value of
what, what the value is

363
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.650
that your, your in result
is going to be. So

364
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.810
if you're trying to put
up something, I don't know,

365
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.280
maybe if you're putting up
a blog or something that

366
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.800
you're not really making any
money off of. I mean,

367
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.740
yes, you probably should go
with a designer that can

368
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.650
make your custom thing, but
you may not even know

369
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.390
if you like the blog.
You may not even know

370
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.880
if this is something that
you continue. And so if

371
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.640
you put maybe a 40
to $50 investment into a

372
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.940
theme and it doesn't pan
out, you've only lost 40

373
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.580
or $50. You know, if
you go to a designer,

374
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.400
maybe it's a, it's a
different conversation of, you know,

375
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:33.020
thousands of dollars, perhaps different
tools and different kinds of

376
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.690
things that you buy, I
think are, are okay. I

377
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.120
mean, I've even flirted at
some point with putting little

378
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.990
templates or icon packs or
something up for sale, because

379
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.710
sometimes you just need that
one thing. You may not

380
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.770
need to always go to
a designer to get the

381
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.170
full package, but it depends
on what your project is.

382
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.070
You know, if you're a
multinational, you know, multimillion dollar

383
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.310
company, and you're only going
to theme forest or something

384
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.980
like that, that might be
an issue, you know, because

385
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.980
you certainly might have the,
the, the manpower or the

386
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.550
budget to hire someone or
to, you know, bring on

387
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.460
a designer to actually do
something more custom. But I

388
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.070
see. So you're saying that
these, these $5 themes are

389
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.330
making, you know, design and
presumably design of some quality

390
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.050
available to regular folks. Like,
you know, like myself and

391
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.630
the listeners, but then at
some point you have to

392
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.770
decide your corporate identity requires
a custom set up a

393
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.020
custom design, and it's time
to start paying someone some,

394
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.300
some money. And also, I
mean, you get what you

395
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.210
pay for. I mean, if
you pay for something, that's

396
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.910
$5. The other thing that
these marketplaces do is that

397
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.830
they really don't give you
that much of a preview

398
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.590
of what's under the hood.
You don't really know what

399
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.160
the documentation or the options
panels or anything look like

400
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.390
until you've purchased. I know
that I bought some things

401
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.630
and I've gotten the documentation
and everything and it's trash

402
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.510
and I can barely use
it, but I paid X

403
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.030
amount of dollars for it.
And oftentimes you can't get

404
00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.800
that money back. So he
can be a little bit

405
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.900
of a crapshoot, but you
get what you pay for.

406
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.290
Yeah, definitely. And I'm speaking
if we get what you

407
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.750
pay for, I'm starting to
be frustrated. As I see

408
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.290
people saying, give me some
design, I'll give you exposure.

409
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.110
How do you feel about
that? I mean, exposure is

410
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.550
for cameras. So not a
fan, Not a fan. I

411
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.530
mean, the thing with the
internet is that anyone can

412
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.590
have some level of exposure.
I don't, I don't buy

413
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.990
that whole. Oh, if you
do it for XYZ exposure

414
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.320
thing, I really hate when
that comes. Particularly from celebrities

415
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.080
who you would think would
know better. You know? I

416
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.640
mean, I think it's one
thing. If they feel like

417
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.770
you have to pay your
dues, but, but nah, I

418
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.990
don't, I don't buy that
Somehow. It seems like the

419
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.730
celebrities are good. Like they're
the ones that we think

420
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.080
have the most money, but
they're the ones that get

421
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.930
the most free stuff. Why
don't we get free stuff

422
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.870
for the people? I mean,
politicians do the same thing.

423
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.720
So it's kind of that
same, it's that same thing.

424
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.550
If they can get it
for free, they will. Yeah.

425
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.780
That's not cool. So, so
you've interviewed 150 plus designers,

426
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.680
developers, front end people. I
don't know about you, but

427
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.260
I've always struggled a little
bit with imposter syndrome. The

428
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.540
idea of feeling like a
phony. When you look at

429
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.820
that kind of like crush
of talented people that you've

430
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.950
had on the show, do
you think that all these

431
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.490
visible designers are giving other
designers a sense of imposter

432
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.470
syndrome? I mean, there's so
much great design on the

433
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:18.750
web right now. I think
sometimes, sometimes that can happen.

434
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.960
I know there are times
when I reach out to

435
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.500
people for the show and
they've seen that I've interviewed,

436
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:31.530
you know, Kristy Tillman or
Eddie APAR or, or, you

437
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.570
know, Sarah Hunter young or something
like that. They see that

438
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.420
I've interviewed these well known
designers and they'll say, Oh,

439
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.880
I'm not at that level
yet. Oh, I'm not there

440
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.400
yet. And oftentimes I have
to tell them, well, that's

441
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.380
the reason why I want
to talk to you. I

442
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.510
don't think it's the one
thing that I think I

443
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.370
really like about revision path
is that I've tried to

444
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:52.110
get people at all different
levels. I've got students, I've

445
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.170
got captains of industry. I've
got educators, I've got junior

446
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.770
designers, I've got senior designers.
I think it's more important

447
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.860
that they just tell their
story about where they're at,

448
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.050
because where you're at is
not where you're always going

449
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.590
to be. So even if
someone thinks that, Oh, I'm

450
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.510
not, I'm not good enough
to be on here or

451
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.030
whatever. I'll tell them if
I've reached out to you

452
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.560
to be on the show,
I feel like you have

453
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.310
something that's worth sharing. That's
cool. Hopefully they don't feel

454
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.930
that way. But I do
know that some do. I

455
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.630
mean, I certainly have gotten
pushback from folks that will

456
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.060
say, Oh, I don't know
if I'm, if I'm ready.

457
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.220
If I know that's, that's
the other thing, if they're

458
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.100
ready and I'm like, well,
there's never really going to

459
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.430
be a ready. You either
are gonna, I mean, you're

460
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.110
either going to do the
interview and that to the

461
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.670
interview, but they feel like
they have to get to

462
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.820
a certain point in their
career in order for people

463
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.390
to talk to them about
their work. And no, I

464
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.340
mean, you get to that
point by talking about what

465
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.210
you're doing step of the
way. So people know what

466
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.770
it is that you're doing.
So they see that you're

467
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.620
visible and you're out there
and you're working and you're

468
00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.640
hustling. If you're just staying
in the sidelines and grinding

469
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.370
and biggest, I was going
to notice you, that's probably

470
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.820
not going to happen. Yeah.
It really is a challenge

471
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.920
because people, you know, you
don't want to say fake

472
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.920
it till you make it
right. But you, but at

473
00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.450
the same time there Self,
self promotion with Promotion, like

474
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.320
it's okay to own your
awesomeness and be like, you

475
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.290
did something awesome and own
it. And that talking about,

476
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.700
Hey, I did a thing
and it makes me happy

477
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.050
and I did a good
job. I don't think that

478
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:24.520
necessarily is, is saying, you
know, look how slick I

479
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.850
am. Right. I hope it
doesn't. It really shouldn't. Yeah.

480
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.370
Yeah. I hope not. And
I've had similar issues trying

481
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.650
to get people on, on
my show. I had a

482
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:36.880
guest on recently who was
concerned. They couldn't fill the

483
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.770
half an hour and it
was pretty clear that I

484
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.200
could have talked to them
for 90 minutes or two

485
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.970
hours, or maybe that they
could have done it an

486
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.510
eight hour session, like an
entire workshop. There was such

487
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.730
a huge amount of information.
30 minutes goes by like

488
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:57.160
that. Yeah. When, what was
the environment like for designers

489
00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.490
online when you started revision
path tagging and five years

490
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:04.930
ago, six years ago, What
was the environment like, Like

491
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.200
online, were there a lot
of visible designers with designers,

492
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.150
personalities that you would go
and say, Oh yeah, I

493
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.550
know that name. I know
honey. I know Chrissy Tillman

494
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.610
or, or is that a
new thing? The star designer,

495
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.850
the visible designer? No, I
think the visible designer has

496
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.600
always been there because the
problem that design media has

497
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.150
is that they tend to
regurgitate the same seven or

498
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:29.380
eight dozen people out on
conferences and podcasts and things

499
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.990
like that. So there are,
there's always been that level

500
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.080
of visible designer. I think
the problem is that that

501
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.010
visible designer has always looked
one way. It's always been,

502
00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.550
you know, one certain type
of person. And so the,

503
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.950
the look of what a
designer could be or who

504
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.250
a designer could be, is
I think has drastically changed

505
00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.040
as I've started revision path.
I don't want to be

506
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.170
boastful and say that I've
really helped to change it

507
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.960
a lot. I think we
just said to own that

508
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.680
though. Didn't we just talk
about that? So, I mean,

509
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.170
I, I hope that, you
know, with all the people

510
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.670
that I've been able to
interview and get out there

511
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.700
that I've helped to change
those perceptions and certainly people

512
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.550
that I have interviewed for
the show have now gone

513
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.340
on and they're doing, you
know, really big and great,

514
00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.970
amazing things. So it's changing
that definition of what a

515
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.790
designer looks like and what
a designer can do and

516
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:23.020
who our designers should be.
That has definitely changed a

517
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.800
lot since I started revision
path. I'm curious if you

518
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.310
think, what do you think
that, that white folks or

519
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.460
non-black folks who are listening
and they hear that there

520
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.630
is a show that's all
about black designers and, you

521
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.130
know, talks to black designers
in front of developers. W

522
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.520
what do we, what do
we tell them about the

523
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.440
importance? Why, why a show
is needed? Like, what would,

524
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.080
what does race matter for
web design? I think it

525
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.960
matters because there's not just
one particular race of person

526
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.840
that's using the web. So
there are certainly is not

527
00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.590
more than one particular ways.
That's, that's building the web.

528
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.980
I mean, the web is
out there for everybody and

529
00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.630
you don't want to have
just, or you don't want

530
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.880
to at least showcase just
a certain type of designer,

531
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:12.320
designing things for a big
diverse global audience. You want

532
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.410
to show a diverse global
group of designers. That's doing

533
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.290
the same thing. I think
people will look at revision

534
00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.500
path and they'll see our
archives page. And they see

535
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.790
this wall of black faces.
And they might think that

536
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.850
as a monolith, but there's
a lot of diversity within

537
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:34.730
that monolith. There's young, old,
gay, straight trans in the

538
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.310
U S not in the
U S they're across all

539
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:42.170
different parts of the design
industry, summer developers, summer public

540
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:47.900
speakers, summer educators. Like there's
a huge swath of diversity

541
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.610
and what could be viewed
as just this sort of

542
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.790
monolithic set. And I can
tell, you know, for, I'd

543
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.890
say maybe 90% of the
people who I've had on

544
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.160
the show, it was their
very first interview. And it

545
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.440
was their very first time
anyone had ever really talked

546
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.890
to them seriously about their
work. And th and these

547
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.370
are people at all different
levels, not just, you know,

548
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.610
junior people starting out or
anything like that. This, this

549
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.220
is at all different levels.
It's the first time anyone's

550
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.160
ever really cared to talk
to them about what they

551
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.680
know and why they love
what they do and why

552
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.810
they're a designer, or why
they're an illustrator or anything

553
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.110
like that. So I think
that is what is really

554
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.540
important is that every designer
has a story to tell.

555
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.810
And I think it's important
to kind of hold the

556
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.810
mic and, and let them
tell that story. Yeah. I

557
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.990
really feel, I have always
Longfeld since I met you

558
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.990
many years ago, that I
felt a kinship with revision

559
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.330
path that I also feel
with, with, with, with the

560
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.480
show that we're on right
now, which is that there's

561
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.280
yeah. You have some famous
people on, and yeah, you

562
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.460
have some really accomplished people
on, but I love catching

563
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.030
people on the come up
and then going back and

564
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.950
saying, Hey, you know what
I had, so and so

565
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.100
on the show and folk
didn't know who that person

566
00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.170
was, and now look what
they're doing. You know, I'm

567
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:03.110
not saying I gave him
a stepping stool, but I,

568
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.760
you know, I gave him
a thumbs up. I gave

569
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.730
them an up vote when
I started, you know what

570
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.430
I mean? Well, you gave
them the mic. You gave

571
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.160
them a platform to at
least tell people what it

572
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.870
is they're doing, because there's
no telling who's going to

573
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.570
listen to the episode once
you've put it out there.

574
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.850
Yeah, exactly. Like I'm looking
back at my wall of

575
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.090
faces and I see Kimberly Bryant
from black girls code. I

576
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.510
had her on in 2012,
you know, wow. Six years

577
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.180
ago, you know, I there's
dozens and dozens and dozens

578
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.730
of great stories like that,
of fun people doing amazing

579
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:36.860
work and catching them while
they are already going to

580
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.080
become superstars, whether they're on
their, on our shows or

581
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.790
not. It's just so nice
to look back and say,

582
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:44.350
look at that, look at
that, that Corpus, that, that

583
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.350
wall of content that we
created and having made hundreds

584
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.860
of hours of audio has
gotta be really satisfying. Yeah.

585
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.770
And I mean, even for
them, like, I know we've

586
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.990
had a couple of repeat
guests that have come back

587
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.150
and just, you know, have
said like, this is what

588
00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.650
I've been up to. This
is what I've been working

589
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.710
on since the show. And
they're like, they really love

590
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.330
that revision path is giving
this voice for black designers

591
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.450
and developers and creatives to
really tell their story about

592
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.300
what's going on, because they
may not get approached by

593
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.220
any other design media to
tell it, they may just

594
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.440
have to say it on
Twitter. They may have to

595
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.350
be their own cheerleader. And
then that way revision path

596
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.210
kind of, you know, as
a megaphone for the work

597
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.880
that they're doing. Yeah. I
also liked the term that

598
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.150
you used before when you
said monoculture, because you're, you're

599
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.700
saying it's important to show
people that there's lots of

600
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.280
different folks out there doing
amazing work. And I, I

601
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.490
like that. You, it's not
just, Hey, look, black developers,

602
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:40.720
black designers, there's a spectrum
within any subgroup of people.

603
00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.680
But it's interesting to see
techies complain about things like

604
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.040
browser monoculture. You hear that
a lot amongst designers like,

605
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.010
well, we shouldn't have to,
to Chrome. So, so we're

606
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.670
upset about there being just
one browser, but we're not

607
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.740
upset about there being just
one kind of designer or

608
00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.040
one flavor of developer. That's
interesting, isn't it? It is.

609
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.070
So I think that if
we, as techies, no matter

610
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.260
what color we are or
what our background is, can

611
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.340
agree that lots of different
kinds of technology are no,

612
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.440
there's not just one language.
There's not just one browser.

613
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.970
There's not just one render,
or there's not just one

614
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.500
design that seems uncontroversial. We
should apply that to our

615
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.110
lives as well. And the
more kind of mixed up

616
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.330
our group is our friends
are, and our designers are

617
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.980
the better. The web is
going to be for everybody.

618
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.790
I agree. Yeah. I dig
it so people can check

619
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:33.760
you out@revisionpath.com and you are
on basically every podcast app

620
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.820
network site that anyone could
possibly find, which I need

621
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.950
you to up my game,
because some of these you're

622
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:43.330
on SoundCloud, you're on overcast
or everywhere, and we're on

623
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.450
Twitter and Facebook and Instagram,
just search for revision path.

624
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.670
Very cool. Well, thanks so
much for chatting with me

625
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.220
today, Scott, thank you so
much for having me on

626
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.860
the show. I really appreciate
it. This has been another

627
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.530
episode of Hansel minutes and
we'll see you again next

628
00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:16.960
week. <inaudible>.
