Hey friends. I want to
thank our sponsor. Reagan, are

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.490
you struggling to replicate the
bugs and performance issues that

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.730
your customers are reporting? Plug
Reagan into your web and

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.390
mobile applications right now, and
diagnose problems in minutes rather

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.720
than hours. Kiss goodbye. Having
to dig through log files

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.350
and relying on frustrated users
to report issues, make your

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.040
software development life so much
easier. Using Reagan's error, crash,

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.150
and performance monitoring tools. Every
software team can create flawless

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.540
software experiences for their customers
with Reagan cry it free

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:49.130
today@raygun.com. That's our a Y
G U n.com. <inaudible>. Hi,

11
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.350
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is an episode of Hansel

12
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.170
minutes today. I'm talking with
dr. Muriel Reese. He's a

13
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.450
clinical psychologist from Silverdale, Washington.
I'm great. Thank you. You

14
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.000
have got a great podcast
called brain science@achangelog.com slash brain

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.270
science, and I've without realizing
it, I've been talking to

16
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.540
a number of people in
the kind of clinical psychology

17
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.560
space, thinking about burnout and
depression and anxiety. I don't

18
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.120
feel like I have any
of those things, but it

19
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.660
is significant that without realizing
it, people are showing up

20
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.820
in my life in this
space. So I'm really excited

21
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.040
to talk to you today.
Thank you. I'm excited to

22
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.950
share this because you know,
brain science and really our

23
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.280
hope for the podcast is
really not just what we

24
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.670
know about the brain, but
how, what we know about

25
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.480
the brain can affect how
we do our lives and

26
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.260
ourselves. And so it's all
about utility. And I think

27
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.420
we're in a world where
we're all under a microscope

28
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.120
because so many people are
on social media, but then

29
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.980
also we have so much
data. And I think a

30
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.890
lot of us are overwhelmed
with data. Whether that data

31
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.260
be emails that I'm not
going to read, or, you

32
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.240
know, people that are coming
into my life, I guess

33
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.230
their data as well. Amen.
Yeah, it is all these

34
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.470
things. Like we, we take
in information through our senses

35
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.710
and our brain is always
trying to make sense of

36
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.400
it. It's interesting because, you
know, I always say it's

37
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.980
not the eyes that see
or the ears that hear,

38
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.380
but how our brain puts
that puzzle together. Hmm. That's

39
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.720
very interesting. And as we
are in a situation where,

40
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.920
you know, facts themselves are
unclear, as things are coming

41
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.110
at us and we all
interpret us to interpret them

42
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.050
differently, everything is up for
interpretation. Now there's this, this

43
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.320
is article that I was
reading on the New York times.

44
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.120
And I'll put it in
the show notes that is

45
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.750
talking about Instagram and social
media primarily focuses on women

46
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.500
and how they feel about
social media. But it's about

47
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.100
being real. How can we
be ourselves when we are

48
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.560
observed? I think is the
essence of the, of the

49
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.700
question. Well, yes. And part
of that is that how

50
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.430
other people see you and
how you see yourself aren't

51
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.140
necessarily the same and I'm
not ever in charge of

52
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.340
anybody else's perception. You know,
it was interesting having children.

53
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.550
I always get the opportunity
to expose, expose myself to

54
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.580
things I hadn't planned on.
And one of those things

55
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.720
recently was actually an experience
with VR. So my go

56
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.270
to my son's friend's birthday
party, and I had an

57
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.470
opportunity to do this game,
so to speak where I

58
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.360
did this elevator experience. So
I go up the elevator

59
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.700
and then there's a plank
when the door opens that

60
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.060
I can walk off of.
And so I'm going up

61
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.100
and I'm taking in all
the data, which is like

62
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.550
the beautiful elevator music and
you know, the buttons on

63
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.010
the elevator and the doors
open and here's skyscrapers and

64
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.130
sky and birds. And so
knowing what I know about

65
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.130
the brain, and I know
I'm standing on the ground,

66
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.130
but yet my eyes, my
visual system is taking in

67
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.370
this data that is alternative
to other data points. I

68
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.200
know. And so I literally
got down and actually touched

69
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.690
the ground beside the plank.
Yeah. But I had to

70
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.290
take in additional information in
order to tell my brain

71
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.380
that what I was seeing,
wasn't actually legitimate. Oh, I

72
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.960
took my sons to one
of these called tree to

73
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.630
tree, the situations where they
link you up on a

74
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.580
tree and you're like a
hundred feet up on a

75
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.790
ridiculous tree in the middle
of a forest. And you're,

76
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.060
you're, you're very much, belayed
your LinkedIn, like, there's no

77
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.210
chance that you're going to
fall and die. Right. And

78
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.310
they're like, yeah, walk between
this tree and that tree.

79
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.730
And it's like on a
rope or a single string

80
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.820
or a piece of fishing
line. And I watched my

81
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.860
kids just say, Oh, so
you're telling me that this

82
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.720
won't kill me. And then
they like yank on it

83
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.150
twice and they go, okay,
I believe you. And then

84
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.350
they just go and they
go running. I was like,

85
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.730
Oh, I had never felt
I got a headache that

86
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.490
I'd never seen before. It
was almost like the lizard

87
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.520
part of my brain that
has spent near 50 years

88
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.730
trying to keep me from
dying. It's not shut off.

89
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.440
Yeah, you're exactly right. And
that's so much so when

90
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.940
we're faced with some of
these alternative data points, imagine

91
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.580
that we have these different
aspects of our brain that

92
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.850
come into play and what
we're really trying to manage

93
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.820
so much of the time
is how not to die.

94
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.890
Like our brain is right.
Our brain is always first

95
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.620
and foremost, its primary gig
is trying to keep us

96
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.280
alive. And so when we're
activated in that place of

97
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.430
threat, whether it's on social
media or up in a

98
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.270
tree, we tend to see
far and we see narrow.

99
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.740
So there could be a
rope beside me, or there

100
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.710
could be some other life
preserver. However, my brain is

101
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.860
an app to see it
because the way in which

102
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.440
my brain is wired, if
there's a saber tooth tiger,

103
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.890
I need to see it
from far away. I don't

104
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.900
need to take in all
of the data. I need

105
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.830
to, to narrow my focus
and see what's essential As

106
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.110
I struggle too, as I
struggled to raise these, these

107
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300
children, I keep wanting to
encourage them to look at

108
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.450
the long game, like think
about after high school and

109
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.520
think about after college and
think about when you're 30

110
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.750
and they literally can't think
past Tuesday. Yeah. But at

111
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.430
the same time, the older
I get the farther in

112
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.560
the future that I see
and that, and most of

113
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.130
my goals and goal setting
are all set out in

114
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.350
the future long range as
well. I didn't realize that

115
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.700
my focus has changed. Yeah.
Well, part of that is

116
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.060
the development of the frontal
lobe. So frontal lobe right

117
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.660
there in the foremost frontal
part of your head right

118
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.480
behind your skull is this
part of our brain. That's

119
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.380
responsible for what we call
executive function. And so if

120
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.280
you think of everything that
an executive assistant does, so

121
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.580
they're looking at part to
whole relationships like now and

122
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.180
later it's how fast you
process information. It's how you

123
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.200
problem solve. It's how you,
you know, shift between two

124
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.260
different things in terms of
attention. And the thing is,

125
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.200
is that doesn't begin to
really come online more until

126
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.360
adolescence and it isn't fully
cooked. So to speak until

127
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.750
like mid twenties for women,
and usually later twenties for

128
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.370
boys, for men Or mid
forties, depending on who you

129
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.090
ask. Well, and the other
fascinating thing about this is

130
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.150
that dopamine, which is our
feel good neurotransmitter. It's like,

131
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.700
anytime we do something that
feels good, you can say,

132
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.660
thank you, dopamine. This works
the same in adolescents that

133
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.620
it does in adults, but
yet you don't have that

134
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.650
braking system that impulse control
that part of the frontal

135
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.560
lobe is responsible for until
later in life. So it's

136
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.660
like, Oh, that sounds fun.
Let's just go ahead and

137
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.280
try it. Yay. Okay. So
this explains why all of

138
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.130
the don't eat that candy
you'll rot, your teeth messaging

139
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.420
is being lost on my
people. Amen. Yeah. They just

140
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.000
don't care. And really, you
know, we talk about this

141
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.500
in some of our episodes
about forming habits that our

142
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.890
brains don't really care about
what is going to happen

143
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.830
long range, because part of
what you're doing, Scott is

144
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.070
holding both intention and that
I need to do what

145
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.310
feels good now, but also
that's going to benefit me

146
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.390
in the future. And so
I will, yeah, I will

147
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.720
embrace to some degree the
suck of whatever I'm doing,

148
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.300
because I know it's going
to pay off Well. And

149
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.880
I'm also older because I
remember all of the suck

150
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.430
and I know that a
little bit of suck now

151
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.610
can make a lot more
comfort later. So I'm able

152
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.200
to make trade offs across
time. Yeah. And so this

153
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.440
is really important when it
comes to learning and that

154
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.440
what I really work hard
with both patients and my

155
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.620
children is I reinforce their
effort and the frustration tolerance

156
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.700
with the effort so that
I'm not so fixated on

157
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.700
an outcome, because like we
talked about earlier that outcome

158
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.350
I'm trying to manage threat
or the possibility of future

159
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.500
threat, they don't really care.
Okay. So if you're, if

160
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.020
we, if we pivot a
little bit, hopefully not awkwardly.

161
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.200
And we think about developers
and techies and it, people

162
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.430
there is an amount of
willpower, but there's an amount

163
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.100
of mental exercise. I think
that is required perhaps in

164
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.890
the developer or the technical
person's brain that maybe isn't

165
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.020
as much in other jobs.
I mean, every job you're

166
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.060
always learning, but one of
the things we talk about

167
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.210
when we think about programmers
and techies is the absolute

168
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.410
requirement that you always learn
less, you get into obsolescence

169
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.340
must faster than if you
were in another job. Right.

170
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.250
But so that is challenging.
So I'd say that requires

171
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.430
a high degree of cognitive
load and you're doing a

172
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.180
lot of frontal lobe functions.
So in the same way,

173
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.090
you could like drive somewhere,
drive a long distance and

174
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.160
you might be incredibly fatigued
by the end of the

175
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.980
day, but you didn't really
do a lot of activity

176
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.570
it's because you had attention
and you were still utilizing

177
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.650
motor systems, you know, memory
systems like your brain was

178
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.010
fully frontal. Is that why
we put so much after

179
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.900
these long days? It's a
different kind of hurt though.

180
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.910
My, my wife is a
nurse and she comes home

181
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.240
and physically hurts. Cause she's
standing all day and I

182
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.790
come home and I'm just
a useless mess because I've

183
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.870
been, I dunno, head forward
all this time. Yeah. And

184
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.870
you're utilizing. So even the
way in which like memory

185
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.350
works like you guys and
attention, which is a sort

186
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.440
of all in one gig,
we need attention in order

187
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.220
to have memory, but you
guys are holding different things,

188
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:34.070
conceptually simultaneously and shifting, set,
shifting between them over and

189
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.160
over and over again, and
then having to problem solve.

190
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.650
So going, how does this
data point relate to that

191
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.020
data point? How does this
system work and how can

192
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.520
I translate this information? So
just like a physical muscle

193
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.600
under tension is going to
give out. So it will

194
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.150
with our brains. Can I
use this information now to

195
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.940
make things better? Is this
simply a matter of knowing

196
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.920
that this is a thing
now can make me have

197
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.900
more control of it? Yeah,
exactly. So thinking about it,

198
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.710
I think it was recently,
you had dr. Simon's on

199
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.540
and talking about the concept
of burnout with managing resources.

200
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.300
And so I know this
and we're trained in this

201
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.200
as psychologists around. I know
that what I'm using in

202
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.770
all of my work with
my patients is myself. Furthermore,

203
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.530
I'm taking on a lot
of energy because I'm dealing

204
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.410
with emotions that people either
are aware of or are

205
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.580
not aware of. And so
I make decisions all the

206
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.660
time around an allocation of
my energy. And I would

207
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.970
say that it really shifted
one when I had one

208
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.260
child, but definitely felt it
when I had to, because

209
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.880
I was sharing my resources,
my mental energy with more

210
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.620
than just myself and my
husband, that is why caregivers

211
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.470
burnout So much is that
they're chopping off pieces of

212
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.630
energy and giving it to
someone else and forgetting that

213
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.430
it has to be replenished.
Exactly. And so I'll even

214
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.890
make decisions around different work
demands so that I allocate

215
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.610
energy according to the greatest
priority or the hardest thing.

216
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.880
Like I learned really early
on to always start with

217
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.880
the hardest thing. And that
might be the thing that

218
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.950
like takes the most amount
of cognitive bandwidth, but it

219
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.410
could also be the thing
that I am most adversive

220
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.640
to. And that is maturity
and frontal lobe, you know,

221
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.150
like executive function, because last
night at 10 30 at

222
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.790
night, my 12 year old
said that they have a

223
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.510
paper due and due in
90 minutes. And I was

224
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.100
just like, you could have
been doing this at any

225
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.120
time in the last three
weeks that what you were

226
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.080
able to do, because you're
a grown, they were not

227
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.970
able to do yesterday. Yeah,
yeah. But so all of

228
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.540
this sort of planning and
allocating and recognizing too that

229
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.840
in different seasons of life,
or like, be it, you

230
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.620
have aging parents or somebody
else with health issues, like

231
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:06.630
if I'm remembering correctly, your
wife battled cancer. And I'm

232
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.470
certain that during that season
of time that your energy

233
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.990
was different than what it
is today when she's not

234
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.500
ill. Yeah, Absolutely. And in
fact, five years later, the

235
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.310
echoes remain and the side
effects remain. So those moments

236
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.370
of, of energy go up
and down based on how

237
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.150
we are all feeling that
particular day. Right. And so

238
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.540
I always talk about this
cause I don't want people

239
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.300
like knowing doesn't help me
do myself any better. So

240
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.070
just the pure knowledge doesn't
change anything. But acknowledging that,

241
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.840
say this task or, you
know, certain thing I'm trying

242
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.020
to develop app I'm working
on is hard for me

243
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.570
or more challenging. Then I'm
going to identify an action.

244
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.180
So I want to acknowledge
and then act. So I'm

245
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.030
going to sort of write
my own prescription over what

246
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.000
I could do differently. Like
I would offer from my

247
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.550
understanding that with your wife,
you guys journaled like during

248
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.460
that whole time. And so
you really operated by this

249
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.000
name it, or name it
to tame it principle so

250
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.610
that the more that you
could articulate or put words

251
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.060
to the experience, it was
as though you were creating

252
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.260
your own Dewey decimal system
of it. So it defragged

253
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.560
all of that mental energy
because you knew where to

254
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.040
put it. That is true
though. Like you say, name

255
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.680
it to tame it. Sometimes
in software engineering, we say

256
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.900
name it and claim it.
When we talk about naming

257
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.910
objects, the idea of naming
something has power. If you

258
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:40.170
have a, an under an
undiagnosed disease, it is extremely

259
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.080
difficult, but once you get
a name for it, it

260
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.750
still sucks. It just sucks
measurably differently. Correct. Because you

261
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.280
then can look at what
can I do while this

262
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.580
is the case. And so
that's what I would say

263
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.640
when you're talking about sort
of managing cognitive load of

264
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.440
going while this particular thing
is challenging. I'm going to

265
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.220
reallocate my energy accordingly Because
this could be a bad

266
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.550
thing. I feel like that
when, you know, a very

267
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.640
long time ago, there were,
you know, there were fewer

268
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.050
peanut allergies, there were fewer
anxiety and ADHD diagnoses. I'm

269
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.570
sure all of those things
existed except the name didn't

270
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.560
exist when we start naming
something, whether it be clinically

271
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.990
or otherwise, it, it can
give a lot of people

272
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.030
power, but could it, it
can also give people even

273
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.090
more anxiety because they can
name something and claim it

274
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:34.780
for themselves, but it might
not be theirs Well, so

275
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.020
this is the other thing,
you know, where attention goes,

276
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.880
energy flows. So the more
that I focus on something,

277
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:47.710
I'm, I'm feeding my attention
towards that. So it doesn't

278
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.130
help me just focus on
a challenge. And like this

279
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.010
sucks, this sucks, or this
is hard and yes, this

280
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.030
is why I'm struggling. But
rather, what else can I

281
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:02.230
do as to buffer that,
That sounds like the clinical

282
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.220
version of like, don't worry
about the haters. Well, it's

283
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.170
going, what do I do
with them? Like how would

284
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.820
I approach it? Would I
be like, you know what?

285
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.430
I'm going to look at
all of the messages and

286
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.590
I'm going to spend 15
minutes and just like go

287
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.800
all in. We would call
this flooding in terms of

288
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.710
exposure therapy. I'm just going
to flood myself with all

289
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.620
of the junk. I don't
want to hear. And then

290
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.480
I'm going to go do
something that actually feels really

291
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.440
good Folks. I'm taking this
episode to advertise for other

292
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.430
podcasts. If you enjoy stories
about the people behind the

293
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.040
technology that we use, you
should check out the greater

294
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.760
than code podcast. They focus
on the human side of

295
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.840
software development with stories of
diversity and inclusion, accessibility from

296
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.080
people that you don't normally
hear from search for greater

297
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.980
than code in your favorite
podcast app, or check out

298
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.690
greater than code.com. You know,
that's really interesting. So it's

299
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.210
so funny to hear like
the kind of more official

300
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.460
or more, you know, like
what a clinical psychologist like

301
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.580
yourself knows to be true
because research shows it and

302
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.670
experience shows it in many
years, show it versus a

303
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.630
parental wisdom, which is oftentimes
made up. But one of

304
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.030
the greatest tips that my
mom ever gave me, and

305
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.830
I've said this in talks
before, and I'll say it

306
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.590
now is, Oh, wow. You
know, you, you feel bad,

307
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.200
don't you? Yeah. I feel
bad, mom. Well, put a

308
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.870
time limit on it. Pick
a time, pick a time.

309
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.760
It could be 15 minutes.
It could be six weeks,

310
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.910
but pick a time, set
a timer, feel as bad

311
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.420
as you can and then
stop. And she was basically

312
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.670
doing flooding. She's like, yeah,
sit here and cry. And

313
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.530
like, you got an F
on that test. It sucks

314
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.200
that doesn't work for everything,
but it has been one

315
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.680
of the number one tips
for me is just flood.

316
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.320
No, it accept it, let
it wash over you and

317
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.470
then move onto the next
thing. Yeah. And this is

318
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.680
at the heart of what
it means. Like even all

319
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.410
of the different things we're
talking about with like anxiety

320
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.560
and willpower. And that really,
what I want to do

321
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.270
is cultivate resiliency so that
when I get knocked down,

322
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.110
I can learn how to
get back up. Because oftentimes

323
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.720
what happens such as in
the case with anxiety or

324
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.070
phobias, I will have an
experience that feels incredibly abrasive

325
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:15.900
and deleterious to myself. And
so then I'll practice avoiding

326
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.480
that, that thing that was
unpleasant. However, what, by doing

327
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.640
that, I forfeit the data
because I think it's actually

328
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.980
going to help me, but
I forfeit finding out that

329
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.600
I could feel differently by
exposing myself to it. Interesting.

330
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.840
So we are in a
world where we have a

331
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.200
very, very often, very appropriately
trigger warnings for content and

332
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.510
things like that, which are
very much a place where

333
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.240
someone needs to protect themselves
from something that could be

334
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.260
sincerely damaging. But then I
hear people using the term

335
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.640
anxiety, or I feel anxious
when I maybe wouldn't use

336
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.960
that word. Like if you
were going to give a

337
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.700
big presentation, how would you
know when that's dangerous data

338
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.810
or when it's actually potentially
positive? Well, so this is

339
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.380
part of even that decision
making and identifying in the

340
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.800
experience and going, I wouldn't
call it anxiety because anxiety

341
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.160
usually involves a sense of
threat. But, and while that

342
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.660
might be threatening to you,
if I'm going to give

343
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.150
a presentation, right. Cause I
don't know what people are

344
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.090
going to actually hear versus
what I actually said, because

345
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.560
that doesn't always go together,
right? Because everybody's got a

346
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.700
different filter and way in
which they put together pieces

347
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.480
of information. And so I
would look at, is there

348
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:38.420
asking myself, is there an
actually an identifiable threat? Because

349
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.120
if my brain's job is
always to try to keep

350
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.580
me alive, of course, it's
going to signal to me

351
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:48.290
that I need to heed
some warning, but in the

352
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.840
same way that monopoly money
won't work the same as

353
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.380
regular money, I need to
be able to differentiate and

354
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.070
sort of categorize anxiety as
it relates to something that's

355
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.400
going to move me in
a direction of growth versus

356
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.350
one, that's going to move
me in direction of threat.

357
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.810
I love that monopoly money
idea. I just, I have

358
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.630
this image of like, like,
you know, I'm, I'm super

359
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.360
anxious, I'm very anxious. I'm
having an anxiety attack, but

360
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.940
it's a monopoly money, anxiety
tag, right. And it's, it's,

361
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.610
it's bad. Like it hurts
in the moment, but ultimately

362
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.190
it's not going to change.
So you're saying that a

363
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.880
positive anxiety can be a
fuel that one can tap

364
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.980
into not to disparage or
discount. Anyone's legitimate threat based

365
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.520
anxiety, but positive anxiety is
really the anticipation of something

366
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.110
that may not be as
threatening as we think it

367
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.700
is. Right. And that's not
to say like, it's, it's

368
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.730
interesting. Cause a lot of
what people tend to be

369
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:44.570
afraid of or fearful of
for the future, it's something

370
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:49.080
that's already happened to them.
How do you mean In

371
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.950
the sense that I've already
encoded that data? And so

372
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.590
my brain knows that that's
threatening because once upon a

373
00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:00.570
time it was, But maybe
it's not now today. Right?

374
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:04.290
So imagine I'm deconditioning my
brain around something that did

375
00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.920
happen in the past, but
is not actively occurring. Okay.

376
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.430
So analogy, time or direct
experience analogy. So I've been

377
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:15.480
recently taking TaeKwonDo and it's
something that I've learned that

378
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.000
I should have done 20
years ago. And I just

379
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.960
now discovered this sport and
I did a tournament and

380
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.510
I'm in the tournament. I
got, you know, somewhat hurt,

381
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.750
like, you know, bust your
toe hurt kind of hurt,

382
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.740
but not, not legitimately hurt.
And I was really on

383
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.560
full speed, like the same
headache that I got when

384
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.570
I was trying to climb
those trees, which was like,

385
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.560
I'm going to freaking die.
But then I did my

386
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.430
second tournament and I went
into it completely different. I

387
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.930
just realized that this other
middle aged older man who

388
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.540
is also taking TaeKwonDo, but
just lives in a different

389
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.140
neighborhood is not legitimately trying
to kill me with his

390
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.780
feet. It sounds silly. But
I was like, I'm going

391
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.500
to get my beat. And,
and I didn't. And I

392
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.260
was like, okay, well this
is another fat guy from,

393
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.420
from the other side of
town. And when I went

394
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.160
into it with this idea
that, yeah, I probably get

395
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.020
hurt. I might get a
bruiser too. And I did,

396
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.320
but this person was not
trying to kill me. And

397
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.490
it completely changed how I
looked at the thing. Yes,

398
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.130
yes. This is so huge
because you're no, it, it

399
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.500
is your brain is firing.
Like it's so crazy. So

400
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.010
research is, I find I'm
fascinated by. And so somebody

401
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.210
thought of doing a research
study around building thumb strength.

402
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.170
Okay. And they looked at
whether or not you actually

403
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.400
build, strengthen your thumb by
picturing it or doing it

404
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.630
because a lot of athletes
use visualization as a method

405
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.500
for training. And what was
fascinating is, is that people

406
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.590
actually cultivated strength in their
thumb. I'll be at not

407
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.290
to the same degree, but
strengthen on the last, by

408
00:22:55.290 --> 00:23:00.810
simply picturing it because neurons
that fire together wire together.

409
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.240
So the more that I
think of thought, the more

410
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.780
that I practice seeing things
a certain way, I'm building

411
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.150
a network in my brain
that says, this is the

412
00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.460
way to work. We go,
Well, then we need to

413
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.920
understand why I don't have
a six pack because I

414
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.530
have been thinking about it
for quite a few decades,

415
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.460
but it's not working that
way. Yes. But how much

416
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.370
activity are you doing? Thinking
about it? If I got

417
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.470
credit for every time I
thought about working out, I

418
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.220
would be amazing at this
point, but Right. But you

419
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.950
had the live event and
so you actually had the

420
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.490
emotional experience with the thoughts.
And so it was far

421
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.220
more comprehensive. I see. Okay.
So that is the different

422
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.780
story sitting down and visualizing
my TaeKwonDo practice does fire

423
00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.920
certain neurons. It doesn't do
the complete package. It's the

424
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.640
virtual reality version of actually
doing it. One is more,

425
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.370
more inclusive and more complete.
Right? And so part of

426
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.710
what I, what I would
offer in these situations, when

427
00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:00.370
you have anxiety in doing
a job or with people,

428
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.610
is that you imagine using
more of your whole brain,

429
00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.300
that we want all access
to all of your brain.

430
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.100
And so when you're activated
or perceiving a sense of

431
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.580
threat, you're spot on in
saying it was more like

432
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.970
your reptilian brain at play.
And look, I can have

433
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.760
super long conversations with lizards
about what they should do

434
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.700
and how they should act,
but they don't really care.

435
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.000
Yeah. Their scope, their scope
of, of goals. They're planning,

436
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.920
their future looking is all
limited. No, exactly. If I

437
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.620
am an alligator and I
see a baby, I'm not

438
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.480
going to reason it out
and think I shouldn't eat

439
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.400
a baby because I think
they're going to hurt Really

440
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.080
dark. This may be the
first time that that ever

441
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.350
came up on the show
and all these episodes, which,

442
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.630
which actually brings me to
another interesting question. When we

443
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:50.260
think about being a programmer
or being a techie, I

444
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.330
was, I was working with
my mentorship group. I've got

445
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.790
some young people that I
mentor. And one of them

446
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.430
said, there's a lot more
squishy bits than I thought

447
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:59.290
that would be like, what
do you mean by squishy

448
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.310
bits? So I was like,
well, I thought I was

449
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.440
going to be here to
do deep analysis. And I

450
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.560
would be like, my technical
ability would be challenged for

451
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.360
the next 30 years. And
that would be my career.

452
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.400
But I have to keep
dealing with all these humans

453
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:12.700
and they don't do the
stuff that I want them

454
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:19.240
to do. Isn't that the
truth? So, you know, my

455
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.260
husband always has said, since
our children were young and

456
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.390
as they'd grown up, he's
like, you know, seven or

457
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:29.110
47, it doesn't make a
difference because we still have

458
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:32.950
to learn how to navigate
ourselves while other people make

459
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.860
choices. We wouldn't make think
things. We wouldn't think and

460
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.430
do things we wouldn't do.
And it's the little stuff.

461
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.230
Like if you listen to
one of the shows with

462
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.270
my wife, like we've been
in living in this house

463
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:47.110
for 12 years, she still
turns left at the light.

464
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.490
And I turn right at
the light and we are

465
00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:52.060
both convinced that that's the
quickest way home. And it's

466
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.640
like, why do you insist
on that? Like, why do

467
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.820
you you're, you're, you're fool's
errand that you're going right

468
00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.740
at the light. Everyone knows
going left at the light

469
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:05.140
is the only true way.
Yes. But, you know, could

470
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.080
you convince the other one
that, I mean, the other

471
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.560
way is right. And would
that really matter? That's the

472
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.380
essence right there. So when
you are dealing with these

473
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.430
decisions and these decision points,
I, my wife and I

474
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.620
actually made a kind of
a pact or a contract

475
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.600
with each other where we
said, you know, I was

476
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.880
okay before you and I
would be okay after you.

477
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.360
And I don't want to
be, I don't want to

478
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.330
be here after you, but
just to be clear, I

479
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.330
was kind of kicking butt
in life before you came

480
00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.850
around. So let's just know
that when things aren't, you

481
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.310
know, when you're frustrated or
you think I can reboot

482
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.530
the router, I will probably
be able to figure out

483
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.090
how to reboot the router.
Well, And so with that,

484
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.970
I would offer that there's
a big difference in how

485
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.690
it feels when we're connected
to others, as opposed to

486
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:57.740
complying with others. You got
all the little, little nuggets

487
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.730
there don't you. Well, I
think it's super helpful because

488
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.540
you know how we remember
will help us do ourselves

489
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.260
differently in these situations. And
so if I am to

490
00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.480
say that somebody else has
to look like, I do

491
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.150
think like I do do
like I do, I am

492
00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.870
forfeiting all of what they
have to offer as a

493
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:22.160
unique human. And that's what
makes us beautiful. Like, I

494
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.920
don't care about the same
things that everybody else does,

495
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.000
but that's a great, great,
great thing because they go

496
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.910
fight those fights and they
build skills in order to

497
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:36.230
change how that thing interacts
or interfaces. But we do

498
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.000
have to agree on stuff
though, like at some core

499
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.890
level, like don't kill people
and be nice. Well, are

500
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:48.080
we talking about morality or
preference because this is it.

501
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.080
I try to work really
hard with people because we

502
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.060
talk about this in cognitive
distortions, when I am solely

503
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.420
embedded in all or nothing
or binary ways of thinking,

504
00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.360
then I'm apt to sort
of say that there is

505
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.840
a right and a wrong
way to do things when

506
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.910
there's just a way to
do things. And if I'm

507
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.980
going to talk about right
and wrong, it should be

508
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.610
far more applicable in the
lane of morality. And that's

509
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.130
why I don't kill people.
Not whether it's right or

510
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.200
wrong to turn right or
left or to say yes,

511
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.390
or say no to a
certain opportunity or a way

512
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.630
to write code or not
write it. Okay. That is

513
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.970
a really interesting point. Right?
So in the computer world,

514
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.000
we talk about pragmatists versus
purists and you look at

515
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.770
two pieces of code and
someone might say, well, this

516
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.330
is the pure, this is
the way we've always done

517
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.730
it. This is the way
that our ancestors wrote code.

518
00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.920
And you know, well, this
is the one that works

519
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.590
and it took this many
fewer lines and it's perfectly

520
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.200
fine that isn't a morality
issue. You can, you can

521
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.730
frame it as one, but
that would be a lie.

522
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.140
Yeah. Because it's, that's part
of what makes the person

523
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.040
human coming to the code.
And if I want to

524
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.440
be like you guys do
a lot of things that

525
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:59.210
involve creativity and creativity, there's
a component that is solely

526
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:04.940
related to you. When I
watch, when, I mean, I

527
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.520
think kids are like the
best sort of research lab

528
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.150
because it's further enhancing data
I've got. And so I

529
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.210
watched the art teacher teach
my kids the whole class,

530
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.890
you know, these sort of,
Hey, we're going to make

531
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:19.370
this picture, but which one
of the 22 kids in

532
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:24.320
the class looks the same.
They look similar, but they

533
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.560
are, none are the same.
And so I don't want

534
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.110
to sit beside somebody else
and tell them to diminish

535
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.180
who they are so that
I can feel okay about

536
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.790
who I am. That is
a very, that's a very

537
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:39.800
positive and very like well
oriented expression of the idea

538
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.060
of inclusion. So if deal
with the morality of things,

539
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.520
everyone should be able to
have, you know, life, Liberty,

540
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.730
and the pursuit of happiness
is our morality. And then

541
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.860
how you go about your
life, Liberty and pursuit of

542
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.360
happiness, doesn't matter. As long
as you have the right

543
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.630
to exist and be appreciated
and find people that love

544
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.490
you, then do your thing.
Yeah. I would say we

545
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.180
work better when we have
a sense of respect and

546
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.740
empathy for others. And that,
you know, I in working

547
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.860
beside people who don't think
like I do and do,

548
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.950
don't do like I do.
I also recognize that there's

549
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.530
things that work better for
people being able to work

550
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:20.220
as a team or beside
other people than other things.

551
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.730
I mean, if I berate
you and like go off

552
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:27.780
to high heaven, when you
messed up on some, you

553
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:31.860
know, task, you were responsible
for that, doesn't help you

554
00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.620
actually solve the problem. Let
alone want to hang out

555
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.780
with the other person in
any other way, other than

556
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.810
to get the task accomplished.
And that is the thing,

557
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.280
right? Like we do have
to hang out with these

558
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.550
people afterwards. They are our
coworkers or our wives and

559
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.210
partners and husbands that we
do, like, think about the

560
00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:50.280
decision you make. I need
to start to my 12

561
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.680
year old like that may
or may not be correct,

562
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.810
but you may also need
to understand that that person

563
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.440
will be in class tomorrow
as well. Right. And look,

564
00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.470
I say like, to some
degree, we're all still learning.

565
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.300
Like when we raise kids,
like not everybody is launched

566
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.770
with the same skillset or
level of expertise. And so

567
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.160
I want people to embrace
this process of learning across

568
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.090
all aspects of their life.
And so we have to

569
00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.390
develop relational skills and emotional
skills if we're going to

570
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:27.240
even do our technol technological
skills different because none of

571
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.730
us get to opt out
of humanity first and foremost.

572
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.190
Yes. My dad always says,
none of us are getting

573
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:37.800
out of this alive. Yeah,
exactly. And so I want,

574
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.500
I think in terms, if
I do anything binary, I

575
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.190
look at whether things are
adaptive or maladaptive, do they

576
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.190
work well or not work
well? And so if I

577
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.250
have an interaction with somebody
else who, you know, in

578
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.300
my world comes across incredibly
abrasive, I try to look

579
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.480
at and go in what
way could I establish a

580
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.180
common ground with this individual
so that I could see

581
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.420
more of their heart, their
motivation in terms of what

582
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.090
their, their effort is, as
opposed to the way in

583
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.370
which they present it to
me or relate to me,

584
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.680
Giving me a lot to
think about it. And folks

585
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.170
