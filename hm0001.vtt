me introduce to you the

12
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
star of the show, Scott
Hanselman and your host with

13
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.540
the most, the toast of
the East coast. And I

14
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.050
don't mean to boast and
I didn't write this really

15
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.970
Carl Franklin. Hello, and welcome to
Hansel minutes. This is Carl Franklin

16
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.750
hosted.net rocks. And what we
plan to do here is

17
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.410
bring you Scott Hanselman in
all his glory every week

18
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.360
with stories from the field,
and we'll get his ideas

19
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.860
about what the show is.
And we'll in a little

20
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.200
bit of the history of
why, why we're doing this.

21
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.210
I don't really have an
introduction prepared for Scott. I've

22
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.480
had him on Don Iraq's
a couple of times, and

23
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.080
he's also a regional director
like myself from the Portland

24
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.910
area. He works in the
banking industry and in works

25
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.540
on really, really powerful ASP
net systems that have to

26
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.590
be absolutely perfect. You know,
when you're dealing with banking,

27
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.100
there is absolutely no room
for error. So, you know,

28
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.620
to say that he's a
little bit high, strong is

29
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.130
a maybe an understatement. I
mean, he's very, very careful

30
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.250
about his work, but he's
also brought more tools in

31
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.360
references to external tools to.net
rocks. Then I think I've

32
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.790
ever seen in my life,
he's got a list of

33
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.590
tools on his blog that
just defies imagination. And every

34
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.600
time we talk to him,
he's always introducing me to

35
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.020
some new tool. He introduced
me to code rush, and

36
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.420
he introduced a lot of
our audience To a lot

37
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.540
of the tools that we
use now all the time.

38
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.720
So that any further ado
on this premiere episode of

39
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.920
Hansel minutes, let's just introduce
the man Scott Hanselman. Hi

40
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.590
Scott. Hi. That was a
very kind and overly a

41
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.490
fluent introduction, but I'd very
much appreciate it. You are

42
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.940
a little high strung, aren't
you? I'm, I'm known to

43
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.440
be a little type a,
but I, you know, yeah,

44
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.500
we do. We do what
we can. Someone asked me

45
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.980
what my hobby was and
not, not having a hobby

46
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.480
has a tendency to give
you a lot of time

47
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.720
to do this kind of
crap. Right. And first of

48
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.030
all, let's just get it
out of the way. Congratulations

49
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.940
on your new child. Thank
you very much. His name

50
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.050
is <inaudible> and he's pushing
seven pounds. Now he's three

51
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.350
weeks and three days old
and I'm up to my

52
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.600
neck and poop, but that's
the way it should be.

53
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.340
Alright. So let's tell everybody
why we, you know, why

54
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.410
this show exists. Sure. So
briefly and people who've read

55
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.110
my blog will probably catch
me on this. That I've

56
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.480
not been too much of
a fan of podcasting. I

57
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.800
think The word was podcasting
sucks. Podcasting. Our podcasting sucks.

58
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.240
I think has been said
a couple of times you're

59
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.010
more than welcome to look
it up on the blog.

60
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.270
It was the lack of
content. I don't want podcasting

61
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.960
to be, Hey Mike, you
know, I'm picky. You know,

62
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.880
people always say blogging is
way the way blogging is

63
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.430
because people like to post
pictures of their cat. Right.

64
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.130
And I was worried and
I'm worried that podcasting can

65
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.500
very much become a discussion
of pictures of your cat.

66
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.580
And I'm like, just even
for an example, to get

67
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.040
an idea of how high
strung I am. We've been

68
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.930
talking for three minutes and
I feel that there's been

69
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.470
no significant content yet. That's
how nervous I am that

70
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.210
I want to make sure
we got a lot of

71
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.640
good content in the, in
Hansel minutes because it's not

72
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.280
Hansel hours. Right. Right. It
is going to be a

73
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.130
shorter show. We'll be a
little bit shorter show. And

74
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.480
it's gonna be the kind
of show that I think

75
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.700
someone could listen to on
the way to work. And

76
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.180
hopefully have a bit of
a, a bit more information,

77
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.190
a little less talk and
a little more content. I'm

78
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.120
going to talk about tools,
new tools that I've found

79
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.750
tools that I'm currently using
things that are really utilitarian.

80
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.820
You know, that's a really
good word. Excellent. That word.

81
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.280
I think if, if Hanselman,
it could be anything. I

82
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.180
would like it to be
utilitarian tools of the week.

83
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.380
What's hot. What are the
great things that are people

84
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.100
are talking about on the
blog? I think it would

85
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.900
like to be a podcast
for people who don't have

86
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.150
time to read the Scoble
sized chunk of blogs that

87
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.390
are out there. Right. I
know I read about 250

88
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.530
blogs a day using feed
demon. And I know that

89
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.290
I don't have the patience
to read 500 or 700

90
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.110
or whatever amount of Scoble
reads. I'm sure most people

91
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.570
don't have the patience or
the time to read that

92
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.870
much content. So if I
can provide some, some benefit

93
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.380
by breaking that information down,
then that's great. Yeah. We

94
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.060
should also say that we
already recorded one of these

95
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.540
and we're going to call
it the midweek geek. And

96
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.300
we just decided to call
it Hanselman it's I think

97
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.110
that you came up with
that name didn't, You know,

98
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.770
the, actually the etymology of
Hansel minutes is from Travis

99
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.830
Illig Travis elig is a
engineer that I work with

100
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.280
who has a blog called
parasthesia and Hansel minutes is

101
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.760
what is a unit of
time when you ask Scott

102
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.660
Hanselman for how long something
will take, and there's a

103
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.900
Hanselman it's conversion factor. I
have a tendency to say,

104
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.120
Oh yeah, I can write
that up in 10 minutes.

105
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.940
Yeah. Or y'all yeah, that'll
take about half an hour.

106
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.610
Right. And then they usually
apply a Hanselman it's conversion

107
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.680
factor and find out that
it really takes three days

108
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.280
to write the code. So
let's just Into the content

109
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.470
and as we were going
to, as we were going

110
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.840
to do every week, so
what do you got for

111
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.750
us this week? Well, there's
two tools that I've been

112
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.840
using this last couple of
weeks that have really been

113
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.810
making my life a lot
easier so far. These are

114
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.840
not shareware. These are just
loving, that has been passed

115
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.560
on from the dotnet community
from two individuals in particular.

116
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.270
The first one is Kenny
Kurz window clippings, window clippings.

117
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.400
And you can get this@tinyearltinyurl.com
slash BD, V as in

118
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.930
Victor, Z, Z as in
Zed, K tiny earl.com BD

119
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.600
visa, ed K, No. I'm
curious as to why you're

120
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.590
not using shrinks Because tiny
Earl has less war, less

121
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.840
letters in it than shrinks
there does. Right. But the

122
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.120
actual, you know, the cryptic
part of it has more

123
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.660
characters, Six one half dozen.
The other there's a particular

124
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.000
tool I use it sits
in my tray that lets

125
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.730
me automatically tiny Earl, everything
that gets clicked cut into

126
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.520
my clipboard. I started using
tiny arrow a long time

127
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.650
ago. Yeah. As long as
we're comparing notes, I have

128
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.700
the same tool for shrink
stir shrink lit. Oh, okay.

129
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.520
That's fantastic. So yeah, tiny
Earl is actually as an

130
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.190
aside, tiny Earl and shrink,
stir anything at all that

131
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.890
we'll take a five line
long Earl and turn it

132
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.220
into something shorter is great.
I'm actually debating creating one

133
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.150
where I would just be
able to say hanselman.com/tools/four. Yeah.

134
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.730
And I may actually set
that up for the All

135
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.460
right. So let's talk about
this thing. Okay. So Kenny

136
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.470
Kerr as a blogger, and
he's got a blog up

137
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:15.160
at weblogs.asp.net/kenny Kerr. And window
clippings is a at first

138
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.250
glance, a print, a print
screen tool, but there's a

139
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.390
million different print screen tools
out there. And, and most

140
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.540
people just use alt print
screen. But one of the

141
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.530
things that Kenny noticed is
that in windows, the corners

142
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.620
of the Explorer window and
most windows, anytime that you

143
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.540
have a themed windows XP
theme, particularly the default theme

144
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.530
actually have rounded edges. If
you take a look real

145
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.680
close at your windows, I
explore window or even the

146
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.870
chat window that I've got
open with Carl right now,

147
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.480
you'll see that you've got
rounded edges. When you do

148
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.920
a print screen, you end
up with a rectangular region

149
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.060
in the background. Color does
not end up matching whatever

150
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.610
color you're going to be
rendering that image onto. So

151
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.090
typically you just put that
window over a white background

152
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.520
and you just kind of
lie and suffer with that.

153
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.550
What Kenny's created is a
real nice tool that lets

154
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.150
you double click on his
icon in the tray. And

155
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.560
he will create an irregular
region, a non rectangular region

156
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.970
and create a transparent PNG.
A PNG of course is

157
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.650
a better graphics format, Portable
network graphics. Yeah. This is

158
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.690
a 24 bit alpha channel
supporting, you know, so therefore

159
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.680
transparency supporting format. Exactly. You've
got an outfit. You've got

160
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.950
eight bits for red, green,
and blue and an additional

161
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.150
eight bits for a total
of 32 for the alpha

162
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.990
channel. Exactly. Yup. So his
tool will let you do

163
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.760
this. When you double click
on the tool and the

164
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.300
tray, the screen goes gray
in that kind of way.

165
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.080
When, when, like when you
see windows XP, shutting down,

166
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.810
everything goes gray. You move
your mouse over the window.

167
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.180
You want double click on
it. That one jumps out

168
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.000
of the screen indicating is
this the one you want?

169
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.180
And then in his options,
he can automatically save the

170
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.180
file into a folder on
your desktop, which for me

171
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.220
is great because then I
can immediately blog it from

172
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.760
blog jet blog, jet.com, which
is a tool I used

173
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.640
to post a DAS blog.
So he'll automatically put it

174
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.100
in the clipboard. This is,
we should talk about blog

175
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.980
jet too. This is an
interesting thing. I'm obviously, you

176
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.950
know, getting pictures in a
blog is tricky because you

177
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.230
have to have access to
your web server and then

178
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.060
you have to make a
URL to it and then

179
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.310
include that URL in an
image tag, blah, blah, blah,

180
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.810
blah, blah. So what is
this? Do Blas does that

181
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.410
for you? Yeah. Blog jet
is an offline blogging, a

182
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.850
blog writer. It supports a
whole host of blogging API

183
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.930
APIs, like the meadow weblog
API and the blogger API.

184
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.890
And additionally like these are,
these are ones, of course,

185
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.560
that dosh blog supports DAS
blog has its own API,

186
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.000
but it's not something that
has caught on. And in

187
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.070
a widespread way, we support
the blogger standard API and

188
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.470
the met a web log
API, which adds the support

189
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.290
for categories. You load up
blog jet, which is a

190
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.690
very small kind of app
that it's really just hosting

191
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.560
the IAE editable DHT Mel
regions, which gives you the

192
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.030
same kind of HTML generation
support that IES editable is

193
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.090
gives you. And you say,
I'm going to be using

194
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.100
a dos blog or I'm
going to be using a

195
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.180
community server and it will
automatically configure the appropriate API.

196
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.060
You give it the end
point, the Earl to your

197
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.350
particular blog. And then since
DAS blog and most blogs,

198
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.920
don't support posting of images.
It has a very clever

199
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.000
hack. It will post the
blog text via the blogging

200
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.970
API, and then it will
do a parallel of FTP

201
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.260
upload, nice of the image
and then automatically turn your

202
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.060
relative Earls into absolute Earls
and vice versa. So with

203
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.070
blog, it's a fantastic, fantastic
tool. I believe it's the

204
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.190
only one for DAS blog
and it That's it blog

205
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.750
jet.com. We should say Blogs,
jet.com. And if you go

206
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.030
up on my blog right
now and search for DAS

207
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.030
blog, one of the most
recent posts is actually a

208
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.140
gentleman has done a complete,
a fairly complete analysis of

209
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.830
every single, offline blogging tool
he could find logged. It's

210
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.020
a very popular one. Another
one that's very popular is

211
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.190
called w dot blogger, except
blogger is spelled a R

212
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.570
B L O G G
a R w blogger. And

213
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.140
this gentleman has done a
very extensive offline analysis of

214
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.870
all the different tools you
could post to your blog

215
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.030
with and whether or not
they work with DAS blog.

216
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.270
Yeah, he's done a very
nice compatibility matrix. So a

217
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.730
window clippings is the tool
from Kenny that I've been

218
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.810
using to do my, my
posting of images. That's pretty

219
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.330
nice. And it'll even do
very, very irregular regions, like

220
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.600
the kind of skinned irregular
regions you get when you're

221
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.600
messing around with windows media
center and media player, rather

222
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.390
windows media player. Is that
a, is that the tool

223
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.240
you use all the time
to, to, to clip out

224
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.140
pictures and posts? Yeah, I've
started using Kenny's tool pretty

225
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.940
much all the time. I
it's it's, it's always in

226
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.650
the tray and it is
the tool that I decided

227
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.760
to use now for my
screenshots. Although there's another screenshot

228
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.550
tool that I've been using
recently. That's I think just

229
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.430
come out of beta it's
from Leon Bambrick and this

230
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.040
is something that actually won
one of the awards in

231
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.890
Mike Gunder lawyer, recent Lark,
where Mark, where.com coding contest.

232
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.010
It's called time snapper. And
he's actually put up a

233
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.340
site at times, snapper.com. And
this is very, very clever.

234
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.660
This is one of those
things that I think we've

235
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.790
all thought about writing at
one point or the other.

236
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.110
And it's an automatic screenshot
journal that runs in the

237
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.520
background on your machine automatically
taking screenshots of your desktop

238
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.250
every couple of minutes. As
long as you work on

239
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.360
your system, it's only an
ADK download and what's clever

240
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.430
about it is it creates
a timeline. So for if

241
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.400
you're a person that gets
paid by the hour by

242
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.710
the minute, and you said,
well, what the heck am

243
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.080
I doing this week? I
need to fill out a

244
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.350
time card. What was I
doing Wednesday at two o'clock.

245
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.680
You can actually run by
and see a playback of

246
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.000
your week. I'm not talking
about a Camtasia, realtime playback,

247
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.300
but I'm talking about a,
if you manage your time

248
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.960
in 15 minute increments, what
exactly were you doing about

249
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.590
this time? Wow, that's excellent.
Oh, it's fantastic. And it's

250
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.030
free. It's 80 K to
download it and it uses.net.

251
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.250
Awesome. Yeah, it's really fantastic.
I'm pretty impressed with what

252
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.980
they, what they turned out
Better use for that new

253
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.340
400 gig hard drive you
got for Christmas or Hanukkah

254
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.070
present as the case may
be. I've actually found that

255
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.950
it's, they're doing a pretty
good job. Of course, when

256
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.780
you're doing something like this,
you don't need a lot

257
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.790
of compressor. You don't need
a lot of details. So

258
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.680
the compression's not too bad
in 30 K you know,

259
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.440
30 K per shot or
50 K per shot. No

260
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.350
problem for every five minutes
is really trivial. You're looking

261
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.040
at maybe a mega day.
Yeah. And if they obviously

262
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.650
have some sort of mechanism
to go back through those

263
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.570
and look at them in
an, in an organized way.

264
00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.270
Yeah. They've actually got a
very nice slider tool that

265
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.030
shows you when the time
of the day, along with

266
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.680
when the shot was taken,
that's a time snapper.com. That

267
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.560
is super cool. As the
website says, now, Scott, I

268
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.540
see on the show notes
page that you sent me,

269
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.820
that you want to talk
about the Xbox three 60.

270
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.380
Yeah, absolutely. And not in
the typical way that people

271
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.150
have been talking about it.
Yeah. Which is how can

272
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.250
I get one? Okay. Well,
yeah. How can I get

273
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.370
one? Of course I pre-ordered
mine in July. Okay. And

274
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.710
just got it a couple
of weeks. Well, actually when

275
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.960
I say about a week
and a half ago, certainly

276
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.270
I didn't have to stay
overnight anywhere and sleep out

277
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.910
front of best buy to
try to get my Xbox

278
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.580
three 60. All that's good.
I was on the second

279
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.010
shipment, July or June, end
of June when I ordered

280
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.150
it was not early enough.
But what I'm excited about

281
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.370
with the Xbox three 60
is its potential as a

282
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.000
media hub readers of my
blog were folks that want

283
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.850
to go back and look
at my blog, do a

284
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.270
search for media. I've been
searching for the ultimate kind

285
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:09.130
of media hub system for
years. I've tried, UPNP you

286
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.040
know, the universal plug and
play, which is a protocol

287
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.060
that will allow you to
do discoverable media within your

288
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.920
house. I run on a
UPNP server called Twinkie, TW

289
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.140
O N K Y. If
you search for Twinkie or

290
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.230
the Twinkie music server, this
is a free with an

291
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:31.600
alternate consumer alternate commercial upgrade
UPNP server. Let's talk about

292
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.280
that. I mean, you said
at some that lets you

293
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.070
connect in your house and
stuff, but doesn't it isn't

294
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.130
this like an automatic firewall
port opener kind of product.

295
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.810
It's it's a protocol that
does everything from what's called

296
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.310
Nat traversal network address translation
traversal at it is a

297
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.180
protocol, a protocol that sits
above TCP IP that provides

298
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.850
information about, I wish to
talk to that system over

299
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.740
there, figure out how I'm
going to get over there.

300
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.590
And I want to speak,
I want a certain kind

301
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.200
of media get me this
media. I'm not really worried

302
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.070
about how it happened Or
like USB for software. That's

303
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.390
a very good way to
put it is it is

304
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.630
like USB for software and
you can get a UPNP

305
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.530
server. Twinkie is a very,
very well known one that

306
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.740
is known for being very,
very reliable. But the one

307
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.770
that you can get a
very easily from windows media

308
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.310
is the windows media connect
2.0 stuff that was released

309
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.070
just a month or so
ago. This adds some new

310
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.140
stuff in your control panel
and a little guy in

311
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.260
your tray. Yet. Another thing
in your tray that lets

312
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.750
you say, I want this
folder in that folder presented

313
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:41.440
as UPN UPNP available, shared
content windows media also provides

314
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.770
a little bit more granularity
as far as access control.

315
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.770
You actually have to specifically
allow access from a machine.

316
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:52.710
So I've got a big
250 gig removable hard drive

317
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.350
that I have all of
my media on. I've got

318
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.220
pictures, I've got video, I've
got music, I've set up

319
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.560
each of those folders with
windows media connect to be

320
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.210
shareable from my main machine.
So then when I plug

321
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.030
in another machine, whether it
be a windows media center

322
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.680
system or a X-Box three
60 in this case, I

323
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.400
am then prompted to allow
or disallow access to that,

324
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.510
to that machine. So what
is Xbox three 60 do

325
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.290
in terms of accessing media?
So the Xbox three 60

326
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.450
has a main dashboard. That's
much more advanced than the

327
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.140
previous X-Box is dashboard. And
it's got a vertical blue.

328
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.810
They call it the blades.
It's got a blade interface,

329
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.050
which is basically a tabs
like the kind you would

330
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.660
see on the left hand
side of outlook. You know,

331
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.320
you click inbox and it
goes, right. Calendar goes, swish.

332
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.680
Imagine that flipped on its
side, flipped 90 degrees. And

333
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.990
it goes back and forth.
You've got Xbox live, you've

334
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.390
got games and you've got
media. So you've actually put

335
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.600
media very much upfront. There
you go to media and

336
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.120
then you can say, I
want pictures. I want video.

337
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.090
I want music. So I
can go down now on

338
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.200
my HDTV downstairs, turn on
my Xbox with on a

339
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.960
universal remote control. This is
very important for the wife

340
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.650
acceptance factor, right? The wife
go downstairs, turn on the

341
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.650
Xbox. She goes over to
media. She hits pictures. It

342
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.990
says, where do you want
your media to come from?

343
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.970
Choices are the Xbox hard
drive? Any external machine? Like

344
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.720
any computer that's not on,
you know, near the Xbox,

345
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.040
a portable device, like an
iPod or a USB key.

346
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.310
So I just cheat his
clicks, Scott PC, which is

347
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.810
my machine upstairs. And then
immediately has a folder hierarchy

348
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.780
presented to her. Wow. Of
all the photos. So this

349
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.800
is interesting. Just sort of
a, a media center, you

350
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.770
know, replacement, or it sounds
like, Like, so this is

351
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.320
actually a thing that is
very confusing about the Xbox.

352
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.140
In my opinion, it's don't
need them. You don't need

353
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.040
a media center or a
media center PC edition to

354
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.950
do this kind of stuff.
This is built directly into

355
00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.670
the Xbox dashboard. Wow. No
IDC. Yeah. If you have

356
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.820
any PC or check this
out, if you have a

357
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.080
Mac and you want to
use the Twinkie music server

358
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.660
for the Mac or the
Twinkie media server that you

359
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.200
pay for that runs cross
platform on the Mac, the

360
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.780
wind or the Xbox three
60 will talk to most,

361
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:22.220
any UPNP service. Wow. They've
done a fantastic job of

362
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.670
making the Xbox three 60
avail, you know, able to

363
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:29.240
talk to other things. This
is all again, without using

364
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.160
any of the windows media
center stuff. We'll talk about

365
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.990
that in a second, but
I can look and look

366
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.300
at video. I can look
at music. So this has

367
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.630
been able to basically move
all of my pictures and

368
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.960
all of my music out
of my upstairs bedroom and

369
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.210
into the living room where
it belongs. Right? And since

370
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.580
I've got my wife's family,
staying with us with us

371
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.090
right now to take care
of the baby, we'll take

372
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.520
them out. We'll go to
the mountains. We'll take a

373
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.860
bunch of pictures. We'll come
back and we'll immediately want

374
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.960
to look at those pictures.
As soon as they're on

375
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.660
the computer, they can be
viewed downstairs on the big

376
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.290
screen TV dude. This is
fantastic. When they want to

377
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.230
look at the pictures even
faster, I've got a very

378
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:10.270
inexpensive Casio XLM digital camera.
The excellent <inaudible>. I can

379
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.260
just take it. And it's
little USB dock downstairs where

380
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.960
the TV and the Xbox
three 60 are plug it

381
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.480
into the Xbox three 60,
right in the front, there

382
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.960
are two USB ports go
to the same exact place

383
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.830
media within the Xbox three
60 dashboard blade, click on

384
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:30.760
pictures. And it'll say, Oh,
from this digital camera, it'll

385
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.980
automatically flatten the digital cameras
file system. You know, most

386
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.110
digital cameras. You don't actually
get to have your photos

387
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.820
in the route. It's usually
under images, Fu whatever, whatever

388
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.170
those, those details are confusing
to Mort to the average

389
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.560
Joe. So they flatten those
things. They don't see them.

390
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:55.630
You simply see pictures. Additionally,
any USB key that has

391
00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:00.700
content like a JPEG or
any video or any iPod.

392
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.950
So I was actually able
to take my iPod nano.

393
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.220
This was amazing. I plugged
it in there. Wasn't any

394
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.370
big click. Oh, I'm searching
for a driver. You know

395
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.010
how, when you plug a
USB device into a windows

396
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.040
machine, there's the big, I
think something's happening. Let me

397
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.660
look and see what I
can do about it. Long

398
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.200
pause. You plugged the nano
in boom. I go to

399
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.290
music and it says Scott's
nano suite and I can

400
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.500
play music directly off of
the, the iPod. That's awesome.

401
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.410
That is also going to
also got a Sony PSP,

402
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.950
the PlayStation portable. And I'm
working on getting video to

403
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.690
come off of that, which
is going to be pretty

404
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:49.800
hot. Hey, this is Carl Franklin

of test complete@automatedqa.com. Now Twinkie
is at Twinkie vision dot

427
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.500
D E or do you
have a, a that's it,

428
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.200
do you have a tiny
URL for that? No, that'll

429
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.900
that'll do it. So T
w O N K, vision

430
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:50.080
dot D E to wonky
vision. Exactly. Now all of

431
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.820
this that we've been talking
about is simply the windows

432
00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.250
media connect support, which is
a fancy way of saying

433
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.560
the Xbox three 60 is
the ultimate UPNP receiver. None

434
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.420
of this has anything to
do with windows media center

435
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.690
right now, windows media center
has the notion of an

436
00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.870
extender and an extender is
really, I like to say

437
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.190
that you're basically remote desktopping
into your windows media center.

438
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.470
If you've ever used remote
desktop or VNC to go

439
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.890
in and remote the desktop,
the X original Xbox had

440
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:23.500
a fantastically crappy X-Box extender.
It was basically a CD

441
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.080
that you put in your
X-Box and you got a

442
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.460
three 20 by two 40
times by eight bit color,

443
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:35.170
very little animation extender that
gave you a watered down

444
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.250
simpler version of the windows
media center experience. And we

445
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.860
all know that the meeting
center experience is very, very

446
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.150
fluid, very, very gradient, very
soft, very, you know, it's

447
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.650
a very smooth experience. Yeah.
Turns out that the Xbox

448
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.460
three 60 has this built
in this, this technology built

449
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.550
in where they've do all
of the rendering of the

450
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.360
windows media center interface on
the Xbox three 60 itself.

451
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.870
So only the content is
coming back and forth. Wow,

452
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.640
that's what the actual work
and the fluid, the fluidity

453
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.930
is there. Now, I originally
tried doing this with a

454
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.340
wireless adapter. I ended up
using my original Xbox wireless

455
00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.010
adapter on the new Xbox
three 60, because it didn't

456
00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.920
want to spend $99 to
buy the Xbox three 60

457
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.110
wireless. But I found out
that if you're going to

458
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.740
be doing any kind of
video or any larger MP3s,

459
00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.980
you really want to think
about a wired connection. I

460
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.190
know that everyone's saying with
the 54 megabits, you can

461
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.950
get some pretty good bandwidth
with your wireless. I agree

462
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.010
the wired adapter so much
better, but what you can

463
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.850
do with the, some of
the newer, excuse me, some

464
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.670
of the early Xbox three
60 is you have to

465
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.830
watch for this because there's
a sticker on the outside

466
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.250
of the box that says
included for a limited time,

467
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.670
a media center, remote control.
They give you a small

468
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.800
meatus and a remote control,
but only on the first

469
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.200
couple of shipments, you have
to watch for this. If

470
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.270
you don't have it, you
spend $30 to buy this

471
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.230
remote control. We also have
a media center, PC Scott,

472
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.420
I'm sorry. I do. In
fact, have a media center

473
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.700
PC that I built from
scratch. If you go up

474
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.140
and search for media center
on my blog, enhancement.com/blog, then

475
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.180
you'll see how I built
it. I've got a complete

476
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.640
parts list and how you
can build the same thing

477
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.280
from newegg.com. I tried to
build one and it didn't

478
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.620
work for some reason. And
then I just said, screw

479
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.410
it. I went and I
bought a, a Dell media

480
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.860
center PC. Yeah, they are
notoriously hard to set up.

481
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.880
Yeah. And w what's your
impression of, of it? I

482
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.750
mean, you know, the application
itself, the media center application

483
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.670
seems to be my wife's
favorite way to access music,

484
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:42.860
you know, because of the
icons and stuff. And it's

485
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.160
very, very cool and the
pictures overlap each other and

486
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.030
stuff. And my brother, you
know, he does everything with

487
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.750
a win app. You know,
he's got basically a network

488
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.750
connection to his PC upstairs
that has all his music

489
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.750
on it downstairs. And he
just uses when amp for

490
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.950
everything. But what's your, what's
your impression of it? I

491
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.870
mean, I know that there
are a lot of people

492
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:11.060
that aren't particularly all that
happy with it. The thing

493
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.210
is that the, the, an
interface like this, which it's

494
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:17.240
called a 10 foot interface,
but that can be used

495
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.360
from 10 feet away is
written in such a way

496
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.820
that it, it hits 80%
of the market, but sometimes

497
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.760
myself where you or your
brother is not that at

498
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.360
80%. Yeah. If, if, if,
if he likes when app

499
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.980
and when app does what
he needs it to do,

500
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.960
then he's definitely not going
to be satisfied with this.

501
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.500
For example, I've got right
53, I've got 5,300 MP3s.

502
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:40.610
And I hate the music
section of the windows media

503
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.700
center, because I just can't
get to my songs. I

504
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.220
ended up listening to songs.
I listened to artists that

505
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.100
start with like a and
B, because they're at the

506
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.810
top, right. So I listened
to a lot of, But

507
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.220
There's a lot of music
from Zimbabwe that would love

508
00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.230
to listen to, I can't
figure out how to get

509
00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.790
there. The, So then, you
know, I understand, I understand

510
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.280
your, your concern. And I
don't know what the answer

511
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.530
is. Other than a little
bit more thought about hot,

512
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.290
you know, hot keys, the
notion of a page down

513
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.510
that was a little bit
more called out would be,

514
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.170
How does the Xbox interface
compare to, to the media

515
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.930
center interface? Yes, It's a
very good point because you

516
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.360
can, you can access your
music either way with the

517
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.120
Xbox three 60. If you're
using a standard PC, you

518
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.090
can just use the built
in dashboard, or you can

519
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.310
remote into the media center
and then look at your

520
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.470
data from there. It is
a built in dashboard. Have

521
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.640
the cool factor that the
windows media PC has. Doesn't

522
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.280
it, it's not as flashy.
It's not as fluid. It

523
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.590
doesn't have that kind of
soft blue look. It's much

524
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.510
more garish look. Although the
Xbox three 60 interface does

525
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.330
allow theming. So you can
have themes and skins that

526
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.540
you can download using a
micro cache, which are called

527
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.470
Microsoft points. You buy. I
think I bought for $25.

528
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.380
I think I bought 2000
Microsoft points. Wow. And then

529
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.750
four for two or 300
points, you can download a

530
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.570
theme so you can get
the Portland trailblazers theme, or

531
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.660
you can get the Brazil
soccer team theme, or the

532
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.940
call of duty two theme,
and it'll scan the whole

533
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.180
thing. So you can change
the interface, but it's not

534
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.570
as fluid as the media
center, but it gets you

535
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.690
there faster. I totally thought
I would be remoting into

536
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.690
the media center to view
my images and to view

537
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:23.710
our music more and more.
I'm ending up using the

538
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:26.890
Xbox directly, which has been
very, very interesting. And I

539
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.500
didn't expect it to go
down like that. But from

540
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.900
a wife acceptance factor standpoint,
she had a couple of

541
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.050
ladies come over from her
work recently, and they were

542
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.840
able to sit down with
our harmony eight 80 universal

543
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.220
remote control. They pushed play
Xbox from the activity screen

544
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.910
on the harmony remote control
and turn on the Xbox

545
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.030
turn on the TV, turned
on the HDTV, changed all

546
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.130
the inputs to the right
place. And then just using

547
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.920
the up, down left, right.
And the okay button. We're

548
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.890
able to look at pictures
of the baby. And that

549
00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.460
is absolutely unbelievable. I mean,
I can't express how powerful

550
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.660
that is. Yeah. That's the
experience you want. Absolutely. I

551
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.090
feel like with the Xbox
three 60 and with this

552
00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.540
harmony eight 80 remote control
and believe me, I've tried

553
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.090
every remote control. And if
you want to check out

554
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:17.910
remote control information, you go
to remote central.com, fantastic website,

555
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.990
and their forums are unbelievable.
The harmony eight 80 actually

556
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:26.130
added X-Box three 60 support
as a simple download. So

557
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.350
I can apply. I plugged
the harmony eight 80 into

558
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:32.160
the, into my computer, went
up to harmony, remote.com. Literally

559
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.310
the day the Xbox showed
up at my doorstep downloaded

560
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.310
the new activities and all
the new content I've actually

561
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:42.000
been playing Bejeweled using my
harmony remote control. So I

562
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.310
don't even need the media
remote control that came with

563
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.270
the Xbox. Oh, that's so
cool. It's seamlessly integrated with,

564
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.880
with the house. How do
you plug the remote control

565
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.120
in is that USP? And
it, interestingly it uses the

566
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.090
tiny USB adapter, you know,
those little dizzy USB a

567
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.160
and B, and then there's
the really tiny one, right?

568
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.650
You plug it in, you
go up to a website,

569
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.350
the entire application for the
harmony remote is done with

570
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:08.040
a website, and then they
create a packet of information

571
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.180
with a special extension. Then
when you download that, instead

572
00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.180
of saving the packet, you
hit open, it opens into

573
00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.570
a browser helper application that
then decodes the air codes

574
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.690
from that packet, and then
downloads it directly into the

575
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:26.450
harmony suite. Yeah, it's the
bomb. Wow. You know, I

576
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.770
just got a couple of
new TVs end of the

577
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:32.480
year. I'm I had been
holding out. I mean, I

578
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.610
I've had CRT TVs for
years and years and years.

579
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.910
This is the first time,
you know, this, this Christmas

580
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.500
that actually gotten, gotten with
it in terms of home

581
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.060
media. And so I got
a plasma TV for the

582
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.700
living room and a smaller
LCD TV for the bedroom.

583
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.220
And so this, this is
a welcome timely, a timely

584
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.030
information from you for me.
Yeah. I was planning on

585
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.030
getting an Xbox three 60
after, you know, the next

586
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.240
wave, you know, in January
when the next wave comes

587
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.530
out and hopefully they'll have
fixed that little heating overheating

588
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.820
problem by that time. Yeah.
Interestingly, I haven't had that

589
00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.250
problem. I, I'm not sure
if that is something that's

590
00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.070
happening for certain people's machines.
It gets only a few,

591
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.530
like keep it on a
carpet or something where there's

592
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.690
no way for the air
to get out the bottom,

593
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.250
Actually, you know, not on
the topic of overheating, but

594
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.400
on another topic don't even
bother turning your X-Box up

595
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.270
and down. Just keep it
horizontal. It turns out that

596
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:38.350
the, the vertical position is
not ideal for the DVDs

597
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.360
and they have a tendency
to slide a little bit

598
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.640
down and there's no hooks
to actually hold the DVDs

599
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.830
in. So there's been a
number of DVDs that have

600
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:48.160
been getting scratched. It's better
for the hard drive to

601
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.640
have it have the whole
thing on its side, but

602
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.860
it's much better for the
DVDs if you have the

603
00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:58.330
device horizontal. So I'm keeping
mine horizontal. And if the

604
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.850
DVD isn't accessible, you don't
really have much of an

605
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:04.750
experience. Not at all, not
at all. Let's talk about

606
00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:07.270
the, the bug fixes of
the day as we, as

607
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.400
we head towards the end
of the, the Hansel minutes.

608
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:12.790
Okay. So I've got two
pretty good bugs right now.

609
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.150
The first one was an
asp.net bug. And again, when

610
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.040
I say bug, I'm not
necessarily saying it was something

611
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.520
that Microsoft did, it might
have some problems that we've

612
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.550
solved. So we're not impugning
anyone. Most often, it's something

613
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.980
that I've done wrong and
then fixed later. So I'll

614
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.110
call it a bug, even
though it's learning from my

615
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:34.450
screw up and this one's
up on my blog@tinyurl.com slash

616
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.160
seven K B M Y.
And this was an asp.net

617
00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.540
bug where I would have
people visit my site and

618
00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:48.610
get foreign languages that they
didn't speak. And I actually

619
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.000
showed up on my site
recently on a particular page

620
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.370
and noticed that chunks of
my page were in German.

621
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.160
Huh? I was, I mean,
I literally did a double

622
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.550
take. I visited my site
in the dates. You know,

623
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:04.060
usually it says Friday, November,
whatever it said, you know,

624
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.380
I don't even know how
to say it in German.

625
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.660
It said it in German
and it freaked me out,

626
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.670
visited a couple of pages.
I visited another one. It

627
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.520
was in Turkish. Then I
realized that one of the

628
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.580
performance optimizations that I had
done since my site had

629
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.950
been getting more and more
traffic was that I had

630
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:20.800
added the output cash directive.
It's a single line that

631
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.690
you put at the top
of your ASP X page,

632
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.380
right? That says cache the
content of this particular page.

633
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:30.070
I'd added that. And I
put in duration, I think

634
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:34.020
I put 1800 seconds. And
I put in very bipolar

635
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.400
Ram equals star saying, no
matter on the Earl and

636
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.430
the query string, I want
you to catch a different

637
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.130
version for each thing that
appears in the query string.

638
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:48.540
So if I said, you
know, permalink dot ASP, X,

639
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:52.830
good equals, and then whatever
the goo it equals, I

640
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.550
would get one cached version
of the page per value.

641
00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:00.200
So every page has its
own version. Every page has

642
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.870
its own version. And for
everybody that's exactly, that's a

643
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.600
lot of memory thing, welfare
isn't it turned out. Yeah.

644
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:11.630
That I was cashing the
ver I'm sorry. It's actually

645
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:15.380
not for everybody. It's based
on the parameters and variables,

646
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.320
Right. It's based on the
parameters. Not session based. Yeah.

647
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.650
Okay. Right. Okay. So let's
say that there's a page.

648
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.350
No one's ever visited before.
It's just sitting out there.

649
00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:29.150
It's not been cashed and
a German visits. I will

650
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.610
say I'm actually going to
DAS blog does this automatically.

651
00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:35.570
I look at his HTTP
headers, specifically the accept language

652
00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:38.600
header. And I see that
he's a German. So then

653
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.180
I being friendly guy that
I am we'll render the

654
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.460
dates and various things that
I am able to the

655
00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:47.180
DAS blog interface in German.
There you go. But that's

656
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.940
First guy. He was the
first guy that visited the

657
00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.670
site. That's the one that
gets cashed. If an Englishman

658
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:55.970
shows up later, I don't
bother looking. I simply know

659
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.220
that I've cast something and
I show blindly what was

660
00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.870
cashed. We should also mention
Scott that you are writing

661
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.690
DAS blog. I mean, this
started with Clemens. Fasters right.

662
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.020
And he wrote the original
version With Chris Anderson who

663
00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.620
wrote blog X. Oh really?
Okay. Then Clemens in a

664
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:17.690
caffeinated overnight freaking code session
wrote the first version of

665
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.560
dash blog put up on
god.net, somewhere around in version

666
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.800
one, five or one six.
I got involved. Omar was

667
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.660
around Omar Shaheen, shaheen.com was
around somewhere in one, five,

668
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.970
Omar and I have pretty
much been the DAS blog

669
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.900
stewards since one six. Okay.
And we're, we're on one

670
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.900
eight now. And we've got
actually, as an aside, we've

671
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.090
got new stuff going on
in the DAS blog world.

672
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.450
We've got a new DAS
blog information site. It does

673
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:50.660
blog.info, www.dasblog.info. And we've got
a whole series of forums.

674
00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.150
We like to say they're
for us, there are DAS

675
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:58.730
blog.us. Okay. So we've got
support forums@dasblog.us. And we've got

676
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.280
information at dusk blog that
info. So how did you

677
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.750
solve the problem? Did you
vary by by culture? Yeah,

678
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.240
we had to actually vary
by header because the culture

679
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.900
information, the accept language header
is located inside of the

680
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.320
HTP headers. So the output
cache now says output cache

681
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:21.110
vary by parameter equals star
vary by header equals except

682
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:25.700
hyphen language. So now each
version of the page gets

683
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.550
each line. Each language gets
its own version of the

684
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.500
page. So there's a German
version of cash. There's a

685
00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.590
Turkish version, et cetera. It
does add some more memory

686
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:37.140
usage, but it gives me
the same experience. I can

687
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.900
imagine the email, Hey, I
wish I went to this

688
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.200
page and what he tried
to do to me. Yeah.

689
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.630
Yeah. It was a problem.
And I, I realized that

690
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.190
it actually been in there
for a very, very long

691
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.530
time. It wasn't actually a
DAS blog bug. Cause it

692
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.710
was my output caching that
I had added. Right. A

693
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:56.550
valuable thing to know at
any rate. Okay. And finally,

694
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:59.970
there's a, a publisher policy
issue that you had that

695
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:03.240
you wanted to talk about
this week. Yeah. Publisher policy

696
00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.150
is something that's not very
well understood, but in a

697
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.720
nutshell, you know, that.net has
this notion of versioning. That's

698
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.350
very intrinsic to the, the
notion of an assembly. And

699
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.250
the notion of versioning is
very fundamental to the way

700
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.520
dosh, the way that the.net
framework and the loader works.

701
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:25.200
You've got these four numbers,
major, minor build revision. And

702
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.350
when a publisher like I'll
use, you know, my buddy,

703
00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:32.220
Peter Blom, as an example,
is publishing some thing he

704
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.510
decides to release his validation
and more controls. He might

705
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:40.560
say, these are version 2.0
0.0 0.0. And he'll put

706
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.870
them in the global assembly
cache so that they are

707
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.410
available to anyone in any
machine. To me, anything rather

708
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:50.700
on the entire machine, they
become a, a system wide

709
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:55.560
assembly. And then later on
I will write code to

710
00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:00.200
Peter's stuff and I will
be intrinsically linked to 2.0

711
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.440
point, Oh, if something gets
fixed in Peter stuff and

712
00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:09.180
he has to release 2.0
0.1, do I have to

713
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:15.060
recompile? Or can Peter provide
some XML configuration document that

714
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:20.220
would indicate to my application?
I strongly recommend that because

715
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.560
you're on version two. Oh,
that has some known bug

716
00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.620
that you, in fact, not
receive what you asked for,

717
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.340
but instead the bug fixed
version. So when he puts

718
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.090
his application into the GAC,
he can include a signed

719
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.590
publisher policy file that says,
I am Peter Blom. I

720
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:41.280
am the publisher. I have
signed this. And I am

721
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.700
going to insist that anyone
who requests to O gets

722
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.000
two Oh one. Yep. So
that's publisher policy, and this

723
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.660
is for fixing bugs. So
Peter Thomas, a guy that works

724
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.050
at Karelian, who was one
of our deep understanding of

725
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:58.800
the loader and deep understandings
of a installer type, people

726
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.910
was doing some debugging on
some behavioral quirks and things.

727
00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.140
And he had a publisher
policy file with a version

728
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.410
of 3.1. And he had
another one for, you know,

729
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:13.950
for testing purposes. That was
version 20. So N two

730
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.580
O dot O dot Oh,
dot know. So he fully

731
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.360
expected that the 20 version
20 would be loaded. So

732
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.240
then he would see within
the fusion logs, how things

733
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.280
were working, but it wasn't,
it wasn't happening. It was

734
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.530
in fact happening in the
wrong, in the wrong order.

735
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:35.180
He was noticing that single
digit warns were working, but

736
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.000
double digit ones, we're not,
he could put in a

737
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.960
version nine and things worked,
but version 10, version 11

738
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.400
version, 20 things like this
were not valid. So publisher

739
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.420
policy doesn't appear to work
in the way that we

740
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:55.190
would think it would with
your using double digit major

741
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:59.780
versions. This is in.net one
dot X. Wow. So in

742
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.600
Don at one dot X,
when you're using publisher policy,

743
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.690
you would like, you really
should avoid double digit version

744
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:11.630
numbers because it appears that
they're being sorted alphabetically rather

745
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.880
than numerically. I don't know
if that's necessarily the case,

746
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.110
but that is what appears,
There's really no work around

747
00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.630
for this. This is just
a, A bug there really

748
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.900
isn't. And in, in to,
Oh, this has been indirectly

749
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.860
fixed due to using something
called the policy cash. And

750
00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.190
there's a gentleman named John
Fang who on as a

751
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:34.000
Microsoft employee. And he has
talked about the policy cash

752
00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.810
at his blog. And if
you can go up to

753
00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:41.560
ours to, to my site,
the publisher policy bug is

754
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:46.870
tiny url.com/c M M five
w. And I have a

755
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:50.470
link to junk fangs. A
site from there talks about

756
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.950
the publisher policy cast. The
code with that particular calculation

757
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:58.270
error is avoided using this,
this policy cash. This is

758
00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.970
a very, very little known
bug. It will likely be

759
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:04.210
fixed in the Longhorn timeframe.
So we'll probably have this

760
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:08.140
fixed by next summer, but
it's fairly obscure. I doubt

761
00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.060
that there are people out
there with version 20 of

762
00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.690
their particular application, but if
you are doing publisher policy

763
00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:18.310
on.net, one dot X do
avoid using double digit version

764
00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:22.570
numbers where you might not
get what you expect. Good

765
00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:25.780
point. It's crazy stuff. This
is the kind of weird

766
00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.840
stuff that we end up
popping into Valuable. I think

767
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.480
in, in let's hear from
the listeners out there, do

768
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.670
you think this is good?
I mean, I, I personally,

769
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.060
every time I talked to
Scott, I learned something and

770
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:42.040
let us know, send your
comments to.net rocks at Franklin's

771
00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.640
dot net. And let's, let's
see what, what people think.

772
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:49.120
Yeah. I really, you know,
in all my talks, whether

773
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.070
I'm talking on stage or
with an I Neta thing,

774
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.470
my total goal, and you
can see this in my

775
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:56.620
blog because in my blog,
I am pretty tourist. I

776
00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.170
don't, I'm not very verbose,
right? I don't want to

777
00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:03.460
waste anybody's time. So, you
know, I encourage you to

778
00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:07.060
listen to this podcast on
double speed using the windows,

779
00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.210
media, whatever it takes for
you to squeeze as much

780
00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.340
information out of it as
possible, Or depending on the

781
00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:16.180
time of day. Half-speed Exactly.
But the point is I

782
00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.730
want them to know that
we will, if they find

783
00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.350
this boring, if they find
the chatter boring, they want

784
00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:23.650
more chatter tell us, and
we'll do it. Right. All

785
00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:27.160
right, Scott, you try to
get some sleep and keep

786
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.520
washing your hands. You know,
what can I say? Poop

787
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.110
happens, Carl. I wanted to
thank you for the opportunity

788
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.520
to use your equipment and
