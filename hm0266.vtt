applications online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this episode,
Scott talks with Chris cells

7
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.760
about the pressure to release
software as open source versus

8
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.710
the pressure to make money
as a business. Hi, this

9
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.080
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

10
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.870
It's too much too soon,
but it's Chris sells and

11
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.920
he's back. How's it going,
sir? Too much too soon?

12
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
I don't know I was
doing well right up until

13
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.490
you said that. It's always
funny. Whenever I have Richard

14
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.990
on the show, like two
shows in a row, or

15
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.020
like too much, Richard, I'm
like really, really 260 shows

16
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.460
Richard on twice. That's a
problem for you. It is

17
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.650
awesome. Anyway, so I don't
know why anyone would have

18
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.010
that complaint. That is true.
That is true. Hey, yesterday

19
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.440
we were talking on the
phone and sometimes when I

20
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.240
talk to you and we
have such a great conversation,

21
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.940
I stopped the conversation and
said, we can't have this

22
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.130
talk right now because we
have to have it while

23
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.130
recording, which means that I
either need to quash the

24
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.070
mood. And then we start
talking later, which is, is

25
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.950
hard. Or I just run
over to your house with

26
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.530
a microphone and start recording.
I don't know. I feel

27
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.450
like I need to have
some kind of a device

28
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.520
plugged into my phone where
I can record any call

29
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.540
that could potentially be compelling.
But we were talking about

30
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.090
how, you know, normal people
might have trouble with that.

31
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.750
Yes. Having someone say, I'm
going to record this, is

32
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.940
that a problem at any
moment might be, might be

33
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.390
an issue yesterday. We had
a Google Chromebook came out

34
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.240
and it just felt like
I'm just getting a little

35
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.020
tired of people hating on,
on Microsoft. So I made

36
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.640
the comment to you that,
you know, we, we are

37
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.800
a lot less evil than
I think than people realize.

38
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.100
And we're certainly a lot
less organized than people here

39
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.990
a lot less organized than
we would need to be,

40
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.930
to be as evil as
people think we are. Yeah.

41
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.650
I mean, it's like imagining
that the government actually had

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.280
his shit together enough to
be able to pull off

43
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.940
the controversies that we credit
them with. Right. Microsoft is

44
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.940
very much along those same
lines. Right. Right. And, and

45
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.230
I, I wonder is, you
know, is Apple that organized

46
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.890
is Google that organized? And
it seems like in the

47
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.970
last couple of, I don't
know, last couple of five

48
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.840
years, you know, Google was
incredibly not. And Apple only

49
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.950
recently became evil just because
of some draconian app store

50
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.140
thing, some very crisp language
on behalf of, of Steve

51
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.480
jobs. And, and then Microsoft
were still evil. So now

52
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.320
we have three evil companies
instead of just one. And

53
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.060
I was kind of hoping
things would flip around and

54
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.570
people would realize that we're
not really that evil. And

55
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.480
it seems like some groups
are recognized as being less

56
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.910
evil. Like I think web
platform and tools, you know,

57
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.170
if I may be so
bold and Your team, that's

58
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.230
amazing. Yeah. It's funny how
that works out. That may

59
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.590
just be because I live
in that bubble, but you

60
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.780
know, we're doing our best,
right? We, we, we, we

61
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.170
try every day to suck
less, but then I was

62
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.870
thinking, you know, maybe it
would just all be peaches

63
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.990
and cream and puppies over
like working for an open

64
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.400
source company. And you challenged
that idea that, that it's

65
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.260
all magic and at a
company that does nothing but

66
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.850
open source. Well, it's interesting.
So I have two immediate

67
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.570
reactions to what you just
said. One was when I

68
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.410
came to Microsoft a little
over seven years ago, I

69
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.290
never thought I would last.
I never thought I would

70
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.790
like it. I never thought
I would fit in. And

71
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.740
I really did expect everyone
to have a maniacal laugh.

72
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.490
Whenever we talked about what
the customers wanted off, off,

73
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.410
we don't care what the
customers want. We will give

74
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.960
them what they need and
they will give us money

75
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.920
and awe. And that is,
I mean, maybe it's a

76
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.760
little overplayed, but it is
what I expected the attitude

77
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.730
to be like. And I
was completely bowled over when

78
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.630
I actually started working with
people, real people at Microsoft.

79
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.490
And I've worked in seven
years. I've worked at a

80
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.160
number of teams with a
number of different people. And

81
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.640
I can't tell you how
important the customer is to

82
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.140
just everyone at Microsoft. You
know, I've hung out with

83
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.270
VPs and, and you know,
brand new, new college grads

84
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.780
and everyone in between. And
everyone that I've run into

85
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.510
practically, everyone cares, deeply passionate
about what the customer wants.

86
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.040
So one, I don't actually
think Microsoft is evil. I

87
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.520
think we do things that
I disagree with, but you

88
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.840
know, any, anytime you have
two or more people together,

89
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.270
that's what happens, right. People
will do things that you

90
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.630
disagree with. So that's one
thing. And the other thing

91
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:46.380
is this idea that any
company can do things that

92
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.030
everyone will like is crazy,
right? I mean, he said,

93
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.910
Oh, Apple, everyone loves Apple.
I can't tell you how

94
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.730
many people I've run into
that negative opinions of Apple

95
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.110
and a vehement negative opinions.
Now, me personally, I've had

96
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.100
a couple of I-phones I've
liked it, a great deal.

97
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.520
My sons have had some
iPods and iPhones and they've

98
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.700
liked them. I played around
with an iPad for awhile.

99
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.610
I mean, in general, I'm
a, I'm a fan of

100
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.040
Apple products. Even before I
came to windows years and

101
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.990
years ago, I had a
Macintosh to CX or $6,000

102
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.960
in 1990, which was just
all the money in the

103
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.340
world to me. And I
loved it. I absolutely loved

104
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.040
it. So, so you know,
the idea that you can

105
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.210
go and work for some
company that everyone loves is,

106
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.390
is hard to imagine. Are
these companies doing stuff because

107
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.330
they're evil or is just
that evil is associated with

108
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.020
making money? I mean, I
think that putting the customer

109
00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.190
first is one perspective, you
know, putting intellectual property and

110
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.260
copyright and, and, and open
source first is another philosophy,

111
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.200
a driving philosophy of company.
And then, you know, putting

112
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.570
the user first, like, are
we, are we, are we

113
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.180
putting money first? And then
that makes us, you know,

114
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.100
not good. Okay. Well, you
have to remember that any

115
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:26.050
publicly traded company has exactly
one primary overriding goal, which

116
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.540
is making their stockholders happy
and to bake and stockholders

117
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.630
are very simple crowd. They
care about making money on

118
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:39.010
the stock they bought, unless
they're doing something fancy. They

119
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.920
vibed some stock in some
company, and they want the

120
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.230
value of that company to
go up, that they can

121
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.330
sell the sockets of a
future date and have made

122
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:52.300
money. And so is any
publicly traded companies job to

123
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.570
make money. And so that's
first and foremost what they

124
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.930
have to do. That's just
the realities. And so Microsoft

125
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.320
makes money and Apple makes
money and Google makes money.

126
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.320
And all of these people
make money and they, they

127
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.340
have different philosophies of how
they do it. For example,

128
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.870
Microsoft is very much about,
you know, selling software that

129
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.550
anybody can put together. IBM
and Oracle are all about,

130
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:23.020
you know, sending out teams
of, of consultants and setting

131
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.290
up the software for you.
Apple is all about having

132
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.780
a one end to end
consumer experience that they tightly

133
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.550
control and Google is all
about, Hey, anything that gets

134
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.440
people to look at their
set of online ads, they

135
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.110
will happily give away for
free. Right? So that, that

136
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.050
cause all their revenues come
from, you know, ad impressions

137
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.620
and clicks on the ads.
So each one of these

138
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.950
companies does it differently and
they have different philosophies about

139
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.470
how they make money, but
they all make money. I

140
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.890
see. So you're saying that
it might feel like a

141
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.040
certain company is not evil.
It's just that they're not

142
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.340
getting money in a way
that you're noticing. Yeah. And

143
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.660
of course, well, it's, it's
funny too, because even so

144
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.570
I've heard people complain about
Google. In fact, they just

145
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.250
released their music thing yesterday
and somebody was a right

146
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.880
away hounding on it. Right.
Just how horrible it was.

147
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.060
You know, I can't say,
cause I haven't seen it.

148
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.630
I haven't tried it, but
no matter what you do,

149
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.860
someone who's going to have
a negative opinion and probably

150
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.570
no matter what you do,
somebody who's going to have

151
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.920
a positive opinion. It's really
just only a matter of,

152
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.510
of scale. And so, you
know, of course different companies

153
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:49.010
do different things. You know,
if, if a money, if

154
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.360
some company decided how to
make money by squeezing puppies,

155
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.750
probably that wouldn't be very
well received. Right? XN Exxon,

156
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.770
when they, you know, spilled
the oil all over the

157
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.120
place or PP more recently,
you know, they weren't exactly

158
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.210
the most popular guys on
the planet, but boy, they

159
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.950
make money hand over fist.
On the other hand, as

160
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:20.480
you say, Google, right? Consumers,
themselves rarely spend money on

161
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.120
anything from Google, right. You
and me. So going home,

162
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.980
we can use a lot
of stuff from Google for

163
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.930
free and Oh, and by
the way, a ton of

164
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.480
stuff for Microsoft for free
as well. But it's the

165
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.180
ads that pay the bills
for those free services. Right?

166
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.800
Hmm. So is it, is
it our, our business model

167
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.230
in that we want, we
want licensing money. That that

168
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.820
is like people we want
money because we're publicly traded

169
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.160
company and people notice it
because it's right in your

170
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.550
face, you buy windows. Like,
do you think that like,

171
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.960
people always say, why don't,
why don't we just give

172
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.520
windows away for $99. Right.
Isn't that like, isn't like,

173
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.230
if you buy iOS 10,
like upgrades, you're like 39

174
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.780
bucks and family packs like
200 bucks. I mean it's

175
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.540
pretty straight forward pricing. So
it seems like there's two

176
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.370
issues there. One is being
straightforward in your pricing, which

177
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.620
is something that we could
certainly do better. Although I

178
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:15.080
don't understand why we don't
and then there's subsidizing core

179
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.070
businesses with other revenue. You
know what I'm saying? Like,

180
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.110
does it, is it really
reasonable for us to do

181
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.870
that? You know what I
mean? Okay. So, so now

182
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.410
here's that you've just brought
two wonderful, fabulous points that

183
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.070
are completely different. One is
this idea that we are,

184
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.140
we have prices that are
too high and prices that

185
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.410
are varied. Now on the
too high, I will argue

186
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.220
with you because most people
that get windows, they don't

187
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.170
go out and buy windows
and install it on a

188
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.420
computer. They already have, they
buy new windows. If they

189
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.090
buy a new computer and
it comes with windows and

190
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.000
for that, they pay a
much smaller price than they,

191
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.230
if they, you know, go
and buy it off the

192
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:01.900
shelf. So, I mean, we're
talking, you know, a percentage,

193
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.790
a small percentage, and I
don't know what it is,

194
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.390
but you know, $30 as
opposed to $200, right? I

195
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.210
mean, it's that difference? That
much difference. So most people

196
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.890
don't spend very much on
windows now of course, companies

197
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.170
do right companies by, you
know, being license agreements. And

198
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.360
the reason we have all
of the different pricing is

199
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.140
because boy, years and years
ago, when I first started

200
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.060
Microsoft, we were busy pushing
windows into the enterprise because

201
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.430
it wasn't right. It was
kind of a mom and

202
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:39.370
pop operating system. And we
were busy competing against opp

203
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.690
enterprise operating systems like Solaris
and trying to get, you

204
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.990
know, windows and windows server
into the enterprise. And now

205
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.410
it's just a given that
we're there. But part of

206
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.670
what you have to do
there is you have to

207
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.200
have a variety of kinds
of pricing structures because different

208
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.630
companies have different needs when
it comes to how they

209
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.930
spend money on various kinds
of software and services. And

210
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.030
you just have to do
that, not from the consumer

211
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.390
point of view. I think
we went a little crazy

212
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.960
and I think we've been
pulling back on that pretty

213
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.760
well, But doesn't that imply
though, that Apple will, if

214
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.410
they move into the enterprise,
they're gonna need to come

215
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.080
out with like always 10
home premium. I mean, I

216
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.020
don't know if I buy
that Well, it's so it's

217
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.380
interesting. Like I say, I
think we went a little

218
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.220
crazy by applying those same
enterprise pricing principles to the

219
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.800
consumer space. And I think
we've been pulling back on

220
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.220
that pretty hard and that's
useful. And so we figured

221
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.810
that out on the other
hand, you know, if Apple

222
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.960
does push into the enterprise
space, I don't think you'll

223
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.130
see, you know, Oh, it's
10 home premium, but you

224
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.230
will see a bunch of
different pricing structures than they

225
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:52.020
have now simply to work
with the enterprise space. Hi,

226
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.150
this is Scott coming to
you from another place in

227
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.540
time. Are you using agile
practices to manage your software

228
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.820
development? There's lots of tools
in the market that manage

229
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.740
the steps of a project,
but most of them focus

230
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.070
on individual roles. Get ready
for a solution that caters

231
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.590
for the success of the
whole team. Guys at Tellerik

234
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.600
common workspace. Finally companies, regardless
of their size can use

235
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.940
a lightweight and convenient tool.
It makes all the stakeholders

236

237
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.570
countries by combining intuitive user
interface and the power server

238
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.510

on their fan page. facebook.com/t
L E R I K

245
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.390
color. We do appreciate it.
There wouldn't be a Hansel

246
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.070
minutes if there wasn't Tellerik
helping us. So the first

247
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.010
question was like the actual
price or the can one

248
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.860
subsidize the price, like why
aren't we charging 900 bucks

249
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.510
for windows? Well, and of
course, you know, the answer

250
00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.450
is for most people we're
charging far less than $99

251
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.570
from windows. What do you
mean? Do you mean when

252
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.980
we sell it for eight
bucks? When we buy a

253
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.660
PC People by computer windows
comes on? W w so

254
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.640
you're saying we, are you
saying that we make windows

255
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.730
expensive so people won't upgrade?
No, no, I think, well,

256
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.280
I mean, there's different price
points. Now. Now you're talking

257
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:41.800
about the science of, of,
you know, pricing, which is

258
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.780
really about that sweet spot
between how do you maximize

259
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:53.380
not volume or cost, but
revenue, right? Where do you

260
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.860
price a product such that
you get the most money

261
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.550
coming in? You might sell
fewer copies, but if you,

262
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.400
if you lowered the price,
you'd sell more copies, but

263
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.620
make less revenue. And so
that is a black art

264
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:14.170
Microsoft, and not just health
companies have been tweaking and

265
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.130
figuring out for, for, you
know, hundreds of years. And

266
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.950
I don't know how we
come up with our current

267
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.490
formula. I do know that
as a company, Microsoft does

268
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.770
pretty well revenue wise. So
we must be doing pretty

269
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.320
well on the pricing. Of
course, of course. And certainly

270
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.360
I think we know in
listening knows that you're not

271
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.990
in charge of any of
those things and, but this

272
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.880
is an opinion show and
I, you know, and I

273
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.460
definitely, Yeah, I get that.
But do I think that

274
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.770
we would, that people would
like this better if we

275
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.950
charged less for windows? I
don't know. I, I don't

276
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.630
hear a lot of people
complain about the price of

277
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.080
windows to you. I hear
people complain about the price

278
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.410
of windows as it relates
to other things like there's

279
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.540
the complexity of the price,
then there's the actual price

280
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.250
itself, you know? And I've
had people say like, well,

281
00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.770
I want this feature, but
it's an ultimate and Ultimate's

282
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.830
400 bucks. Therefore I can't
have that feature. I see.

283
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.050
So I don't hear people
complain about that so much,

284
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.660
mostly because as I say,
most people, I know that

285
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.910
could windows get it with
the computer they buy, and

286
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.890
it just comes with whatever
version of windows it comes

287
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:19.630
with. But then, but then
you were talking about what

288
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.250
the idea of, of subsidizing
one product with the revenues

289
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.120
from another, do you mean
like, you know, keeping X-Box

290
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.150
afloat while it was in
the red, until it made

291
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.550
profits with money from windows
and office, what are you

292
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:38.380
talking about? There? Keep keeping
X-Box afloat is keeping X-Box

293
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.630
afloat, but making X-Box 50
bucks because we think everyone

294
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.600
should have an Xbox and
we will subsidize money from

295
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.030
advertising and Hotmail to work
on Xbox. You know, I'm

296
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.640
just making something up here.
You know what I mean?

297
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.790
Like, why don't we give
the developer tools away? Why

298
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.340
don't we give visual studio
away for $99 or five

299
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.170
bucks? Oh, well now, you
know, as well as I

300
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.650
do that, we give away
some pretty damn capable versions

301
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.710
of visual studio, right? The
express views, hell I've written

302
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.040
entire books with the express
skews and never missed any

303
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.160
of the features from the
next higher rungs up the

304
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.370
chain. So I think we
do pretty well there. So

305
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.430
you're saying that people, that
the stuff that's inside of,

306
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.670
of express is pretty amazing.
And then we shouldn't complain

307
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.190
about like Intella trace and
things that aren't available in

308
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.390
anything, but ultimately It's interesting.
It seems to me that

309
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.140
this, and this is a
cycle I've just noticed recently

310
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:39.740
is that we use the
non express use as a

311
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:46.250
way to, as a way
to figure out a set

312
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:51.350
of new features and to
develop value and differentiate for

313
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:56.120
that for the ones that
we actually sell. But more

314
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.390
and more we're putting those
kinds of features were, were,

315
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.060
we kind of moved them
down, right? We moved them

316
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.480
more and more features into
the express queue. So whereas

317
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.870
the express use used to
be very bare bones. They're

318
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:14.900
getting more and more features
from the higher level versions

319
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:18.560
that the, for money versions
of visual studio and, you

320
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.100
know, in four years, maybe
in tele trace will be

321
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.290
part of the express and
we'll have a whole nother

322
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.230
set of features that we
charge for in visual studio

323
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:36.020
notes. So do you think
I'm being too idealistic? Well,

324
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:43.010
it's interesting the idea that
companies don't exist to make

325
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.830
money and that you could
go somewhere where that wasn't

326
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:51.500
a concern is kind of
a very Portland cultural idea,

327
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.460
right? We have a bunch
of open source companies here.

328
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.890
And for some reason we
seem to have kind of

329
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.520
a, a generation of, of
people that live here that

330
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.120
are very laid back when
it comes to making money

331
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.400
and they just need, you
know, they're all they're willing

332
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.800
to live with, you know,
three or four roommates and

333
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.980
work at a coffee shop
in the afternoons and not

334
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.430
think too hard about it,
which is a very Portland

335
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.430
cultural idea To give people
context who don't live in

336
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.650
Oregon, who, or maybe people
who are overseas, who are

337
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.810
not familiar with Oregon. So
I live in Portland, Oregon.

338
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.700
You also in fact, live
in Portland, Oregon. So we

339
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.250
are two guys who are
not in Redmond and we

340
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.920
are hopefully not as affected
by the Redmond reality distortion

341
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.990
field. But Portland as a,
as a cultural kind of

342
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.320
Mecca is, is, has a
very San Francisco ASCO kind

343
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.410
of environment, but it's even
a little bit more kind

344
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.210
of Birkenstocks and socks. It's,
we're extremely relaxed here. And

345
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.490
money is not really a
priority over here. And the

346
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.190
open source community just loves
that we've had definitely thrive,

347
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.550
but there's an old joke
that Portland is where young

348
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:02.250
people go to retire. And
that, by the way, that

349
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.400
makes for a very attractive
living environment in a lot

350
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.040
of ways It does, but
there's not a lot of

351
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.710
ruthless moneymakers in Portland. So
you're implying, I think that

352
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.850
maybe my kind of laissez
Faire attitude towards making huge

353
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.830
amounts of money and preferring
a boutique software development company

354
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.630
is related to being a
Portlander. I think that might

355
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:33.060
well be yet. And by
the way, I mean, if

356
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.900
you look at those companies
that use open source, I

357
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.900
believe that they're doing it
to save money so that

358
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.560
they can keep more of
the money they make on

359
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:48.420
the software and services that
they sell. So again, there

360
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.700
are companies like anyone else
that want to make money.

361
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.730
What about company should, do
you think that companies that

362
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.630
have some intellectual property, like,
let's say stack overflow should

363
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.560
give away everything. That's not
the core intellectual property. Like

364
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.350
they've got lots of controls
and processes and logs and

365
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.310
tools around asp.net, MVC that
have nothing to do with

366
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.210
their stack overflowing. Should they
give out all of a

367
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.220
way, just because it's simply
the right thing to do,

368
00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.380
or should they, is that
a waste of their time?

369
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.850
Yeah. Wow. So defined right
thing to do for me.

370
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.140
I mean, if I may
for profit company and I

371
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.840
have, you know, investor money
and revenue to pay software

372
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.010
engineers to produce the software
that I run my business

373
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:40.170
on, I agree that it
would be nice for stack

374
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.220
overflow to give away as
much of it software that

375
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.070
they wanted to, but I
would never make the argument

376
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:51.510
that it is the right
thing to do because they

377
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.350
spent money. They spent their
revenue to produce those. Now

378
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.080
they can gain all kinds
of Goodwill in the developer

379
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.680
community by doing so. And
of course, a lot of

380
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.100
their customers are the developer
community, but I don't think

381
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.250
anyone uses stack overflow or
any of the other second

382
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:12.330
exchange sites, more or less
based on whether they give

383
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.210
away the controls that they
use to build their site.

384
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.040
Do you? No, I think
you're, yeah. Your point is

385
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.840
that people aren't going to
stack overflow is not going

386
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.760
to make more money, whether
they open source their stuff

387
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.820
or not, they will gain
mind share and, and love.

388
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.660
Well, so, so that's the
thing, right? I mean, if

389
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.460
it does it provide a
competitive, if they're not giving

390
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.820
away the family jewels, right.
If they're not giving away

391
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.720
the things that make them
a competitor, they're not enabling

392
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.160
their competitors and they can
gain by giving their stuff

393
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.690
away, then I think that
would be a good thing

394
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.790
for them to do. But,
but again, I don't have

395
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.790
all the details, right. That's
definitely a business decision for

396
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:58.070
them to make. I already
get a ton of benefits

397
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.060
from the stack exchange sites
that exist and that model

398
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.540
that they've produced and the
way that questions and answers

399
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.200
work, and just the whole
things that they've set up.

400
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.690
And I get, I get
benefit because I learn things

401
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.850
on those stack exchange sites,
and those are good for

402
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.550
me. And, you know, if
I was building a site

403
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.850
that I wanted it to
make it work like stack

404
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.070
exchange, it would make my
life easier if it gave

405
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.520
my music controls. But I
don't think that would make

406
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.510
me use stack exchange more
or less. Then why do

407
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.600
I have a sense that
I think releasing source code

408
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:39.250
to help the collective is
a admirable thing for a

409
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.430
person and or a company
to do. And why do

410
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.190
I get so in a
twist when people have perfectly

411
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.550
good source code that would
provide value to a multiplicity

412
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:52.210
of people and they just
sit on it Well. So

413
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.110
I think the reason you
do that is, is the

414
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.930
same reason I do, which
is you and I have

415
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:04.480
dedicated our lives to making
developers' lives better, right? To

416
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.160
the content we produce the,
you know, books in conference

417
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.840
talks and blog posts, and
even tweets and add the,

418
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.160
the thing that gets us
up in the morning and

419
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.240
the thing that we push,
you know, inside of our,

420
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.780
our meetings and, and day
to day in our lives,

421
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.770
right? I mean, Microsoft serves
a large number of kinds

422
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.500
of different kinds of customers
and put the ones that

423
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.830
we have chosen to focus
on are developers. And so

424
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.760
we want to do everything
we can to focus on

425
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:41.650
making developers' lives better. And
so, Hey, if you look

426
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.330
at something, you'd be looking
at, you know, a set

427
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.570
of source code that we
imagine second Ching Chaz, and

428
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.470
you go, Hey, it doesn't
hurt you to give these

429
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.910
away. Why don't you give
them away? You can, of

430
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.420
course, you and I do
this inside of Microsoft all

431
00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.720
the time. There's all this
goodness that happens inside of

432
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.220
Microsoft. And some of it
ships and recharge people and

433
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.290
some of it ships for
free and some of it

434
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.090
doesn't ship at all. Then
we, sometimes we look at

435
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.120
that and we go, wow,
this is really great stuff.

436
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.090
Why don't we give it
away? If, if we're not

437
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.100
going to do anything with
it or, or we haven't

438
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.800
decided what to do with
it, Hey, our first reflex

439
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.020
is let's give it to
our customers and making them

440
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.360
happy. And by the way,
a lot of times, a

441
00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.090
lot, a lot of times
we do that. Sometimes we

442
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:29.200
don't, it's not just stacking
change, right? It's not just

443
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.460
anybody, right? It happens all
the time. But the reason

444
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.980
it puts us in a
twist is cause we want

445
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.590
them, these are our people,
right? These are the ones

446
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:42.940
we want to make happy.
Do you know the, in

447
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.180
Portland, there's a whole lot
Of companies that they're these

448
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.440
kind of open source PHP,
Ruby C you know, open

449
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.830
source, CMS, like, you know,
we do ticket management for

450
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.880
governments, or we do environmental
analysis, impact statements for people

451
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.830
who use our CMS or
whatever. It's that, it's that

452
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.320
kind of like small boutique.
It's usually like, you know,

453
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.580
eight to 35 people with
an open source application and

454
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.380
they sell kind of support.
And you're saying that that

455
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.680
supports a Portland desk who
take lifestyle, but could never

456
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.260
turn into a Microsoft or
Google or anything like that.

457
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.750
Like the thing that Google
really stumbled upon it seems

458
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.900
is advertising. Sure. And by
the way, so did Facebook,

459
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.990
right? Facebook hit the goldmine
with advertising too, Right? And

460
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.840
Facebook is entirely based on
staying connected with your friends

461
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.260
and being narcissistic and Google
is based on looking for

462
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.780
stuff. And since everyone in
the world needs to either

463
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.720
look for stuff or be
very narcissistic, then you pretty

464
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:50.840
much got unlimited money. Well,
it's, it's interesting, but Google

465
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.810
sells eyeballs based on what
people are looking for. And

466
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:57.320
Facebook sells eyeballs based on
what is happening in their

467
00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:02.660
lives. These are both extremely
valuable eyeballs by the way.

468
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.200
And that's why they make
money, hand over fist. And

469
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.220
that's fine. Those are wonderful
business models, but I would

470
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.780
never say, in fact, I
was at a, like a

471
00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.740
startup weekend that happened in
Portland a few weeks ago.

472
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.360
And I just, I just
was there for like four

473
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.790
or five hours to see
the final presentations. But I

474
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.660
was fascinated that there was
these, this group of, I

475
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.710
don't know, it must've been
a fifth year more people

476
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.420
who were there from like
three or four States away,

477
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.440
in some cases, marketing people
and designer people and art

478
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.280
people and developer people and
different kinds of developers, people,

479
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.970
windows, people, non-business people. And
they all came together because

480
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.030
they had this dream of,
Oh, I've got this one

481
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.520
little idea and I'm going
to do it. I'm going

482
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.740
to do it just right.
And I'm going to strike

483
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.430
it rich. And, and this
idea of all of these

484
00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:03.140
venues in the mobile space
and in the web space

485
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.460
where you can, you know,
it's turning into a hit

486
00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.930
based business, just like movies
and music has been it's.

487
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.570
The whole thing is turning
into a hit based business.

488
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.920
And so the whole thing
has been optimized around. What's

489
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.470
this little idea I'm going
to spend a little bit

490
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.330
of time and energy and
see if it takes off.

491
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.340
And if it doesn't that's
all right, I have a

492
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:30.500
dozen more to come right
behind it. That's a pretty

493
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.750
interesting shift in the, in
the software industry that has

494
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.200
really only happened in the
last three, four years. I

495
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.790
think it's fascinating Do w
so if, if, If Apple

496
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.720
Apple sells things because people
consume Google sells it because

497
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.280
they're searching for stuff, Facebook
does it because people want

498
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.840
to see what their friends
are doing. What are we

499
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.810
getting our money from? People
who want to check their

500
00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:02.440
email. Okay. Seriously, like what's
our core, our core thing.

501
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.260
We're the, we're the, we're
the base of the pyramid

502
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.940
where the operating system. Well,
so it's interesting. So absolutely

503
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.430
Microsoft started out as the
base of the pyramid, right?

504
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.720
The operating system. But, you
know, when we started that,

505
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.880
and I can't even say
we, cause I was nowhere

506
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.230
near it, when it happened,
started all that, you know,

507
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.110
the, the operating, having the
idea of an operating system

508
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.890
that worked across a variety
of PC-based architectures was a

509
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.250
big deal. And it opened
up this idea of apps,

510
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.310
right? It was a platform
for apps. And suddenly back

511
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:40.110
then it was, Oh, people
building apps that work across

512
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.600
this variety. That was, that
was a goldmine, right. That

513
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.450
was a moneymaker in the
same way that the mobile

514
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:49.530
platform is today. And then
over time, these things happen,

515
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.960
right? The operating system got
richer and richer and more

516
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.250
and more base functionality. And
then the company itself decided,

517
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.400
well, you know, productivity software
is a huge area. And

518
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.960
so we have office. And
then, and then, you know,

519
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.660
we pushed heavy into the
enterprise and that's where windows

520
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.540
server and all IIS and
asp.net and all of that

521
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.110
work came from. And then
of course, developer tools has

522
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.020
always been a thing because
it's a platform, right? You

523
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.440
need developer tools and in
databases again, in the enterprise

524
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.300
space. And, and now recently
you started with the Xbox,

525
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.500
but you know, the Zune
and a windows phone seven

526
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.720
is really version seven, right?
We've had a bunch of

527
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.230
windows phones before then, right.
Pushing into the consumer space.

528
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:39.660
I think, I think the
thing that is that we

529
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.810
want, that we've always wanted
is windows everywhere, right? We

530
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:48.150
want this set of, of
base capabilities everywhere, whether it's

531
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.490
on your TV, whether it's
on your phone, whether it's

532
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.490
on your PC. And we
want this set of apps

533
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.630
that can work everywhere. And
really, it's not that the

534
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:02.160
apps so much, it's the
data, right? We want a

535
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.940
projection of your data as
appropriate for each of these

536
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.080
devices, no matter which one
you use. And I, I

537
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.110
think that is a laudable
goal. I think that is

538
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.450
in my life. It makes
my life better to be

539
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:21.870
able to get to my
various bits of data and

540
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:28.200
my various applications from each
of these platforms. And every

541
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.680
time we do it better,
more, it makes me happier.

542
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.950
It makes my life better.
I am a fan of

543
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.940
that word. Well, thank you
for taking the time to,

544
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.930
with me today about your
ideas. I don't know how

545
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.520
things are going, but I
know that I'm going to

546
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.280
stay at Microsoft as long
as I can push, push

547
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.760
my agenda. My Portland, my,
my hippie Portland agenda to

548
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:54.070
release it. Well, you keep
pushing it. Scott, you're doing

549
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.610
a good work. All right.
This has been another episode

550
00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:59.590
of Hansel minutes, and I'll
see you again next week.
