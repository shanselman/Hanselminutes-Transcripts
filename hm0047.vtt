Leon Bambrick. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman and do a

14
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.600
you're joining us for another
episode of Hansel minutes. Carl's

15
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.910
taken a break. I think
today he's making dinner for

16
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.060
the family and I am
on my own, but I'm

17
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.480
here joined via the magic
of the internet and long

18
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.740
distance phone calls with my
personal hero. Leon Bambrick from

19
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.660
Australia. You are from Australia.
Is that correct, sir? Where

20
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.770
are you down there? Anyway,
I'm in Brisbane, Brisbane, Queensland.

21
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.430
It's great to be here,
Scott. Yeah, I was pretty

22
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.830
excited to have you on
because you actually, you want

23
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.580
to contest didn't you, you
one time snapper, your product

24
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.140
won Mike <inaudible> contest for
applications. That's right. We won,

25
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.200
we won the LA Lockwood
contest in 2005 and for

26
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.390
a product called time snapper
or at the, at that

27
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.480
time, just for an idea
and a very simple product.

28
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.690
And since then we've turned
it into a professional product

29
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.480
that you can get, you
can now buy and people

30
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.030
do buy and give us
money for So you're actually

31
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.570
making some money on this.
Yeah, yeah. Not, not, not

32
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.930
enough to retire. We've gotten
to the point where money

33
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.280
trickles in constantly. That's cool.
Which is nice. So you

34
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.130
are now a, an ISV
of your own you're independent

35
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.830
software vendor. Well, yeah, Yeah,
I am. It's not, it's

36
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.340
not just me. I'm in
conjunction with my partner at

37
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.440
Lee who's he's from Iceland
and together. We're a micro

38
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.120
ISV as the term coined
by Eric sink. Hi, Eric

39
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.110
sync from a vault source
gear vault. Yeah. So we'll

40
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.370
see a volt Erickson who
wrote some for MSDN. Yeah.

41
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.730
He's a great guy. Self-proclaimed
dot net. Redneck. Yeah, not

42
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.070
a legend. Yeah. He's not
a legend at all. Now

43
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.110
you said you're in Australia.
He's in Iceland. And how

44
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.460
did you meet this guy?
Do you know each other?

45
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.630
No, no, no. I on
I'm on my blog on

46
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.200
secret geek. I said, I
need someone to implement this

47
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.010
idea so we can enter
the competition and just open

48
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.040
it up to whoever wanted
to have a go. And

49
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.200
at least sent me a
really good first cut of,

50
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.260
of Tom snapper of what
became Tom snapper. So how

51
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.390
do you know if someone
on the internet sends you

52
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.340
information and read your blog,
that they are a good

53
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.600
person to get in business
with? Yeah, I dunno. I

54
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.330
think I'm pretty trustworthy. I
think I know. And that's

55
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
never really harmed me yet,
so I'm just going to

56
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.890
stay that way. I think
that's great. But you know,

57
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.090
we agreed from the start
that it was 50%, everything

58
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.600
was 50% and that, that
we were just going to

59
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.150
trust each other and see
how that went and we

60
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.280
haven't looked back. So it's
been great. That's fantastic. It

61
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.670
makes it nice and clean.
Nice and simple handshake partnership.

62
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.850
So you are, I've been
talking about on secret geek

63
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.090
on your blog, a secret
geek.net that you were going

64
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.830
to publish the 25 easy
steps to making your own

65
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.430
micro ISV. Yeah. What I'm
hoping to put out is

66
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.800
a series of articles on
all of the, all of

67
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.930
the steps that we went
through and all the steps

68
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.450
that other people could also
go through to go from

69
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.830
having a free product or
free piece of software to

70
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.050
having one that people can
pay for and that you

71
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.780
can make money out of.
So the steps you have

72
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.540
to go through now, your
product is time snapper, time,

73
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.350
snapper.com or for the shrink
stir people. That's shrink stir.com/l

74
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.680
eight C or, and then
your blog is secret geek.net

75
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.200
that you said Eric sink
was the guy that coined

76
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.040
the term micro ISV at
shrink stir slash L eight

77
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.060
E. And I'm looking here
at a, a list of

78
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.160
25 steps that you emailed
me ahead of time. And

79
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.480
then you're going to put
this up on the net

80
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.780
too. Yeah, I'm going to
put up the 25 steps

81
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.990
and then over time, I'm
going to do articles about

82
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.470
each one, about what basically
mostly what the pitfalls are

83
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.690
for each of those steps.
Like what, where you can

84
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.120
go wrong. And what's the
simplest way to get through

85
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.090
the step because there's, I
mean, there's 25 steps to

86
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.430
get through. That's a lot
of steps, the steps themselves,

87
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.400
aren't that hard. But if
you want to get, if

88
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.810
you want to actually get
through them, then you have

89
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.940
to really get through them
quickly and you have to

90
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.850
try and make progress as
best you can in a

91
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.670
timely manner. Now, some of
these steps seemed obvious to

92
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.340
me like, you know, get
a domain, but some of

93
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.830
them I thought were kind
of a, I wouldn't have

94
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.720
thought about them as being
important steps, but you make

95
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.360
really good points about why
this is really crucial, like

96
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.060
getting really good screenshots. Why
don't we go through these

97
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.550
25 steps and comment a
little bit on them as

98
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.200
we go through them? Is
that okay? Okay. Yeah, that

99
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.050
sounds great. Yep. So you're
going to step one on

100
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.180
the, on the Leon list
is registered domain. Yeah. That's,

101
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.980
that's like, seems like the
really obvious easy one, but

102
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.750
I think that's where people
start to go wrong, right?

103
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.930
From the start, the trick,
the probably the hardest thing

104
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.030
is you have to realize
that you should be registering

105
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.360
a domain for your product.
Not for your company. You

106
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.390
don't start off by saying
I'll register microsoft.com for, you

107
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.000
know, whatever my company name
is. And then I'll register

108
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.660
windows.com, whatever your product is,
you start with the product

109
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.870
because you've only got one
product. If you're lucky, if

110
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.570
you can get to have
one product. So focus on

111
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.900
the product first, and don't
worry about whether you're going

112
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.810
to have a company that
has 10 products under it

113
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.540
or whatever, because that's, that's
blue sky thinking you don't

114
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.210
need to go that far.
So you start with just

115
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.760
the product name, register that,
and don't stick on a

116
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.600
product name until you've got
the domain. That's that's the

117
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.260
trick there. I think That's
a great idea because I

118
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.180
don't even know what your
company's name is. And I

119
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.900
guess considering I'm a potential,
a person who would buy

120
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.610
your software. I don't really
care, but I know that

121
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.980
if I go to time,
snapper.com I'll get information about

122
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.530
it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
and our, our company is

123
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.930
Tom snapper.com. And if later
we want to have a

124
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.930
different company, then that's, that's
fine too. And we can

125
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.680
have more, more products under
that name. So yeah, it's

126
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.740
not, I assume for Google
ability that having a product

127
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.390
name be the same as
the domain name would mean

128
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.850
when I search for time
snapper that your, your domain

129
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.320
comes up first. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. That's right. And that's,

130
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.840
that's the thing with, with
the D with the product

131
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.420
name, you know, you want
it Google-able, there's a lot

132
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.070
of, there's a lot of
things to do with your

133
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.890
website to make it Google-able
if that's a word, but

134
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.430
the, the, the name right
from the start should be

135
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.130
like, so the name.net, for
example, is not a good

136
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.710
name, I would say, because
it's not, when you Google

137
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.890
for the words.net, you find
all sorts of stuff about

138
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.970
the top level domain, not
just about microsoft.net. So Yeah,

139
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.800
that's a good point. If
you have to put this

140
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.770
as an interesting point, yours
is you're, you're a product

141
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.170
called time snapper. One word.
There's no space because adding

142
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.480
a space would make it
harder to Google for. Yeah,

143
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.470
exactly. Right. And we had
lots of potential names. Like

144
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.320
we weren't w when we
won the competition originally back

145
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.140
then we were called just
snapper. Snapper is not a

146
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.030
domain. We could get our
hands on. Of course, cause

147
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.490
it's too easy. It's too
easily. You sort of use

148
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.580
up. And so we just
came up with 20 different

149
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.300
possible names. It was like
time, grab a time collector,

150
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.240
snapper time, every, every possible
thing we could. And we

151
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.890
just didn't commit to any
of them until we had

152
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.810
a domain for one of
them. And then once you've

153
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.220
got that one you want,
then you've got to love

154
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.170
the one you're with, you
know, you find the one

155
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.630
you want and you stick
with it. And that seems

156
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.560
to work. Now you also
say here, step two, reliable

157
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.230
hosting, do not host yourself.
Now, a lot of the

158
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.120
kind of dotnet nerds that
I hang out with are

159
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.790
all about hosting their own
stuff. They got the server

160
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.770
rooms in their houses, but
you don't, you don't think

161
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.710
that's a good idea. No,
I, I don't. I, I

162
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.300
just do not understand that
man. And tell the at

163
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.370
all, just because you've got
a nice server, it doesn't

164
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.960
mean it's going to be
better than the servers that

165
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.720
are in the racks of
servers that are managed 24

166
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.400
seven at a hosting company
at a reliable hosting company.

167
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.940
And when you, when you
put a product online, because

168
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.170
it's an executable or installer
package or whatever, the file

169
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.720
itself is a little bit
bigger and you have much

170
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.510
more bandwidth issues and nothing
is going to make you

171
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.530
look less professional than having
your website down. There's no

172
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.210
quicker way to kill, and
it doesn't cost anything. It

173
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.280
costs, I think it costs
us 10 us dollars a

174
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.000
month or something maybe less
even, but it costs almost

175
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.650
nothing to get good, reliable
hosting That implies that if

176
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.870
you're, if your personal hosted
site was down, if you

177
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.250
were hosting this out of
your house and it was

178
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.370
down for more than a
few minutes, you've just wasted

179
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.400
that money. I mean, if
you're not in the business

180
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.310
of hosting, if you're trying
to make a product hosting

181
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.780
your own stuff, if it's
down for any time at

182
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.560
all, that's wasted time. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, hosting seems

183
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.080
to be a commodity market
where people will go for

184
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.170
the, they compete very hard
and they have the cheapest

185
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.270
prices they can. So you
can't really do it at

186
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.320
home for cheaper. Yeah. So
I'm a hundred percent behind

187
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.500
paying for hosting rather than
hosting it yourself. And that

188
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.930
message goes out to you.
Jeff Atwood, whose website was

189
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.330
down for a few days
last week. Yeah. Sorry, just

190
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.900
let me throw that out
of his garage now, number

191
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.380
three, website and website design.
And here's something that you

192
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.950
say that I cannot agree
with more in an instant,

193
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.440
the user should be able
to find download and screenshots.

194
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.330
That's the first thing I
look for. I wish the

195
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.550
screenshots were on the homepage
of every site. Cause that's

196
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.490
what I want to see.
Yep. Yeah. Okay then. Yeah.

197
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.640
That's, that's interesting. Cause I
mean, you download more free

198
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.710
software I think, than just
about anyone else on the

199
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.640
planet free and professional software.
And, and yeah. I find

200
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.980
that when I go to
a site that has downloads,

201
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.290
I want to see the
word download and I want

202
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.200
to see the screenshots and
my attention span is really,

203
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.750
really short. And if I
can't find those, then I've

204
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.060
already moved away. Even if
it's the best product. Sorry.

205
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.630
Yeah. I've, I've not downloaded
a product because I couldn't

206
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.240
find screenshots. Yeah. Yeah. You
don't know what you're going

207
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.620
to get. Is it worth
your time? You know? And,

208
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.690
and so yeah, Of course
I've also downloaded a product

209
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.340
and a not installed it
because it was like a

210
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.520
visual basic three installer. And
I got scared when the

211
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.070
screen filled with that blue
gradient and I said, Oh

212
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or the
really early wise installer. Yeah.

213
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.620
Yeah. Not cool. Now in
step four, you basic website

214
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.640
content, you said that you
could use a content management

215
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.630
system, but do you prefer
static? Well, I, I prefer

216
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.940
to, I think you want
to do the simplest thing.

217
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.270
You can, I mean, content
management systems, there's no limit

218
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.480
to how complex, complex and
complicated they can be. Cause

219
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.300
they go right from right.
You know, they go right

220
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.250
to the top end where
you're publishing something like the

221
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.190
New York times and you haven't
throwing out thousands of articles

222
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.980
a day for, for this
kind of a thing for

223
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.220
a product it's, it's mostly
just a few static pages

224
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:49.040
that say, you know, your
release notes and download here

225
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.170
sort of stuff. So you
can, can get away with

226
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.110
static pages. But having said
that the, the, the trick

227
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.770
is that some, some pages
will change. And also because

228
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.870
you have a consistent look
and feel on each page,

229
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.530
you might use what I
use is server-side includes to

230
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.110
just include my, the menus
and the bit at the

231
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.180
top and the bit at
the bottom. Cause they change

232
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.980
often and you want to
only change them in one

233
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.220
place. So by just using
service side includes, which is

234
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.910
just a, a basic HTML
technology, what's the service side,

235
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.560
HTML technology you avoid having
to set up a CMS

236
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.690
and worry about that, or
we'll have to buy a

237
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.330
CMS or anything like that.
And, and you know, you

238
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.270
get the best of both
worlds. I can totally see

239
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:35.700
somebody writing a product and
then getting all intense on

240
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.640
writing a website to support
that product. But there's so

241
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.620
many other things set up
to do that work for

242
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.650
you. Just like the hosting
point you made content management

243
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.330
is certainly, I don't want
to write a shopping cart.

244
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.020
I think that in 2007,
someone's probably solved the shopping

245
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.860
cart problem. Not something I
want to get in the

246
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.480
business of doing. And same
thing like in traffic monitoring

247
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.390
is your step five here,
the package, but you know,

248
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.250
Google analytics, it's ridiculously functional
and Yeah, look, it looks

249
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.190
brilliant. We're not using it
yet. And I think we

250
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.840
should, because I think we're
going to go that way

251
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.270
in a few months so
that we can get better

252
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.980
info. Like we just, we
put out a new release

253
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.770
a few days ago and
we've only got very rough

254
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.180
stats on how many people
found it automatically because of

255
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.730
the automatic check for updates
feature and things like that.

256
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.650
And I think with Google
analytics, we'd be able to

257
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.980
get enough detail to know
more about that. So yeah,

258
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.580
Google analytics, AWS stats is
the one we use and

259
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.180
that comes free, but there's,
you know, there's lots of

260
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.030
statistics packages in the past.
I wrote, I wrote my

261
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.680
own for something. And that
was just a waste of

262
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.720
time. You know, that's a
solved problem that you don't

263
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.500
need to resolve yourself, but
yeah, you know, there's certain

264
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.110
info you need, you need
to know how much traffic

265
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.290
you're getting, where it's coming
from, how many downloads, you're

266
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:53.420
getting. One of the interesting
things for us to look

267
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.200
at with the ratio of
how many people download the

268
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.320
free version versus how many
people downloaded the professional. Now

269
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.710
what's the difference in your
product? Well, for us, the

270
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.040
free version is, well, it's
the original version we came

271
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.470
up with. It doesn't have
a database. It doesn't use

272
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.280
a database to record all
the extra information about a

273
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.800
screenshot when it takes one.
So they're basically, there's more

274
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.950
features in the professional version
and the professional version is

275
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.220
a bigger download and we
don't have an, an installer

276
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.490
for the free version. You
basically download it as zip

277
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.280
and, and get it from
there. You know, which reminds

278
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.470
me, we forgot to tell
people what the product does.

279
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.150
The product takes screenshots on
a regular intervals. And basically

280
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.520
I call it TiVo for
your desktop. It lets you

281
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.040
see what the heck you
were doing four hours ago

282
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.200
when you're filling out your
time card, which is a

283
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.560
huge problem for, for people,
especially who have a little

284
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.320
attention deficit disorder and you
get a little off and

285
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.850
you what you want to
bill for your time, but

286
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.650
you don't want to build
people for surfing. So you

287
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.160
can go back and say,
I spent a half an

288
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.500
hour working on this at
15 minutes working on that.

289
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.450
And then I surf the
web for 15 minutes. You

290
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.760
keep all of that in
screenshots. And it doesn't take

291
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.950
up a lot of space.
What's a days where the

292
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.180
screenshots cost. Yeah. You know,
it depends on how you

293
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.960
want, what settings do you
use? Cause you can, if

294
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.940
you want, you can have
them as tiny little thumbnails.

295
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.370
That was the original idea
for the product. I thought

296
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.560
that that thumbnails were all,
you could probably fit on

297
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.570
a computer, but it turns
out we've got really big,

298
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.180
hard drives nowadays and you
can fit a lot of

299
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.700
biggest screenshots on your computer.
So it's just as much

300
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.930
as you want it to
take up for me. I

301
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.290
have about maybe two, two
gig worth of images for

302
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.230
the last few weeks or
the last few months. But

303
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.230
that's, I'm probably more of
an extreme case. That's not

304
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.790
bad at all. It's, I'll
be a couple of gigs

305
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.900
for that much for that
much information. That's great. Yeah.

306
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.970
Yeah. I mean, you know,
what's a gig these nights.

307
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.980
You've got to, you've got
typically, if you're not on

308
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.220
a laptop than you might
have 200, 400 gig there,

309
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.990
it's not all used up
yet because you haven't downloaded

310
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.800
when effects, you know, so
Pretty performance. I mean, taking

311
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.020
a screenshot every couple of
minutes, it doesn't, it doesn't

312
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.650
cause slow the system down
I've I haven't noticed any

313
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.650
slow down. And I, I
assumed before when I first

314
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.300
came up with the idea
and I didn't implement it,

315
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.400
the reason I didn't implement
it was cause I thought

316
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.890
now this is never going
to work and then actually

317
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.290
implemented it and I ran
it and I thought this

318
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.740
is amazing. There's no, there's
no, there's no slow down.

319
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.040
It doesn't take up too
much room. It's just, it's

320
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.680
stupidly easy. It's it's really
good. You're just using the

321
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.240
print window in 32 API.
Yeah. He uses the, the

322
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.440
wind 32 API is to
do it, but the, the

323
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.230
bad solution that other people
use sometimes we'll use up

324
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.430
your clipboard, but he doesn't
do that. Oh, okay. So

325
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.080
he does it without affecting
anything you're doing on the

326
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.300
clipboard now. No step number
six or create forums. Is

327
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.300
it important for an ISV
to have a site that

328
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.090
is a blog? Do you
have RSS feeds for like

329
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.820
news and release notes or
is a forum enough for

330
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.610
this kind of feedback? Yeah,
I suppose because I've already

331
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.230
got a blog and I
don't want to split my,

332
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.840
we do actually have a
blog on Tom snapper, but

333
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.900
we don't use it just
because we've got community server

334
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.930
in there. So you get,
you get that with it.

335
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.130
But for me, no, I
don't have a blog for

336
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.200
Tom snapper itself. It probably
is a good idea for

337
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.420
someone if they don't have
any blog at all and

338
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.820
they're putting out a micro
ISV, they're putting out a

339
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.270
product to have a blog
to where they can put

340
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.120
out information and put out
other things for me, I

341
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.950
don't have a blog on
it, but then, you know,

342
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.690
I write about it on
secret geek and people seem

343
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.520
to read that. So, so
that works out. Okay. The

344
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.830
forum though, I think is
a very important idea. It's

345
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.270
something that, that Eric sinks
talked about in his book,

346
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.110
business and software. Yeah, that
was a very good book

347
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.310
in business and software talked
about having a forum so

348
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.410
that people so that you
can find out everything from

349
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.050
the customers directly, rather than
just reading it when they're

350
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.610
complaining on their own blog
so that you bring the

351
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.220
news to you rather than
let, rather than have to

352
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.020
go and search everywhere else
for what the bugs are

353
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.490
on your product. And so
on. Now, do you use

354
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.430
a pH BB or do
you use community server for

355
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:07.520
your forum? Initially, initially we
used Google groups and really

356
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.070
similar also to Yahoo groups.
And that, that was a

357
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.830
good idea that worked out
really well. The good thing

358
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.110
with Google groups is that,
you know, it's a really

359
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.790
professional piece of software. It's
really, it's really well done.

360
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.840
The bad. The downside though,
is that, you know, people

361
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.850
have to go to someone
else's site, not your own

362
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.720
and the ads there are
potentially for your competitors and

363
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.050
so on. So it doesn't
look really as professional as

364
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.930
hosting it on your own
page, An ad sense thing

365
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.540
pop up. That would be
there. The competitor notice, you

366
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.910
know, Google notice that they're
talking about time sheets and

367
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.330
then your competitor pops up.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, they

368
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.270
could, they could purchase keywords
like Tom snapper as a

369
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.370
keyword. And then you could
say, Hey, you don't use

370
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.520
time snapper use this. You
know? So yeah. So that's

371
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.740
the only downside to Google
groups, but it's a really

372
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.290
good piece of software. You
allow feedback from the help

373
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.970
menu. I always thought it
was great when I go

374
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.490
to the help menu of
any piece of software and

375
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.200
I look in the help
menu and it says, report

376
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.550
a bug, make a suggestion.
Sometimes I've seen applications that

377
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.760
will let you actually suggest
a feature. And then it'll

378
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.660
actually bring up a screenshot
of the application that you're

379
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.390
currently commenting on. Allow you
to annotate it by drawing

380
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.670
on it and then send
the screenshot along with your

381
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:25.820
comments off to Really cool.
Yeah. Windows, windows, one care

382
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.610
windows one care had a
really great feature where they

383
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.370
had a little smiley face
and a frowny face. I

384
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.160
think office 2007 did this.
When you've had a great

385
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.560
experience. You double click on
the smiley face, they take

386
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.380
a screenshot and they ask
you what was great and

387
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.250
vice versa. If something is
bad, you allow someone to

388
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.630
go straight to your forums
from your help menu. Yeah.

389
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.570
Well, I don't know if
we do. We definitely don't

390
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.270
have the suggest feature link,
but I'm just writing that

391
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.450
down now because that's, that's
fantastic. Cool. We'll be putting

392
00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.380
that in the annotate. The
screenshot idea. Yeah. That's a

393
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.390
good one. I like that.
I've seen that a couple

394
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.950
of times, but I think
it's just, it's a little

395
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.510
bit of Polish, you know,
it's like a couple of

396
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.910
years ago, we didn't think
auto update was important, but

397
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.940
now if you don't say
check for updates or it's

398
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.810
just considered unprofessional. So you
say create forums, that's number

399
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.920
six, maintain a FAC that's
important. We talked about screenshots,

400
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.320
get the best screenshots. Number
eight, email There's one trick

401
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.070
with screenshots that I've noticed
is you've got to use

402
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.840
the best theme you can't
like. Say if it's for

403
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.720
a windows application, then you've
got to use the best

404
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.480
theme you can. I noticed
like when windows XP first

405
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.400
came out, that all of
these sites suddenly all their

406
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.800
screenshots were updated and they
all had the windows XP

407
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.260
look and feel. And for
most of us out there

408
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.680
that were still on windows
2000 or windows 98, you

409
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.070
look at it and go,
Oh, that looks I'll have

410
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.020
to look at that same
trick. So you're saying that

411
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.530
the, the classic windows theme
could actually discourage people from

412
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.980
downloading. It just doesn't feel
Well. Yeah. It just it's.

413
00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.080
You can just go that
little step extra, you know,

414
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.210
like we use the media,
the media theme Royale. It's

415
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.260
a nice thing. Royal blue.
That is a very nice

416
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.620
thing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I
had someone comment yesterday on

417
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.670
the laptop. I shouldn't have.
Oh, nice. Yeah. The little

418
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.830
tricks I think are worth
doing. Yeah. I'm running the

419
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.380
Zune theme now, but I
actually was running Royale just

420
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.710
before that. That's a great
theme. There was a Royal

421
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.850
Royal Nero where it was
black. It looks good, but

422
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.940
I didn't get my hands
on it. So best screenshots

423
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.120
you can you say configure
your email? Of course. And

424
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.400
then number 10, you talking
about, get payments now you're

425
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.590
international. You've got a guy
in Iceland. You've got your

426
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.110
in Australia. I assume a
lot of your customers are

427
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.660
from the U S and
the North America, North American

428
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.690
continent. PayPal. Is that really
the best way for a

429
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.450
micro ISV to get started?
Even at an international one?

430
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.570
Well, I don't, I don't,
I don't know anything else.

431
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.580
I mean, it works fine
for us. We've had no

432
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.670
problems if you, if you
Google for PayPal and you

433
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.100
can find lots of people
with problems, but you know,

434
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.140
if you Google through for
water, you can probably find

435
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.050
people with problems. So, you
know, everything, everyone complains about

436
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.600
something. It seems to work
for us. What is an

437
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.240
alternative? The other alternatives I've
seen, like, you know, there's

438
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.940
the big kind of draconian
ones, like digital river that

439
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.970
had been around for years
and there's five or six

440
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.150
that I do affiliate programs
for, but they take huge,

441
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.090
huge amounts of, of your,
they want to distribute your

442
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.760
software and they take, you
know, 30, 40% of the

443
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.730
profits just for the privilege.
I don't think Google doesn't

444
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.490
really like Google rather, but
PayPal doesn't really care about

445
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.370
that. Right? What do they
take? Three, 4%. The central

446
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.770
has, I don't know, four
40, cause our products 40

447
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.550
us dollars and they take
$1 20 thereabouts. So yeah,

448
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.890
maybe that's 3% get a
couple of percent or so

449
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.200
bad at all. Yeah. Yeah.
So, and, and you know,

450
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.800
you get your money, so
you don't really care at

451
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.900
that point, if they take
a dollar out or something,

452
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.060
because otherwise without their help,
you wouldn't have gotten a

453
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.450
cent. So Now you didn't
put anything about pricing on

454
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.910
your 25 steps or how
did you decide on $40?

455
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.900
Cause I'm a big fan
of 12, 1995. Cause 40

456
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.450
bucks is enough to make
me think, but 20 bucks

457
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.150
I ah, 20 bucks, the
next thing I know it's

458
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.430
gone, I've paid it. You
know, how do you decide

459
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:12.720
that? Look, it's not easy.
I feel bad charging anything

460
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.370
for starters. I mean, there's
so much free software that

461
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.070
is just brilliant. You know,
look something like Lutz road

462
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.530
is reflected on it. There's
so much, really good software

463
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.930
that you can get for
free. So it's very hard

464
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.710
to put a price on
it. But with Tom snapper,

465
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.010
for the, particularly for the
original 2.0 edition, we thought

466
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.380
$40 was probably a bit
steep, but we were willing

467
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.690
to put it on there
because we've got a plant.

468
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.230
Cause, cause we've got more
functionality that's going to come

469
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.550
in yet. We're sort of
going somewhere with it and

470
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.330
so priced and you can't
really creep the price up

471
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.400
all the time. You can,
but it doesn't look very

472
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.790
nice. So we started so
we've So as you add

473
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.920
functionality, you don't want to
hike up the price, but

474
00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:59.050
you're going to give free
updates. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah,

475
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.290
I don't know. W we've
listened. It's about balancing the

476
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.300
amount of complaints about the
price versus the amount of

477
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.570
sales. So we're happy with
it at the moment we've

478
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.520
had one or two people
say it could have been

479
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.550
lower. We don't have anyone
say it should be more,

480
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.800
but I'm sure I'm happy
with it. You know, there's

481
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.700
a, there's a quote from
Eric sink in that business

482
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.220
of software where he said,
he said, you know that

483
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.920
whatever price you put, people
will complain. He said, if

484
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.320
you gave the software away
for free, people would complain

485
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.030
that you were taking up
space on their hard drive.

486
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.000
And then if you, if
you had people, if you

487
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.060
had Selma Hayek in a
bikini, go around and install

488
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.790
the software on someone's computer,
someone would complain that they

489
00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:42.040
prefer blondes. Yeah. Nice that
Eric sinks product pricing link

490
00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.080
is up at shrink stir
slash L H I. And

491
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.350
you've put, you've given us
a whole list of links

492
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.420
that we're not going to
be able to mention within

493
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.600
the scope of the, our
little short podcast here, but

494
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.370
I'll, I'll put all of
them up on the site.

495
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.520
So just a reminder about
The, the, the other pricing.

496
00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.870
The one that really made
me think a lot about

497
00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:04.030
pricing was Joel Spolsky's article
camels and rubber duckies. We've

498
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.130
got that here somewhere. Here
we go. L L H

499
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:13.000
H L H, that that,
that article really shows you

500
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.050
and also pricing, I think
sends a message. So if

501
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.140
you underprice yourself, you've, you,
you will be out of

502
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.740
business. So If you, if
you under price, you're sending

503
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.140
a message that you don't
care about your product. Yeah.

504
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.900
Yeah. Although, you know, I
remember the funny, the funniest

505
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.380
product pricing story that I've
got is that you're familiar

506
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.280
with Nancy, right. And ant
it's the.net make file, you

507
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.530
know, it's free, right. And
everybody uses Nant and tell

508
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.930
him, this bill came out
and a guy came out

509
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:45.790
with Nant pad, basically an
editor for NAND files, 85

510
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:49.480
bucks. And he was, he
was laughed. It's a free

511
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.390
piece, making an editor for
a, for an XML file

512
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.720
format for an XML file
for a free product. Anyone

513
00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.640
at $85 originally he wanted
249 and he was laughed

514
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.890
down to 85. And it
turned out the reason that

515
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.230
it was 85 is that
he was doing it through

516
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.660
digital river or some distributor.
And it was, they were

517
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.510
taking such a huge chunk
of money from him, this

518
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.730
particular software distributor. That was
the only way he could

519
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.860
make any money at all.
Of course, that faded away

520
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.620
into nothingness. But I still
maintain to this day that

521
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.630
if he had charged 20
bucks and use PayPal or

522
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.580
something like that, he would
have had a great product.

523
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.690
It would have made a
little bit of money for

524
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.840
himself. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough.
I mean, look, net net

525
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.500
falls having to edit them
is, is probably the, one

526
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.020
of the biggest drawbacks of
using that, having to edit,

527
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.430
because you're kind of doing
scripting when you're editing in

528
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.010
that file and scripting in
XML is sort of wrong.

529
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.230
I mean, you put out
an article once about that.

530
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.860
Notepad is not an XML
editor and you know that

531
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.560
with Nat and you get
into that situation. So yeah,

532
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.530
Nick has a good idea,
but it might've priced himself

533
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.490
out of the market. Speaking
of XML, now, step number

534
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.400
12 on the 25 steps
to starting a micro ISV,

535
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.730
you say, create a pad
file, a portable application description.

536
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.040
This is news to me.
This is some XML file

537
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.010
that is read by CA
Yeah. Yeah. This is, this

538
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:07.370
is a shareware thing. And
you know, if you're putting

539
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.860
out software that has a
free version or that has

540
00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.800
a trial, then you fit
the loose definition of shareware

541
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.430
a pad file. Yeah. It's
an XML file. You put

542
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.360
it on your site, much
like an RSS file or

543
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.280
a bit more like an
open EML file. And it

544
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.290
says, this is what my
product is. This is what

545
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.630
version I'm up to. This
is how big it is.

546
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.400
Here's the short description of
it all with all the

547
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.830
information, lots more than that.
Lots of information about your

548
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.380
product, put it on your
fault. It then gets polled

549
00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.650
every day by all the
different download sites. And if

550
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.840
you update the file like
we did just yesterday, then,

551
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.180
then as I've been getting
today, you get lots of

552
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.450
emails saying, yes, we detect
that you have updated your

553
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.150
product. And it is now
updated on our download site.

554
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.390
You're kidding. That's fantastic. I
had a, and this has

555
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.430
been around a few years.
Oh, I'm like really? I

556
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.770
had a 1998. I came
out in 1998. I came

557
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.620
out with a Palm pilot
program for diabetics and I

558
00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.440
spent, I spent 20% of
my time running around to

559
00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.810
websites and registering it and
letting them know about new

560
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.800
versions. And even today, some
of those sites know about

561
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.710
incredibly old versions because I've
forgotten to go back or

562
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.650
log in what a great
idea. I didn't know that

563
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.740
existed. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't
done any of the work

564
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.870
with that, at least on
all the work there. So

565
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.870
before I get around to
writing the article on this,

566
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.940
I've got to get more
information from him about that.

567
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.820
But as I understand, that's
the basic idea, Commercial apps

568
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.940
do sorry. Do commercial apps
do that? This Photoshop had

569
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.200
one of these. Cause I'd
love to know when there's

570
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.140
a new version of a
commercial product or flat. I

571
00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.420
bet they do. Yeah. Yeah.
Actually I wouldn't put money

572
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.810
on it. I'm going to
look into that stuff. Yeah.

573
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.700
Because it, any, anything that
you see@likedownload.com, all of those

574
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.530
products probably have pad falls
and there's a free tool

575
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.360
that you use for writing
them because it's much like

576
00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.980
the Nan thing. You don't
want to write XML by

577
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.070
hand and you can get
that from L a R

578
00:28:55.490 --> 00:29:00.260
Shrinks.com/l eight R Yeah. Shrinks
down. It's a little bit

579
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.900
dodgy that Pat Jen thing
I thought, or it's a

580
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.090
little bit, in fact, the
whole pad format is a

581
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.790
little bit funny. There's just
something very shareware about it.

582
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.070
Yeah. Well, when people pull,
when people pull XML out

583
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:14.240
of their butts, it usually
isn't have a schema. It

584
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.970
might, I'm not sure When
people make up XML, it

585
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.870
sometimes comes out smelly, doesn't
it? Yeah. Yeah. And it

586
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.030
might have a schemer. It's
just got a, it's got,

587
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.540
you know, there's a lot
of variety in software and

588
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:28.130
it has to handle for
everything. So it's nice. Now

589
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.420
you've got things about registering
it, dot download.com and things

590
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.090
about making sure you get
a ULA, you know, talk

591
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.990
to the lawyers and make
sure that if anyone kills

592
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.070
themselves while using your product,
that you don't get sued.

593
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.150
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I Think
that's one of the steps

594
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.070
that, that stops a lot
of people, they sort of

595
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.140
go, Oh, you know, if
I make a professional product,

596
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.910
then I have to have
an end user license agreement.

597
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.620
And I don't know how
to do that. And I

598
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.000
certainly don't want to talk
to a lawyer because I

599
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.120
hate lawyers, but it's not,
it's not a terribly hard

600
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.190
thing to do. It's pretty
easy. And there's a lot

601
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.050
of, there's a lot of
websites that will help you

602
00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.170
with it. And there's obviously
millions and millions of example,

603
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.560
end user license agreements that
you can liberally steal from.

604
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.720
And that you can learn
from. You can see how

605
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.450
they work and where they,
how they put together their

606
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.420
content. And then once you've
done a draft yourself, you've

607
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.130
got to get it checked
over. I mean, for us,

608
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.660
I have a friend, I
have a few friends that

609
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.390
are lawyers. I recommend that,
you know, cause I spent

610
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.100
a bit of time in
prison. No, no, no. But

611
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.060
I recommend that to everyone
to get it done for

612
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.430
free from a friend because
plenty of friends ask us

613
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.080
to help them with their
computers. So why not? And

614
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.270
that's Now speaking of naughty
people in prison, how do

615
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.420
you deal with licensing day?
People ever steal timestamp. Sorry.

616
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.480
Do people steal time? Speaking
of prisons. Yeah. Well like

617
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.670
you've got this whole thing
about licensing. Like I found

618
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.940
out that my gluco pilot,
blood sugar, my freaking blood

619
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.880
sugar blood sugar program was
stolen and there was a

620
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.920
crack put out for it
within a few weeks of

621
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.990
its release. That's terrible. See,
I was thinking that now

622
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.180
that that's a fairly niche
product you've got there, right?

623
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.210
You'd hope. Well, I mean,
think about it handheld diabetic

624
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.720
management. And apparently there was
a diabetic hacker in Russia

625
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.510
somewhere who felt the need
to crack it. Presumably that

626
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.240
just told me that every
single product with a licensing

627
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.410
key scheme is at some
point hacked, someone wants to

628
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.450
give a crack for it.
He searched for time snapper

629
00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.060
and wears. And maybe someone's
got a thing. How do

630
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.010
you manage that? Do you
feel that people steal from

631
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:24.540
you very much? I think
you don't worry about it

632
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.670
too much. Just to some
extent you say, okay, well,

633
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.550
if someone really wants to,
then they they'll, they will

634
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:34.110
be able to get around
it, but you just make

635
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.970
a few steps to make
it a bit harder so

636
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.580
that it's so that they
might be compelled to instead

637
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.460
buy the product. But what
we've got, like, you can't

638
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.650
just get a cracked license
key that wouldn't work for

639
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.830
it because it has to
validate over the internet. So

640
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.260
it has to be key
that hasn't yet been used

641
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.500
by anyone that we've created
specifically in relation to one

642
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.430
sale. Do you have a
database of licensed keys? There

643
00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.150
isn't a scheme that you
could just invent that's right.

644
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.880
So you know exactly how
many copies are out there

645
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.310
in the world. Yes. Is
how many licensed copies. Yeah.

646
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.580
So that lots of people
would, might have it on,

647
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.030
on trial, but all the
people that have it licensed,

648
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.940
we've got their license key.
So Now you obfuscated your

649
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.130
code though, too. You're saying
that, you know, people may

650
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.410
steal you make it harder
for them. You did choose

651
00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.960
to obfuscate the code. Cause
you mentioned reflector earlier. Lutz

652
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.330
has reflector. Yeah. Intellectual property
is important. Yeah. Look, it's

653
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.190
not so much to protect
the intellectual property of the

654
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.610
tool itself. As in, you
know, taking screenshots and storing

655
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:40.400
them, it's more to protect
the licensing so that to

656
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.250
protect the whole overall investment
in effort, you know, I

657
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:47.240
feel like, like, you know,
pretty main person for the

658
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.270
scaling it because I'm all
for putting out code and

659
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.010
sharing code and I'll put
out a lot of little

660
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.010
things when I can, but
just, just so that it

661
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.870
would make it that much
harder to crack the licensing

662
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.900
scheme so that people were
compelled to buy it. If

663
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.670
they wanted the professional edition.
I mean, there's a free

664
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.110
edition. If you, if you
don't want to spend any

665
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.410
money, that's a free edition.
That is not time limited

666
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.800
or anything. It just has
a few less features. So

667
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.750
yeah. So on one hand
I feel bad for obfuscating

668
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.440
it, but there is that
it's basically obfuscated just to

669
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.770
stop people from being able
to crack the licensing. That's

670
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.190
the only real It was
put, it was putting out

671
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.840
a free version you had,
I mean, this is the

672
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.820
thing that's kind of unique.
I see a lot of

673
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.360
share where there's nag, where
and different ads supported applications.

674
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.600
But I think your product
is kind of a classy

675
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.970
for lack of a better
word, because you actually have

676
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:38.290
a completely free version that
has features that are useful

677
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.590
and it's compelling all by
itself. And it doesn't constantly

678
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.950
remind you to register along
with your professional edition. Was

679
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.810
that a difficult decision to
decide to actually have a

680
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.540
totally free version? No, no,
it wasn't at all. I

681
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.960
think it depends on what,
what the product or the

682
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.090
areas you've got. I mean,
I, I think that's the

683
00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:56.890
way to do it. I
think if you've got an

684
00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:00.130
idea that's good enough or
that has enough potential to

685
00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:01.960
grow, then you'll be able
to do that. You'll be

686
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.230
able to have a simple,
free edition that's compelling and

687
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:08.410
a professional edition that has
enough extra features to also

688
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:10.570
be compelling. And you'll be
able to sort of move

689
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:13.900
up from there. But if,
if your, if your lowest

690
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.190
low end edition really has
all the features of the

691
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.740
best one anyway, then you
really can't do what we've

692
00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.950
done. And you're going to
miss out on a lot

693
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:26.500
of customers because then because
for most people, there's going

694
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.750
to be nothing there for
them because most people aren't

695
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.640
going to want to pay
for it. So I mean,

696
00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.130
if people have got the
free one, then, okay, they're

697
00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.050
not a customer, they're not
a paying customer, but we

698
00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.050
still consider them a customer
because they're using code that

699
00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:39.580
we've written and that's, so
that's a sort of a

700
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.820
joy in itself, you know,
and they might talk to

701
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.890
other people and they might
eventually become a customer. And

702
00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.890
if not, they might just
give us feedback that helps

703
00:34:47.890 --> 00:34:50.830
us improve it for others.
So as long as you've

704
00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:53.350
got an idea, that's got
enough growth in it, then

705
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:56.230
it's worth. Then I think
you can put out a

706
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.060
free one and it's not
going to limit your sales.

707
00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.790
It's going to help. And
it means you've given something

708
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:02.680
to the world, which is
a nice, warm, fuzzy feeling

709
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.380
That is warm and fuzzy.
That's such a healthy attitude

710
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.060
to say that, even though
it's a free piece of

711
00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.880
software, occasionally people use it
for free. They may never

712
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.520
pay you. They may complain
all day long, but there's

713
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.800
a certain sense of stewardship
because you put this out

714
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.170
into the world and it's,
it's a part of someone's

715
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.900
life. And presumably if it
does add something to their

716
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:24.220
life, they will eventually realize
that this is valuable. I

717
00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.700
mean, Jeff Atwood talked about
Jeff Atwood talked about registering

718
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.490
that piece of software that
you use every day. There's

719
00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.410
a little tiny Pang of
guilt. Like I use a

720
00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.910
tool called get right, get
rights to download. Yeah. I

721
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.690
heard, I heard, I mentioned
in week show yet. I

722
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.150
love this tool and you
know, it, it bugged me

723
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.560
and it's one of these
tools that says, you know,

724
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.190
you've downloaded 55 things before
and I'm trying to pay

725
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.900
my mortgage. And I just
said, you know, wow, I

726
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.290
use this thing six times
a day and I happily

727
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:56.990
click past that. Okay. Yep.
Ignore. And I just said,

728
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.460
I'm going to register this.
I'm going to pay for

729
00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.580
this because it, it certainly
provides $40 worth of value

730
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.030
to my life. Yeah. Yeah.
The last thing I wanted

731
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.500
to, Oh, sorry, go ahead.
I was just gonna say,

732
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.970
how many places do you
go when you see people

733
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:13.130
with WinZip and they just,
they just constantly go past

734
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:17.480
that screen Who doesn't have
WinZip I don't, I use

735
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.720
the built in stuff in
windows now, but yeah, It's

736
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.520
a whole other show right
there. I hate that. The

737
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.820
compressed folder stuff. Let me
talk about the very last

738
00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.500
thing. And then we'll send
people up to see the

739
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.890
rest of the 25 steps.
Step number 21. You talk

740
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.890
about automating your build and
release strategy. You know, I'm

741
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:37.640
all about continuous integration and
continuous integration is more than

742
00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.330
just the build process. It's
the actual release. Can you

743
00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.490
actually, do you generate the
pad files being, can you

744
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.740
just, is it one click
and it all the new

745
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.720
version of timestamp it goes
out. Yeah. I'd like to

746
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.630
say yes to that. That's
again, that's a goal for

747
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.620
now. Well, the actual releases
at least take at least

748
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.600
babysitting them at the moment.
Like he's taking care of

749
00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.720
them. He uses, I think
he uses Matt to do

750
00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.400
the builder. Is it something
to do to build EMIS

751
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.610
build? I'm not sure at
the moment and it doesn't

752
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:06.020
do the full, I don't
think he does the full

753
00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.140
release. As in, as in
posting it up to the

754
00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:14.270
website, updating the version file,
putting out the release notes

755
00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.930
and all that. So we've
got a checklist. Okay. And

756
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.960
a checklist is a valuable
thing. Like if you can't

757
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.630
automate it, don't say, Oh,
well I can't automate it.

758
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:24.950
I'm not doing it properly.
I won't do anything. I'll

759
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.510
just give up on the
whole thing. You've got to

760
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.250
start somewhere. You start with
a checklist and you try

761
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.340
to automate from there, Right.
If it's not one button,

762
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.560
maybe it's five buttons, but
at least it's very clear

763
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.230
and it's can read repeatable.
Yeah. Yeah. And because it's

764
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.750
so easy for mistakes to
creep in at that point

765
00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:43.070
and, and they killed it,
you know, they're right at

766
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.050
the last step. And yet
that's the first bit where

767
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:48.260
our customers are gonna see
something and, and that, and

768
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.610
a customer is going to
be the person who tells

769
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.010
you about it and that's
not good. So you've got

770
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.230
to do everything you can
around controlling the quality of

771
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.510
that. I mean, in his
twenties, in his 25 steps,

772
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.390
you know, we've looked at
everything about software development itself.

773
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.030
Cause that's kind of, you
know, that's an exercise for

774
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.610
the reader. You've got to
learn how to make software

775
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:07.250
all by yourself or from,
from other places. This is

776
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.530
just the steps. But that,
but that one is kind

777
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:13.700
of a general programming thing,
getting your builds, right? That

778
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.100
it relates very much to
having a professional process. Great.

779
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:20.510
This is fantastic stuff. There's
times snapper.com. That's the product.

780
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:24.410
And then of course your
blog is secret geek.net. We

781
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.410
talked about Eric sinks, micro
ISV articles. We're going to

782
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.630
post all of these links
up on the show site,

783
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.420
including links to Joel on
software and then a number

784
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.100
of books that you recommend
on amazon.com like the design

785
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.920
book. And then there's also
some suggestions that you have

786
00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.590
about installers. And I think
maybe we'll do a whole

787
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:45.940
show on installers. Cause I
know that you mentioned NSIs,

788
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:49.090
the Knoll soft installed system,
which I really love. What

789
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.480
do you guys use for
your installer? Originally? We use

790
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.440
Microsoft one in visual studio,
but yeah. NSIs was way

791
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.440
better. Yeah. That's a great
tool. It's not, it's not

792
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.040
MSI based, but it's so
clean and simple. It's definitely

793
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.900
worth checking. I think we'll
do a show on installers.

794
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.450
Well, you know, thanks so
much for taking the time.

795
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:10.270
What time is it over
there in Australia? Anyway, it's

796
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.060
nearly 10 o'clock in the
morning. So it's tomorrow. No,

797
00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.180
it's yesterday. Yes. Yes. It's
more if you know. Yeah.

798
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.830
Well, I really appreciate you
taking the time out of

799
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:22.690
your day and no worries.
Cool. And this is it

800
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.510
for Hansel minutes today. Hopefully
we did. Okay. Without Carl

801
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.730
and we'll see you again
next week. Thanks again, Leon

802
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:28.060
Bamberg.
