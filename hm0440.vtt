<inaudible> From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel

8
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.910
minutes, our weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

9
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.260
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing
show number four 40 in

10
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.250
this episode of Hansel minutia.
Scott talks with Richard Campbell about

11
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.120
the Apple iPhone six and
the Apple watch announcement. Hi,

12
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.130
this is Scott Hanselman and
this is another episode of

13
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.090
Hansel minutes, except this one
is broadcast live here with

14
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.970
my friend, my favorite Canadian
Richard Campbell. How are you, sir?

15
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.630
I'm well, sir, how are
you? I am lovely. I

16
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.420
am lovely. So I just
finished watching the, the Apple

17
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.300
live stream of their I
everything event. Did you see

18
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.270
that? Yes, we were both
watching it and I realized,

19
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.000
cause we had planned on
doing a Hansel minutia anyway,

20
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.770
and then as soon as
I saw the live stream

21
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.720
started watching it, I thought,
you know, this is going

22
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.850
to be the show. Yeah,
we basically now have, what

23
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.000
are you going to do?
Yeah, well, and the, actually

24
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.190
the whole keynote was really
interesting. It was the first

25
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.220
time they've said the whole,
Oh, and one more things

26
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.700
since job's past. So it's
starting to feel like Cook's

27
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.240
company, you know, and I
thought it was extremely polished.

28
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.370
I mean, there were a
couple of parts that were

29
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.130
a little rough. I thought
that the watch demonstrator guy

30
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.470
took a lot of energy
and brought the whole thing

31
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
down, brought it way down.
Yeah. And the crazy part

32
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.290
is that's the new UI.
Like I was blown away

33
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.960
by how well they thought
about the UI. It should

34
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.020
have been the most interesting
part. Yeah, exactly. He just

35
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.910
didn't have that energy. So
that was a bit of

36
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.600
a downer. And then, well,
Tim cook was super cool

37
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.420
for most of the talk.
Then you put a really

38
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.050
actual cool person in front
of you. Oh, I love

39
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.950
it. Yeah. Two awkward dads.
It was terrifying. You cook

40
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.000
by himself. He's fine. Cool.
Yeah. Next to you. Dick's

41
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to Bano. I mean, you're
just like, hi pano. I

42
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.310
mean, it was just, it
was extremely uncomfortable. So, well

43
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.580
I felt the first two
thirds was just perfect. The

44
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.880
last part was a little
bit like now the stream

45
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.940
was kind of a disaster
itself. Yeah. There was some

46
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.520
live streaming problems. I tried
it with VLC. I had

47
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.530
my iPad here as well.
So I was between the

48
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.320
hacked on the PC version.
I was doing the iPad

49
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.410
version on my phone. There
was a background, a translator

50
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.670
in Chinese, a Mandarin translator
for the first Half an

51
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.190
hour. That was for their
workers, their pressed worker. Right.

52
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.320
And I think they, I
realized as I turned it

53
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.860
on early that there were
two music tracks playing before

54
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.050
the thing started. So I
think they had the problem

55
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.170
right from the outset. Right.
They have music coming from

56
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.360
both tracks. So that's funny
that you mentioned that because

57
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.130
a number of people tweeted
about it. Yeah. Why is

58
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.750
there two music tracks and
then when the Mandarin started,

59
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.800
like that's why. Yeah, exactly.
Yeah. I would argue, you

60
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.560
know, cause I have the
audio engineering background, the audio

61
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.070
engineer botched a lot of
things, you know, you know,

62
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.760
once you've done that work,
you only hear mistakes. He

63
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.640
was laid on a bunch
of mikes. He was laid

64
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.670
on some, on some rebalancing.
Like it just, he was

65
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.440
laid on, on Banos. Mike
Bonno talked for 45 seconds

66
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.290
with his mic off. Well,
I think in, in fact

67
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.670
his mic was on I'm
singing like Bano mode, right?

68
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.520
Deep echo and resonant version.
And then they had to

69
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.670
switch it into the normal
speaking voice mode. The deal

70
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.010
with it does make me,
but again, we don't watch

71
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.430
these things. No they're audio,
your live stream value. We

72
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.740
watch them because we want
to see one more thing.

73
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.720
So two interesting things happened
first was the phone, the

74
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.570
iPhone six, which we all
knew was coming. Yeah. But

75
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.070
what I think is interesting
and I want to talk

76
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.710
to you about is, is
the size issue. Cause I've

77
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.270
got, I've got an iPhone
five right there. That's my

78
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.330
iPhone, Mike with my, my
lovely, I'll see if I

79
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.820
can get that to focus.
There you go. Now I

80
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.150
went to ARS Technica who
I love and they made

81
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.100
a PDF, which I was
actually in the middle of

82
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.310
doing and they beat me
to it, print it out

83
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.710
sizes of the new iPhone
six and six plus, which

84
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.270
is the new windows, 95
naming style. You use the

85
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.000
plus pack. Okay. So here's
the five S here's the

86
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.710
six and here's the six
plus. Now I immediately, I

87
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.380
mean the five is a
really small phone compared to

88
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.510
virtue of a phone out
there today. Hang on. So

89
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.220
I was talking to people
on Twitter and I said,

90
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.720
Hey, it's just not that
big of a deal. You

91
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.130
know, it's a little bit
bigger than a, than a

92
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.100
five. Right. I didn't get
the five. I liked the

93
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.150
size of the four. Here's
an iPod touch circa three

94
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.500
GS style. Right. So if
you look at Phil, right,

95
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.620
it takes, take this guy
here and then let's put

96
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.040
him next to the six
plus. So this is effectively

97
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.950
the three GS higher things
fits in the screen size

98
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.420
of the six plus. So
this is the six plus

99
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.330
in your hand. Okay. Yep.
But I didn't think that

100
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.490
maybe that was enough. So
what I did as I

101
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.320
went and I got a
Nokia 15, 20, Okay. That's

102
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.440
the giant, right. Okay. This
is a great phone because

103
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.010
I actually, I actually was,
and I beat a man

104
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.830
to death. They do the
nine 20 is a better

105
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.690
be to death phone. It's
not as big, but it's

106
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.020
harder. This isn't as heavy
as the, it is actually

107
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.260
heavier, but yeah, extra 50
20 is huge. This is

108
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.640
really interesting though. Here's a
six plus right next to

109
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.480
a 1520. So you could
actually go and try these

110
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.900
different things out. Yeah. Six
plus is a little smaller

111
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.990
than the 1520. Okay. I
find the 15, 20 still

112
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.830
fits in my back pocket.
Yes. So I think Backpocket

113
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.230
ability is still a possibility
here. Well, and I do

114
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.080
appreciate the idea that they
only started making bigger I-phones

115
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.030
once they had the watch.
So you didn't have to

116
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.630
take the phone out of
your pocket anymore. So here

117
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:49.600
is 15, 20 iPhone, five
S six plus and six

118
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.570
all next to each other.
Nice. Effectively a three GS

119
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.800
in front. Yeah. So seriously,
if you can't find a

120
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.930
phone, that's the size that
you want out in there

121
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.280
in the market? You have
a problem. Yes. You do.

122
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.830
I want a phone this
big, do I want an

123
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.110
iPad mini phone? You know
what I mean? The thing

124
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.880
that I appreciate about the
1520 and I don't have

125
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.680
one, I have a nine
25. I was trying to

126
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.420
get the wife to get
one. Actually she has a

127
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.030
nine 20 and she's ready
for a new phone. Is

128
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.900
she struggles with battery constantly?
Cause she's not super disciplined

129
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.300
on, on charging batteries all
the time. And the 1520

130
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.280
is good for a couple
of days. I would have

131
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.080
hoped that those new I-phones
would be good for a

132
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.860
couple of days, but they
made them so thin. I

133
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.740
don't think the battery life's
any better. Well, you know,

134
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.020
so there's this TV show
that I love to watch

135
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.060
with Halle Berry. That's called
<inaudible>. Yes. Right. Okay. She's

136
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.160
in space and she's awesome.
It's just great. It's just,

137
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.050
and she's pregnant and yeah,
it's an excuse for me

138
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.090
to watch Halle Berry for
an hour every week. And

139
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.230
then there's aliens. They effectively
have iPhones on the show.

140
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.140
Right. But there is thin
as paper, like, like wax,

141
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.030
it looks like wax paper
and they're kind of see

142
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.980
through and they light up
and they kind of glow

143
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.420
and it's, it's like looking
at an iPhone in 2025.

144
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.090
Right. Question is when it
gets thinner, which this one

145
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.690
apparently has, is it still
have that, that, that sense

146
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.960
of, of structure because you
gotta really give phones like

147
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.830
this credit, they feel like
they are not going anywhere.

148
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.010
Yeah. They're sturdy. Yeah. I
mean, even if I take

149
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.200
any modern phone, I would
say, although I think the

150
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.860
galaxy series is a little
rough, even a 1520, it

151
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.930
doesn't torque. Like if you
take it like a, like

152
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.790
an ice tray and you
torque it, it's not going

153
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.750
anywhere. Yeah. It doesn't twist
indeed and older phones with

154
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.210
plastic backs. Definitely have that
feeling, but can they make

155
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.310
it thinner? But it's still,
I like a heavier phone.

156
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.810
You know what I mean?
I want some, I think

157
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.180
that we've hit this point
now where phones are getting

158
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.030
too light. I would think
the 15, 20 is a

159
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.900
little disturbingly light for its
size. Hmm. Yeah. It is.

160
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.620
It's funny that you mentioned
that the 15, 20 compared

161
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.660
to an iPhone, it's about
the same weight and that's

162
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.810
weird because when you're, when
you pick it up, Would

163
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.030
you want that phone to
be heavier? It seems not

164
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.060
real. Yeah, it actually does.
So I, I, I actually

165
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.100
have the additional cover in
order to give it some

166
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.910
Toss. Yeah. No gravity tip
here is the five next

167
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.950
to the six. Alright. It's
subtle. It's a little bit

168
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.900
bigger. Yeah. That's your 4.7
inch screen. Yep. Why do

169
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.050
you think they have such
a gentle gradient? Why not

170
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.140
just have it Two? Yeah.
Why not? Just all go

171
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.070
all plus. I think they,
you know, they needed to

172
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.310
make a base slightly bigger
phone. Apple. How about almost

173
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.830
on a, on an understandable
at times they are very

174
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.900
careful with the rate of
change that they do with

175
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.970
their things. And I want
to believe that it's all

176
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.550
intentional, but sometimes I think
it's what it is, what

177
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.030
it is. The resolutions are
higher on these new screens.

178
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.690
The DPI is insane. Isn't
the six plus over 400

179
00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.100
DPI on a 10 80
P screen. So crazy how

180
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.860
we take this is a
16, 20, 15, 20 lumen.

181
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.140
This is an iPhone six
plus, right? They're both 10

182
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.160
ADP. Yes. These are three
and 400 or 350 and

183
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.580
400 PPI. This is like,
they called it retina. Plus

184
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.400
this is like I said
on Twitter, it's got more

185
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.520
pixels than I have neuron.
Yes. Yeah. Your eyes can't

186
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.700
see it. I can't pick
these up. That's how They're

187
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.740
all to, you're going to
holding it closer to your

188
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.750
face and it's not just
cause your focus isn't working

189
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.750
that well. And here's the
thing. People are talking about

190
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.660
how, you know, not every
game on the Xbox and

191
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.000
not every game on the
PS three PS four, whether

192
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.140
one attend NDP games on
these running 10 ADP, why

193
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.670
is my phone running a
10 NDP game and my

194
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.340
next generation console isn't Well,
and it's going to, we're

195
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.400
going to start limiting the
capabilities of these games because

196
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.650
we just can't render fast
enough. You know, GPS are

197
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.590
only so fast. Yeah. Well,
and certainly of course, and

198
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.450
even in the, in, in
the impressive demo that we

199
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:04.100
saw them doing, it's not
exactly next generation, No graphics,

200
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.550
no it's limited. It was
pretty impressive. But yeah, but

201
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.250
it was still cartoony graphics.
There were some nice shading

202
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.040
effects and so forth, but
they aren't pushing the resolution.

203
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.380
They're not moving huge numbers
of pixels. Well, yeah, like,

204
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.110
I don't know if you
saw that Bioshock is out

205
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.430
for the iPhone now. No,
that's amazing. It is amazing.

206
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.810
But You go around and
Google with being, I believe

207
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.340
Bioshock came out in 2007.
Yeah. It's not that new

208
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.920
man. It's like, well, wait
a second. That's not as

209
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.580
fancy as we thought, But
it's but it's, it's hella

210
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.190
impressive. Well, it speaks, it
speaks to the, you know,

211
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.430
Moore's law still applies, right?
Harbored densities are continuing to

212
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.820
grow. Yeah, Exactly. And we're
going towards a, an environment

213
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.830
where it's about the number
of cores on a machine.

214
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.840
As more than it is
gigahertz. Like everything has been

215
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.650
at three gigahertz for awhile.
Yeah. While the stuff that

216
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.620
they just announced last week,
we'll go to four for

217
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.780
consumers that doesn't really matter.
It's about, can I have

218
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.520
16 processors or know? Yeah.
Because marketing needs to sell

219
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.180
something, a number that people
feel superior with. Right. Well,

220
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.270
everyone I think, and I
actually, I was working at

221
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.730
Intel in the early nineties
as a consultant when they

222
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.840
were doing, trying to get
webcam doing what we're doing

223
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.120
right now, H w they
were going to get that

224
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.980
at like, you know, postage
stamp size. And the argument

225
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.950
was, if it's a must
have feature, then we're going

226
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.810
to need the processors for
it. Therefore people will sell

227
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.190
it. So there's a whole
bunch of people in Intel

228
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.470
whose job it is, is
to figure out how can

229
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:35.070
we use more CPU, power,
right. While doing word. Yeah.

230
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.490
And I think that, that
brings me to the, the

231
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.890
watch announcements, which is really
interesting because it is really

232
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.440
a companion to the phone.
I got the impression I'm

233
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.290
sure you did as well,
that the phone's doing a

234
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.420
lot of the work. When
you talk to Siri, I

235
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.760
did not get the impression.
And this is pure speculation

236
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.300
that you go, hello, Siri,
give me directions. So whatever,

237
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.810
certainly we know the watch
has no internet connectivity. Just

238
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.640
to be clear, you have
a pebble in your hand,

239
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.190
right? You don't have an
inside tray. Right. I have

240
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.610
the original I watch, Oh,
what is this? Watch here.

241
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.630
Recognize that. No, that's an
iPod nano with eyes Nano

242
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.980
inside. Huh? Yeah. Kind of
a case. That's a Kickstarter

243
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.650
case there. This watch, I
wore this watch for a

244
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.890
year. This is a lovely,
lovely wife. And that's what

245
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.940
that actually inspired the pebble,
which one could argue inspired

246
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.330
Apple. Although let's face it.
Apple took this to a

247
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.180
whole other level. I am,
I am very impressed with

248
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.730
what they packed into that
water. I totally agree. I

249
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.230
think the thing that was
the most impressive and I

250
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.670
was talking to my buddy
at the same time is

251
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.340
that, Hey, there's a watch.
That would have been impressive.

252
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.320
Yep. If they had come
out with a watch that

253
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.170
looked like this, it would
have been okay, I'm a

254
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.910
geek. I have a watch
on my wrist, but I'd

255
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.050
still be impressed. Yup. But
then three finishes X number

256
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.410
of cases, it's it basically,
didn't say here's a smartwatch.

257
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.210
It said we are a
smartwatch manufacturer bow before us.

258
00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.970
Well then Yeah. And that's
always been Apple's way. Right.

259
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.770
You can have any kind
of iPhone you want, as

260
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.560
long as it's this one
right there. And then it

261
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.200
went, you know, okay. In
the five, they finally went

262
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.110
to some colors and a
couple of case variations. But

263
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.080
the diversity on the FA
on the watch is astonishing.

264
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.480
Oh, I notice it's not
an iWatch. What's up with

265
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.880
that. I think Because I
watch is creepy. Even the

266
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.490
whole NSA thing. Yeah. You
know, I don't, I don't

267
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.880
want you to watch, so
Apple watch is cool. So

268
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.400
I brought out I'm a
watch guy. Yep. And I

269
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.700
have a whole pile of
watches, you know, in a

270
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.200
box. Like I'm one of
the people who has a

271
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.290
wooden box with watches in
the box. And these are

272
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.750
not my most attractive watches,
but I thought I'd bring

273
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.280
them out just to give
you a sense of what,

274
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.510
what diversity in watch work
has. I have some automatics

275
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.840
upstairs. I didn't bring, didn't
bring down, but here is

276
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.210
the theoretical Apple watch. You
know, these are, these are

277
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:58.670
big watches, but they are
watches that are all appropriately

278
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.800
sized. I was also very
impressed that there is a

279
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.120
smaller Apple watch for the,
for the ladies or for

280
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.590
the slider. I know that
my buddy, Chris sells likes

281
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.600
a big watch. He's one
of those guys that has

282
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.850
a watch, like a bouncer
would use just to flag

283
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.560
somebody. That's a new fossil
that is quite a bit

284
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.030
larger in the face. Yeah.
Then this Movado over here,

285
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.550
the, this watch here is
a $400 watch, but has

286
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.480
a rubber band crap. There's
a whole new class of

287
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.030
watch out there that are
three, four or $500 watches

288
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.530
that don't look like your
classical, you know, old person

289
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.990
in a suit type watch,
which brings me to the

290
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.880
pricing three 49. What'd you
think about that? And they

291
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.220
said starting at yes. I
assume that's the sport. Yeah.

292
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.400
The aluminum chassis with the
glass face and the plastic

293
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.820
band, like all cheap as
possible. I think it's going

294
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.320
to be a six or
$700 when you get to

295
00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.060
the elegant version. And is
that because it's going to

296
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:07.240
be five, $600 for Sapphire
crystals and Sapphire is definitely

297
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.690
more but gold casing on
the elegant one. That's 18

298
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.700
karat gold, a funny alloy,
which means they got to

299
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.720
make that on mass and
definitely more expensive bands. See

300
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.600
20 gold on a, on
a watch like that. I

301
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.280
think the number one thing
that I'm going to want

302
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.540
is a watch that is
reliable and durable. Yeah. Well,

303
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.720
and the whole point of
this product is to wear

304
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.750
it all the time. That
to me is the interesting

305
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.180
side of it. They never
said the word wearables once

306
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.850
and I get that. But
the bottom line is this

307
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.600
is more instrumentation for your
body and you want it

308
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.920
on all the time. Yeah,
exactly. So the other thing

309
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.840
here is that I'm a
Fitbit guy. You have a

310
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.680
Fitbit. I am. I use
a one. I've tried one

311
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.720
more knob just to see
if that makes any difference.

312
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.780
Fitbit one is the one
that you clip on your

313
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.690
pants or your belt. Yeah.
So it's in my, my

314
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.660
little coin pocket of my
jeans. Okay. Yeah. So I've

315
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.040
got a flex and I
have lost three Fitbit forces.

316
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:12.370
If you find a Fitbit
force, anywhere in New York, Chicago,

317
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.390
or Austin, it's mine. How
did, how did you lose

318
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:22.330
them? So the force is
double wide and clips on

319
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.460
like this, and it's quite
a bit heavier. It has

320
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.920
steel in it while this
is extremely light and rubbery

321
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:33.370
and only two little clicks
to make that thing stick

322
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.470
right. Falls right off. You
put your hands in your

323
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.750
pockets, you put your, put
your coat on. So we

324
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.970
would almost always fall off
like while putting my coat

325
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.610
on, on the subway. So
for every time you've lost

326
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.610
one, it's fallen off you.
What? 10, 20 times. Oh

327
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.830
yeah. And I, I even
had one in Austin where

328
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.980
it fell off me in
a, I had to run

329
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.140
back, pick it up at
the bathroom and then dip

330
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.940
the thing in Purell. But
I liked them. And I

331
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.070
think we all liked them
because they are the beginning

332
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.860
of the quantified life we
had. We had Chris dancy

333
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.440
on who's the most quantified
man keeping track of all

334
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.080
these bits of information. But
think about this. This is

335
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.580
an entire new industry based
on pedometers. Right? Smart pedometer.

336
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.380
Yeah. Elevating a pedometer, The
pedometer to the point of

337
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.640
like, Oh, I need to
have this. It's going to

338
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.100
tell me all sorts of
bits of information, which I,

339
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.860
as a, as a diabetic
find funny, because I have

340
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.950
spent 20 years plugged into
devices that give me a

341
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.860
biofeedback loop. Like, how am
I doing? I don't know

342
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.420
how I'm doing. Let me
check this device. Oh, that's

343
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.670
how I'm doing. Now. I
will change my behavior. Like

344
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.880
I have, I have spent
a day with you in

345
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.300
Copenhagen Basing your blood sugar.
Right. Actually you did. Yeah.

346
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.730
That was tough day for
you. For me, it was,

347
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.910
it was inspiring. It was
challenging. And, and there was

348
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.560
a time when I had
to go get your orange

349
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.490
juice right now. I remember
That is, but that's every

350
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:54.260
day for me. Right? Yeah.
So fast forward a year,

351
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.770
which in internet years is
like 10 years. Fitbits are

352
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.590
smart pedometers. And this watch
the first thing I noticed

353
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.850
when they were doing the
little thing, when they were

354
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.520
moving the watch around in
the beginning before they said

355
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.260
a word, I was like,
Oh, look at that. That's

356
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.420
a sensor on the back
Set of sensors in the

357
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.470
back. Yeah. Convex sensor. That
it's clear that it puts

358
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.530
pressure on the back of
the arms. You've got radio

359
00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.400
pulse. I'm presuming yep. Temperature.
Maybe they didn't say I'm

360
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.760
guessing. Say they only say
Pulse, but there's no reason

361
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.710
it shouldn't be able to
measure blood pressure, but maybe

362
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.250
that's, you know, watch too
Unclear if it has, it

363
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.250
didn't have its own motion
coprocessor. And the phone does

364
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.880
too. So it knows what
direction you're moving, you know?

365
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.880
Right. Well, and they talked
about that purely in the

366
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.850
context of the phone they
had. And I noticed accelerometer

367
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.400
and barometer. Those are two
ingredients from the Fitbit so

368
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.080
that you can really figure
out stairs. You need the

369
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.170
barometer for that. And then
tying in the GPS and

370
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.300
so forth to figure out
how far you're actually moving.

371
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.900
So, you know, the whole
running in place on the

372
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.190
escalators, not going to work
anymore. Exactly. For this is

373
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.880
a smaller, less intrusive screen.
That's going to be on

374
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:07.040
my arm. Yeah. To watch
companion. But they respected the

375
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.140
fact that a good looking
watch is a good looking

376
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.510
watch. And why would I?
And so many people were

377
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.100
like, why would I wear
a watch? I have a,

378
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.780
I have a watch. Don't
you have a phone that

379
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.630
was literally someone tweeted to
me. You have a watch

380
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.540
don't you have a phone,
like young people. Yeah. That's

381
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.600
there. That's not, And I'm
there. Right? I haven't put

382
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.240
anything on my wrists in
years because I don't like

383
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.290
having stuff on my wrists.
I prefer that my phone

384
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:34.310
is my watch. That's how
I think. But I enjoy

385
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.800
the accessorizing now. Of course
I'm tee shirt and jeans

386
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.810
today. But yeah, the average,
the average man does not

387
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.450
get a lot of accessorizing.
You know, other than the,

388
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.600
other than the, the, the,
the Pooka shell necklace. There's

389
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.620
not a lot. I can
do a wedding band, you

390
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.340
know, you know, I can't
hoop earrings anymore. And it

391
00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.350
can't, you know, there's only
so much, you can do

392
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.290
a couple bracelets, necklace, maybe
that's about it. I think

393
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.800
a watch cufflinks type in
those are accessories. I enjoy

394
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.010
accessorizing. I like literally picking
a watch to match my

395
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.650
shoes. If I'm dressing up.
I think of a watch

396
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.950
as a, an adornment. That
is something that happens to

397
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.240
tell the time. And I
think that a lot of

398
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.740
fans who, who like watches
like automatic watches, they like

399
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.640
the engineering is a piece
of mechanical engineering on their

400
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.680
wrist. Right. And, and I
know, and I have an

401
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.120
appreciation for those beautiful mechanics,
right? Like when I see

402
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.570
people who are passionate about
watches, it's not at quartz

403
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.120
Timex. You know, it's not
just, I need something to

404
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.520
tell the time it is
the elegance of all of

405
00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.330
that. Moving hardware with Sapphire
bearings that, that you, that

406
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:49.290
you enjoy. They, one of
the great things about a

407
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.930
watch, like this is this,
this got a quartz battery,

408
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.840
and this thing runs for
ever. I mean, I've had

409
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.680
this watch for two years.
Most non-automatic watches will run

410
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.990
for, for two years. If
you have a watch winder,

411
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.060
or are you aware of
watch every day? You don't

412
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.440
even think about it, right?
Yeah. They didn't say much

413
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.650
about battery life on this.
Watch. Some people are speculating.

414
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.980
They're speculating. It's kinetic, which
would be like a digital

415
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.590
automatic. Well, they did show
the charging plate was a

416
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.370
magnetic clip in field effect,
charger. The implication was you

417
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.460
charge it every day. Right?
What does that mean though?

418
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.290
Right. I mean, if I
wake up at eight and

419
00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.110
go to bed at midnight,
Are you, is that thing

420
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.180
gonna make it? Well, I
notice they also were very

421
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.060
emphasizing that the screen is
off until you raise it

422
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.800
up, which, which that's the
biggest power consumer people have

423
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.860
tried to do that. Yeah.
No, the pebble, I have

424
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.640
a pebble as well, keeps
the screen on is the

425
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.440
low power screen. And then
the light turns on not

426
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.280
on the lifting, but on
the flick. Interesting. They don't,

427
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.320
they don't have a sense
of it. Right. But they

428
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.170
know that you accelerated quickly.
So if you have a

429
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.540
pebble and you're in the
movie theater, you just go

430
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.900
like that and shake it
and it'll light up. It

431
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.080
really depends on how well
that works. And I think

432
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.490
it would, I would remind
us of the time when

433
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.830
we could hold the phone
up to our ear, remember

434
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.950
that was a big deal
during the first iPhone. Right.

435
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.150
Coming out like, Hey, it
dims the screen. When you,

436
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.100
when it's up at your
face, your ear. And there

437
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.590
was a time there when
it was like, what, remember

438
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:23.340
they had to adjust that,
that technology. Yes. Just those

439
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.890
sensors. If they can really
make it with a thing,

440
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.860
feels always on, like, I
don't want to see it.

441
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.810
You don't want to see
a power up. It's got

442
00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.490
to be on when it
gets to you. But that's

443
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.680
the big, the, the net
screen is probably the number

444
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.800
one power consumer. Right. Cause
they clearly have eliminated all

445
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.080
the extra antennas that communicates
only with an iPhone. It's

446
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.470
probably low power Bluetooth if
I had to guess, and

447
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.770
that's going to save a
lot of power. I hope

448
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.680
so. So, you know, that
has the best chance. What

449
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.800
about the whole haptic bit,
the fact that your phone

450
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:58.300
vibrates politely to you And
the tactic tactic. Yes. Haptic

451
00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.810
feedback is almost always a
small motor that vibrates. Yep.

452
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.240
That gives you the kinetic
energy to go and give

453
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.820
a little rotational inertia. And
then, you know, it reminds

454
00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.230
you, they implied that it's
a combination of a motor

455
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.160
and a speaker. Like maybe
they're going to give you

456
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.730
the sense of a vibration
or a heads up by

457
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.790
sending a, a tone through
a speaker that's maybe not

458
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.920
audible, but enough to make
the speaker vibrate, which I

459
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.360
think also speaks to a
focus on power consumption. And

460
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.000
I agree with you there.
They also made the point

461
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.130
of only, you will notice
it, that it was private.

462
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.130
And now we get to
the creepy part of that,

463
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.010
which was the heart, The
intimacy, the thing, which was

464
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.240
weird. That was creepy. I,
and of course the wife

465
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.330
was next to me watching
the, the thing as well.

466
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.070
And I said, Oh, look,
we can both get one

467
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.620
of these watches and then
you could feel my heartbeat.

468
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:58.180
And she's like, yeah, that's
pretty creepy. Yeah. I think

469
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.010
it'll be interesting to see.
I mean, we're just two

470
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.250
random old married guys. Yeah.
If other people think that's

471
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.860
cute, it is very conceivable
that someone who's 19 in

472
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.470
a, in the early parts
of a relationship, I think

473
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:13.000
that that is absolutely adorable.
Yes. With their $600 phone

474
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.990
and their $400 watch. That's
a teenager. Yeah. That's a

475
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:22.480
good point. Funny, funny comment.
Also a bill Sims, or

476
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.070
just made a comment on
Twitter here. He said, Oh

477
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.040
look a live streaming session
that actually works. Geez. Yeah.

478
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.610
Yeah. Somebody had, Akamai's going
to get into trouble for

479
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.760
that. I I've watched Stanfield
tweeting about this whole thing.

480
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.130
And if anybody knows what's
going wrong with the streaming

481
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.100
system, it's him, he's done
everything and handled some of

482
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.940
the largest stream problems ever.
So he, he accused Akamai

483
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.280
and I'm just going to
go with that, that, and

484
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.590
halfway through that half hour
in, when they got rid

485
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.490
of the Mandarin lady, the
stream started working reliably. So

486
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.860
it's like, somebody woke up
like, Oh, we're on and

487
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.820
fixed stuff. Streaming is hard
getting it the same time.

488
00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.230
It also speaks to the
amount of interest. I mean,

489
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.940
we can pick on them
for streaming, but certainly they

490
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.550
were being slammed, which is
yeah. Which is a, which

491
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.250
is nontrivial. Now of course
they had a YouTube at

492
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.030
the end of their presentation
and we have no one,

493
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.010
no, We have no, well,
we could play a little,

494
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.680
Carl Franklin is an outro if
you want, because I'm sure

495
00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.930
he'd, he'd approved that we
could probably bet on the

496
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:24.640
licensing. Maybe, maybe a little
Nickelback, Apple pay. Yeah. So

497
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.580
Apple pay was an interesting
one to meet. There's a

498
00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.800
drive through that. I go
through and forgive me for

499
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.580
eating fast food occasionally and
hanging off of that. Drive-through

500
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:38.500
as I drive through, is
this touch pay system. Yup.

501
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:45.060
That appears abandoned. Like only
in America install 200,000 and

502
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.940
FC touched a pay systems
and they are literally derelict.

503
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.350
Have you ever in America
on the West coast or

504
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.210
again, you're Canadian American Canadia.
Nice. Anyone you guys have

505
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.850
that you have like better
payment systems because we are

506
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.680
the only country in the
world that doesn't have chip

507
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.080
and pin. And at this
point, yeah. Well we're all

508
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.000
chip pretty much all chip
and pin down in Canada.

509
00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.930
The only place that I
see touch pay used routinely

510
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.230
is certain gas stations. Instead
of the gas card, they

511
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.570
give you a little fog
for your key chain and

512
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.000
that's what you touch it
pay with. But that's pretty

513
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.310
much the only place I
see touch it, pay being

514
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.460
used on an, on any
regular basis. I have never

515
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.740
used touch and pay ever.
I have no cards that

516
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.900
can use it. I am
Meg Stripe all the way

517
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.630
now that said, apparently these
are all over and we're

518
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.390
just not using them. So
maybe he's bringing it to

519
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.300
life. And I appreciate that
Apple signed visa, MasterCard, American

520
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.440
express. Okay. So there's the
big three. That's great. And

521
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.350
I noticed they did emphasize
it, but notice that when

522
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:46.610
you paid with your phone,
you use that thumb sensor,

523
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.040
they fingerprint sensor. So there
was a sense of it

524
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.070
had to be you using
the phone. I appreciate it.

525
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.160
So you've got a pin
to unlock. You've got the

526
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:59.720
touch ID, right. Magical crypto.
And then I think it's

527
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.330
just important though, that the
existing NFC devices don't have

528
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.790
this Right. Well, and I
think these are sort of

529
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.950
basics. That must be there,
but then he spoiled the

530
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.330
whole thing at the very
end by saying, Oh look,

531
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.070
and you could do it
with the watch and stuck

532
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.450
the watch in the machine.
And it worked too. And

533
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:15.080
I'm like, where's the fingerprint
sensor on that. So that

534
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.030
was a little creepy. It
presumably something that you could

535
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.420
set and also presumes that
the, I think that the

536
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.410
phone is nearby. Well, obviously
the watch requires the phone.

537
00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.680
So, but the whole point
is you don't want to

538
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.570
take the phone out. Is
that something you activate? Like,

539
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.330
it sounds like it's going
to be awkward. Yeah. Well,

540
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.490
and here's another thing that
is a little awkward. There

541
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:36.350
were some jokes about, you
know, well, there's Apple take

542
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:40.010
30% of everything that you
bought. What's really interesting though,

543
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:44.750
is it's unfortunate that they
don't announce a, an open

544
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.330
standard and say, here we
are the first implementation of

545
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.270
this open standard. Yeah. They
called it Apple pay. Right?

546
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.210
Yep. If, if, if Microsoft
came up with Microsoft pay,

547
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:54.770
they would be destroyed and
no one would think it

548
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.140
was okay. Did it? What
did we, Can we start

549
00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.850
with the fact that the
stream only worked on Safari?

550
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:02.720
Well, that's obviously just an
exclusivity thing. That's not, there's

551
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.520
no technical reason that they
had to do that. That

552
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.450
was just because, Hey, it's
a club. Yes. But that

553
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.060
said by calling an Apple
pay, I feel it's a

554
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:15.320
little bit too exclusive, less
inclusive. Yes. But, but I

555
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.680
think just as touch ID
was the iPhone five S's

556
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:22.760
claim to fame. Yup. Here's
a unique feature that upscale

557
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.130
people who have lots of
money to toss a phone

558
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.760
every year to ha you
know, this is the, you

559
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.680
know, the Apple pay is
that feature as well. The

560
00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.580
question is though, they're taking
the watch support all the

561
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.850
way down level. Yep. You
ready for this? All the

562
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.370
way down to the forest?
Does that mean if I

563
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.510
buy the, can I Apple
pay with the watch and

564
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:50.550
the forest is nearby. Right.
But the Apple pay said

565
00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.120
only down to the fives.
Yep. So guess who's driving.

566
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.390
Who here Don't know now
on Twitter here, Stacy Odell

567
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.550
brings up a very good
point because I am nothing.

568
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.430
If not nondenominational, and to
make sure that everyone agrees,

569
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.820
You just want excuses for
toys, Make sure that no

570
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.350
one thinks that I am
in any way device discriminatory.

571
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:19.290
No, you want everything He
said? What about, yeah. Right.

572
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.540
Well, So here is the
Samsung gear and the Samsung

573
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.300
gear too nice, which were
followed by another 12 us

574
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.170
Samsung devices that were announced
within hours of each other.

575
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.310
These are not mine. I
didn't, I didn't buy these.

576
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.790
These are given to me
as a, what I call

577
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.300
a review gift. Right? My
buddy, Bob Somerville. And he,

578
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.700
he just said, Hey, let
me loan you, my Androids,

579
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.490
Take these out for a
spin. See what you think,

580
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.820
things, You can review them.
So this is the gear

581
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.690
and the gear too. These
watches both have the problem

582
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.680
of they scream. I'm a
watch on your wrist. Right.

583
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.380
You know what I mean?
Yeah. This is the gear

584
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.640
to Booton up here. And
then here is a gold

585
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.350
galaxy S three. So just
as these guys, Android were

586
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.710
basically have been, have been
argued. It's kind of a

587
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.080
lock in thing, you know,
it's Android and Android. I

588
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.870
don't know if I want
to do that, right. No

589
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.150
one seemed to say that
about the iPhone. Well, I

590
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.640
think it's presumed. It's going
to be all Apple. Yeah.

591
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.980
I don't think it's a
surprise to anyone that it's

592
00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.230
all Apple, but, and it's
not that it's a, it's

593
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.290
not that it's all Android,
even that's all Samsung, even

594
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:36.350
worse. Right. And, and here's
the thing I'm already in.

595
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.430
And again, this is America
specific. So I don't mean

596
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.340
to be overly ethnocentric here,
but I'm locked into at

597
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.190
and T right. Like, you
know, when my first child

598
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.070
was born, they got a
piece of him. I can

599
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:50.610
never get away from them.
Gotcha. Certainly Not. If I

600
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.670
want a new phone, you
know, their hand don't have

601
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.780
that part. No, I've got
Rogers. We've got Rogers. Rogers

602
00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.640
is the at T and
T equivalent. Oh, I fight

603
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.190
it. I buy it just
by assume anywhere in plug

604
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.980
in and elsewhere. Oh, I,
so I've taken the time

605
00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.020
to try and get phones
that aren't locked so that

606
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.870
I can get local Sims
when I want. But that

607
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.080
is not what my carrier
wants me to do. Rogers

608
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.150
is just the polite version
of at T and T

609
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:19.680
because it's Canadian. Yep, exactly.
So What's w this is

610
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.750
by the way here, this
was booted up here and

611
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.700
I can get that to
focus in just a second

612
00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.180
here, come on. Focus. Getting
a webcam to focus is

613
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.310
actually the next big problem
to solve. That was how

614
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.610
the light just went out
there. Right? Well, and, and

615
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.250
that little subtle poke that
Apple had about their focusing

616
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.250
system in their phone was
interesting. Cause it is dealing

617
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:42.620
with exactly that. Yeah. Focusing
is definitely a problem, but

618
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.720
Does this mean that I'm
now locked in even more

619
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.700
than I'm already locked in?
Like sometimes people say, Hey

620
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.380
Scott, why don't you have
a windows phone? Well, you

621
00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.810
know, I have one, I
use it sometimes, but I

622
00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:57.220
started early. Right? All these
companies want to get you

623
00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.020
early. They want to get
you early and stick you

624
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.150
in. So it's like suddenly
I'm going to have a

625
00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:06.070
fitness tracker slash watch and
Apple pay. And this, they

626
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:09.100
know an awful lot about
me. I've always liked to

627
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.840
mix it up. I have
an iPhone, I have a

628
00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.970
surface, I have a PlayStation,
you know, I just like,

629
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.820
I feel like if I
get a little of everything,

630
00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.000
then I don't have to
feel like I've bought into

631
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.120
an entire ecosystem. What about
you? Yeah. I'm with you.

632
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.000
I like the fact that
my Fitbit syncs with my

633
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.760
Android phone and with my
windows phone. And so, you

634
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.200
know, you feel like you've
got, you know, the one

635
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.940
has got, it's just in
my pocket. I don't even

636
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.830
want to touch it. Right.
It's just that I pull

637
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.300
up my phone to read
the data off of it

638
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.510
and keep going. That's what
I want. And in reality,

639
00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.030
you know, we still are
dealing with lock-in. Where did

640
00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.490
you buy your music? Cause
it isn't moving to the

641
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:46.900
other platforms. Yup. Yup. That
is always the battle with

642
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.650
those things. What about what
kind of lesser known phones

643
00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.460
that aren't launching big in
the Western world? Like the

644
00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.210
Firefox phones, you know, those
phones are very inexpensive. You

645
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:03.370
can get them for $99
or less unlocked. They're all

646
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.740
openness and open that they're
all, all you just use

647
00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.500
Java, JavaScript and HTML. They
are run by Mozilla, but

648
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.730
yeah, they're open phones is
should, should we be complaining

649
00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:16.150
so much about these walled
gardens? I think so. I

650
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.850
think we are generally trying
to press against wall gardens

651
00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:21.550
as a whole, because they're
not, they don't necessarily serve

652
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:25.210
as well. You know, my
reaction to looking at Apple

653
00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:26.500
is not that I want
to run out and buy

654
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.750
Apple gear. It's like, okay,
well, there's the new high

655
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.620
bar for the open standards
folks to reach to, you

656
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.740
know? And once again, Apple
has done the brilliant thing

657
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.230
in the sense of, if
you're going to build a

658
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.420
watch, it's not just a
watch, it talks to your

659
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.510
phone, but it's also got
all of the fitness sensors

660
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:49.120
in it. And it's got
really a distinctive, intelligent UI.

661
00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.880
We're not just sticking with
touch, you know, that's, I

662
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.640
think what Apple's done well
is taking all of these

663
00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.680
different ingredients and combining them
in a way to make

664
00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.010
a far more refined product
in exchange for the fact

665
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.380
that, you know, they live
in their walled garden. They're

666
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.750
not going to do anything
else. But once that bar

667
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.600
has been set, it can
be chased by others. So

668
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:12.730
Google has nest, they have,
they have a thermostat, they

669
00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:18.130
have a smoke detector, Fitbit
works great. And it links

670
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.010
to everything Fitbit's everywhere. It's
not like I like to

671
00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:24.340
say nondenominational. Yes it does.
Does Microsoft come out with

672
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.370
a watch or a band
or a Fitbit or some

673
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.520
thing like a wearable of
some kind? And if so,

674
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.770
does that work everywhere? Does
that only work on Microsoft?

675
00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.750
Yeah. I don't know that
they can add anything to

676
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.560
the equation here. You know,
I think Apple held back

677
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.500
their watch until it genuinely
added to the equation that

678
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.300
it was something new. So
It's the fitness aspect that

679
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.220
makes their watch different. I
think so. Yeah. And I

680
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.150
mean, and the UI that
they actually developed it, original

681
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.180
UI. Yeah. I found the
term digital crown to be

682
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.670
a little annoying about the
16th time that they said

683
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.080
it. I was like, I
get it. It's a knob.

684
00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.020
You put a knob back
on the Dobbs back. Thanks

685
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.940
invented voice today. And I
see today they invented digital

686
00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.640
payments today and they invented
a digital watches, which is

687
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.190
kind of Cool. Yep. Well
the, and the, and the

688
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.340
wifi to cell thing clearly
is carrier specific. There has

689
00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.020
to be some kind of
carrier handshake to make that

690
00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.930
work. So Talking about that
on Twitter that I look

691
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.840
forward to at and T
supporting a wifi calling in

692
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:26.420
2025. Nice. That's true. So
in conclusion, let's just re

693
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:32.720
review sizing. Here's our iPhone
five. Here's our iPhone six.

694
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.890
Yes. Thank you. ARS Technica
for these templates. Here's our

695
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:42.530
iPhone six plus now putting
these stacking them and then

696
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:47.390
bringing in the beast. There
is a 1520, so that's

697
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:51.650
a Nokia 15, 20, which
is really about, I would

698
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.910
say a half an inch
or a third of an

699
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.800
inch difference. So if you
want to see what an

700
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.580
iPhone six plus feels like,
I suspect it's going to

701
00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:03.860
feel something like, Like the
15, 20, 15, 20, just

702
00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.510
a S just a hair
on the edges around it's.

703
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.340
It's going to be really
interesting if that's the size.

704
00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.380
Cause I don't know if
I want it up by

705
00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.520
my face like that. Yeah.
Now that phone's finally big

706
00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.950
enough that it looks do
sheer to have that phone

707
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.980
to your face, then have
a Bluetooth headset on it's

708
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:26.000
a, yeah. You know, these
are big phones, but yeah,

709
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.940
these are fabulous. It's going
to be really interesting to

710
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.100
see how they manage, how
many of these they make.

711
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.350
Right. They're really going to
have to decide what the

712
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.150
inventory is going to be
like, and who's going to

713
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.060
buy these Well, and it's
supposed to be on sale

714
00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:42.110
in 10 days. So they've
already decided, wow, you're right.

715
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:47.510
Yeah. Yeah. They've made them
they're in boxes somewhere. What

716
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.420
is your go to phone
right now? My nine 25,

717
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.810
the Nokia, I think it's
the best of the, of

718
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:56.540
those phones so far. Well,
I would encourage people who

719
00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.760
are thinking about these kinds
of things. When you buy

720
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.800
a phone, what a great
idea. Thank you. ARS Technica,

721
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.520
make cutouts go and try
all the different ones. Feel

722
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.620
them out. See if this
is, you know, does your

723
00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.590
thumb fit into the upper
corner? Yeah. Can you reach

724
00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.440
across, Hey man, let me
tell you if you're on

725
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.440
the toilet and you've got
one hand and you can't

726
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.770
get the upper left corner,
you pretty much, You know,

727
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.440
I take it upon myself
to leave my phone in

728
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.900
my pocket, on the toilet.
You, the only person in

729
00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.650
America or apparently I'm it,
I'm the only guy. So

730
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.820
like, you know what, there's
nothing happening in that bathroom.

731
00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.730
That is more important that
that super, it needs to

732
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.220
be interrupted by a phone
I need to finish. Then

733
00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.450
we'll deal with that. Thank
you so much, Richard Campbell. I

734
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.510
love these things bad instead
of spontaneous, but you know,

735
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.540
good stuff. But you know,
this is the conversation I

736
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.860
would have had with you
one way or the other.

737
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.250
This is what's great. And
this is why Hansel minutiae,

738
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:51.210
Campbell additions of Hanselman it's
exists is that we have

739
00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.330
these conversations anyway. Yes we
do. Why not just stream

740
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.810
them to the, the, the
goodly people who like them,

741
00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.820
if you liked this, if
you found this to be

742
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.120
even remotely useful, Richard and
I can probably do them

743
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.700
regularly. This is the first
or second when we've done

744
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.680
on Google Hangouts. I'm not
sure if there's any value

745
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.010
in doing them in video.
So if you're listening on

746
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.410
audio, there's a video version.
And if you enjoy the

747
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.270
video version, let us know,
and maybe we'll do more.

748
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.290
We're going to explore. This
has been another episode. We'll

749
00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.520
see you again next week.
