00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:52.790
<inaudible> Hansel minutes.com. It's Hansel
minutes. Oh, weekly discussion with

9
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.920
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

10
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.760
show number four 54. In
this episode, Scott talks with

11
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.590
engineer Erica Stanley about the
internet of things. Hi, this

12
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.930
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

13
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.230
And today I'm talking with
Erica Stanley. She's a technologist

14
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.370
and a technology person who
knows all about IOT. And

15
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.590
this is a buzzword. I've
been very confused about the

16
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.380
internet of things. Thanks for
joining me today. Thanks for

17
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.040
having me. So I saw
you speak at all things

18
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.160
open and you educated a
whole room of a standing

19
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.550
room, only room of people
on IOT. And I felt

20
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.380
like it's time to talk
about that on the show.

21
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
So I am, I appreciate
what you've got to share.

22
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.130
Thanks. It seems like this
is like the new buzzword.

23
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.900
Like this is the word
everyone's like, Oh, I have

24
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.390
T this and IOT that
is this, this, and this

25
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.900
just plug small stuff into
the internet, Partly, I mean,

26
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.350
and, and is very buzzy,
right. But there's a lot

27
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.810
of, there are a lot
of technologies that come into

28
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.680
this that make this and
this interconnected kind of ecosystem

29
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.720
that, that we're slowly creating.
And like, I know a

30
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.450
Arduino was a thing before
IOT became a buzzword. Absolutely.

31
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.120
And I think, you know,
the, the kind of the

32
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.970
maker movement and a lot
of the smaller boards have

33
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.580
really made some of the
things we're seeing with ILT

34
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.150
possible. So I think that,
that it really kind of

35
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.400
furthered this technology and kind
of brought it to the

36
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.340
consumer space a lot sooner
than we may have seen

37
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.520
it. So you're, you're saying
that it was, was it

38
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.710
the connected aspect of it
or was it the maker

39
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.160
movement that brought it to
the forefront? I think it

40
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.540
was, it was a little
bit of both. It was

41
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.820
kind of, you know, the
planets aligning with, with certain

42
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.980
technological aspects of, of, of,
of IOT. So you had

43
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.980
the maker movement, you had
the, a lot of the

44
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.800
different connectivities being more useful,
but also developers having access

45
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.560
to these things I think
has really furthered. This is

46
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.860
really kind of allowed some
innovation in the space that

47
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.930
we may not have seen
for a few years if

48
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.320
we had not had things
like Arduino and raspberry PI.

49
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.670
And it seems like there's,
there's two sides from a,

50
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.780
from a consumer's perspective. There's,
there's all the consumer stuff

51
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.110
that I can plug in,
like a connected refrigerators that

52
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.480
I think rich people have.
And there's now a smart

53
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.500
TVs, but also things like
nest. And then there's the,

54
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.530
the developer side like that,
like you said, the maker

55
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.500
side of things. So let's
talk first about the consumer

56
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.560
side. I have a nest
that would be an IOT

57
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.130
device. Absolutely. Absolutely because it
connects and allows you to,

58
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.110
to monitor, you know, remotely
and on different connected devices.

59
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.210
And then the other thing
I have in my house

60
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.130
is I have an alarm
system through a company called

61
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.310
alarm.com so I can turn
my alarm on and off.

62
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.150
I haven't been able to
get the two to talk

63
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.710
to each other. So I
don't really get the sense

64
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.630
that they're both like open
plan, Right. And there's some

65
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.630
that are more open, right?
There are some where they

66
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.020
have definitely taken into consideration
the different ways that a

67
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.120
user might want to connect
one. I like a lot

68
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.360
of smart things because they
take into consideration a lot

69
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.250
of the ways that you'd
want your home to be

70
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.260
smart. So versus, you know,
it's very different from nest

71
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.380
that, that controls, you know,
temperature in certain things, but

72
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.170
does not necessarily connect with
other smart devices in your

73
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.370
home. Yeah. Where smart things
has a platform to allow

74
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.740
you to do those things.
The platform seems to be

75
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.260
coming up more and more
like, I think maybe IOT

76
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.770
manufacturers have realized that if
it's not open and a

77
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.600
platform that I can build
on that we probably not

78
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.970
going to use it. Absolutely.
And it kind of gets

79
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.420
back to two mobile, maybe
five years ago when, you

80
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.640
know, no one really started
working with different operating systems

81
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.430
until the developers got into
it and started building apps

82
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.190
and started finding new ways
to connect these platforms or

83
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.770
to, to interact with these
platforms. And so I think

84
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.770
that that's, that's something of
what you're seeing with IOT

85
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.010
because the developers are really
kind of pushing us forward.

86
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.630
Yeah. I did see recently
that that nest got support

87
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.470
for IFF TTT. The, if
this, then that kind of

88
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.520
a workflow, this is that
way to plug devices into

89
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.220
other, other things on the
internet, not necessarily devices, but

90
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.100
also social. So I made
it, so if my temperature

91
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.770
got too high, like if
one of my sons turn

92
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.750
the temperature up on the
nest, that it would text

93
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.180
me that, Hey, it's over
75 degrees in the house,

94
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.000
but that doesn't really feel
like quite for me, that

95
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.120
nest was like an open
platform. What does an open

96
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.360
platform look like? What should
a perfect IOT open platform

97
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.870
look like to you? I
would think it's a platform

98
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.940
where you can bring your
own devices, right? You can

99
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.980
bring your own monitoring. You
can, you know, if you

100
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.260
like, and you know, me
being a developer myself, you

101
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.080
could build a monitoring platform
on top of it. So

102
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.090
I think that these are,
you know, different ways that

103
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.610
you can really kind of
push this technology and make

104
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.320
it more user driven, more,
more consumer. Yeah. That's, that's

105
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.030
why you mentioned smart things.
I assume that you don't

106
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.080
have a relationship with the
smart things company. But one

107
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.820
of the things that I
noticed about them is that

108
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.580
smart things that you can
see, it's more things.com supports

109
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.820
like the Phillips hue, connected
light bulb and drop cam

110
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.120
and Belkin, which now is
getting into power on this

111
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.040
kind of space. They don't,
they appear to be more

112
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.080
about a platform and less
about making widgets. Absolutely. Do

113
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.300
you think that someone who's
a, as a consumer who

114
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.640
goes to like home Depot
and wants to buy something,

115
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.820
should be using certain place,
buying certain things and not

116
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.880
others for fear that they
might lock themselves in? I

117
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.200
don't want to be in
vendor, locked in with the

118
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.960
IOT. Absolutely. And it's kind
of hard right now, because

119
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.040
right now we're developing in
silos. It's very vertical in

120
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.380
a lot of ways. So
what I would do is

121
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.260
just kind of research what
you're trying to do as

122
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.930
far as making a certain
aspect of your home or

123
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.680
your life more connected, and
then see the different platforms

124
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.960
that will allow you to
connect and see how you

125
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.540
can connect things that you're
already using. Do that research

126
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.390
before you ever go into
a home Depot so that

127
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.400
you know, that what you're,
what you're bringing home is

128
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.240
going to be able to
be connected to whatever platform

129
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.920
you use. So it sounds
like people like Belkin, they're

130
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.280
starting to build their own
kind of little mini platform.

131
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.770
And if I, if I
buy only Belkin, I'm sure

132
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.040
I'll be fine, but we
all know that's probably not

133
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.630
gonna be there. Right. And
then, you know, what happens

134
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.090
when you want to connect
something that Belkin hasn't created

135
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.910
a device for yet? So,
you know, so you really

136
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.370
want to try to pick
your platform first and then

137
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.840
pick things to, to meld
with that platform. And we

138
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.300
mentioned smart things. What's another
platform that's kind of on

139
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.610
the, on the come up
right now. There are a

140
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.380
few open source platforms. There's
ILT toolkit, that's out there.

141
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.920
And then a few of
the, the kind of boards

142
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.350
that are out there spark
has, has some pretty good

143
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.000
boards that allow different connectivity,
pretty much anything that's compatible

144
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.210
with Arduino Tesla, as we
talked about a little bit

145
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.150
earlier. So a few different
ways to, to kind of

146
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.030
create your own platform. But
from a consumer's perspective, it

147
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.910
doesn't seem like IOT is
quite there. Like we're techies.

148
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.920
We can go and buy
boards and play at know

149
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.950
spark fund and buy stuff.
But what about, you know,

150
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.150
my nontechnical dad, he's going
to go, Oh, Phillips, they

151
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.010
probably aren't good. And then
think that he's fine. Right?

152
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.820
And this is something that,
you know, we brought up

153
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.480
during the talk. If you
remember how it's not, it's,

154
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.790
it's kind of just tipping
his toe in the consumer

155
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.430
space. So the typical consumer
is not going to know

156
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.940
to, you know, to look
for a platform before looking

157
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.160
for a device. They're not
going to think in terms

158
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.350
of platform, they're going to
think I want my alarm

159
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.480
connected to my phone. You
know, they're not going to

160
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.440
think in terms of scalability,
like most developers will, we'll

161
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.900
start to think of. So
in a lot of ways

162
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.870
is not ready for prime
time for the average consumer.

163
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.250
But I think that the,
the techies, the early adopters

164
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.020
can really start push this
and to create this, you

165
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.840
know what we'd like to
see? That's, that's the beautiful

166
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.450
part of, of getting into
something from the very beginning

167
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.670
is that you can start
pushing it in direction. You'd

168
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.840
like it to go, You
know, it remains me, the

169
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.960
internet of things makes me
think about wasn't it called?

170
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.230
<inaudible> it was that power.
This was what was that

171
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.270
called? Where you could, you
could control devices through your

172
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.160
own, not through a network.
Cause there was no wifi.

173
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.530
We were doing it through
the, Yeah. I remember seeing

174
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.110
something about that. Yeah. I've
never played with it though.

175
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.660
Yeah. I think I'm, I'm
showing my age a little

176
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.240
bit, but basically the idea
was you'd have these remote

177
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.820
power systems and it was,
it was a quote unquote

178
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.400
platform, but it was all
based on the running over

179
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.050
the power wires in your
house. And, but even though

180
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.510
it was a standard things
wouldn't work together. So you'd

181
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.290
have these unfortunate incompatibilities. Let's
talk a little bit about

182
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.900
some of the connections that
these devices are using. I

183
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.330
assume wifi is a big
part of the, the internet

184
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.420
of things. Absolutely. But what
is ZigBee? I hear this

185
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.240
word a lot ZigBee. So
ZigBee is kind of a

186
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:03.110
near communication type of, of
connectivity. And it's not in

187
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.530
widespread use. There were a
few years ago. People thought

188
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.690
that ZigBee might be the
way to go. So there

189
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.110
are a few devices that
do have ZigBee connectivity, but

190
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.950
it does seem to be
that Bluetooth, especially BLE is

191
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:21.200
kind of winning that battle.
Low energy. Absolutely. Okay. So

192
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.540
you say it's like a
near field, so it's a,

193
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.480
it's not for hundreds and
hundreds of feet away. This

194
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.470
is Absolutely. And this is
for devices that are close

195
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.280
to each other and you
know, and network that's pretty

196
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.670
local. Hmm. And then there's
another thing that's called Z

197
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.970
wave, which is another wireless
communications protocol as soon. So

198
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.390
it seems like you've got
Z-Wave, you've got ZigBee, you've

199
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.940
got wifi and they're all
at different, different frequency ranges.

200
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.160
You know, some are in
the gigahertz range, like wifi

201
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.910
somewhere down around 900 megahertz.
And each one is trying

202
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.940
to be like the standard
and all we're ending up

203
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.960
with is three standards. Absolutely.
But that's actually pretty good

204
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.560
for us. Right. We do
want these to start standardizing.

205
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.770
It's kind of hard to
develop for, for NFC and

206
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.640
Bluetooth and wifi and ZigBee.
And so it's kind of

207
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.280
nice that they're starting to
narrow down the field a

208
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.100
little bit. And one of
the things that I find

209
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.570
really interesting about this, of
course, if we look at

210
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.780
like some of these non
wifi based are what they

211
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.380
call a mesh network, because
when I plugged in my,

212
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.800
my, my first connected light
bulb, it connected to my

213
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.570
wifi. And then I'm like,
Oh, I'm going to have

214
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.590
to give IP addresses to
every freaking light bulb in

215
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.630
the house. I thought that
was kind of, that's kind

216
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.330
of silly, but there's this
thing called a mesh network.

217
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.740
How does that, So with
a mesh network, everything is

218
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.040
acting as one. It's kind
of like working as one

219
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.070
unit. So the network knows,
or the mesh knows about

220
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.490
his individual nodes, but your
network knows about the mesh.

221
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.950
Ah, okay. So I think
about the, the, the collection

222
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.650
of lights and then the
lights relay the data between

223
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.410
each other. Right? Absolutely. Okay.
So it's almost kind of

224
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.990
like an ad hoc network
where as long as one

225
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.390
of them's involved in my
house, then another one can

226
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.080
all jump in on the
mesh. Exactly. Yeah. Cause I,

227
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.090
you know, I tell you
even with IPV six, I,

228
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.280
I really don't want to
have to think about all

229
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.100
of the IP addresses of
all the tiny devices. Yeah.

230
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.650
I don't think we, any
of us want to, It

231
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.470
seems like fat is one
of the, from a consumer

232
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.230
perspective, the unspoken things about
the internet of things that

233
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.110
people don't realize is that
you may have four or

234
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.620
five IP devices in your
house, your, your X-Box and

235
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.080
your laptop and your phone.
But then if you start

236
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.580
putting in 15, 20, 50
different things, IP cams, and

237
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.060
sensors, this is going to
flood your, your, your, your

238
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:53.700
ability to manage stuff. Yeah,
absolutely. You know, just, just

239
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.400
flooding your wifi signal, you
know, just, just letting that

240
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.080
you have, you know, limited
amounts of bandwidth and we

241
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.090
hit it all the time.
We have a pretty techie

242
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.410
household. And so the more
and more you connect, the

243
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.100
more you're, you know, really
taking out your wifi. Yeah.

244
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.960
I've got some IP cameras
and I had to make

245
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.240
a separate wifi network for
them because they're running all

246
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.220
the time and I kind
of never thought about it,

247
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.340
but that's taken a big
fraction of what's going on

248
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.710
around the house. And people
love the drop cam because

249
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.110
it's kind of like the
nest, it's just very simple

250
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.990
to set up thing, but
that's pushing high Def video.

251
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:33.360
Absolutely. Somehow. So some of
the different things that one

252
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.940
can get involved in from
a developer side, let's switch

253
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.090
to the developer side now
is you mentioned Arduino. What

254
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.040
are some other boards that
I could, I could explore?

255
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.580
Well, we talked about the,
the spark that IO is

256
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.740
coming out. They're actually coming
out with a new one.

257
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.820
That's a little cheaper, but
still has a lot of

258
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.510
the features of the old
one. I think that's coming

259
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.420
out first quarter of 2015.
And I think as a

260
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.940
board I would buy, right.
Well, it's actually kind of

261
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.700
like a platform. And so
they have their own board

262
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.780
and they have a new
one coming out. There's one

263
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.850
already out that you can
buy. And I think you

264
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.920
can buy that for about
40 bucks. Right. And then

265
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.280
there's the, the spark photon.
So basically they're giving you

266
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.390
the wifi connectivity for, I
think $20. Right? So, so

267
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.240
this is a, you know,
a faster, you know, board

268
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.600
with more features for less
than the current board. And

269
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.290
that's coming out the quarter
first quarter of 2015. Okay.

270
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.830
And these, these kits, these
are called dev kits. Right.

271
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.370
I would basically build the
connectivity. I want, I don't

272
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.070
buy one board that has
like a laptop. It has

273
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.900
Bluetooth, it has wifi. When
I get one of these

274
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.720
boards, it has nothing basically.
Right, right. But they do

275
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.360
have, again, the dev kits
available so that you have

276
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.360
everything you need for, you
know, your purpose. They have

277
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.280
a few for, for beginners
so that you have a

278
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.210
lot of the, the modules
that you would need to

279
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.330
start building for, for IOT.
And then they have some,

280
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.520
some kind of more professional
modules that you can can

281
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.770
build from. Some of these
are really, really small, like

282
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.100
the size of like an
SD card, the spark is,

283
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.490
is got, you know, I
think it's got two megs

284
00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.920
of external flash and it's
about the size of your

285
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.010
thumb. Yeah. And then the
latest one, the full time,

286
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.860
as you mentioned, is even
smaller than, than the current

287
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.590
one. Another one that I
like a lot is a

288
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.560
MetAware has a board that
has a lot of things

289
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.290
just kind of built in.
And it's, it's also very

290
00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.750
small, not quite as small
as the photon, but very

291
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:34.390
small. And that the MetAware
platform has an open API

292
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.240
for Android and for iOS.
And a lot of these

293
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.660
devices use a use arm
as their, their processor of

294
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.590
choice for, I assume, Yes.
I believe that's the case.

295
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.710
So some of these dev
platforms come with lots of

296
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.010
different sensors like accelerometers and
temperature sensors. What are some

297
00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.700
other sensors I might plug
into something like this. So

298
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.830
you might have a, a
gyroscope, you might have a,

299
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.930
a magnetometer, something for pressure
and altitude. And then there's

300
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.200
something called a sensor fusion
chip, which will have a

301
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.530
lot of the sensors kind
of built in, Ah, interesting.

302
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.050
I've saw at spark fund
where I can buy sensors

303
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.690
kind of onesy twosy, you
know, for 15, 20 bucks.

304
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.150
But it seems like even
those are getting made smaller

305
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.140
and smaller and smaller. Absolutely.
And the benefit of say

306
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.200
a sensor fusion chip is
that you have the smaller

307
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.170
chip that can connect to
a lot of different sensors

308
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.110
and it makes your device,
you know, less clumsy. Yeah.

309
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.470
So when I take a
dev kit like this, it's

310
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.410
home kind as, is a
little MacGyver ask, you know,

311
00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.650
the resulting solution, right. It
ends up being a bunch

312
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.220
of things wired together on
a breadboard. How do I

313
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.300
take that from, from, I
guess, prototype stage into something

314
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.800
I'd actually, you know, So
once you're moving past the

315
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.040
prototype stage, you're probably going
to want to build these

316
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.980
things into the board. So,
so you're not going to

317
00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.890
be kind of plug and
play as we were talking

318
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.840
about before, you're going to
want to create a board

319
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.360
that has, you know, whatever
senses you need that has

320
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.890
the built in X accelerometer,
you know, pressure aptitude sensor

321
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.420
in inside the board versus,
you know, putting them all

322
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.150
together kind of ad hoc.
So it seems like for

323
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:20.020
the hobbyist, that's probably beyond
a lot of people's expertise.

324
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.420
It certainly sounds beyond mine.
Like I can, I can

325
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.600
intellectualize what you're saying. And
I could say, I wish

326
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.790
that I had a board
that had these three sensors

327
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.830
on it, but I would
probably not be able to

328
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.530
do that. Well, at that
point, you, you really want

329
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.440
to start looking into manufacturing
is what you want to

330
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.910
do. And so you're going
to want to find, you

331
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.550
know, your, your electrician, you
know, the people who understand

332
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.370
the electrical engineering behind all
of this stuff. And so

333
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.930
at that point, you're going
to want to start getting

334
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.590
more people involved and start
building that kind of from

335
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:52.140
scratch. So as a non
Hardware person, I could prototype

336
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.000
this stuff. I could, I
could show it to someone

337
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.500
who knows more about hardware
and say, look, I have

338
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.960
to made the most amazing
thing that will water plants

339
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.840
automatically. And then we would
take, I built it on

340
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.920
the blank platform, the MetAware
platform, the Arduino platform, the

341
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.590
whatever platform. And then now
we go and take it

342
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.410
from prototype a little bit
more. Right. And then you

343
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.170
start kind of blueprinting it
together with your, your electrical

344
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.930
engineer to come up with
something that you know is

345
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.020
kind of all in one.
So we talked about how

346
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.920
some of them use arm
and these different processors. Am

347
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.070
I writing C for most
of these applications, or can

348
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.380
I write higher level languages?
And some of them, you

349
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.590
can, most of them start
with a C like language,

350
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.920
and then there are different
ways to incorporate, you know,

351
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.750
very high level languages like
JavaScript. And then also, you

352
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.220
know, your, your mobile languages,
so, you know, Java and

353
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.820
stuff for Android. So there
are different ways to kind

354
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.490
of build on the, the
natural language, which is in

355
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.760
most cases, very C like,
and to get more functionality

356
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.210
by using some of these
higher level languages. It seems

357
00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.530
like, like I said before,
that there's the, there's the

358
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.950
hobbyist level of complexity, which
I don't think I necessarily

359
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.750
want to be teaching my
kids see kind of at

360
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.720
this level, they're young, but
the barrier to entry kind

361
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.150
of hits right there at,
at that C in electrical

362
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.090
engineering. I saw that the
TESL T E S S

363
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.860
E l.io uses Java, Right.
That's based on no JS.

364
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.640
So that's something that's a
lot less intimidating for the

365
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.360
hobbyist or for somebody who's
kind of new to, you

366
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.210
know, to development, especially for
hardware. A lot of us

367
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.660
are either software developers or
we're hardware. So the Tesla

368
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.230
is really cool that it
kind of abstracts a lot

369
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.660
of that stuff so that
if you're, you know, typically

370
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.450
a software person that you
can get started right away.

371
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.060
And I suppose that even
theoretically, that would be a

372
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.040
prototyping. I mean, I guess
I could go live with

373
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.830
a TESL, but I could
also prototype it, give it

374
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.810
to someone else and they
might make a tiny board

375
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.840
and do it all and
see again for me. Right,

376
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.550
right. I'm looking at the
list of modules that it

377
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.680
has just to get people
thinking about what they could

378
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.740
do. Reading RFID cards, like
badging into, to work controlling

379
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:09.500
servos on remote control cars,
key pads, motion detectors. I

380
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.380
think sometimes it's so overwhelming.
People don't even realize how

381
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.100
much they could do with
the internet of things. Absolutely.

382
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.320
I mean, at this point
you can create a sensor

383
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.050
for just about everything or
use a sensor for just

384
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.130
about everything, anything that you
want to monitor, there's something

385
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.680
out there for it. Yeah.
I'm even looking here, there's

386
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.430
a pulse sensor where someone
could look at your fingertip

387
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.660
and fire and event on
every heartbeat. Absolutely. And we're

388
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.020
seeing that, you know, come,
come about in more wearables

389
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.230
where you have the continuous
pulse monitoring. So, I mean,

390
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.170
it's something that we're starting
to see in the consumer

391
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.460
space as well. Now when
met at all things Open,

392
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.890
I think I talked to
you briefly about the fact

393
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.870
that I was a diabetic
and that I'm interested in

394
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.770
connecting my different diabetes devices.
Recently, I went to a,

395
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.830
a diabetes tech event and
I was told by someone

396
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.990
who worked for, I triple
E that they're actually working

397
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:07.690
on Bluetooth profiles for medical
devices, like my insulin pump

398
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.930
and like my continuous glucose
meter is awesome. So that

399
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.670
could be the internet of
things too. Right. I mean,

400
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.330
I can plug that in.
It definitely is. It definitely

401
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.460
is. I mean, really the
internet of things is about

402
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.540
monitoring your environment and your
world. And so you have

403
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.940
to find those things that
you care about monitoring on

404
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.400
a regular basis. And, and
how can you use that

405
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.640
information to make it useful
to you? That that's what

406
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.280
it's all about. Yeah. I'm
thinking I just, this just

407
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.650
literally had this idea that
let's say that you're, you're

408
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.010
maybe deaf and you have,
you have diabetes and you

409
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.200
want to flash the lights
in your house when your

410
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.540
blood sugar goes low. I
mean, like that's the level

411
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.330
at which we're talking about.
You have an infinite number

412
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:49.980
of things that you could
potentially plug into. Absolutely. So

413
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.960
talk to me a little
bit about Arduino, cause it

414
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.240
feels like Arduino kicked a
lot of this stuff off

415
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.430
from the maker perspective. Like
you pointed out at the

416
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.700
beginning, there's a thing called
an Arduino shield. Is this

417
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.240
like a standard for plugging
stuff into other stuff? Yeah.

418
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.640
So this is pretty standard
for our doing all bores

419
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.230
is that you have a
shield that will allow you

420
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.580
to add different modules to
add different sensors so that

421
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.610
you're, you're capturing some of
these, these events that you

422
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.350
can actually, you know, create
triggers for, as you just

423
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.610
explained what the pulse monitoring
And is this notion of

424
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.460
a shield, this, this is
like a hardware, what they

425
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.100
call a PCB, right. That
plugs on top of stuff.

426
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.290
But it seems like it's
not necessarily specific to Arduino

427
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:32.790
because competing platforms say, Hey,
we'll use a shield. We're

428
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:36.930
not Arduino, but we can
use those devices. Oh, absolutely.

429
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.290
And most of the boards
out there are creating modules

430
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.080
and shields that are compatible
with Arduino because are doing

431
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.000
all was kind of the
first to start this whole

432
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:49.320
maker movement with the internet
of things And the shields,

433
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.940
whether it be sensors or
what are, do we know

434
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.840
called shields? They've got things
like weather, even ones that

435
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.990
do like MP3 players, really
anything. Is there a particular

436
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.170
shield that, that is your
most, most favorite or most

437
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.740
fun? I'm working with a
few different things. Well, actually

438
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.940
currently I'm working with MetAware
and we'll be moving soon

439
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.950
to spark the full time,
but I like controlling things

440
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.080
around my house. I like
controlling the lights and those

441
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.770
kinds of things. So, so
just understanding, you know, ambient

442
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.520
light and sound kind of
things. Climate are, you know,

443
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.620
those kinds of sensors are
the ones I use most,

444
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.670
My kids were impressed with
one that flashed the lights,

445
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.340
like a disco based on
the sound of the music

446
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.980
that was playing on an
MP3. I just went to

447
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.200
a workshop where a guy
was showing that and it

448
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.930
was, it was pretty cool.
What, what lights, what, what

449
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.480
consumer based internet of things,
products do you have in

450
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.220
your house Working with smart
things and trying to see

451
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.170
how I can extend that
I haven't come up with

452
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.580
any really cool extensions yet,
but really like smart things

453
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.150
right now. Did you buy
any of the Phillips shoe

454
00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:59.710
light bulbs? I bought some
that were called LIFX life

455
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.760
light effects. No, I haven't
experimented with the Phillips light

456
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.220
bulbs. One of the things
that I've been worried about

457
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.440
is, is security. And it's
come up with me with,

458
00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:12.520
with light bulbs where that
light bulb might save the

459
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.310
password for my wifi in
an insecure way. And again,

460
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.830
as a consumer, I don't
know this. And there was

461
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.380
a time there for a
couple of weeks where there

462
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.600
was a bug in the
particular light bulb that I

463
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.510
had where someone could basically
leap into the mesh network

464
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.650
and then hop a second
hop into my wifi. Does

465
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.230
that mean by my refrigerator
in my IOT is now

466
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.090
an entry point into my
house. You're going to take

467
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.640
all my stuff In some
ways. Yes. I mean, I

468
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.910
mean, I hate to say
that, but I think in

469
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.330
a lot of cases, we
have kind of run full

470
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:47.560
speed with internet of things
without taking security into consideration.

471
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.020
And so this is something
that we need to be

472
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.990
thinking about from the moment
we start working with our

473
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.420
prototypes from the moment we
start working with our boards

474
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.330
and start coding. So if
you do that, you, you

475
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.180
won't have a situation where
you have, you know, your,

476
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.110
your password stored in plain
text. I mean, if you

477
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.450
had thought about that before,
I mean, not you, but

478
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.540
if the developer or, or,
you know, the person who's

479
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.060
creating these devices, if they
would think about these things

480
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.460
before you wouldn't have to
just kind of throw in,

481
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.940
you know, plain text passwords.
So, so I think that

482
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.370
that's the kind of next
step and it needs to

483
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.270
be, you know, right now,
honestly, that we need to

484
00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.250
start taking a look at,
like, this is going to

485
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.270
pretty much push out so
much data about individuals. How

486
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.130
are you going to protect
that individual? How are you

487
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.640
going to, to make that
information anonymous so that we

488
00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.080
can't target certain individuals? You
know, we really need to

489
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.720
start thinking about security before
we go much further with

490
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.410
the, the, the features and
the, the competitive, the, the

491
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.710
capabilities of, of the internet
of things. Yeah. And it

492
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:52.570
seems also like there's security
from a InfoSec perspective in

493
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.670
the sense of is my
house secure, is someone going

494
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.770
to be able to sit
in the car, you know,

495
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.900
an NSA van in the
front of my house and

496
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.720
break in there's that level
of security, but there's also

497
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.790
like, you alluded to a
little bit there as like

498
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.060
personal security, like whether or
not someone could find out

499
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.490
if I'm home or not,
by looking at my things

500
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.250
or is Facebook going to
start collecting information and how

501
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.230
I use lighting, and then
I'm going to get some

502
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.470
creepy advertisement, you know, Hey,
it looks like you, like,

503
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.890
You probably will. It seems
like they'll consumer data and

504
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.330
is engaged in this as
well. Absolutely. And so we

505
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.270
have to find different ways,
you know, looking at you

506
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.140
mentioned Facebook and what a
lot of people don't realize

507
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.420
is that there's a way
to control how Facebook uses

508
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.140
your data. Now you're limited
because, you know, sure look

509
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.010
at their terms and conditions,
but there are ways to

510
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.580
protect yourself. Yeah. So as
consumers, we have to be

511
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.300
more aware of our information,
the information that's out there

512
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.050
about us, but how we
can protect it. And all

513
00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.320
of these things are in
the ULAs right? The user

514
00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.690
end user license agreements. But,
you know, I realized that

515
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.150
I'm in logging in to
like my alarm.com or my

516
00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.750
nest using different logins and
not really thinking about, well,

517
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.180
gosh, that used ooff. And
now there's a relationship between

518
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.010
these two companies. Like I
just pointed out the very

519
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.160
beginning. I talked about if
this, then that, and I'm

520
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.680
like, well, they can log
into my nest. Now. I

521
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.590
didn't even really think about
plugging those social logins to

522
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.230
each other. And I don't
know how, if I can

523
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.970
understand it and you can
barely understand it. How do

524
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.460
we explain that to our
parents? That's a very good

525
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.590
point. We need to start
working through this now and

526
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.090
creating standards around this now
so that we can start

527
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:33.560
explaining it to the average
consumer. Yeah, absolutely. Also updates

528
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.930
have been a huge problem
while my nest has been

529
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.170
truly one of the most
polished devices I've ever owned.

530
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.260
It updates itself automatically. I
had to flash the firmware

531
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.570
on my light bulbs three
different times in the last

532
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:49.910
year. And it's not fun.
I imagine it isn't. So

533
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.450
that's very interesting that you
have this mesh that's connected

534
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.400
to your wifi, and we
can't find a way to

535
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.060
update this over, you know,
over your wireless connections. Well,

536
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.520
it seems like that's not,
it wasn't in the case

537
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.770
of my particular brand of
light bulbs, it wasn't really

538
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.070
their priority. Right. I had
to actually download an app

539
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.250
and of course know that
I needed to then run

540
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.340
the app on my windows
machine. And then literally it

541
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.040
was like, don't touch your
light bulbs. So my wife

542
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.570
is like, why are the
lights on at two in

543
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.550
the morning here? Well, I'm
flashing them. Well, I'm gonna

544
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.520
turn them off. Don't turn
them off. They're flashing. Like

545
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:26.090
that's not, that's not okay.
I mean, my, my nontechnical

546
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.520
people shouldn't have to think
about that. And, and that

547
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.900
kind of goes back to
what we were talking about

548
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.120
with security. You have to
think about these things. You

549
00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.310
have to think about your
user from the very beginning.

550
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.460
I mean, that's any, anything
that you're doing, whether you're

551
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.890
doing web development, whether you're
doing mobile development, you should

552
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.710
be thinking about how can
you make life easier for

553
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.230
your user. And so that's,
that's one of those, those

554
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.320
situations where they maybe didn't
take the user into consider.

555
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.350
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And I
know that that's been a

556
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.700
passion of yours as well.
I mean, you have an

557
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.030
understanding about the user experience
as it relates to the

558
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.400
hardware development that you do
and making sure that you

559
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.940
keep the user thinking first.
Right. And there was something

560
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.040
that I learned from, I
think it was a Google

561
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.350
glass workshop and something that
I've taken with me when

562
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.610
I, when I do a
lot of the prototyping or

563
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.060
when, when I work on
anything really, and it's developed

564
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.760
for the user, not for
the technology as developers. A

565
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.410
lot of times we can,
you know, we want to

566
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.840
see how far we can
push things. You will want

567
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.750
to see, you know, what's
the latest, cool feature that

568
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.840
we can make use of
immediately. And if that's not,

569
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.300
if you can't do that
in a way where it's,

570
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.900
you know, makes things easier
for the user and delights

571
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.420
your user, then maybe we
shouldn't be doing them. Yeah.

572
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.700
I, I keep coming back
to the nest because I

573
00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.490
feel like today, that's the
example, like that's the pinnacle.

574
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.730
I walked past my nest
yesterday and noticed that it

575
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.510
had itself and it told
me the weather outside. And

576
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.220
it didn't do that a
year ago when I turned

577
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.170
the thing on. So like
a new feature showed up

578
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.220
and I was delighted. Exactly.
You should always, if you're

579
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.810
going to surprise your user,
it should be in a

580
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.370
way that delights them. It
should not be in a

581
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.320
way. That's like what I
have to flash this every

582
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.370
three, you know? So Yesterday
I was at Intel giving

583
00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:01.080
a talk and I was
kind of a gentleman was

584
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.260
kind enough to give me
an Intel Edison, which is

585
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.710
an Intel processor. And I
could actually, it's running Linux.

586
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.960
I could remote into this
thing. I can SSH into

587
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.290
it. And I can run
top that really brings to

588
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.050
mind a question about, at
what level do I want

589
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.900
to operate? Do I want
a fully featured computer, which

590
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.180
this is, or do I
want something that's like an

591
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.600
Arduino, which is really a
single use device. And I

592
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.630
think they really, it really,
the term, you have to

593
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.510
determine what you need, this,
this particular device to do.

594
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.940
How connected do you need
this device to be? How

595
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.460
powerful do you need this
device to be? Because if

596
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.200
you don't need some of
the power that you might

597
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.420
get from an Edison, you
may want to move to

598
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.230
something that's a smaller and,
and only tracks the things

599
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.690
that you needed to track.
But if you're building, you

600
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.290
know, say something, that's going
to be like an immediate

601
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.760
advice or, you know, something
that's going to require more

602
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.300
power. That's going to be
using say displays certain, you

603
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.430
know, if you need that,
then you may want to

604
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.100
move to something like the
Edison. Yeah. Yeah. It seems

605
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.960
like the Edison has definitely
got the power to do

606
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.360
something like run a tiny
touch display. I could use

607
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.230
it for like my own
custom touch panel. Well, I

608
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.950
see Arduinos doing more like
led, what are those called?

609
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.040
The LEDs that are like
the, the stock ticker type

610
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.560
of a thing, but I
wouldn't necessarily want to run

611
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.680
a full screen. Yeah. Yeah.
You, you you'll start to

612
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.290
kind of buzz it. So
I don't think you mean

613
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.660
you'd want to do that.
What do you recommend that

614
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.120
people who are listening to
get started Vegas, go Arduino

615
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.370
and do that? Or should
they go with your favorite?

616
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:33.780
Which was, what was your
favorite Lately? I've been using

617
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.590
a MetAware, which, which has
a bit of a learning

618
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.770
curve. So if you're not
already a mobile developer, you

619
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.350
would have to kind of
get familiar with either, you

620
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.530
know, iOS or Android development.
But there are a few

621
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.660
things out there. I mean,
you know, we talked about

622
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.530
spark spark core, having the
full time out there, there

623
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:58.830
are a few different devices,
Arduinos Edison, but a lot

624
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.460
of these require, like you
said, C like languages. So

625
00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.120
if you're not familiar with
developing at a low level,

626
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.130
you may want to start
there. You may want to

627
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.340
start with kind of familiarizing
yourself with low level type

628
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.040
development. I see. I would
want to make sure that

629
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.040
people know that spark the
spark photon, the one that

630
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.970
you were talking about that
spark.io is different from spark

631
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.000
fund, which is an electronics
company where you can buy

632
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.490
these things. Right? So that,
that might take a second

633
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.610
to understand, Right? I believe
that spark, that IO is

634
00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.790
built on the spark core
platform versus like you said,

635
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.640
spark fund, Which is a
store and you can buy

636
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.990
a lot of great stuff.
Then the thing that I

637
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.290
like about spark fund for
getting started is you can

638
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.190
buy bundles and save money.
Very cool stuff there. Yeah.

639
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.440
Yeah. And putting together, I've
been putting other robots with

640
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.690
my, with my kids and
they have enjoyed that very

641
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.770
much. And I know that
rock bot who we had

642
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.570
on this show a while
back is a big fan

643
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.480
of using node as the,
as a, as an introductory

644
00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.890
language. So the TESL is
an extremely friendly place to

645
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.580
start for those who aren't
necessarily into C. Right. And,

646
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:08.320
and this really gets to
something that, that I mentioned

647
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.840
at the talk is, choose
your hardware first, choose your

648
00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.630
hardware based on what you
know, what you're comfortable with.

649
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.300
And that's going to influence
a lot of your software

650
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.630
decisions. So if you're already
familiar with JavaScript and node,

651
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.300
then the TESL is, is,
you know, the natural choice.

652
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.220
And, and the, the thing
that I like about the

653
00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.050
Tesla is that it has
wifi built in. Do you

654
00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.120
think that's important to stick
with, as a beginner to

655
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.460
start with wifi rather than
going into Bluetooth or ZigBee?

656
00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.270
I do, because we're pretty
familiar with wifi. There's not

657
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.370
a whole lot of custom
coding we're going to have

658
00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:39.040
to do to connect certain
things with wifi. There's a

659
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.750
lot of handshaking that goes
on with Bluetooth. So you're

660
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.150
definitely going to want to
get involved in that, but

661
00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.610
this is kind of, you
know, a soft introduction to

662
00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.000
the connectivity, Right? Absolutely. And
everyone agrees that this is

663
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.860
going to be big. Like
it is a buzz word.

664
00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.410
And it's certainly the buzz
word that we're all excited

665
00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:59.740
about, but they they're saying
that connected stuff is going

666
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.590
to be like the biggest
thing ever. It's the biggest

667
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.960
thing since the internet, Right?
It's going to be the

668
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.190
new internet pretty much. If
we're going to make a

669
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:10.780
Skynet and the terminators are
going to come and show

670
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.480
us all, they will probably
start with IOT. They're saying,

671
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.650
it's going to be like,
you know, multi, multi, multi

672
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.680
billion dollar industry in the
next five years. So a

673
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.360
good time to jump in
and learn how to make

674
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.150
this stuff. Absolutely. We want
to kind of be ahead

675
00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.880
of the curve there. Cool.
Well, thanks so much, Erica

676
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.710
Stanley for talking to me
about the internet of things.

677
00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.760
Thank you. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

678
00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.140
we'll see you again next
week.
