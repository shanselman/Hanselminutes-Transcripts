00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.810
Scott Hanselman and this is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

9
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.320
Today. We're chatting with the
creative director of stack overflow,

10
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.860
Jen young, also someone who
is crushing me currently in

11
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.640
words with friends online Scrabble
game. Hey, thanks for coming

12
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.470
on the show. Thank you
for having me Scott. So

13
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.000
you're a designer and you,
you, you self identify currently

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.110
as a designer? Yes, I,
I think I've always been

15
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.290
designer, but for a while
I worked as a developer

16
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.180
speak your language somewhat. How
did you start? Right? Did

17
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.260
you start as a developer?
No. Well, since I was

18
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.590
in high school, I was
always interested in design and

19
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.260
the technical side, I got
a, well, this goes back

20
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.540
a little bit further while
I was in high school.

21
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.180
My parents bought me my
first computer. It was a,

22
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.360
I think it was a
four 86 33 megahertz for

23
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.540
makes Ram. That was a
big deal back then. So

24
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.660
I always did graphic work
on that. And at the

25
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.850
same time I was seeing
trust in games and you

26
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.520
know, a lot of on
BVS. And so I really

27
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.920
liked to tinker with computers.
I remember I had a

28
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.560
stack of disks, you know,
you had, you had to

29
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.890
have different like memory booters
for different games back then

30
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.150
I was like to think
are so. And what I

31
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.070
actually went to college for
computer engineering, labor nod. It

32
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.710
was a choice of school
of design where computer engineering

33
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.680
and my Chinese parents wanting
me to have a real

34
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.910
job one day. So Wait
a second. So you wanted

35
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.010
to go to school, like
for design or art design,

36
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.200
what's your, Yeah, I took
architecture and drafting and art

37
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.860
for four years. So I
was really into that. And

38
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.920
of course I'll just computer
skills I had, I've taught

39
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.240
myself and my parents said,
no, no school design because

40
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.680
they didn't want me to
be a starving artist. So

41
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.710
that kind of just kicked
in and I played her

42
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.550
Reddit. Wow. Is that a,
is that a Chinese thing

43
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.970
or is that a, your
parents thing? I think overall

44
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.310
it was a Chinese thing.
Of course I'm just being

45
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.530
stereotypical here. I think it's
either doctors or, Well, you

46
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.640
get to be stereotypical because
you, 50% of all the

47
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.330
Chinese people on. Yeah. You
can do that. I represent

48
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.230
all the Scottish people. Totally
pick. I can pick on

49
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.330
them like, you know, they
suck and everything. So I

50
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.570
can say that and I
just got it right. I

51
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.220
think it was a really
good experience regardless. I kind

52
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.060
of wish I picked computer
science at the computer and

53
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.350
in engineering, which was mostly
electrical engineering courses. And on

54
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.960
courses of computer science, I
took a sense lead data

55
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.610
structure, you know, C plus
plus it was just a

56
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.870
really good experience, I think
because, you know, school engineering

57
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.400
and guards, how to be
analytical, you have to working

58
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.230
in a team where I
think if I had chosen

59
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.590
to our school, I honestly
don't know how that would

60
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.960
affect me today. Cause I,
I think I had a

61
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.300
pretty good analytical skill as
well. Okay. And would you

62
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.010
were just like kind of
doing art on the side

63
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.280
here or what? Yeah, pretty
much. You know, I was

64
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.090
drew a sketch and I
used to, I think my

65
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.820
first of graphic program was
Photoshop 2.0, that was way

66
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.830
back. That was before layers.
You know, when you, if

67
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.500
you want it to make
it simple job shadow, you

68
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.320
said you had to do
two images. You know, one,

69
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.740
for example, you have a
Trump shadow text, you have

70
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.690
to have one image just
with your texts. And now

71
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.800
there's layer either image with
offset, text blurred, and then

72
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.560
you have to calculate those
two, you know, the difference

73
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.410
between those two. So you
get these drop shadow effect

74
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.750
and you have to piece
that back onto original text.

75
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.440
So it was a pain.
So that's why I kept

76
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.350
on telling them designers the
space, you know, it's like

77
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.540
cheating. You can just do
all these all sound effects

78
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.260
with one layer in Tupelo
shop today. There's always been

79
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.260
that strange impedance mismatch between
the Photoshop comp, you know,

80
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.310
the Photoshop composite and then
the, and now I have

81
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.410
to turn it into the
web. You know, I was

82
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.920
always frustrated with designers because
they would come up with

83
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.920
this ridiculous design. And I
would just say that doesn't

84
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.810
look like a webpage. It
was like a tee shirt.

85
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.490
Yeah. There are definitely designers
who produce stuff like that.

86
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.690
And they'll send it into
that. Just regarding to your

87
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.440
question. I would say designer,
I would say, because I

88
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.650
started, I was lucky. I
got my first design related

89
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.470
shop back in 1995. Of
course I wouldn't really call

90
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.710
it what designed back then,
because you can't really design

91
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.500
anything for, for mosaic for
elsewhere. Right? You remember from

92
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.120
mosaic? I remember it because
you know, it was just

93
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.850
a standard gray background with
a Roman font because back

94
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.010
then I remember you couldn't
even put an image tech

95
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.220
tables. So because back then
you had to rely on

96
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.810
tables out to buy out
your page. Luckily I think

97
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.560
Netscape came out shortly after
that. So Netscape was pretty

98
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.880
awesome back then. So you've
been designing That long. You

99
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.310
were actually designing with browsers
that weren't able to do

100
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.850
anything like what you wanted
them to do. Yeah. Funny

101
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.450
story. Because my first website,
it was off my college

102
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.090
accounts, Google account. Of course
it was a really typical

103
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.040
yard. I was like, then
you're off at www, whatever.edu/user/this

104
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.310
really long URL. And I
remember I made my first

105
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.430
web page. It was really
awesome. And at least I

106
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.470
thought it was, and I
post the link. I use

107
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.790
that because I was really
newsgroups were really big back

108
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.780
then. And then I got
these complaints that was the

109
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.900
first cross browser complaint I
ever got because this lady

110
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.310
was using links. She lived
that. She was saying, Oh,

111
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.340
I see, is image, image,
image, tags. You know, I

112
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.590
have no idea what they
are. And I was like,

113
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.660
what is the link? And
I later I found out

114
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.690
was the text is browser.
So I've had to put

115
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.190
all texts in there. So
those people can see, It's

116
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.170
lucky that you didn't drop
out of design at that

117
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.470
point. Yeah. My first job,
you know, of course back

118
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.700
then, it was really easy
to learn HTML because the

119
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.760
first draft was, I think
there were less than 20

120
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.550
texts each to nail tags
and there was no CSS.

121
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.140
My first job was with,
at universities agriculture department. And

122
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.420
my, my first task was
convert 2007 work WordPerfect documents

123
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.800
into HTML by hand, because
back then there weren't any,

124
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.050
which used to be what
you get editor or some

125
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.270
kind of, well, there was
one, there was a Unix

126
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.760
program to hotdog where you
can automatically parse HTML poorly.

127
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.300
So I think that was
kind of like a boot

128
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.410
camp on hand coding age
to now Doesn't that sound

129
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.860
like kind of a, a
task that you would automate?

130
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.950
I mean, I guess like,
I guess as a, actually

131
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.120
this is what I want
to just, this is what

132
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.860
I want to kind of
discover and like dig into

133
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.570
is the mind of the
code versus the mind of

134
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.840
the designer. And because you
were a coder and a

135
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.020
designer, you're kind of like
my spy on the inside,

136
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.810
you know, you can like
sneak over and hang out

137
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.550
with like the hipster. Cool.
You know, well-dressed designer people

138
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.630
and then report back to
the developers. But how many,

139
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.130
how many documents did you
have that you had to

140
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:18.310
convert? You didn't do those
manually. Did you? I actually

141
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.520
did at least 1000 and
later on, I tried, you

142
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.190
know, that program at mission
hotdog and it wasn't that

143
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.500
good. That's I mean, what
does 80% of the job

144
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.720
for me, but that's, you
have to go back clean

145
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.710
up song. Yeah. Like anything
that you have, like from

146
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.930
a program or mindset or
anything you can do twice

147
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.950
you shouldn't, you can automate.
Right. So like maybe even

148
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.140
if the tools didn't exist,
I don't think that I,

149
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.910
I guess I would say
if you couldn't automate it,

150
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.830
I wouldn't even do it.
That's just the idea of

151
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.520
doing it manually is Right.
It's like then I, I

152
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.330
wouldn't call myself a programmer.
And because that was 1995

153
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.520
when I was first introduced
to the web. But as

154
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.760
soon after that, I started
picking up more developer skills

155
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.410
because, you know, simple HTML,
static website just didn't cut

156
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.190
it anymore. And especially my
freelance, you know, my clients

157
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.080
keep on asking more and
more stuff, you know, they

158
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.760
want the NAMIC contents, you
know, that's why I learned

159
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.580
as the classic ASP back
then. So, you know, I

160
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.720
used to set up these
access database where a SQL

161
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.370
server and using class, the
ASP, which I really liked

162
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.190
and I believe or not,
that was pretty simple. Of

163
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.570
course, back then, I believe
SB only has five intrinsic

164
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:40.380
objects, right. With request response
server session. I don't know

165
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.390
if you'd count dictionary as
a, Are you trying to

166
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.500
prove your tele-health developer chops
with the request response server

167
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.590
cache application? I don't remember
what they were, something like

168
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:57.350
that. Right. I'm trying to
select some muscle here. In

169
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:02.180
fact, yeah. Later on, I
just moved to asp.net. I

170
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.770
actually had, I was actually
certified in asp.net VB, which

171
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.400
it is funny after that
I just stopped using.net. I

172
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.190
actually, I stopped programming altogether
because I just couldn't keep

173
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.040
up with these new versions
without an ad coming out

174
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:22.130
every year. So, But don't,
you have to keep up

175
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.570
on design though. I mean,
you were saying that you

176
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.300
quit programming because you didn't
like keeping up with all

177
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.420
the speed of stuff, but
isn't there always stuff going

178
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.730
on in design. I mean,
design do designers, like It's

179
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.620
a little bit different. I
w I would say, well,

180
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.300
what design is constantly evolving
because you know what designs,

181
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.240
I don't like the traditional
print design, what the science

182
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.080
is still technology based, right?
There are new HTML specs

183
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.230
coming out and new suspects
and there's new ways of

184
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.330
using JavaScript or jQuery to
do things. So that aspect

185
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.590
is I have to keep
up with. And, but that's

186
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.200
really easy though, because HTML
and CSS are just simple

187
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.970
markup language and pounds of
jQuery libraries. So that part

188
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.570
is not hard, but the
other aspect about design, I

189
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.870
think it's a lot more
time, for example, you know,

190
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:16.070
the traditional design principles, associates,
typography layout, you know, color

191
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.390
theories, those have long established.
And on that part, it

192
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.590
doesn't does not change that
much. So to me, it's

193
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.760
a little bit easier. And
another reason I quit programming

194
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.970
is not because I hated
it. I really, really enjoy

195
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.200
the aspect, but I was
consider myself as a coder

196
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.840
instead of a programmer. You
know what I mean? And

197
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.790
that's, that's the thing I
want to talk about. Definitely.

198
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.360
Yeah, because there's, I mean,
as I said, the only

199
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.150
reason I pick up prolonging
skill is to aid my

200
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.780
design. I want it to
be this awesome for farmer.

201
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.730
That's why I pick up
programming. It just clients demand

202
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.900
a lot more. And I
was freelancing on my own,

203
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.940
the late nineties, and that's
why I learnt sequel database

204
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.580
store procedures. And, and I
just found that I was

205
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.080
not very good at it.
You know, I'm sure there

206
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.960
were better ways to rise
to the close and the

207
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.960
crap I was coming up
with. So I just thought,

208
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.950
you know what, it's not
fair for a project and

209
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.110
five code because I know
I'm not the best program

210
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.070
out there. I'd rather have
a really awesome program through

211
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.090
that part. And I just
do the part I like,

212
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.850
and that is, which is
the front end. I really,

213
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.100
really like front end. Cause
to me, it's a lot

214
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.280
more gratifying because when you
push a design out there

215
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.350
where you code the front
end and people will see

216
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.380
that right away. Whereas if
I'm just spreading these lines

217
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.450
of ASP coding, backhand, nobody
will see it. She liked

218
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.400
to be out front and
to have people really know

219
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.200
that I made that. Well,
it's not really for, you

220
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.140
know, the, the, the note
is this more like, I,

221
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.870
like, I like to design
that layer where they're directly

222
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.380
interacts with users. I like
to hear user's feedback, you

223
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.040
know, whereas, you know, the
users can't relate to O'Shea

224
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.970
the backend code, unless, you
know, the is really slow

225
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.910
or something. One of the
things that I want to

226
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:12.030
understand is the difference between
the designer mind and the

227
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.310
developer mind. And this is
kind of why I wanted

228
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.230
to have you on, because
I think you understand both,

229
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.270
right. I mean, it's just,
it's, it's like, there's different

230
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.660
kinds. I mean, I'm trying
to say there's, it's so

231
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.860
fundamental. Like you're either a
designer or you're not, there's

232
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.990
not like you're kind of
half a designer or you're

233
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.440
okay with design. You know
what I mean? Everyone knows

234
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.070
what's pretty and everyone has
a sense of aesthetic, but

235
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.930
I mean, ultimately it seems
to me like the difference

236
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.540
between a designer and a
developer is a developer starts

237
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.440
with like going and searching
the web for free CSS

238
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.550
templates. And a designer starts
in Photoshop. That's like how

239
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.020
I describe it, but I
want to understand from you,

240
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.410
like what the difference between
the processes between the two

241
00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:00.120
kinds of people. I think
what you've described as pretty

242
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.270
typical. Cause I remember last
year I was reading John

243
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.960
Galloway's laws where he, I
think the title was that

244
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.800
designer developer workflow crisis actually
asked this side up here.

245
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.960
So he had this flow
chart on this blog. And

246
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.070
I think this is really
typical flow of typical corporate

247
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.180
or government environment, which I
think is really flawed. And

248
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.250
just like what you described,
you said it starts with

249
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.610
designer, creates a page mock
up in Photoshop or illustrator

250
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.700
and the designs, that's the
sign, our hands, you know,

251
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.240
the programmer, this PSD file.
And they go back and

252
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.790
forth. They don't agree on
design. And then they just

253
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.880
the waste of time. I
think, I think it's very

254
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:48.120
important that the team has
to I'll start at the

255
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.790
same point. I think it's
typical over a flow would

256
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.090
be, you know, when you
have an app web app

257
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.030
or a website to deal
an app, user requirements and

258
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.340
developers would just come up
with what functions we should

259
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.010
have on there. And once
they make, give the designer

260
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.860
a wireframe and say, Hey,
go, here's all this stuff.

261
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.510
You need to knock it
out just to make it

262
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.630
pretty. And I think that
you really need to get

263
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.340
the designer involved first because
it's more than just visual.

264
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.990
Otherwise you're just hiring a
pixel pusher. Are you saying

265
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.900
that the designer is also
the UX designer or in

266
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.330
big organizations? It seems like
the one who makes it

267
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.480
pretty as different from the
one who organizes the experience

268
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.060
is different from the one
who designs the information architecture

269
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.380
or is that just enterprise
BS language? I think that

270
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.020
just, it's a little bit
of that because to me

271
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.330
it good web designer, although
the term, I think it's

272
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.660
really convoluted, as you say,
there's so many specializations it

273
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.100
good. What these on are,
should be able to do

274
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.770
all that. There's just absolutely
no reason not to, because

275
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.790
it is what designer is.
Not just somebody who makes

276
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.480
your graphics pretty, right. Otherwise
they're just really hiring this

277
00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.520
graphic monkey. It it's because
sweat design is really a

278
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.510
visual solution and interactions solution.
So if you have a

279
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.830
designer, you know, first meeting,
you know, work alongside with

280
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.440
the programmers, you know, the
are kind of having input.

281
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.130
What's the best way to
design, for example, a which

282
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.070
is where does the page
flow? And then the designer

283
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.160
can lock up these wire
frames. And that's why wireframes

284
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.800
is important because this is
their bone and it has

285
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.020
no visual. So nobody kind
of has a preference that

286
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.480
I wouldn't like this color.
I don't like this around

287
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.480
the corner. So, you know,
I think that typically incorporation

288
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:39.280
is always like a form
follows function. Right. As long

289
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.380
as it works first, and
then we'll worry about making

290
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.520
it pretty or a flow.
Yeah. That's exactly right, exactly.

291
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.520
Right. I design it in
black and white and then

292
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.620
I'll let somebody else like
put a code on it

293
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.400
later and make it pretty
Right. See the OSI has

294
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.090
always, you know, author of,
and it really should get

295
00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.800
at these honoree and bluff
in front of the beginning

296
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.200
because their product, isn't just
how it works. It's how

297
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.950
it looks, how it feels.
Right. Because you can have

298
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.460
this awesome web app. Yeah.
It's so talented programmers. But

299
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.090
if you're in a result,
it's not polished that really

300
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:17.020
damages your branding, right? Because
when a user comes to

301
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.340
your site, before he even
starts using the site, if

302
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.280
he sees this is not
polished, this is so amateurish,

303
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:31.660
it really affects your, your,
your size reputation. How do

304
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.040
I know if a designer
is good, other than fat,

305
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.190
I look at their stuff
and say, that's pretty to

306
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.820
me because I can only
look at the end result,

307
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.310
right? Like with a coder,
I can review their code.

308
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.280
I can potentially, I could
find statistics and analysis and

309
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.580
do static analysis on their
code. I could, you know,

310
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.950
speak to people about how
they, how they worked on

311
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.670
a team and how productive
they were with various measures.

312
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.310
How do I look at
a designer and find out

313
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.600
whether or not they have
a wrongheaded design process, right.

314
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.550
Considering that I'm hiring someone
to do something that I

315
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.800
don't know anything about. Right.
That's a question I actually

316
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.500
interview a lot of designers
in the past. You know,

317
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.770
the first question I always
ask, even on the, during

318
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:23.240
the phone spraining was what
is your blog URL? And

319
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.920
if they just say, I
don't have a blog and

320
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.140
then I would ask, so
what design blogs do you

321
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.220
read? And if they say
I don't read anything, I

322
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.950
pretty much just end the
call right there. Because I,

323
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.600
I strongly believe in, you
know, on our shoot blog

324
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.330
where it would be actively
reading design blogs out there

325
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.140
because this really shows attitude.
You know, they want to

326
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.010
further, better themselves. And it
is a pleasure to have

327
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.160
a blog because a lot
of times that designers can

328
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.800
put these, you know, work
they've done and they may

329
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.630
be good, but you don't
know what part of that

330
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.000
project they worked on. You
know? And you don't know

331
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.560
if they really did it,
but you have to have

332
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.820
a blog where they can
actually write their thoughts. So

333
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.610
you get to know the
person a lot better, just

334
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.160
looking at some pretty pictures.
I think it would be

335
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.920
the same way you interview
a programmer to write. Cause

336
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.890
I would, you know, you
don't just say, show me

337
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.210
what you did. In fact,
I think it would be

338
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.180
harder for programmers to show
their portfolio and because the

339
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.300
code is out behind on
a web server. So I

340
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.900
will go from there. Of
course, as far as looking

341
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.790
at their work, I think
that just really a matter

342
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.260
of taste. And it's normally,
it's not that hard to

343
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:40.700
tell if it's design is
good, were bad. This is

344
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.010
the part of the show
where I mock you while

345
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.690
actually Tellerik mock says your
applications, that you're testing dependent

346
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.870
on external systems over which
you have no control. Maybe

347
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.780
you're being slowed down by
those systems, their lack of

348
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.380
availability, responsiveness. You want to
do TDD, right? Our friends

349
00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.690
at Tellerik help you solve
some of those problems with

350
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.320
their newest mocking tool. Just
Mark. It'll let you do

351
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.250
fast, simple controlled unit tests,
independent of external resources like

352
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:12.320
databases, web services, proprietary code,
unlike some marketing tools, just

353
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.360
mock works with non-virtual methods,
seal classes, static methods, giving

354
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.060
you complete control of your
code. You can get more

355
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:25.460
details. You can download just
mock at telerik.com/just mock. And

356
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.770
don't forget to thank Tellerik
for supporting Hanselman it's on

357
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:34.610
their Facebook fan page, facebook.com/tellerik.
Thanks a lot. One of

358
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.830
the, this is, well, this
is why I have people

359
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.920
on the show so I
can ask inappropriate questions. But

360
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.200
sometimes when I have a
designer working with me at

361
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.560
a company full time, I
think to myself, what is

362
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.650
this person going to be
doing for 40 hours a

363
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.960
week? And I think that
the higher up in the

364
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.510
company, you go, depending on
whether or not they appreciate

365
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:57.160
design that question of, we
don't need a designer full

366
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.250
time because he's, they're just
going to do a comp

367
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.570
and they're going to write
something in Photoshop, and then

368
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.930
they're going to hang out
for like six months. So,

369
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.790
I mean, you know, I'm
being honest with you, right?

370
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.820
I can remember I would
program it. Right. So I

371
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.070
know I can keep a
program or busy 40 hours

372
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.150
a week 50. Yeah. Well,
let me ask you where

373
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.540
you work at Microsoft. Do
you, I mean, what does

374
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.170
your designer actually do? Are
you saying this? I mean,

375
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.240
we have, we have a
couple of designers. Like they

376
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.240
have actually several designers on
MSDN that do stuff and

377
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.270
they do lots of different
websites, but I mean, there's

378
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.610
like when we're in the
middle of the design process,

379
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.990
there's like a flurry of
inf of comps and new

380
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.150
new stuff going on. And
then there's kind of quiet

381
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.070
for a little while and
then there's a flurry again.

382
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.130
And that's just, again, I'm
not involved in the design

383
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:49.350
process as much for the
way that the, you know,

384
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.130
I don't chop up the
graphics. I'm farther downstream. So

385
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.100
I'm just speaking more generically.
I'm not speaking about Microsoft

386
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.880
in general, but Well, I
think what you described is

387
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.940
fairly typical. I see, I
already see a problem there.

388
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.500
You shouldn't be the one
that's chunking that does not

389
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.210
have to HTML. I think
that's designer stuff. What, why

390
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.430
designers shop? That's why they
call it web designers, not

391
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.760
just a graphic designer right
there. The reason I say

392
00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.170
that is I'm. I think
I am you a blog

393
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.890
post? I wrote about my
family web designer shoot code,

394
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.050
and I have a strong
opinion on this. And I

395
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.650
think any web designer who's
worth their checks should be

396
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:33.150
able to write HTML, not
just good HTML, proper semantic,

397
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.780
HTML, and CSS, Almost like,
like final. Would you go

398
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.850
to so far as to
say that they're creating HTML

399
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.150
that is shipping? Yes. That's
what I do. Of course,

400
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.620
with stack overflow, some of
the projects I've worked on,

401
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.840
they already had the HTML
maze. So I just put

402
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.840
the CSS scan over that.
But typically what I do,

403
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.190
I'll explain the design process.
You find when it was

404
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.070
first game I project, the
first thing I need to

405
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.200
do is I had to
identify who I'm making a

406
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.580
website for. Of course, you
know, this, this is not

407
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.860
for the person who pays
me a check where my

408
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.470
boss even it's really for
the people who will be

409
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.900
using the website, right? Cause
that's ultimately your user. And

410
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.230
then, you know, of course
we, I learned a design

411
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.910
go, what is this website
trying to do as a

412
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.540
Sally product? Whereas it just
promoting somebody, you know, or

413
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.480
it's a web app, then,
you know, I would choose

414
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:32.130
my design styles differently. For
example, web apps repetitive use,

415
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.300
I do not make a
graphic intensive because it's for

416
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.720
web apps, the visuals have
really high emissions diminishing return.

417
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.900
You want to keep it
really simple. So user can

418
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.030
focus on what they're doing
and, and ultimately, you know,

419
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.270
and dad is come up
with what kind of mood

420
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.000
we want set up with
this design because ultimately it's

421
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.270
all about setting up that
mood. That's what I think

422
00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.590
that's what separates good designs
to excellent designs. You know,

423
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.270
that's always the secret designs
is to simply trick invoking

424
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:12.650
that emotional response. That's all
there is to it. Everything

425
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:17.370
in between just a means
to an end. That's really,

426
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.970
that's cool though. I like
that. I mean that, like

427
00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.730
it breaks it down, you
know? I mean the Dakota's

428
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.460
job is to get it
done, right? I mean, I

429
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.610
can design, evokes and move.
Right. I can talk about

430
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.880
typography and layout, you know,
the white space, all of

431
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.970
that. But ultimately your goal
is simply trick aren't mood.

432
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.850
I mean, I think that's
true with all designs or

433
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.150
even industrial designs, right? You
want something that just feels

434
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.700
good. I mean, maybe that's
not always the mood that

435
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.290
you want to set it
may, or you find sometimes

436
00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.230
you want to make a
website and make people feel

437
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.840
sad so that they can
donate money, you know, but

438
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.400
that's still, that's all you're
aiming for. So it took

439
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.450
me a lot to realize
that and because why, if

440
00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.850
I can deny these, I,
I think I was more

441
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.220
of a decorator because there
were all these cool trends,

442
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.760
you know, the nineties IDC
night, the 40, 45 degree

443
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.610
lines, tiny little font, you
know, that was a trend

444
00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.860
back then. So I, I
did a lot of crappy

445
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.220
websites, but that style, because
it took me a while.

446
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.340
What is, what does w
what makes a good design,

447
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.040
you know, is it's all
there is to it. You

448
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.960
know, it really triggers this
emotional response. If it's on

449
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.980
a web app, you want
maybe something really clean really

450
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:32.110
fast, and because you don't
want something slow or first,

451
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:35.260
then we'll take a product
Obama's website. I thought it

452
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.620
was really well done regardless
of your political affiliation. I

453
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.710
think, because back then I
was working for the government.

454
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.580
I worked at FCC and
I was familiar with how

455
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.250
the government websites look and
that side just blew me

456
00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.730
away. I thought it was
really well done. And of

457
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.470
course, on top of all
this social media stuff, he

458
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.190
did too. So how many
government websites did you do?

459
00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.520
Because that, that seems like
death to a designer like,

460
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.040
wow, I'm a designer, I'm
creative. I'm awesome. And I'm

461
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.160
going to go work for
the government. There's a funny

462
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.100
story. I first did a
garment. I did some consulting

463
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.640
for the North Carolina state government.
I can late nineties. And

464
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.310
then I went back in
2004, I believe just because

465
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.940
I'm a really cool people
there. The reason I wanted

466
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.910
to work in the garment
is because first of all,

467
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.670
I feel a garment is
like underdog. Len comes through

468
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.360
web standards, you know, how
they lag years behind industries.

469
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.930
So all my friends kind
of made fun of me

470
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.450
cause they were working on
these clammers, you know, clients,

471
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.280
freelance projects here was, you
know, government building cube and

472
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.290
how their website. So maybe
it was surprising. I just

473
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.800
believe I couldn't make it
better. And I did a

474
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.330
lot of them. So I
was kind of proud of

475
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:56.220
it. So the reason the
last one I did was

476
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.370
if you go to the
fcc.gov, of course that's still,

477
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.800
the old site is not
up yet. I think that's

478
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.710
how it was done in
2001. It has not been

479
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.740
changed yet, of course, that
I was not responsible for

480
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.560
that. But if you look
at their new site, it's

481
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:16.110
called reboot that fcc.gov, you
know, that's a long, the

482
00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:20.100
size I work on for
FCC and with the new

483
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.260
administration. And they pull out
the focus on the web

484
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.410
too. And there's the new
media teams for web savvy.

485
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.900
They know how they, you
know, get on Twitter to

486
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.400
gain followers and Facebook now.
Yeah, I'm looking at, I

487
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.630
went to, it's a it's
fcc.gov and this is a

488
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:44.360
very dry, boring kind of
late nineties style, very typical

489
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.960
looking government website. And then
on the upper corner, there

490
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.190
is a page curl with
a, it says a big

491
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.200
thing that says reboot.fcc.gov. And
then it's just very kind

492
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.170
of light fresh while still
being government in the sense

493
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.170
of it looks official, but
it's just not boring, kind

494
00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:10.280
of big navigation thing. And
it's a much, it looks

495
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.380
like a, it looks like
a totally reasonable website that

496
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.370
could exist in 2010. Right?
And that's still not the

497
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.950
final ftc.gov and know that
they are in the process

498
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:23.840
of revamping the FCC, but
it's a huge passcode, hundreds,

499
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.710
thousands of static, HTML documents
and word documents. So it

500
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.870
may take a while to
convert all of them. So

501
00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.430
I believe the new site
will be very good to

502
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.210
you. Well, it's interesting because
I'm looking at this website

503
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.970
and they've got like, it's
like, I see like FCC

504
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.000
connect and they've got like
Twitter and MySpace and I'm

505
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.530
like, really, the FCC is
on Twitter. They're why do

506
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.270
I care? And I click
on it and they've got

507
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:48.290
350,000 followers. Yes, exactly. I
think we were competing with

508
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:52.250
the justice department and they
had, That's insane. That's insane.

509
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.150
Yes. It tells me there's
some really good people working

510
00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.040
at the SPC right now.
There will be huge fans.

511
00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.690
Yeah. Well, none of, they've
got a, they've got a,

512
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.900
a discussion area here where
like a question and they

513
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.690
have a little little poll
and it says, how can

514
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.110
the FCC improve use of
online tutorials? So I clicked

515
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.930
on that, thinking that it's
going to be some lame,

516
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:17.420
you know, radio button poll,
they're using user voice. And

517
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.510
they actually did the CRA
the graphics on user voice

518
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.720
and updated the site. So
it doesn't look like a

519
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.690
voice, Right. Alyssa total branding
package. If you go to

520
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.470
the, our YouTube page or
Facebook is all, you know,

521
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.580
as all look consistent. Oh,
wow. Yeah. So I just

522
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.040
clicked on YouTube and they've
got the, the colors and

523
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.850
everything. All right. Yeah. So
did you work on, so

524
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.410
you on the whole visual
style for, for all of

525
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:49.260
this stuff, I worked with
other designer who worked on

526
00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.020
the Obama campaign, whether she
was really good, we collaborated

527
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.730
a lot on these, of
course, you know, there are,

528
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.750
there's a big team of
developers as well. It was

529
00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:02.760
definitely a team effort. Wow.
That's cool. I wonder, I

530
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.990
wonder if there were any
web designers before on in

531
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.710
the government, Typically the garment
is, you know, most of

532
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.070
their IP work are done
by contractors. So it really,

533
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.290
it depends on if the
contractors are good or not.

534
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.170
And that also has a
lot to do with the

535
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.980
focus, whether it's the management
on top, want to do

536
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:27.300
anything about a website? Yeah,
I am. I did this

537
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.910
video that I put up.
I've, I've actually, I've done

538
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.310
this talk a couple of
times where I talk about

539
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.370
social networking for developers and
it's an hour long talk

540
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.620
and I, I put it
up on channel nine yesterday,

541
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.280
but the general postulate, the
general theory, like, you know,

542
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.430
welcome to my talk. Every
developer needs to be blogging.

543
00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:49.440
And Yeah. See, I think,
you know, as I said,

544
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.080
I feel the same way
about these NRS as well,

545
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.740
but I think the biggest
excuse I've heard when they

546
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.380
post an Allen flog is
I don't have time. Right.

547
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.480
I don't know if you've
heard of that. Oh yeah.

548
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.880
That's the number one, excuse
is I'm doing real work.

549
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.320
I'm not going to pull
up. I always tell people,

550
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.600
if you just say you,
you blog, you spend two

551
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.720
hours on blogging a week.
I think that's reasonable. Right.

552
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.070
And that, that would be,
you know, that adds up

553
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.010
to eight day. You no
time, just, you know, Mazda,

554
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.910
it's like you spend one
day, that's still better than

555
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.700
nothing. And it's not like
you have to blog every

556
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:28.380
single day. You know, you
can just, because I remember

557
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.130
when I first started blogging,
I asked Jeff Atwood, as

558
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.320
it applies, can you get
me? And all he said

559
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.190
was a blog at a
pace you kind of, you

560
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.360
can live with, right. It
can be once a week

561
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.850
or once a month. It
doesn't even matter. As long

562
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.490
as you keep that pace
and it will become easier

563
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.370
and easier to, and eventually
it just feels natural to

564
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.460
arise yourself. So it's not
really that much of an

565
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.730
effort. And I think the
second excuse is like, nobody

566
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.310
will read my blog. You
know, I'm not, I'm not

567
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.100
internet famous, nobody will read
it. So I just think

568
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.230
that's a wrong mentality to
have, you should write for

569
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.590
yourself, you know, to become
a better writer over time.

570
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.660
Right. Is it about bad
communication or is it about

571
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.970
having an online portfolio? Both.
I believe. I mean, your

572
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.250
portfolio, you can, if you
did it project that you

573
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.860
can blog about it, you
can say what, what my

574
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.370
design process was. A lot
of times you can, I

575
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.650
guess, do a matte of
blogging as much as cost

576
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.100
that you blog about different
aspects of the design. And

577
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.930
then you can, you'll get
comments from other designers, you

578
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.280
know, you would, you know,
exchange thoughts or debates, whatever.

579
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.430
And there's the learning process
too. I've learned a lot

580
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:41.860
from the comments on my
blog. I've been visiting your

581
00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.370
blog and poking around. And
there's a couple of things

582
00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:46.960
that I've noticed remembering that
I'm coming at this from

583
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.960
a developer perspective. And, and
it's funny because it's, it's,

584
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.660
it's a nice blog and
you're a good writer and

585
00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.940
it's very pretty, but like,
I think I was bugging

586
00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.620
you about this earlier. It's
like the first thing I

587
00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.300
see when I show up
at your blog is a

588
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.810
giant photograph at the top.
Right. And you're telling me

589
00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.930
that was great. It's huge
because it's like, and I'm

590
00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.340
looking at this and I'm
like, you know, where's the

591
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.130
words, man. I gotta scroll
down to see the words.

592
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.330
And, and then I, I
was looking at your announcement

593
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.890
on the blog where you
say, I'm going to go

594
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:18.970
work for stack overflow and
you have this picture at

595
00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.730
the top. And it's this
picture of like some fruit

596
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.780
and it's overlooking a, in
New York Harbor. And I'm like,

597
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.670
Oh, this is lovely. I
wonder, I wonder where he

598
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.740
got this stock photography. And
then I'm looking in the

599
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.500
comments here. And not only
did you take that picture

600
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.370
at Joel Spolsky's office, but
this is the part that

601
00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:38.080
blows me away. And this
is the real difference between

602
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.540
a developer, a developer and
a designer, because someone's like,

603
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.780
yeah. Okay, great picture. What
kind of post-processing did you

604
00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.930
do? I'm like post post-processing
and like, this is a

605
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.230
discussion between two designers and
he's like, Oh yeah, you

606
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.420
know, I just, this is
you talking, Oh, I just

607
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.300
overlaid some few colored layers
over the original little tan,

608
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.790
little blue, but the blending
mode overlaid you. And I

609
00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:00.310
did some curve adjustment on
different channels and I'm like,

610
00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:03.670
wow, that's like an afternoon
for me. And you probably

611
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.680
bang that out in like
two minutes. Yeah. Well, I

612
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.530
can, I can see why
you think the photos too

613
00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.050
big. But as I said,
well, first of all, know

614
00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.920
the business mail homepage really
most, according to my Google

615
00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.460
analytics, most people actually do
go to individual articles. So

616
00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:26.650
homepage isn't that visited much,
but the point is that

617
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.440
big photos to set a
mood, right? Because actually it

618
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.600
took me awhile to what
to put on my homepage.

619
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.660
A lot of designers put
on their big, close up

620
00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.990
of their face or whatever,
and I'm not very photogenic.

621
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.580
And the, and the, at
that point did not want

622
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.770
to use my photo there.
And I just felt it

623
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.960
would be a little bit
tacky. So I just want

624
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.020
it photo there and make
people look at it for

625
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.260
10 seconds and say, what
the hell is this? You

626
00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.570
know, it's creating that mood.
That kind of like mysterious.

627
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.390
That's why, if you go
to my blog, <inaudible> dot

628
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.050
org, you will just see
this giant robot. I fold

629
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.120
the shopping and not just
parents based museum looks like

630
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.870
a real one. That's all
the point of it. It

631
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.210
just, you know, treat people
a little bit, as far

632
00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.490
as the fall Creek one,
I could just use the

633
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:11.590
standard full time I took,
but I really wanted to

634
00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.440
keep that soft and it
should look, you know, it's

635
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.670
so it's not really so
out there. And that's part

636
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.280
of the set Hampton mood.
And that's what I was

637
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.840
talking about. The part that's
amazing is that you knew

638
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.630
you knew what the motions
were that you had to

639
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.480
do in the tool in
order to evoke that mood.

640
00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.480
And that's the part that
I would just I'd love

641
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.340
to learn, but I realized
that I don't know if

642
00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.550
it can be, I mean,
you can, I can learn

643
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:43.610
to be a fake designer.
I listened to that gave

644
00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.730
like a sense, most of
your listeners are programmers and

645
00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.840
I have a list of
suggestions, I think. Yeah, that

646
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.460
would be great. I mean,
you don't have to try

647
00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.950
to be like a designer.
I think what's more important

648
00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.490
is I think you should
have a good taste. I

649
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:04.370
mean, I think that party
can develop over time. I

650
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:08.000
mean, I already, you know,
the stereotype is whole farmers

651
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.980
have no taste and then
they make these ugly websites.

652
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.050
And I think some of
them are like that, but

653
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:15.410
most programmers have Delta are
not like that. For example,

654
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:22.190
the farmers I'm working with
stack overflow. Yeah. You know,

655
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.260
there are maybe two or
three men groups, you know,

656
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.450
they work on different projects.
So I've been involved in

657
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.100
all of these and they
really surprised me to have

658
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.130
really good taste. You know,
they may not be able

659
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:35.120
to create these graphics, but,
but they have good tastes

660
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.370
that they can offer me
really good suggestions. And, and

661
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.350
I, I will give you
a list of blogs and

662
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:48.040
maybe you can put in
the podcast websites you should

663
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.260
visit. And I think it's
really well, first of all,

664
00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.370
the easiest thing is just
go to Wikipedia, PDA, lookout,

665
00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.420
typography. I think that's a
big thing. And that had

666
00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:00.290
a lot of programmers France.
They w why, why is

667
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.960
it what's the difference between
Helvetica and area? Why does

668
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.730
it even matter? It's just,
these are just texts, you

669
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.030
know, it's not like I
can't even tell they ended

670
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.790
up cause typography. It doesn't
matter in that there's kerning

671
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.760
the spacing and some fonts
are just better than others,

672
00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.400
you know, and see if
this is a type of

673
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.670
thing. I don't think you
have to consciously notice because

674
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:24.230
honestly, sometimes depending on the
capital letters, I can't tell

675
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:28.160
if they're Helvetica or areas,
especially capital E you know,

676
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.450
but I think, you know,
just read the Wiki or

677
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.360
the Wikipedia look up topography,
and you will see Townsel

678
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.730
links and you will know
why it's actually, it doesn't

679
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.290
matter. And the more you
read about it, the more

680
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:43.520
you kind of appreciate what
designers do, Would you recommend

681
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.550
to the listeners that they
should have several design blogs

682
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:52.400
in their, in their reader
list? I think so ecology,

683
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:56.900
because it lists apart accom,
which is Londa, better design

684
00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.410
blogs. It's published, like I
believe two articles per month

685
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.630
or two weeks. Every two
weeks. Yeah. And there are

686
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.370
other ones I'll send you
a list so you can

687
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:13.340
log and, and, and definitely
do not think, you know,

688
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.000
form follows function where a
function follows form. And while

689
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.320
my favorite design closes by
Frank Lloyd Wright, he I'm just

690
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.680
paraphrasing here. He said form
for all the function that

691
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:29.330
is very misunderstood. Format function
should be one. Sean joined

692
00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.600
a spiritual union. You know,
it's really one thing, right.

693
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.910
For example, I hate to
sound a Apple fan polite,

694
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.620
but I think I talked
to you about Apple stuff

695
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.930
on Twitter before they, if
you look at their stuff,

696
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.920
it doesn't matter if you
like your stuff or not.

697
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.930
They really focused on everything.
It's not just how it

698
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.170
looks. And it's also how
it works, right. Everything. And

699
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:54.040
even the marketing, this is
one consistent package. That's why

700
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:58.300
they're able to, you know,
impress their gender politics. And

701
00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:02.340
I think that's pretty important.
Yeah. The fact that it's

702
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.590
a complete cohesive, thoughtful unit.
And even though, you know,

703
00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.810
that there's a marketing department
as a design department, as

704
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.930
a coding department, that doesn't
come out. I think at

705
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:18.080
Microsoft, we have, we definitely
see the, the, the, the

706
00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:22.950
distances, the white space between
our organizations. And The thing

707
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.710
that always surprised me is
I do believe there are

708
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.560
a lot of talented designers
working at Microsoft. And I

709
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.560
remember last year I watched
the Microsoft 2000, 2020 and

710
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.890
19 concept video, Alice, very,
very impressed. And that kind

711
00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:43.080
of thing I blocked about
it kind of just blew

712
00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.740
me away. No offense. I
did not expect that from

713
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.410
Microsoft. That was like, wow,
this is so awesome because

714
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.590
the UI is so unique.
It has this cell shaded

715
00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:57.840
translucent interface. It wasn't copying
Apple. It was not pretentious,

716
00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.900
you know, and I was
just surprised that the, why

717
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.510
is this for 10 years
from now? Why not just

718
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.690
use this UI today? You
know, they can definitely compete

719
00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:09.630
with Apple. So I, I
just thought, I feel like

720
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:12.330
Microsoft has lots of these
cool concepts, but that's all

721
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.820
they are. It's just concepts.
You know, you know, you

722
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.370
had the Microsoft surface. First
time I saw that demo

723
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.680
video, I thought, wow, that's
awesome. They just never came

724
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:24.840
out. You know, then, you
know, Apple touching her face,

725
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:30.420
iPhone iPad. That's, that's the
thing, right? It's the designing,

726
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.850
it is one thing and
shipping it and having it

727
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.490
still be true to the
design. Great. And that's why

728
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:39.360
Steve jobs says, you know,
our artists ship. So it's

729
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:43.410
kind of, yeah, I think
that's how I like what

730
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:51.060
Microsoft windows 3.5 IBM's was
that was really popular because

731
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:58.560
IBM was trying to Polish
our final product by the

732
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.450
time IBM was going to
ship. I like that. I

733
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.190
think that that might be
the title of the show

734
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.520
artists ship. I really appreciate
you taking the time to

735
00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:13.950
chat with me today. Danielle.
Thank you. This has been

736
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.460
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

737
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:17.700
week.
