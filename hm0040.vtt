10
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.080
Scott and Carl discuss software
architecture from tech ed in

11
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:10.080
Barcelona. Hi, this is Carl Franklin
and you're listening to Hansel

12
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.960
minutes from Hanselman it's dot
com. Scott and I are

13
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.840
here in Barcelona, Spain, Barcelona,
Barcelona, protect ed Europe, developer.

14
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.500
Yeah, it's good that you're
here. Otherwise we wouldn't have

15
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.780
a show this week. That
is pretty cool. You're absolutely

16
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.610
right. It would have been
a wake up at three

17
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.020
in the morning and call
you in the hotel kind

18
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.910
of thing. Where, where are
we now? We're sitting on

19
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.630
the bringing foods. He was
sort of out in the

20
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.570
conference where in the middle
of the action, trying to

21
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.690
get that live on the
scene sound and we definitely

22
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.580
got it. They're just, they
just pushed some food by

23
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.600
and we've got cookies and
coffee and bananas everywhere and

24
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.920
sitting outside the breakout sessions
right now. Yeah. So what

25
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.680
are you talking about here?
I'm actually giving a preconference

26
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.860
talk. I'm here with Ron
Jacobs and we're doing software

27
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.330
architecture, architecture. We're doing basically
a day of architecture. We

28
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.740
talking about essentials of architecture.
I'm doing the essential abilities

29
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.690
of the architect. What an
architect really kind of needs

30
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.510
to know to be an
effective architect. Ron's then going

31
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.050
to talk about architectural analysis
and then I'm actually architecture

32
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.780
podcast as he not, he
does it's called arc cast.

33
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.260
If you go up to
channel nine.msdn.com and on the

34
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.840
left side there, he's got
like 136 of them. Wow.

35
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.080
I was feeling really not
superior, but really positive about

36
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.730
how many, you know, we'd
done like 35 shows. And

37
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.270
I was thinking like, you
know, Bob Barker, the guy

38
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.290
from terrific. He just retired
last week after doing like

39
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.190
6,500 shows. Now I'm like,
well, I've reached 35 and

40
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.690
be able to get to
50 and that'll be cool.

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.390
And I go, and I
see it, Ron's guy 140

42
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.640
and I'm like, Oh, well,
but he's paid to do

43
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.200
that full time. And we
do this in our spare

44
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.750
time. So that's different thing.
So, you know, so what's

45
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.180
on the agenda. Well, on
the agenda for my stuff,

46
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.640
we're talking about essential abilities.
So we kind of talk

47
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.320
about security, performance and availability.
And we talk about how

48
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.130
architecture is often kind of
mistaken, I think, or given

49
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.760
a bad name as a
soft skill, right. Basically architecture,

50
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.480
right? A lot of word
documents and developers Ignore them.

51
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.390
Yeah. It's sort of seen
by developers is a job

52
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.550
that somebody could bully their
way into, right? Yeah. It

53
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.690
seems like it's kind of
a BS job that you

54
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.700
hang out, you live in
your ivory tower and then

55
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.370
dogma or word documents kind
of like in the form

56
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.600
of word documents. Hi, thou
shalt architect from somebody who

57
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.680
doesn't understand developers. Y I,
I think, and we, and

58
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.200
moron, and I kind of
propose in this, in this,

59
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.170
this day of preconference talks,
that architecture is a little

60
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.050
bit more than that. It's
more of a, a 20,000

61
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.420
foot view. And while there
are people who don't think

62
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.370
that architecture has a direct
correlation is between software and

63
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.720
actually architecting buildings. I think
it's actually a pretty decent

64
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.950
analogy. I think that if
you think about an architect

65
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.860
is building a building, he
may not be necessarily the

66
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.290
kind of guy who knows
how to do his own

67
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.690
plumbing and do his own
wiring, but he needs to

68
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.390
know what the building codes
are for. Correct wiring, how

69
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.270
to design a building such
that appropriate pipes and wires

70
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.210
can be put down. So
while you would hope that

71
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.400
an architect would be able
to do some amount of

72
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.700
configuring his own TCP IP
stack, certainly he would need

73
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.840
to understand how firewalls interact
with software, how network cards

74
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.830
work, if not at the
lowest level, there is a,

75
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.590
there's a high level understanding
just like a pilot of

76
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.660
a plane, right? It needs
to understand the fundamentals of

77
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.490
flying if they may not
understand the fundamentals of how

78
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.860
to jet. So do you
think developers make the best

79
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.400
art? Well, that's a real
tough one. I do personally

80
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.220
think that, you know, it,
it would be nice if

81
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.140
you were a pilot of
an airplane who started out

82
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.290
as a mechanic. Right. I
don't think it's required, but

83
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.740
yeah, because I've seen a
lot of MBAs turn into

84
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.170
architects. Yeah. I do think
that there is going to

85
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.060
be a fundamental missing piece
that will nail you at

86
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.640
some point, you really come
at it from two different

87
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.340
angles. Right. You know, I'm
always a fan of the

88
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.370
little guy who comes up
sure. As opposed to from

89
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.560
the top down, If you're,
you know, if you're a

90
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.320
developer, who's got a big
picture mentality, you know, you're,

91
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.240
you're not, you're, you're not
just doing your little piece

92
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.320
of coding, you're designing and
doing your own architecture on

93
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.900
the fly. One thing I
do think is as a

94
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.550
rough thing that one of
the guys mentioned at the

95
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.100
talk is that he said,
well, I'm allowed to do

96
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.460
architecture 40% of the time.
And my boss expects me

97
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.710
to code 60% of the
time. So that makes me

98
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.630
think that his boss doesn't
really understand the fundamentals of

99
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.230
architecture and how much stuff
needs to be involved. You

100
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.540
have to be thinking about
every, at every level. So

101
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.980
that's one of the things
that we've been talking about

102
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.250
is like security. Like how
do I systematically manage security

103
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.280
into my system at every
level architects? I think if

104
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.670
they are explicitly called out
as architects and the project

105
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.850
understands that so-and-so is the
project architect, this is an

106
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.340
individual who can explain, not
just to the developers, but

107
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.750
also to the why we
need to think about security

108
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.700
ahead of time. We need
to think about performance ahead

109
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.940
of time. So we're talking
about that. We've talking about

110
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.080
things like threat modeling, threat
modeling is an important step

111
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.140
that I'm seeing more and
more, but there's just not

112
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.290
enough, right? Not enough. People
are doing threat modeling, sitting

113
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.480
down and actually saying All
the surfaces are exactly it's

114
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.080
what happened. Yeah. For example,
things like reducing attack, surface

115
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.180
doing defense in depth, really
thinking about what we're actually,

116
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.830
I'm gonna take a pause
here because we're here at

117
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.610
tech ed and his eight,
some of these random tech

118
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.220
ed guys taking a picture
of us. Cause he saw

119
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.300
two nerds with microphones. So
must have pictures. Yeah. Nerds.

120
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.650
They must be doing something
interesting. So we're talking about

121
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.310
things about reducing the attack
surface, right. And we have

122
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.740
some pretty good examples. Actually.
There was a, an interesting

123
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.000
web dev security exploit about
four years ago, Web dev

124
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.380
being the exchange. Exactly. And
also what SharePoint uses to

125
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.800
talk to the backend. And
we talk about how this

126
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.240
particular exploit was not, did
not exist it, but did

127
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.840
not necessarily affect windows 2003.
They had to patch NT

128
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.200
for it, a patch 2000
new patch XP. And the

129
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.320
reason was many fold because
they had put in a

130
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.920
layered architecture inside of windows
two or 2003. So for

131
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.310
example, there was that big
security push. Remember when Microsoft

132
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.940
stopped everything and started doing
security stuff, they patched a

133
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.820
number of things in the
underlying DLLs, but let's assume

134
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.300
that they didn't, <inaudible>, isn't
even running by default on

135
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.380
2003. So if you ordinarily
to turn that off, you

136
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.360
have to harden the server
yourself who locked it all

137
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.010
down, it locked it down,
but a fault. So let's

138
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.110
just say that they didn't,
well, even if it was

139
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.710
running web dev, isn't enabled,
that's one of the things

140
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.830
about <inaudible>, you know, you
have to, I've deployed a

141
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.330
number. I a six rather
I have to put a

142
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.220
number of things and said,
why isn't this working? Oh,

143
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.130
I got to turn on
asp.net off by default off

144
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.800
by default. So even if
it was on by default,

145
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.400
the maximum length of an
Earl is 16 K, which

146
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.280
I think is still too
long, you needed 64 plus

147
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.940
K two to get this
particular exploit. And even if

148
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.780
that was long enough, they
had the special buffer overflow

149
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.570
code switch when they compiled
the C plus plus. So

150
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.720
the system would have halted
that process if it detected

151
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.570
an overflow. And even if
it didn't and if they

152
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.260
did succeed to execute malicious
code, it would have occurred

153
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.930
under a least privileged account.
So there's an example of

154
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.310
six different layers where security
is preventing that exploit from

155
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.350
Happening. Yeah. That was it
getting in the way of,

156
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.830
of real progress of real
code. What's the most, what's

157
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.900
the most secure system, right?
It's when it's unplugged or

158
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.570
shut off that's right. And
that's really kind of the

159
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.290
thing. It is very difficult
to design and architect a

160
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.100
system that is both very,
very usable. Very, very secure.

161
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.260
Yes. But it really, it
comes down to understanding the

162
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.060
requirements. What is the system
to do and make it

163
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.360
as secure as it possibly
can while still allowing people

164
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.550
to do their jobs. Right.
One of the things we

165
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.650
have to do at Kilian
is designed systems that can't

166
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.930
be hacked by people who
work for the bank that

167
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.370
we're designing for. That's a
pretty good criteria. Yeah. So

168
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.040
let's imagine a guy has
the essay password, right? How

169
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.130
do you prevent things against
that guy? Wow. Right. So,

170
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.250
you know, doing things like
encrypting users' passwords, different for

171
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.860
every user, as opposed to
using master keys for everything.

172
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.280
Just so worst he could
do is cause himself pain.

173
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.300
But no one else, stuff
like that, keeping systems really,

174
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.700
really locked down. We're working
on some stuff at Kirlian

175
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.370
now where people will not
have remote desktop access to

176
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.400
boxes. Like they'll only be
administrative over a single port,

177
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.000
stuff like that. Reducing the
attack surface of the overall

178
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.680
Typically react in a negative
way when you take away

179
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.470
their freedoms, don't they? So,
I mean, this is a

180
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.130
being an architect and communicating
with developers and having those

181
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.460
meetings to say, yeah, I'm
going to have to deescalate

182
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.010
your privileges. Yeah. That'd be
good. Yeah. Right. I think

183
00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.870
that Vista will make that
easier because you can always

184
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.330
become admin. You can blame
the Z issue with, with

185
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.450
not running as admin on
an XP is that often

186
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.510
you're a, they don't give
you the admin password. That's

187
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.610
different than I think what,
what Vista has done, which

188
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.210
is the just-in-time admin, right.
Use your access control, be

189
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.100
admin. When I need to.
I think that makes a

190
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.500
difference. I think that's much
better. One of the other

191
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.690
things that we talk about
in this particular session is

192
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:25.580
availability and the concept of
sequential dependencies, that the idea

193
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.620
is that you've got all
these different layers in your

194
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.070
system and your system is
only as available as the

195
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.330
least available piece. Right? So
if you've got a database

196
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.820
server, a network web server
or a desktop, and they're

197
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.410
all say 95, 96, 98%
available, you have to do

198
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.960
the math. You have to
actually multiply those availability numbers

199
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.300
by each other. And you
end up saying, well, I've

200
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.720
got a database server that's
98% available and a network

201
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.900
and a web server. In
this example here using four

202
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.120
different layers. I came up
with an availability number of

203
00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.770
around 90%. So even though
each item had saleability numbers

204
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.090
in excess of 96%, the,
the net availability was less

205
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.370
than 90. But then if
you take some of the

206
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.670
fundamentals of availability and you
add like a redundant server

207
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.090
in this instance, I'll say,
I'll, I'll add another database

208
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.980
server with Andy 8% uptime.
I can raise the availability

209
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.890
of the entire system by
in this case, 2% by

210
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.740
just adding another box, seems
like it's kind of dry,

211
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.870
but it would actually allow
dry topic, but it would

212
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.480
allow you to go to
a boss and say, I

213
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.760
can get your availability numbers
up 2%, and it's gonna

214
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.910
cost you five grand for
the server and this much,

215
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.360
that da, da, da. Right?
So the idea being that

216
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.640
an architect needs to be
able to go to the

217
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.680
business owner and putting numbers
on solutions and say, I

218
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.760
can't guarantee you three nines
of uptime without this much

219
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.610
money. And that really helps
the business owners make the

220
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.340
right of decisions. You know,
the, the architecture gig is

221
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.920
sort of been touted by,
you know, people in the

222
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.970
industry as a cure for,
you know, job security as

223
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.550
a developer. Cause you know,
a lot of development that

224
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.340
has been outsourced it's come
back and it goes, comes

225
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.160
and goes, but outsourcing is
always a threat to, you

226
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.870
know, the developer, but architecture
is something that we, we

227
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.890
tend to keep in house.
Would you agree? Yeah, I

228
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.950
think you're right. Not because
it's necessarily for job security,

229
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.930
but I think that the
architect really is that bridge

230
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.820
between the business owner or
the product owner and, and

231
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.950
the team, certainly one could,
could outsource an architect if

232
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.300
the architect oversees really where
we are overseas, if the

233
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.950
architect really had an understanding
of the business. Right. So

234
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.100
I don't think that it's
your, your, your job proofed

235
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.590
your, your, your, your, your
outside. Do you know of

236
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.610
any outsourced architecture gay? I
don't personally, but I'm sure

237
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.070
that there haven't heard of
any. I know that there's,

238
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.750
you know, this is a
thing there's a lot of

239
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.520
smart people in the world.
It'd be interesting to know

240
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.310
if they're a company other
than some of these global

241
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.790
things like IBM, certainly IBM
global consulting has architects everywhere

242
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.040
where they specialize in outsourcing
architectural level stuff. I don't

243
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.450
know. I bet you there
is. And we'll hear from

244
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.660
him, You know, if you
know of any, send them

245
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.990
to us, let us know
Places like ThoughtWorks will travel

246
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.950
all over the world and
work on thought. And IBM,

247
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.210
you know, but building an
entire practice of architects would

248
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.690
require deep understanding, not only
of just general.net stuff or

249
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.040
general Java stuff, but like
in my instance, banking, you

250
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.800
know, we, we met with
a number of large banks

251
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.470
this last week, my boss
and I, the CTO were

252
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.140
flying all over the place.
And we always talk to

253
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.650
them about engaging with us,
not just at my level

254
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.380
at the architect level, but
we call solutions architect level.

255
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.930
Sometimes the banks will say,
Oh, we want Scott. He's

256
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.030
the chief architect. He should
be able to talk about

257
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.570
this. Right. But I haven't
personally coded against a Hogan

258
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.210
mainframe, but I've got a
half a dozen guys at

259
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.180
Carilion that do that are
solutions, architects that know how

260
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.270
to make these things happen.
So within architecture itself, there

261
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.600
are, there are different specializations.
I'm certainly not the guy

262
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.390
to architect to design. Here's
where we get from architecture

263
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.430
into design. Right? Yeah. I'm
not going to design a

264
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.890
database, but I can architect
a system that includes a

265
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.940
database, which calls back to
the, the construction example. Right.

266
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.270
I really shouldn't be laying
the, laying the cords out

267
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.250
and putting the, putting the
pipe down. Right. But I

268
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.220
do have an understanding of
some of the regulatory and

269
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.140
compliance issues and the permits
that are going to be

270
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.090
required to do that kind
of work. And that's kind

271
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.280
of the essence of what
we're talking about. Are you

272
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.350
talking about in your, in
your talk here, which is

273
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.360
coming right up, Actually I
need to get going. It's

274
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.980
going to start pretty soon.
We're also going to talk

275
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.500
about kind of the essentials
that one requires for an

276
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.990
architecture review. You're doing things
like viability assessments and all

277
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.880
the different ilities that one
requires. So like functionalities and,

278
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.450
and reliability eligibility. There's an
ISO standard is ISO 91,

279
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:01.220
26 that talks about designing
an architecture and functionality, reliability,

280
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:09.590
usability efficiency, led <inaudible> maintainability
and portability, all different things

281
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.530
that a good architecture should
potentially meet. Did we talk

282
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.210
about all the different things
that want you to keep

283
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.030
track of? Sometimes it becomes
a little dry because it's

284
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.460
an ISO standard. It's really
just a glorified checklist with

285
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.550
a document behind it. Right.
But actually in the talk

286
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.280
that I'll be doing in
about 10 minutes here, we

287
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.350
talk about all these different
entities and then I apply

288
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.160
them to the iPod to
see is the iPod an

289
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.120
example of good architectural quality?
Is it functional? Is it

290
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.240
reliable? Is it mature? Is
it usable? Is it usable?

291
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.320
Is it maintainable? And what's
the verdict? Well, it's actually

292
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.830
pretty darn good. It's a
pretty awesome product. Certainly hits

293
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.860
on like what version five
now sort of certainly, if

294
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.200
any of the action, if
only I had a version

295
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.150
five iPod, maybe one of
the listeners would like to

296
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.860
take pity on me and
send me an iPod to

297
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.730
replace my, my sad, my
next generation iPod, or what

298
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.420
is it? Generation three. This
is the ancient iPod. From

299
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.360
two years ago, it died
on the plane. It started

300
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.690
screaming. I don't know what
happened. The little hard drive

301
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.350
inside just started screaming. And
now I have these sad

302
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.120
iMac as touched at iPod
face. Jeff <inaudible>, who is

303
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.730
the engineer for dotnet rocks.
And he's on Mondays too.

304
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.840
He told a story on
Mondays about his, I think

305
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.540
it was a creative Zen.
Yeah. You know, those things.

306
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.850
Yeah. That's the competitor wasn't
even a creative Zan. It

307
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.490
was before that it was
some, some of the things

308
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.850
that are Rio Rio. That
was it. The real carbon.

309
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.680
That was the thing. Yeah.
So he had a real

310
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.920
karma and it started doing
this click, click, click, click,

311
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.720
click, click, click, click, click,
click, click stuff. He goes

312
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.270
on the web and he
finds out that the solution

313
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.500
to this is to hold
it in your left hand

314
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.470
and slam it a certain
way into the Palm of

315
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.140
your right hand or vice
versa. If you're left handed

316
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.530
right handed and do this
and repeatedly, and then it

317
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.690
will boot up because the
head was sticking and he

318
00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.390
fixed it and he fixed
it. He like booted it

319
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.850
up and see. So he
followed the recommended procedures for

320
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.250
fixing this. Exactly. That would
be under the bullet re

321
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:16.880
reliability sub bullet recoverability, recoverability,
architected for recoverability smack it

322
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.310
hard enough. And it will
eventually come back. That's right.

323
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.910
All right, Scott. Good luck
with your talk and I

324
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.240
appreciate it. We'll see you
next week on Hanselman. Sorry.

325
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.060
Bye. Bye. Bye.
