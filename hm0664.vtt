00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.180
Hey folks. I hope you're
enjoying this podcast. You know,

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.110
I've done over 650 podcasts,
so I must enjoy doing

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.300
it. And I hope you
enjoy listening, but if you

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.510
enjoy stories about the people
behind the technology you use,

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.320
you should also check out
the greater than code podcast.

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.830
They focus on the human
side of software development. They've

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.380
got stories of inclusivity and
accessibility from the people you

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.710
don't normally hear from search
for greater than code in

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.270
your favorite podcast app, or

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.900
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.350
Hansel minutes. And today I'm
talking with Karen Catlin book

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.660
out called better allies. You
can check it out better.

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.200
allies.com. She most recently served
as a vice president in

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.510
the office of the CTO
at Adobe systems and has

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.350
been in tech for a
while. I am so well,

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.160
thank you for having me.
This is so exciting. Hi,

17
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.390
I'm happy to chat with
you. I've actually read one

18
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.080
of your other books was,
was called present techies guide

19
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.600
to public speaking, and I
had your coauthor pour NEMA

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.470
via Shanker on the show
in show 501. So people

21
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.320
should check out that show
as well. Yeah, thanks. Yeah.

22
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.440
Present a techies guide to
public speaking is all about

23
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.760
leveling up your skills around
giving presentations or giving talks

24
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.540
externally. I'm super important for
our careers in tech. And

25
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.760
so thanks for the shout
out and I would definitely

26
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.340
encourage your readers to check
it out. Yeah, absolutely. And

27
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.830
now you've got another book
and it's focused not just

28
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.100
on hiring and retaining a
workforce, but keeping them and

29
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.830
making sure that they don't
walk out the door. Exactly.

30
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.380
Yeah. That's what better allies
is all about? It is

31
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.090
about pretty much everyday simple
actions. Anyone can take to

32
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.900
create a more inclusive and
engaging workplace where really anyone

33
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.720
can do their best work
and everyone is just thriving.

34
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.150
And there's a great buzz
about the workplace. So that's

35
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
the focus of my second
book. Yes. And as you

36
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.510
mentioned, there's a whole chapter
on hiring and casting as

37
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.010
wide a net as possible
in the hiring process. There's

38
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.800
supposedly a tech shortage out
there. And in researching this,

39
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.530
I went and I Googled
tech storage and I got

40
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.860
an interesting reply. I got
interesting results. The first one

41
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.500
was the tech talent shortage
is a lie. And then

42
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.260
the next one was the
tech talent shortage is even

43
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.080
larger than you thought. So
now I don't know, are

44
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.350
we, are we, do we
not have enough techies? Yeah.

45
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.890
Well, so first of all,
think about your experience at

46
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.520
Microsoft and for your listeners
wherever they are, their experience

47
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.430
hiring. I think that most
people probably think it's pretty

48
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.030
hard to hire tech talent
these days. I'm certainly I'm

49
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.580
in Silicon Valley and there's
such a shortage and it's

50
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.760
hard to hire the right
talent. So just anecdotally I

51
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.730
think that the tech talent
shortage is alive, not a

52
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.570
lie. And, and as I've
done research too, there are

53
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.580
definitely different studies that show
up and catch my eye.

54
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.270
One is last summer, I
was reading something on LinkedIn

55
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.500
and they were reporting that
by 2020, which is only

56
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.690
like a year and a
half away, maybe, you know,

57
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.090
ground up to two years.
But by 2020, there's going

58
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.910
to be over a million
tech jobs that are going

59
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.630
unfilled because the talent isn't
there. And then I've also

60
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.520
known the CSO website for
chief security officers reported that

61
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.550
by 2021, there's going to
be 3.5 million cyber security

62
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.790
jobs that are going unfilled.
Okay. So I think that

63
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.160
there's probably, you know, even
if you think that those

64
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.270
statistics are maybe exaggerated or
not quite accurate, there's still

65
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.600
something there. And we don't
have enough talent to fill

66
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.990
all these tech roles that
we need in our companies

67
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.690
and frankly, to solve problems
around the world that we

68
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.440
know need solving. That's a
great point. And we can

69
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.720
look at it as a
gap in that there aren't

70
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.880
enough people to hire, but
we can also think about

71
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.400
the people who have talent
right now might want to

72
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.430
develop their talent internally and
stay at the company and

73
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.280
move into a different job.
That's, you know, up until

74
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.760
the one direct, you know,
diagonally within their company. Absolutely.

75
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.850
And I certainly hope that
our, our tech companies are

76
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.700
investing in their talent, that
they have, that they want

77
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.010
to keep growing the talent.
I mean, face it, tech

78
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.070
moves so quickly. And if
you rely on the skills

79
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.630
you have last year, they're
not going to be the

80
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.150
skills you need next year.
Right. So I hope that

81
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.600
the companies are investing in
talent, but it probably is

82
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.170
not happening at the right
pace. Definitely. No, it doesn't.

83
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.900
I recently had someone who's
a friend of mine leave,

84
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.840
leave the company. And on
the way out in the

85
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.080
kind of like final email,
she was a black woman

86
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.470
in tech. She said, you
meaning you, the tech industry

87
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.890
are spending so much time
trying to get us to

88
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.320
come work at your company,
that you're not putting any

89
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.650
work into having a stay
at your company. That idea

90
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.130
of not focusing on retention,
but having so many recruiters

91
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.100
running out there looking for,
for talent really hit me.

92
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.040
Yes. Oh my gosh. Retention
is so critical. And you

93
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.050
mentioned she's a woman, is
that, did I hear that?

94
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.750
Right? This friend of hers.
Yeah. Black woman in tech,

95
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.190
a black woman in tech,
even more elusive, I'll call

96
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.650
it because if you look
at the statistics that are

97
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.520
being reported, the demographics that
get reported in various diversity

98
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.150
reports, we definitely see that
there's hardly any people of

99
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.910
color working in tech. And
so I know that that

100
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.730
hiring those people, there's a
lot of focus on bringing

101
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.700
people of color of tech,
as well as people from

102
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.970
other underrepresented groups into our
tech companies. But if we're

103
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.760
not retaining them, what I
mean, how shortsighted is that

104
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.770
and can kind of have
to think about what are

105
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.750
our budgets that we give
to the recruiting team to

106
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.750
hire these talents versus the
budget we're giving to whether

107
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.330
it's learning and development or
other activities to create the

108
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.780
really inclusive environments where people
feel like this is awesome.

109
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.220
And I want to be
here. And by the way,

110
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.930
I want all my friends
to come work here too.

111
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.320
This is such a great
place, right? Are we, are

112
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.360
we making the right investment
there? And I kind of

113
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.920
think not in that one
story, you shared underscores that,

114
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.530
but it's really why I
wrote my book. I wrote

115
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.610
this book better allies, because
I really do want everyone

116
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.190
to realize there are things
that we can be doing

117
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.240
to create these workplaces, this
culture, where people feel that

118
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.940
I'm, I can thrive here
and I am thriving. I'm

119
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.090
doing amazing work and it's
fun. And you know, it's

120
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.890
just like, it's, it's the
place I want to be.

121
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.260
And I don't want to
leave. And I'll just say,

122
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.140
there are definitely companies out
there that have that reputation,

123
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.420
but I think they're few
and far between. Hmm. What

124
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.670
do you say to people
who might've made it this

125
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.070
far into the podcast? Or
I've heard stuff like this

126
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.220
before, who are saying, well,
I just want to do

127
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.390
good work like this isn't
about gender. This isn't about

128
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.580
race. Let's just, you know,
the code compiled, that's check

129
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.270
it in. Yeah. So it's
a cool the code compile

130
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.210
and check it in, you
know, that's great, but is

131
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.580
it the right solution? Is
it the right solution for

132
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.210
the customer needs? There's so
many stories about technology gone

133
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.930
wrong there hops because a
diverse group of people we're

134
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.260
not coming up with a
solution they're stories about, do

135
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.240
you want to, well, I'll
share one or two quickly,

136
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.430
like the early airbag technology,
for example, it was built

137
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.090
by a team of all
men who used the standard

138
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.150
heightened weight of an average
adult male to build the

139
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.260
early airbags. And the tragic
story there is that as

140
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.530
those airbags were deployed into
cars and as they deployed

141
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.530
in accidents, they worked really
well for the, the, the

142
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.770
men who are the standard
height and weight. But the

143
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:37.330
tragedy is they were killing
women and children. Okay. So

144
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.910
you kind of wonder, well,
if there had been some

145
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.430
women involved in that engineering
team coming up with the

146
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.400
first airbags, would the same
solution have been put into

147
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.180
place or would have a
better solution have been pointed

148
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.920
out. You don't, we don't
know, we can't go back

149
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.460
and re redo history, but
that's just one example. Another

150
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.420
example is a more recently
is the Apple health tracker.

151
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.180
You know, when it was
first announced the Apple health

152
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.570
tracker, that was, I think
the marketing was L the

153
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.840
health metrics you ever need
to track are available now

154
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.810
in our health tracker, all
the metrics you need, except

155
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.300
they forgot one. Do you
know which one they forgot?

156
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.680
It's the one that women
have been tracking since the

157
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.090
Dawn of time, our Reaper,
our reproductive calendar, they forgot

158
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.210
to include that. And so
half of the population that

159
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.580
was using the Apple health
tracker could not track the

160
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.310
most fundamental of health metrics.
Now, I don't know what

161
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.040
the demographics were of that
team that was creating the

162
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.740
health tracker. But again, I
kind of wonder, like if

163
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.110
there were more women involved,
wouldn't that be the first

164
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.090
thing they think about in
terms of the health metric?

165
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.690
I don't know. So anyway,
That is really interesting because

166
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.800
there's so much more though,
if you think about what

167
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.350
it means to how wide
is your neck and it

168
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.320
be, I give you two
very, very brief stories. My

169
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.470
boss runs a huge team
at Microsoft and visual studio,

170
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.920
but he happens to be
one of the few, for

171
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.820
whatever reason, people that has
a red, green colorblind. So

172
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.490
inevitably he's the one that
finds the problems with our

173
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.940
colors and icons and, and
UX, and it's ranch, red,

174
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.080
green issues, you know, gray,
gray refactor. Isn't quite as

175
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.580
exciting as red green refactor.
Thank goodness you have, you

176
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.320
have him on board. Yeah.
And then the other one

177
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.200
was I'm on the Apple
health of early, early versions

178
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.120
of Apple health. I was
putting my blood sugar in

179
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.050
with my continuous meter every
five minutes. But the database

180
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.050
didn't think to scale that
far, you couldn't do that.

181
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.390
It was too, it was
too much, too much data.

182
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.320
Yes. Data. Yeah. So diversity
is diversity of thought. Diversity

183
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.840
of background it's it's it's
medical it's veterans it's Yeah.

184
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.500
It's that diversity of experience,
life experiences, as well as

185
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.080
personal needs that all comes
together. I think to create

186
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.470
a truly vibrant product development
team is solving the right

187
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.020
problems. Yeah. Well, what do
you do if you have

188
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.760
a small team? What if
you have four or five

189
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.310
people and you don't want
it to look like the

190
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.910
power Rangers, you know, I've
talked about artificial diversity. We

191
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.410
don't want to make a
team of power Rangers where

192
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.320
there's five people, one of
each type, because a it's

193
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.790
artificial and it's not the
effective team. It's just an

194
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.670
attractive team. Well, or maybe
it is an effective team.

195
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.070
I don't know. It could
very well be the right

196
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.190
team for your needs. We
have the important thing. And

197
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.380
I must admit, I'm not
a fan of quotas per

198
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.190
se, to, to, you know,
we shouldn't have some idealized

199
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.590
power ranger team as you.
I've never heard it talked

200
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.720
about that way, but I
love that. That's not what

201
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.450
I'm all about. I'm about,
if you are building a

202
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.620
team, why not cast the
widest net possible cast a

203
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.830
net that is going to
be broad so that you

204
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.040
get a variety of talent
coming in to the interview

205
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.340
process so that you are
evaluating a variety of candidates

206
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.440
and that you're choosing the
right person for the team

207
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.890
for your needs. Why not
cast the widest net possible?

208
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.810
That makes it good. That's
a good point. So this

209
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.390
isn't about, this is about
getting as many people into

210
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.090
the interview door as possible.
You know, if you're interviewing

211
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.970
three people and it's all,
you know, 50 year old

212
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.200
guys, maybe interview six people,
Right? Exactly. And not just

213
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.070
getting them in the door,
but then interviewing them in

214
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.630
an appropriate way that is
objective, that is not biased.

215
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.510
And when you actually make
them the offer, how can

216
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.220
you do that in an
unbiased way? And how can

217
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.160
you onboard them so that
they feel, Hey, I was

218
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.530
hired because of what I'm
bringing here. And not because

219
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.350
I'm the token, somebody at
the token person of color,

220
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.540
the token woman, they didn't
lower the bar for me

221
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.850
because I've got what it
takes. So it's the whole

222
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.470
process, the whole pipeline of
how we hire and interview

223
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.620
attract candidates interview, and then
hire them. Hmm. Can we,

224
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.680
can we break down some
specifics? For example, I hear

225
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.610
a lot about a white
board interviews and people are

226
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.160
still doing interviews where they
say here, go and sort

227
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.080
this, or do a bubble
sort in, see on a

228
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.570
whiteboard, which is not something
you'd ever do in your

229
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.350
job, but something that we
apparently ask people to an

230
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.210
interview. I know, I know.
And I do think that

231
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.060
it is a much better,
better, better, best practice to

232
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.120
have a realistic interview, to
have an interview that mimics

233
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.370
what, what the life is
going to be like once

234
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.560
they walk in the door.
So if it is the

235
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.870
kind of thing that you
are whiteboard, coding every day,

236
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.490
and you're doing that in
a team, then that's fine

237
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.040
to have that be part
of your interview process. But

238
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.380
chances are, as you said,
it's not, it's just this

239
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.590
artificial thing we've done. Maybe
it's because we were put

240
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.350
through that ringer when we
got our jobs. So we're

241
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.540
going to pass that along
to somebody else. Right. Pay

242
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.300
it forward, maybe it's because
we don't know what else

243
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.950
to do, you know, another,
yeah. Another thing that we,

244
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.450
we do. And I think
it's just because of habit

245
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.450
is leading up to the,
the whole interview process when

246
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.150
we're writing job descriptions. I
mean, how many times have

247
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.710
you written a job description?
I'm sure you've done this

248
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.960
many times, but, and you
kind of copy and paste

249
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.660
the last one. The last
one might say, you know,

250
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.280
open source experience, nice to
have and a bachelor's degree

251
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.460
or equivalent in computer science
and, and, and Dan, right.

252
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:59.100
We copy and paste. And
it turns out That as

253
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.340
a result, we end up
having a lot of extraneous

254
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.570
requirements in our job listing
extraneous requirements in terms of,

255
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.240
do you really need a
college degree to be a

256
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.060
software engineer? Well, I haven't
have a computer science degree.

257
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.780
I love the training I
got, but the bootcamp grads

258
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.630
or years of experience might
surpass that, or might be

259
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.350
the equivalent. So ask yourself
with every requirement you're putting

260
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.870
in a job listing. Would
I say no to the

261
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.630
best candidate ever who came
through the door if they

262
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.750
didn't have that college degree.
Right. And if the answer

263
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.300
is, you know, I, I
sort of soften that requirement.

264
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.970
I'd waive that requirement, then
why even put it there

265
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.330
in the first place, open
source experience, the same thing.

266
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.840
Yes. There are some jobs
that absolutely require you work

267
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.620
in open source. And so
of course that would be

268
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.900
a valid requirement, but so
many of our engineering jobs

269
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.350
don't really require open source
experience. It's just sort of

270
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.960
a way for us to
vet a candidate, may we

271
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.780
can go check out their
contributions, the code they forked.

272
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.700
Maybe we can go see
what they've done and get

273
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.850
hub, but it really doesn't
tie to the job per

274
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.940
se. So why put it
in there if it's really

275
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.760
not a requirement? And in
fact, in my book, I

276
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.960
talk about why not try
to just have five requirements

277
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.650
for any job that you're
listing really narrow down what

278
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.870
you're asking for and what
you're looking for to five

279
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.230
and five is kind of
an artificial number could be

280
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.720
six or seven. Doesn't really
matter, but, but try to

281
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.900
minimize it. And the reason
to do this is there

282
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.950
are studies. In fact, there's
this famous HP internal study

283
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.180
from years ago that studied
the promotion velocity for women

284
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.000
and men at the company.
And they found that women

285
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.450
applied for a promotion internally
when they had about a

286
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.940
hundred percent of the requirements
for the job they applied

287
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.550
only if they could say
to every single requirement. Yup,

288
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.970
yup, yup. Yup. Yup. All
the way down by contrast

289
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.530
men internally applied for these
promotions when they had that

290
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.620
60%, when they had 60%
of the requirements and they

291
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.810
kind of probably thought in
their head, I've got enough,

292
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.940
I've got more than half.
I could go for this

293
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.540
promotion now. And that study,
it's kind of infamous. It's

294
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.790
an, it was an internal
study. It hasn't been published

295
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.840
externally, but the study has
been repeated by other researchers

296
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.560
and they finding very similar
things that women will apply

297
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.480
for things when they, they
know they can do the

298
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.270
job 100% of the time
they've got all the things

299
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.720
they're looking for and men,
you know, will, will apply

300
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.220
when they've got most of
them. It's so it's, you

301
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.200
don't want to believe these
things. They are true. It's

302
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.750
a, literally yesterday I was
having dinner with my niece.

303
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.980
She's an accountant. She's just
discovered that her job, that

304
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.330
she's underpaid, she's the lowest
paid of the five accountants

305
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.570
that are there. She was
recently looking around at a

306
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.880
job at job listings and
she, she just exactly described

307
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.440
what you described. She was
looking at the list of

308
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.480
things she could do, and
she had check, check what

309
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.080
I can do all of
this. She basically didn't realize

310
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.870
she was as competent as
she was until she found

311
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.610
a job description that described
her job. Exactly. And she

312
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.260
had previously felt like, well,
I'm never going to ask

313
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.480
them for more money because
if I, I would never

314
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.150
be able to find another
job, but then she realized

315
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.340
what a second. I can
do this. I could find

316
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.900
another job. So now she's
going to go and ask

317
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.140
for her, her raise. And
I encouraged her to not

318
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.450
ask as a raise. I
encouraged her to ask it

319
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.500
as a correction Correction. Oh,
good for you. That's great

320
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.560
advice. I love that. And
it's, it's just so interesting.

321
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.100
I love hearing these anecdotal
examples of this in the

322
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.770
wild, so to speak in
real life, because it does

323
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.460
happen and the research backs
it up. So a best

324
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.770
practice then to attract more
women and to cast that

325
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.120
wider net is really simplify
your job descriptions to the

326
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.550
bare minimum, to the things
that you absolutely are going

327
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.950
to be interviewing for. And
that you require for the

328
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.100
job and leave out all
those nice to have. Yeah.

329
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.800
Job descriptions have become so
long. They're almost as longer

330
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.990
than your resume. I've seen
page Mo you know, page

331
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:06.040
long job descriptions. Someone recently
showed me a job description

332
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.570
that asked for a master's
degree in lieu of experience.

333
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.340
And I thought that was
an interesting and weird way

334
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.290
to do things. They said,
well, we want you to

335
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.870
have five or 10 years
experience or a master's degree.

336
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.460
Not true. Those are interchangeable.
I don't either. I don't

337
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.860
know what they were thinking,
but perhaps they had a

338
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.680
method to their madness there.
Yeah. I don't know. Don't

339
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.800
know. Interesting. Okay. So you
said you need to give

340
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.570
fair interviews. Yes. Can we
talk about that? Yeah, please.

341
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.070
Hey friends, this is Scott,
but this isn't an advertisement.

342
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.540
I just wanted to take
a moment in the middle

343
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.120
of the podcast here to
ask you to help me

344
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.390
grow the show. When you
visit our sponsors, you helped

345
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.940
me out. You helped me
in my spare time, build

346
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.210
this and tell people about
it. But what I really

347
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.970
need from you is that
you tell people about the

348
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.420
show. I love when I
see tweets from you, when

349
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.420
you tweet our guests. When
you talk about the show,

350
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.390
there's anything you can do
to tell your friends, family,

351
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:08.190
relatives, coworkers, colleagues, about the
show. That'd be great. If

352
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.960
you have an idea for
someone who should be on

353
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.380
the show, let me know.
And above all, review the

354
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.810
show, review it on your
blog, review it on iTunes,

355
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.820
review it on Google play
or Stitcher or wherever you

356
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.720
can because telling people about
the show, lets me continue

357
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.200
to do the show with
over 600 episodes. Thanks a

358
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:31.700
lot. So quick story about
how things sometimes are not

359
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.490
fair. Well, years and years
ago, early in my career,

360
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.440
I think I had about
six years of experience. At

361
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.290
the time I had been
working as a software engineer

362
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.950
and I actually was married.
My husband, Tim and I

363
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.120
had met at work. And
we had almost identical resumes.

364
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.340
We had gone to the
same school, got the same

365
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.000
computer science degree, worked at
the same company, right out

366
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.260
of school using the same
technologies, the same frameworks like

367
00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:02.420
it, literally our resumes were
almost identical and we decided

368
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.730
we were going to move
to Silicon Valley. We were

369
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.220
living in England at the
time we were moving to

370
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.760
Silicon Valley and we applied
to a few places and

371
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.210
found one company, very large
tech company that was building

372
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.190
out a team and they
were hiring a handful of

373
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.880
software engineers. And we said,
perfect. Let's apply. We've worked

374
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.830
together before. Wouldn't it be
fun to do that again?

375
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.680
So we applied and we
both got interviews on the

376
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.190
same day. We were seated
in side by side conference

377
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.660
rooms. And literally the interview
team talked to me, you

378
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.550
know, one person talked to
me and then for half

379
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.350
an hour and then move
next door and interviewed my

380
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.720
husband. And it went back
and forth like that all

381
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.870
day. It was a pretty
exhausting day at the end

382
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.240
of the day when my
husband and I were driving

383
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.690
back to our hotel room,
we started comparing notes. Like,

384
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.610
how'd you do? How'd you
think it went, you know,

385
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.700
those types of things. And
I remember him telling me

386
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.820
like, Karen, that was the
hardest interview I've ever had.

387
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.300
They asked such tough questions.
I don't know how I

388
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.170
did that type of thing.
And I remember thinking, huh,

389
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.650
that was the easiest interview
I've ever had. They didn't

390
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.130
ask me any tough technical
questions. They were so superficial

391
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.480
his skirted. Mike's just the
level of my experience. And

392
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.810
I realized what happened is
they lowered the bar for

393
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.860
me. They didn't think that
I, as a woman had

394
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.220
the same technical chops as
my husband. And they asked

395
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.590
different questions, even though we
were back to back side

396
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.150
by side. And the interesting
thing is that company ended

397
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.330
up making both of us
offers. And I decided to

398
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.300
say no, because I didn't
want to join a team

399
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.670
that lowered the bar for
me during the interview process,

400
00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.470
like, what would it be
like if I actually joined

401
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.900
the team? What, what was,
what would the quality of

402
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.740
work assignment be that I
got, or the I'd get

403
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.650
in a team meeting or
a standup, right? Like I

404
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.660
just didn't think it was
going to be there. So

405
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.890
that's one example of how
the hiring process, the interview

406
00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.030
process itself can be very
biased. So the best practice

407
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.240
to contrast that and to
approach it differently is to

408
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.540
make sure we really have
objective criteria that we are

409
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.190
interviewing against perhaps even having
very structured interview tactics, where

410
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:18.310
there are questions designed upfront,
head of time that you're

411
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.610
going to be asking each
candidate consistently and some rubric

412
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.790
for measuring the answers, measuring
those responses so that the

413
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.490
bias can be taken out
as much as possible. So

414
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.550
that's for example, how, how
the bias creeps into the

415
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.690
high, the interview process. I
think, I think that last

416
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.520
bit we should kind of
double click on a minute

417
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.780
because I think that's really,
really functionally practical advice that

418
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.590
someone who's listening can use,
like right away, write down

419
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.420
some questions, talk about them
as a group, decide that,

420
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.730
yeah, we'll have an interview.
We can, the interview can

421
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.250
go in wide reaching different
directions, but these are the

422
00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.650
15 questions that we are
going to ask everyone. They

423
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.610
are good, solid tech questions.
They're unbiased. They're not trivia,

424
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.270
they're not writing a bubble
sword on a whiteboard. They

425
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.970
are representative of the kind
of stuff that this person's

426
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.520
going to do every day.
Right. They aren't your, your

427
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.520
favorite movie. They aren't, you
know, like whatever. I mean,

428
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.770
w w you know, it's
just, it's focused on the

429
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:18.180
business and the business needs.
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. You know,

430
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.490
what else I would, I
would love your listeners to

431
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.480
ask if they is, add
a question. So number 16,

432
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.210
to that list of 15,
ask the question, how have

433
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:31.980
you contributed to a diverse
and inclusive workplace? Just ask

434
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.370
that question. Some people would
just stared into the middle

435
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.650
distance and didn't have an
answer to that Then, you

436
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.720
know, you know, and you
can decide if this is

437
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.400
important to you, but if
it's an important, if it's

438
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.010
important for you to be
hiring people who are going

439
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.430
to add to the inclusivity
of the environment, even if

440
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.500
they are part of the
majority now, as you know,

441
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.600
a white man, if you're
looking for people who are

442
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.000
going to make your workplace
even more inclusive, why not

443
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.890
start when they're walking through
the door and ask that

444
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.830
question, if you don't care,
don't ask it. But if

445
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.450
they stare into the distance
and that's going to be

446
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.000
very telling, Yeah, I think
that one of the things

447
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.060
that helps me as a,
as a white guy think

448
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.940
about things is I really
call out the difference between

449
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.720
diverse, which is a thing
which is maybe the who

450
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.860
and inclusive, which is the,
how, The, how loves that.

451
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.760
We, we, we did a
Thanksgiving meal recently and we

452
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.410
had some people come who
were vegetarian, inclusive behavior was

453
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.590
making sure that they had
vegetarian food to eat. Right.

454
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.470
We weren't trying to put
together, put together a diverse

455
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.560
Thanksgiving, but we wanted to
be an inclusive one. Otherwise

456
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.590
we'd have our guests literally
just eating stuffing. Oh gosh,

457
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.580
we put sausage in our
stuffing. That wouldn't work very

458
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.220
well. Anyway. Yes, I know,
but that's, it that'd be

459
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.520
a problem. There we go.
But what a great, great

460
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.860
thought. I don't know. I
love that. I love that

461
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.760
inclusive is the how and
the diverse is the who.

462
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.050
That's great. So simple. And
so, so telling, yeah, You

463
00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.080
have a section on performance
feedback, and this has been

464
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.680
a problem amongst, you know,
kind of my, my manager,

465
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.210
friends of people, not feeling
that their performance feedback was,

466
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.840
was fair, getting feedback, and
then talking to a peer

467
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.700
and then finding out that
they were given entirely different

468
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.030
feedback, even though they were
doing the same jobs. How

469
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.120
do you keep feedback private
while still making it fair

470
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.080
to everyone? Yeah. I don't
know if that is the

471
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.400
concern that I have in
terms of private feedback. It's

472
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.660
more that there's research showing
that we tend not to

473
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.410
give difficult feedback, constructive feedback,
you know, the feedback that

474
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.810
helps us really learn and
grow. We tend not to

475
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.210
give that difficult feedback to
people who are different than

476
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.730
us, whether that is across
gender lines or race lines

477
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:54.190
or some other demographic line,
we hold ourselves back. Here's,

478
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.210
here's why, you know, as
a person who's white, I

479
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.850
am white. I might not
want to give that really

480
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.280
tough feedback to a person
of color on my staff

481
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.500
because I might think, Oh
my gosh, they're going to

482
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.200
think I'm racist. If I
give them, if I show

483
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.940
up real tough here, and
I'm giving them these, this

484
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.520
feedback, they're going to think
I'm racist for a man.

485
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.590
He might not give feedback
to a woman because he

486
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.390
might think she's going to
think I'm sexist if I

487
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.880
give her this feedback. So
it's just easier to hold

488
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.880
back. And there's research that,
that shores this up and

489
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.840
improves it out Stanford's claim
and instituted a research study

490
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.130
of reviewing thousands and thousands
of written annual performance reviews

491
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.830
from tech companies. And this
is what they ended up

492
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.790
finding is that the difficult
feedback went more to men

493
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.420
than women. Women just didn't
get as much cause again,

494
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.970
because chances are their bosses.
Amanda, that's how it works

495
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.000
in tech. The other thing
they found is that the

496
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.720
length of the performance reviews
was different. Men got longer,

497
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.380
just longer more words in
their performance reviews. So there

498
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.160
was more, more feedback given.
And also the third thing

499
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.070
is that men were cha
chancellor and men were more

500
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.040
likely to get feedback about
a skill they needed to

501
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.600
learn that would further their
career tech skill in particular.

502
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.570
So the feedback we're giving,
I think that's where the

503
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.700
equitable part is. This let's
make sure that we are

504
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.330
writing performance reviews of the
same length that we are

505
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.000
for every review we're giving.
We're making sure that we're

506
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.010
giving tangible ideas of tools,
techniques, jobs, skills, that people

507
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.890
should be learning to further
their career. And that when

508
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.930
we do have difficult feedback,
we're not holding it back

509
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.320
Truly significant. And I think
that there are very likely

510
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.740
people who are listening, who
disagree with aspects of this,

511
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.990
and they should kind of
go back to the science

512
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.780
and go back to the,
the work that has been

513
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.060
done in this space. That
is fact-based and say, listen,

514
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.990
the facts are that these
are how people are. You

515
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.480
know, people feel this way.
People are perceived this way.

516
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.390
People are receiving reviews of
this such and such a

517
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.430
length. And if you go
back to the original thing

518
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:00.540
you said about interviewing, have
specific questions that represent what

519
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.250
they're going to be doing
on the job, you can

520
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.920
apply that to performance feedback.
Are you giving them feedback

521
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.760
on what their job is?
Exactly. You'd like it's objective

522
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.270
criteria. It's a way of
measuring people objectively to help

523
00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.520
prevent the bias from creeping.
And we all have bias.

524
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.610
It's okay. But we can
put these best practices in

525
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.990
place to help prevent that
bias from affecting creating an

526
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.980
inclusive workplace from effecting people's
careers. So the book is

527
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.480
coming next month. I think
January, 2019. Yeah, that's right. That's

528
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.280
right. I hope at the
beginning of the month, but

529
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.710
cross let's cross our fingers.
There are few things still

530
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.630
to be worked out, but
we are on track for

531
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.990
January 20, 19. Yeah. Super
excited to get it out

532
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.210
there. And if I, if
you don't mind, I'll give

533
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.420
myself a shout out. People
can go to better allies.com

534
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.150
and sign up to be
alerted when the book is

535
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.690
ready, read more about it.
I also have a newsletter

536
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.950
that's weekly called five ally
actions where I share five

537
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.460
simple everyday things people can
do in a workplace to

538
00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.940
create a more inclusive culture.
So just we'll dose of

539
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.460
inspiration every Friday. So you
can sign up for that

540
00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.490
newsletter also in my, on
my website, better allies.com. And

541
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.380
then I want to give
you a shout out and

542
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.520
say, go to better allies.com/about
in your bio. There's a

543
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.730
bunch of great URLs that
people should follow. There's of

544
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.340
course, the link to your
newsletter that you commented on.

There's your Twitter handle, better
allies, but also your Ted

546
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.300
X talk on women in
tech, the missing force, this

547
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.940
idea that we've got 50%
of the population just there

548
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.030
waiting to be hired, let's
get them involved. There's a

549
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.250
group of people that we
can, we can call upon.

550
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.250
And then the reminder of
course, that your book with

551
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.840
<inaudible> called a techies guide
to public speaking present. She

552
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.940
was on episode five Oh
one. And that's another great

553
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.010
book that they can buy
from you. Yeah. Thank you

554
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.110
so much. Thanks for all
those shout outs. Really appreciate

555
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.240
it. Yeah. I appreciate you.
Thanks for chatting with me

556
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.780
today. My pleasure. It was
so fun, Scott. Thank you.
