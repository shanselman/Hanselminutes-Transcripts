Scott talks with Victor, a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.390
lawyer and lecturer from the
university of the pseudo. Hi,

10
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.130
this is Scott Hanselman, and
this is another episode of

11
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.920
Hansel minutes. And again, like
I was last week, I'm

12
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.830
still here in South Africa and
rather than doing it focus

13
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.410
technology podcast for the next
couple of weeks, I'm doing

14
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.990
man on the street interviews
here in South Africa with real

15
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.990
people today. I'm fortunate enough
to sit down with Victor

16
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.750
who is a lecturer at
the university of <inaudible>. Thank

17
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.980
you so much for taking
the time to talk to

18
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.990
me. Hello. So I think
that the people that are

19
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.990
listening to this show may
not be familiar with Lisha

20
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.270
too, and how it is
situated in the African continent.

21
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.460
Maybe you could give me
a little bit of geographical

22
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.040
context. Yes. Les Sutro is
a tiny country. It is

23
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.260
located insights of Africa. It
is the only country in

24
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.480
Africa, which is completely surrounded
by South Africa. Every time you

25
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.260
cross the border of lessor
or you walk into South Africa

26
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.110
and it is formally a
British colony, and it got

27
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.540
its independence in the 1960s
during the time of a

28
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.370
path. It, so you can
imagine that a immediate loud

29
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.130
of lizard, there was a
path that, and inside a

30
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.760
lessor, there was a free
country. There were lots of

31
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.150
political difficulties at the time.
Now, why is it that

32
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.740
it's a country and not
a province of South Africa? Well,

33
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.700
I think when the British
came in, it was essentially

34
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.440
the three, such two size
countries. First, there was a

35
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.930
sweat Swaziland, and then Botswana,
which a British protectorates, but

36
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.430
they colonized less sort of,
it was not a British

37
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.110
protectorate like Swaziland. They made
it into a colony and

38
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.790
it came directly under the
Queens rule. It was a

39
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.220
very set up that came
through lizard. Now I've heard

40
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.860
people refer to it as
Lesotho and a suit to

41
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.530
suit the Soto. What is
the correct way to pronounce

42
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.420
the country? Well, I think
by Soto was at the

43
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.550
people, the indigenous people, they,
they call it Lisutu bad.

44
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.860
It is spelled L E
S or T H O.

45
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.430
So most of us call
it less Sato because of

46
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.480
the way it is spelled.
But for the West, it

47
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.670
is less true to the
land of the Bosu too.

48
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.570
That's what it means. Yes.
Your lecture at the university.

49
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.830
And what is your specialty?
Well, I teach mainly in

50
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.260
the legal field. I am
a lawyer, so I do,

51
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.430
I teach different courses in
law, things like family law,

52
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.890
commercial law, property law varies
depending on the needs of

53
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.250
the faculty from time to
time. Now, my understanding of

54
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.530
the law is limited to
what goes on in the

55
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.350
U S and from what
I watch on us, legal

56
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.050
TV shows like law and
order. And these kinds of

57
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.050
drama shows. What I know
about the British system is

58
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.780
that they have barristers instead
of attorneys, but I really

59
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.930
don't understand how law works
on the, on the continent.

60
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.330
Are there multiple legal systems?
Does each country have their

61
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.590
own legal system? Well <inaudible>
is a Jew, a legal

62
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.980
system. Basically it means that
we have two legal systems,

63
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.410
the customary law, which is
the indigenous law of the

64
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.510
pursuit of people, which is
applied mainly to the, in

65
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.270
the villages. It's agitated by
achieves and so on. And

66
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.890
then we have the inherited
law, the Roman dash legal

67
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.200
system, which was brought in
into Lisutu as much as

68
00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:00.210
South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Namibia.
Now, what it means basically

69
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.490
is that when the British
came and colonized South Africa Fest,

70
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.310
they found that the Dutch
had settled it in the

71
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.600
Cape and they will operating
the Dutch legal system. So

72
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.340
then when they extended their
occupation, interlace Soto, they decided

73
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.210
that the law which was
operating in the Cape will

74
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.690
be the same as the
low, which is operating in

75
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.410
a risotto ended that applied
to all the other colonies.

76
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.120
They actually pass the law
to specific Cali legitimize, the

77
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.320
application of Roman dash legal
system. They didn't bring in

78
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.830
English law, but what happened
was that the people were

79
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.540
administering the Roman Dutch legal
system where English lawyers. So

80
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.940
there was a lot of
influence of English law. They

81
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.760
were being asked to apply
Roman dash law, but we're

82
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.550
not trained in the Roman
Dutch law. So at the

83
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.340
end of the day, the
inherited road, the colonial became

84
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.150
an Armagh emission way mixture
of English law and Roman

85
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.850
dash slope. So in most
of our laws, although we

86
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.210
took off Roman bachelor is
the law, which is applicable.

87
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.750
There's a lot of influence
of English law. And in

88
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.890
modern days, because of that,
the growth of the global

89
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.020
village, even American loam in
things like commercial law, insurance,

90
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.630
property laws, there's a lot
of a mixture of Anglo

91
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.890
American laws into our systems.
So basically we have the

92
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.840
customary law, as well as
the imported Roman dash, which

93
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.280
is strictly speaking, not from
international lawyer as such. So

94
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.160
it's a Roman Dutch law
400 years in the future

95
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.520
and kind of broken off
into its own style. Yes.

96
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.850
And you actually borrow laws
from the, from the Anglo,

97
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.870
from the American system from
other systems. Yes. I think

98
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.480
what basically lawyers say we
have, we draw from the

99
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.050
Roman dashed law is the
sources of law, the leading

100
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.040
judgments, the leading, what we
call it, the jewelries, those

101
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.850
who wrote about Roman dash
law, but the influences from

102
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.970
other legal systems like English
fabric, we say those are

103
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.940
persuasive so that if a
judge is deciding a case

104
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.300
and there's no Logies applicable,
he can be persuaded to

105
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.460
borrow from other systems. Really.
So a precedent is almost

106
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.060
set kind of an implicit
precedent by a case that's

107
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.220
being done somewhere else in
an entirely different country and

108
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.960
entirely different legal system. Yes.
What we, we normally, what

109
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.470
judges do they apply precedents
from previous decisions within their

110
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.950
own country? Let's say presidents
from Minnesota, but in the

111
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.640
absence of a precedent from
within Lesotho, they have to

112
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.010
look at other likes legal
systems and see whether a

113
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.420
decision in a similar case
in another foreign country would

114
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.910
persuade them to apply that
particular judgment and the foreign

115
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.170
countries they would normally look
to. First of all, England,

116
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.750
the former colonial country and
the American legal systems as

117
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.290
well. Because as I'm saying
in the commercial world, the

118
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.520
laws are becoming more and
more universal so that it

119
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.850
won't be strange to find
that in certain aspects, American

120
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.660
law and lesser to law
at the same. Hi, this

121
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.210
is Scott Hanselman with a
word from our sponsor. Do

122
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.790
you know how to build
web 2.0 Ajax applications with

123
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.640
web 1.0 components? You really
can't. If you want to

124
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.670
do the next generation web
applications you'll need next generation

125
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.070
components. Just like the ones
that our friends at Telerik

126
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.280
have got their rad controls
for ESPN at Ajax. It's

127
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.800
a huge pack of web
controls built on top of

128
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.540
asp.net Ajax. That'll add previously
impossible performance interactivity to your

129
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.600
next project. The new controls
mirror Ajax API from asp.net.

130
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.990
So development is really straightforward.
The client scripts are shared.

131
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.410
So loading time is not
a problem. If you just

132
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.980
had a couple of properties
and you'll be able to

133
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.980
automatically bind to web services
for a really efficient operation,

134
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.450
the new rad editor from
ESPN Ajax, Telerik loads up

135
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.090
to four times faster than
before. And the new rad

136
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.570
grid handles thousands of records
and just milliseconds, but as

137
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.240
always, it's best to try
for yourself. So you can

138
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.750
visit <inaudible> dot com slash
ASP, net Ajax, and download

139
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:30.660
a trial. Thanks a lot.
So globalization is becoming the

140
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.350
defacto standard to the point
of even contracts being similar

141
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.460
all over the Yes, indeed.
There is a lot of

142
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.090
that is I'm saying, especially
in the laws, dealing with

143
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.680
business in general where the
local business or international business

144
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.560
Now customary law might be
something that's interesting to people.

145
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.550
These are, these are laws
that were there before white

146
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:58.190
folks showed up. This is
for dealing with struggles and

147
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.840
conflicts within perhaps a chief's
influence area of village. Is

148
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.590
that correct? Yes. Customer low
base Cali operates at a

149
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:14.870
very simplistic level. Familial relations
neighbor relations. You look at

150
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:21.020
situations where, for example, a
boy from one family, impregnates,

151
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.130
a girl from another family,
usually in the villages that

152
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.760
will be dealt as a
customary matter because in the

153
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.960
context of lesser term, eh,
for a boy to, in

154
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.580
pregnant another Gail before marriage,
that raises a question of

155
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.220
liability on the part of
the boy that you be.

156
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.940
He will be liable to
play damages, which is six

157
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.550
head of cattle for every
new pregnant at that particular

158
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.470
Gail before negotiations for marriage
can even take place that

159
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.730
the very act of impregnating
another, a girl from another

160
00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.230
family before marriage is actually
treated as a, is a

161
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.130
wrongful act. Is it hot
As a tort? So even

162
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.590
now after he's paid six
head of cattle, though, is

163
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.710
there not an obligation like
in the U S there's

164
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.660
kind of an implicit obligation
to take care of your

165
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.160
child until they're 18? And
there are laws for, you

166
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.580
know, parental obligations or is
it simply pay your six

167
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.090
head of cattle and move
on? Apparently there is a

168
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.720
conflict here between customary lawyer
in the received law, or

169
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.160
because it customary law. If
the boy or the family

170
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.070
of the boy pay their
six, eight of cattle, they

171
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.800
are done with that child
in the absence of marriage,

172
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.040
it is the girl's family.
Lou must look after that,

173
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.490
but to collect child should
the family of the boy

174
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.970
wants that child at a
later stage, when the child

175
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.920
grows up, they are required
to pay extra cattle. But

176
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.000
on the other hand, the
received law says that if

177
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.240
you father a child, your
light to maintain. So it

178
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.170
now depends on which law,
the family of the Guild

179
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.340
chooses to, to utilize. If
they choose to utilize the

180
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.070
Roman national law, then the
boy may be asked to

181
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.160
the Gail can go to
court and claim maintenance under

182
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.940
the <inaudible> legal system. But
if they are, they go

183
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.090
for the customary law, then
it means that the family

184
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.930
must ask for the head
of cattle. It doesn't, it

185
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.060
doesn't that require a, a
level of education on the

186
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.040
part of the girl and
the girl's family. They may

187
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.720
not know that these laws
exist. I think we shouldn't

188
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.510
underestimate people and see that
they're not educated. I think

189
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.770
in general, they do know
what the law says, but

190
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.970
the families, as far as
I realized in most of

191
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.390
these Southern Africa in Africa,
they do what I call

192
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.810
in legal teams, forum, shopping.
They look at which legal

193
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:56.670
system will best serve their
interests. If customer law will

194
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.150
best serve their interests, then
they'll go for the customer

195
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.380
who option. Let's say, for
example, the, the, the boy

196
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.920
who has been pregnant, the
boy has impregnated together is

197
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.760
not working, but is the
family know that the parents,

198
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.010
they have lots of cattle,
they'll go for the customer

199
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.150
option. But suppose the young
man is working is ending

200
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.240
your salary. The girl may
decide to hope for the

201
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.850
Roman Dutch legal system and
claim maintenance, because he has

202
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.150
an income from which he
can claim maintenance. That's quite

203
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.710
clever. Yes. Yeah. That is
exactly what happens. And we

204
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.340
have headaches, similar experience in
other countries like Zimbabwe and

205
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.340
so on. But I have
to say that in general,

206
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.890
my experience that in Southern
Africa, men who filed that

207
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.200
children out of marriage generally
do not want to look

208
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.360
after them. And we men
in general, struggle to get

209
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.290
maintenance, even from those that
are working in our wheeling,

210
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.310
to be able to afford,
to pay men in maintenance

211
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.520
for children, they will refuse
to pay to say and

212
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.280
say, if you want me
to pay maintenance, let me

213
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.340
give me the child, but
I will not give you

214
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.920
my money, because if I
give you my money, I'm

215
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.420
not going to give it
to my son. That is

216
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.080
the attitude. Unfortunate. Now you,
you, your specialty is, is

217
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.450
not just law, but also
women's issues in law. And

218
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.600
you've recently been working on
a paper on how the

219
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.630
legal system actually kind of
supports masculinity. Yes, to a

220
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.200
large extent, we live in
a men's world. I remember

221
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.670
that recently, I read a
book called immense world talking

222
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:42.090
about masculinity. Basically we have
a situation where patriarchy or

223
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.460
the dominance of men is
the order of the day.

224
00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.980
And it does not matter
where they are talking about

225
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.250
Southern Africa or the United States
or any other country in

226
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.630
the world. We may have
countries where women have gained

227
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:59.900
certain advantages against men, but
in general, we are looking

228
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:05.000
at a system where the
legal system itself is generally

229
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:11.210
unresponsive to women's needs in
the sense that if I

230
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:16.070
can use a very, very
simple example, we have a

231
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:23.540
crime in, in my, in,
in Lesotho whereby a woman

232
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:30.050
who commits a abortion will
be criminally prosecuted. But the

233
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.200
law does not say anything
about the person who is

234
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.950
responsible for the pregnancy, even
in the case where the

235
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.490
boy after him pregnant, and
the girl disappears will say,

236
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.760
says, I have, I am
not responsible. You are on

237
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.020
your own. And then we
also have other crimes like,

238
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.790
eh, which are unfortunately real.
We have had women who

239
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:57.110
would damp babies, women who
kill babies when they are

240
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.850
born. And in those cases,
the law will punish the

241
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.020
women, regardless of the social
circumstances that is posed to

242
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.720
the woman to do such
a thing. I don't think

243
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.400
that any normal person would
want a woman would want

244
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.640
to kill a young child,
but we see a situation

245
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.440
where women are pushed and
the lawyer is unresponsive. And

246
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.360
another offense, which is even
common, I would say in

247
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.520
countries like the United States, the
battered woman syndrome, where women

248
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.930
pushed to the point where
they killed the husband, because

249
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.530
that is the only defense
mechanism left to them. But

250
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.230
the, what does the law
say? You are guilty of

251
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.430
murder in most cases, but
the law has not moved

252
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.750
fast enough to see what
are the circumstances, what leads

253
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.620
this woman to do this.
And unfortunately also in our

254
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.820
part of the world, generally,
the issue of violence of

255
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:04.580
men against women is either
not taken seriously, or it

256
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:10.040
is general underestimate. It. It
is no man clipping a

257
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.030
woman or punching is not
something that can be taken

258
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.690
quite seriously, unless do man
is severely injured. Then we

259
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.690
say, but people need to
say that it was wrong

260
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.690
to be dizzy. They say
you went too far in

261
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.780
disciplining this particular person. So
that is the kind of

262
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.100
attitudes that women have to
deal with. And it's a

263
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.800
massive problem In, in the,
in the States and the

264
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.440
County that I live in,
they recently changed some of

265
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.390
the laws with regards to
domestic violence, such that if,

266
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.130
if I, if, if you
were my wife and I

267
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.700
grabbed your wrist, I just
squeezed us a little harder

268
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.300
than you. It, and you
decided to call the police.

269
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.180
You could say, lock him
up. I don't want to

270
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.300
see him for a month.
So they've swung the pendulum

271
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.100
all the other way. Any
physical, any unwanted physical contact

272
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.780
then becomes a domestic violence
issue if, if the, if

273
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.380
the woman or, or if
the man in this case,

274
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.860
but usually it's focused towards
the woman says that I

275
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.300
don't want to be touched
in that way. So that

276
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.020
instantly there, the husband is
drug drug away. Yes. I

277
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.330
think that is, I would
commend that kind of law

278
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.980
for the simple reason that
in the majority of cases,

279
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.860
a woman who was wristy
has been attached will not

280
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.640
learn to quote and say
that somewhat ties to my,

281
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.910
at least, I mean the
extremes, but, but basically Lila

282
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.300
is sending a clear message
that it is wrong to

283
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.110
use violence of any form
against anybody. You must respect

284
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:47.630
somebodies bodily integrity. But on
the ally hand, in Lesotho,

285
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.470
for example, we don't have
domestic violence legislation. It is

286
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:57.530
treated as assault. So a
woman whose is been violated

287
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:03.590
by the husband physically here's
to pursue common assault by

288
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.220
sold, to do grievous bodily
harm and so on. And

289
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.430
that is a, not an
ordinary criminal process. And we

290
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:16.160
know that the criminal process
takes forever. Unfortunately, the police

291
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.700
attitudes also Elman who comes
to say that my husband

292
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.210
clips me, but with nothing
to show that there's been

293
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.320
some kind of physical damage,
we'll be laughed out of

294
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.580
the police station, they'll say,
but what did you do

295
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.090
to, we don't see anything.
And I've actually had personal

296
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.900
experience where a person I
know had that kind of

297
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.340
a situation. And the police
were very, very reluctant to

298
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.910
press charges. And eventually that
case never went beyond the

299
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.970
police station. Okay. But isn't
that that's an example, not

300
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.460
necessarily the law not being
on her side, because it

301
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:57.800
was in fact, but rather
that's institutionalized a patriarchy culturally.

302
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.360
Yeah, partly. Yes. I would
say that, but I would

303
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.540
go so far as to
say that the problem is

304
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.100
bigger than that. If we
had a law, which for

305
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.180
beads domestic violence, then you
could begin to change attitudes.

306
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.750
You could begin to train
the police that any form

307
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.080
of violence, even if it
does not lead to any

308
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.170
injury is wrong. But in
this case, because we don't

309
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.310
even have a law, which
says that a <inaudible> domestic

310
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:33.050
violence is a specialized kind
of problem. It happens within

311
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:39.200
the confines or private department
and generally is not readily

312
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.860
seen. So you need specifically
legislation about, I see. So

313
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.230
even the simple fact of
naming it and giving it

314
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.000
a name and pointing to
it and saying that is

315
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.850
different, and that is wrong.
Even though the result may

316
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.810
still be similar to an
assault charge. That is valuable.

317
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.910
Yes, it is a first
step. I would say South Africa

318
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:04.320
is domestic violence legislation, but
South Africa is one of the

319
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.740
highest incidents of domestic violence.
But I believe that by

320
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.720
passing that law, they've put
the Fest a break. If

321
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.580
you like even a difficult
building process. It seems to

322
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.880
me that the countries in
Africa that take a problem

323
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:27.990
head on name it and
start coming forward with cultural

324
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.360
reconciliation, that this is a
problem. Like for example, the

325
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.020
way Uganda handled the HIV
crisis. And now the way

326
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:39.540
that that South Africa has started
to kind of demystify AIDS,

327
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.340
moving from myth to reality,
trying to think about very

328
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.920
publicly everywhere. As I move
around South Africa, I see signs

329
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.330
and billboards and television commercials
that are making sure that

330
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.240
people know their rights. You
cannot be fired from your

331
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.330
job because you have HIV.
It seems like some kind

332
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:02.970
of a Countrywide expression of,
of domestic violence and the

333
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.610
problem of domestic violence. The
same way that they're doing

334
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.970
with AIDS could, could move
the ball forward. Yes. I

335
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.110
think that it's very important
to go public about these

336
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.410
particular things. Let me just
share one Pepsi, one last

337
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.650
example of what we are
talking about until very recently

338
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.790
in Soto, we didn't, it
was not a crime where

339
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.010
it has been raped. His
wife. We didn't have a

340
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.330
crime called marital rape, but
in 2003, they passed a

341
00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.570
law which makes marital rape
on offense. Now that is

342
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.540
not lead to a rash
of people going to court

343
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.330
to say, my husband has
raped me or that, but

344
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.990
it is a sign that
the law is coming to.

345
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.200
The reality that rape can
even take place within an

346
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.030
intimate relationship. So that to
me is a clear indication

347
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:59.400
that with some of these
culturally changed problems, you need

348
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.400
to have a law that
sends a message, but at

349
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.130
the same time, we then
need to mobilize the people,

350
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.670
raise consciousness and so on
so that the law can

351
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.100
then support that change in
the attitude. It's definitely a

352
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.950
step forward. Well, thank you
very much. Victor lecturer from

353
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.020
the university of the PSU
for taking the time to

354
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.180
chat with me. Thank you
very much.
