From Hansel minutes.com. It's Hanselman.
It's our weekly discussion with

2
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.850
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

3
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.360
show number one 84. Recorded
live Wednesday, October 14th, 2009. Support for

4
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.110
Hanselman it's just provided by
teller RD controls the most

5
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.620
comprehensive suite of components for
windows forms and asp.net web

6
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:45.710
applications. online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this episode,
Scott talks with Microsoft program

7
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.360
managers, Scott Hunter. Hi, this is
Scott here. That's amazing. This

8
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.370
is another episode of Hansel
minutes and I'm here on

9
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.560
the Microsoft campus today, actually
on the third floor of

10
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.950
building 42. And I'm sitting
down with Scott Hunter program manager

11
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.890
on the asp.net team. An
individual who's obviously changed his

12
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.020
name to Scott because you,
you have to be named

13
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.850
Scott to work for Microsoft.
Yes. If you want to

14
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.470
be on the third floor
of building 42, your name

15
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.170
must be Scott, but actually
that's not true because now

16
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.410
I'm actually Hunter because there's
so many, so many Scouts

17
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.120
on the floor that I
am now a Hunter. That's

18
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.740
pretty good. That's a cool
name. And so for people

19
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.050
out there, you have to
realize that Scott Guthrie's on

20
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.990
this floor, the goo the
goo, are you the who?

21
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.390
That could be a thing.
We could make that a

22
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.700
thing actually I'm Scott who
actually tends to are Scott

23
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.340
who, because I'm Scott. Huh?
So we have hoo ha

24
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.820
and goo, and then Phil
hack when we were in

25
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.340
Norway, we were the haha
brothers. Yes. It's just lovely.

26
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.520
Crazy. So you guys have
been working really hard in

27
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.970
visual studio, 2010. And as
soon we're going to see

28
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.700
a beta to some point
in the future. What are

29
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.010
some of the things that
are going into asp.net for

30
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.140
that people should want to
look for? When, when beta

31
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.690
two comes out? The main
things that we're trying to,

32
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.430
you know, look at, look
at for Danette for is

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.800
we've really been trying to
address pain points for customers.

34
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.690
That's probably been our number
one item is to go

35
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.680
look at things like client
IDs, view, state, and what

36
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.780
we rendered as markups. You
know, there's lots of things

37
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.050
that ESPN it's rendered and
people go, I can't turn

38
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.910
that market off. Why is
it rendering that stuff? So

39
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.160
we did a lot of
work in those three kind

40
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.800
of pillar areas, but really
done it for, for our

41
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.990
team has been trying to
address customer pain points. That's

42
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.730
been number one and all
these legacy problems that have

43
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.760
been around for a long
time. And we've been trying

44
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.830
to address a lot of
those. Now these are legacy

45
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.770
problems because Dutton at three,
five and three Oh and

46
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.660
two, Oh, those are all
kind of in the same

47
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.300
CLR. But some people I
think have figured out by

48
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.920
now that.net four is going
to be a side by

49
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.960
side release. It's going to
be a kind of a

50
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.570
lateral thing. You can have
two Oh and four running

51
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.660
on the same machine, right?
That's correct. So that's one

52
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.390
of the benefits of D
of, of dotnet for is

53
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.000
the fact that it's a
brand new CLR and just

54
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.070
the act of installing it
on your box will not

55
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.350
break any application on your
box because all your applications

56
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.840
on your box that are
already running, you know, dotnet

57
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.350
two or.net three, five will
continue to run those, those

58
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.760
versions exactly. As they are
today, you'll have to manually

59
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.160
go to a website and
move it to.net for if

60
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.010
you want to start taking
advantages of some of the

61
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.910
features in dinette for, So
they're not going to automatically

62
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.640
upgrade my websites. No. Okay.
So if I have a

63
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.170
server, let's say that's runs
one, one, two, and four.

64
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.760
Oh, I can do that.
I can have them all

65
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.740
running side by side. That's
correct. You could have one

66
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.680
server and it could be
one web application running one.

67
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.630
Oh, you could have one
running two. Oh, it could

68
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.720
have one running for, Oh.
And they would all not

69
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.610
touch, touch each other at
all, or have any side

70
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.060
effects on each other. So,
Okay. Now and that, and

71
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.650
that's because of the side
by side sealer aspect of

72
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.230
things, because this is truly
a separate installation of a

73
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.540
seat. That's correct. So if
you go look in your

74
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.130
windows, microsoft.net directory under the
frameworks, there'll be a framework

75
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.400
directory in there. And you'll
see a brand new FORO

76
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.700
directory with all the assemblies
and stuff. And so that

77
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.140
those are only for four
of brand new. Now, did

78
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.910
that mean you got to
break stuff like, does this

79
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.460
mean like the asp.net team
is like, Ooh, it's separate.

80
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.740
We can break stuff now.
Like stuff you want it

81
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.420
to break, You would still
wish we could break more

82
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.610
stuff. You know, that, that's
one of the things that

83
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.180
I think that frustrates us
as, as employees of Microsoft

84
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.490
is, you know, one of
the benefits for our customers

85
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.050
is that we, we go
out of our way not

86
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.900
to break people's software, but
at the same time, I

87
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.630
think that hampers our library
as well, where sometimes I

88
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.400
feel like, you know, God,
we have these legacy problems

89
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.280
that we can't fix because
fixing them fundamentally is gonna

90
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.460
break other, you know, break
people's applications. But FORO does

91
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.420
allow us a little bit
more leeway. Leeway is the

92
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.600
right word yet to break
things because obviously the installation

93
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.810
of that on the box
is not going to break

94
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.080
any applications that are already
on the box. And we,

95
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.120
we have done a few
breaking changes in.net for That's

96
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.010
cool. I mean, I think
that's great. I mean, I

97
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.080
know that most applications that
I've upgraded, I haven't had

98
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.630
any problem, but if it
is a breaking change and

99
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.520
it's written down and there's
some flag, then I can

100
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.040
put it back into legacy
mode. That's that's cool too.

101
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.110
Yeah. So we're actually going
to have a document that

102
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.850
we're gonna try to get
released right around the time

103
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.190
beta two comes out, which
actually lists all these breaking

104
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.830
changes and you know, the
knobs and switches you can

105
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.840
use to turn these things
on and off. The biggest

106
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.930
one I think will affect
a customer moving forward is

107
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.290
we added a, what we
call rendering compatibility mode. And

108
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.320
what this allows us to
do is basically say, I

109
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.220
want the application to render
using the FORO rendering versus

110
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.320
I want the application to
render, render of using the

111
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.640
three, five rendering. And we
use this switch particularly to

112
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.810
go, and there were some,
some controls that we had

113
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.720
that just admitted stuff without
you asking. I mean, if

114
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.100
you put an image, you're
gonna get a border. Yeah.

115
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.340
Cozy, right. Admitted a kind
way to put it. If

116
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.810
you, if you threw a
table out there with a

117
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.150
rented equals Rentokil service, like
in a grid view or

118
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.840
something you got like once
again, border equals zero various

119
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.880
little attributes that were scattered
all over the place and

120
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.850
put on things and, and,
you know, frustrate your customers

121
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.130
when there's no way physically,
there's no way to turn

122
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.220
these things off. And so
when you move an application

123
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.990
to FORO by default, those
things will all disappear. If

124
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.430
you want to put them
back on, you can go

125
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.850
sit in weapon, figure, you
can go set rendering compatibility

126
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.610
mode to three, five, and
you'll get that legacy rendering.

127
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.580
Okay. So for the most
part, I won't mind that

128
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.370
if these little kind of
widgets, but in some obscure

129
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.490
case, I might be counting
on that weirdness. Exactly. I

130
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.160
expect some small, you know,
styling type, you know, effects

131
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.350
that people might have very
small breaking things. It wouldn't

132
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.560
be something huge where your
whole page snapped and skewed

133
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.690
sideways or something like that.
But I would, I could

134
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.240
see some, you know, some
little spacing issues and stuff

135
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.190
like that. Yeah. You just
put the skewed sideways flag

136
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.070
to false and everything is
great. Now I was talking

137
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.110
to a couple of people
for these channel nine videos

138
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.300
that I was doing. And
they were saying that you

139
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.060
actually went through a bunch
of really old controls, like

140
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.060
the wizard control. And when
I say really old, I

141
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.490
mean, I wasn't, I mean,
I didn't use them in

142
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.650
the last couple of years,
but some people will base

143
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.160
their whole system on like
the wizard control, but now

144
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.220
it, it can emit clean
markup. Yeah. There was, there

145
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.660
was two areas that I
think fundamentally got mighty confused

146
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.150
developer stays. We have in
the, when these, when these

147
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.510
controls came out, we actually
had these templates. So you

148
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.910
could actually, you know, templatize
a control, which sounds like

149
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.040
you're getting, I'm giving you
the power to fully templatize

150
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.200
your control. Right. But even
in those cases, you would

151
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.020
still find out that, well,
I did, I wrote my

152
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.300
own template, but ESPN, it
was kind enough to wrap

153
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.430
it into a table with
a Tiara and a TD.

154
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.280
Thank you, ASP that, and
I don't want that. So

155
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.310
we put in some flags
that turn that stuff off

156
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.290
so you can turn that
off. And then we took

157
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.380
some controls, the wizards, a
great control. And one of

158
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.110
the reasons we attack the
wizard is because of another

159
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.880
thing we did in four,
which is we have brand

160
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.700
new web form templates. And
these brand new web form

161
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.350
templates have a full in
Template. Just to be clear

162
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.840
if that's, when you say
file new project. Yes. I'm

163
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.330
talking about a project project
template. Okay. Yes. We added

164
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.630
project templates. Okay. And when
we go to the process

165
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.280
of adding these new project
templates, I want to support

166
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.500
things like users, being able
to log in. I want

167
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.920
people to create new accounts.
We put these in the

168
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.300
new web form templates, project
templates, because these features can

169
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.010
be complicated to turn on.
So we thought we turn

170
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.480
them on by default and
you can remove them if

171
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.960
you want. But another act
of part of, of, of

172
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.770
these new templates is we
want them to pass validation.

173
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.840
So if you, if you
go to the WTC and

174
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.760
try to validate your, your
website, we want these things

175
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.730
to pass. And so part
of the work that was

176
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.210
done on these controls was
explicitly because they are used

177
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.220
in these new templates and
we want them to validate

178
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.280
properly. So the new templates
will actually show all these

179
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.160
new flags and operation we'll
have the outer tables turned

180
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.250
off, we'll be using some
of the new templates that

181
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.290
allow you to template, template,
size, parts of these controls

182
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.050
that you can not have
templatize before. And so you'll

183
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.360
actually see quite a bit
of that CSS work in

184
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.800
these new templates. You see
the new menu control, you'll

185
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.070
see the create user wizard,
which is based on the

186
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.370
wizard. Yeah. And you're going
to see some login controls

187
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.430
and stuff like that that
are all utilizing this new,

188
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.710
these new features to, to
admit really cleaning up. And

189
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.330
it sounds like everybody had
a part in that. Like

190
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.640
I was talking to Phil
yesterday and he went off

191
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.880
and I think he doing
the menu control. So that

192
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.220
was not like one person
that was like every PM

193
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.890
took a piece to try
to bring it into the

194
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.790
present day. Exactly. It was
it's, you know, it's, once

195
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.620
again, it's a team thing
here. So everybody goes, you

196
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.440
know, I think sometimes the
outside people go, Oh, Phil

197
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.410
is the NBC guy. Right,
right. I'm not feels working

198
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.930
on web web forms. Controls
Phil works in web forums.

199
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.390
I mean, he worked on
data annotations. He's worked on

200
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.560
the menu control and various
other aspects of ASP net.

201
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.020
So in fact, comically enough,
Phil was one of the

202
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.970
guys that was actually responsible
for coming up with a

203
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.950
list of things that were
wrong with the controls. Well,

204
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.140
it feels pretty hardcore. He
likes his markup clean. He

205
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.010
does. And he probably wouldn't
be satisfied unless it was

206
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.690
fixed. So one of the
things that was really cool,

207
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.050
that that I saw was
that David Ebo showed me

208
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.750
a dotnet to app that
did things kind of the

209
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.890
older style way. It did
like, like, you know, old

210
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.000
style data access in inline
sequel spit it into a

211
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.800
data grid, but it was,
you know, it was the

212
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.250
way we wrote applications five
years ago. And then he

213
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.770
added dynamic data to it.
Now a lot of people

214
00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.240
have looked at dynamic data
and they think it's like,

215
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.730
Oh, look, free admin site.
And they thought of dynamic

216
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.010
data as being like a
pillar in the sense of

217
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.260
web forums and VC dynamic
data. But he just went

218
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.830
and said enabled dynamic data
on this grid view. And

219
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.900
then he didn't have to
add anything. He didn't go

220
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.580
in a web config. I
mean, he didn't add any

221
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.970
references. So it kind of
turned my perception of what

222
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.310
dynamic data is on its
head. So what's, what's going

223
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.170
on. Let me call that.
That makes me want to

224
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.000
call out a couple points.
Okay. So one of the

225
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.790
things you're going to see
and for O r.net for,

226
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.960
I should say the, Oh,
is not supposed to be

227
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.600
there. Just say that actually
that's funny, just.net for people.

228
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.760
So when you, when you,
when you see.net for one

229
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.790
of the things that we
did is we modified web

230
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.670
config. So if you do
an empty, empty, empty project,

231
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.050
you're going to see a
weapon figure. It's got about

232
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.810
10 lines of web config
now. And part of the

233
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.460
things that we didn't in
the process of doing that

234
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.690
is we took a lot
of the assemblies that we

235
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.940
think you might want by
default and move them into

236
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.840
root config. And so things
like dynamic data routing that

237
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.460
used to have to go
Ajax that used to go

238
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.770
and have to put in
web config, right? Or now

239
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.170
in your root config. And
the fact that we can

240
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.060
put them in root config,
then allows me to sit

241
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.740
there and say, Hey, I
want to go enable this

242
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.720
for any website. Now there's
this new switch called enabled

243
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.380
dynamic data. And let me
see, can I tell you

244
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.800
the story about how we
got there was, we were

245
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.380
sitting in a room with,
with Scott Guthrie one day, the

246
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.310
goo, and he asked a
question. He goes, Hey, so

247
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.650
you know, these, we've got
these rich data controls, like

248
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.320
reviews and details using stuff.
Did we ever fix these

249
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.090
things? So if I put
bad data in, they just

250
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.510
work. Cause it's, it's kinda
funny. We have these controls

251
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.810
and you know, they do
paging, they do editing do

252
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.660
inserting deleting. They do all
these common operations, but you,

253
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.340
you go in there and
put a bad value in

254
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.040
a cell press return and
you get the yellow screen

255
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.580
of death, right. Telling you
that I put string is

256
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.760
on the correct format exit.
Yeah. And we're like, you

257
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.470
know, that's one of the
things that dynamic data does.

258
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.930
And so what we did
is we added a new

259
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:54.580
switch called enabled dynamic data.
You use that on any

260
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.610
of the major controls, form
view details, you grid, view,

261
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.140
list, view, and just turn
it on. And by doing

262
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.560
that, you'll get automatic validation
for the types in your,

263
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.020
in your control. And it
means you could also use

264
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.820
all the annotations that we
have around validation. So if

265
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.790
you want to specify a
range, specify that something is

266
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.010
required, stuff like that, you
can go put those in

267
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.160
those annotations that we introduced
in three, five, <inaudible> on

268
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.610
your, on your stuff. And
they'll just automatically work. Yeah.

269
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.920
And this was really interesting
because he did this with

270
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.140
data that wasn't really object
oriented and he didn't have

271
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.980
like an object for a
product. He just had basically

272
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.250
straight sequel old school style
into a grid, but it

273
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.140
worked right. He had a
system that worked, he didn't

274
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.180
want to break it. He
didn't want to convert it.

275
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.960
He just wanted to augment.
Yeah, That, that was, that

276
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.360
was some feedback we took
after three, five S P

277
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.970
one was we didn't get
exactly that as much a

278
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.770
use of dynamic data that
we thought we thought our

279
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.260
customers would actually be using
it more than, than they're

280
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.880
using it today. And I
think part of the reason

281
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.980
that is because if you
want to use dynamic data,

282
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.990
you had to start with
a brand new project templates.

283
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.320
And then you had to
be using LinkedIn SQL or

284
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.570
indeed your framework. We only
supported those two models because

285
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.750
those, those, those are worms
and dynamic data wanted a

286
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.990
full object model. And so
when we started looking at

287
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.110
a dinette four, we're like,
how can we enable dynamic

288
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.020
data for everybody? So I
can just take my existing

289
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.020
three, five app or my
two application at one line

290
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.330
of code one line of
code and get the benefits

291
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.280
of dynamic data. So I
no longer have to have

292
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.470
a dynamic data directory. I
no longer have to have

293
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.120
an object model, be it
linked to SQL or any

294
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.640
framework I could just, I
could be binding directly to

295
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.340
an array of, of items,
or it could be something

296
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.010
from a SQL data source,
pretty much it doesn't care.

297
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.500
And so that, that was
one of our goals was

298
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.390
basically to be able to
say, Hey, let's make an

299
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.000
existing application better and not
have, have them have to

300
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.270
go through any hoops at
all. Hey everybody, this is

301
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.940
Scott coming at you from
another place in time. No

302
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.460
doubt. You'll probably bump into
testing tasks now, and then,

303
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.220
and your work and, you
know, writing functional tests is

304
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.200
probably not your favorite thing.
It's kind of difficult. It

305
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.050
takes time and the results
can be dubious. Well, get

306
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.870
ready to start liking tests.
Thanks to Tellerik with the,

307
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.890
the new webinar testing framework.
Building web automation test is

308
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.760
a breeze. You've got code
automation with advanced asp.net Ajax

309
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.950
and several light applications. You
can write a single test,

310
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.910
have it executed against multiple
browsers at once. You'd benefit

311
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.940
from a rich API there's
link support integration with visual

312
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.300
studio unit testing, also in
unit X unit and NBA

313
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.540
unit, not to mention the
free rappers for Telerik rad

314
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.810
controls for ESPN and Ajax,
and several light, all shipping

315
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.230
with Telerik's new testing tool.
One of the best features,

316
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.930
the web testing framework, which
is developed by art of

317
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.310
test is it's absolutely free.
Freddie got hooked on web

318
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.850
testing framework, start using it
right away, go to tellerik.com

319
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.640
for more info. Thanks a
lot, you know, and that

320
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.740
actually brings me to another
point that I've I've long

321
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.760
complained in presentations about the
file. New project dialogue always

322
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.740
has sense of like, all
right, pick your vocation. How

323
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.180
are you going to do
this? Right? And once you

324
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.630
hit, okay, you've made your
decision, right. File new project,

325
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.810
web forms, app, or file
new project dynamic data app.

326
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.640
It's like, okay, well you've
just headed in that direction

327
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.430
and you can never go
back. But now you can

328
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.760
turn on NBC dynamic data
at web forms in the

329
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.560
same app, which kind of
got me thinking about it.

330
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.150
It's more about asp.net. Like
there's like, I'm going to

331
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:23.330
sound cheesy marketing, like, but
it's like dutton@fourhasgotagreateremphasisonasp.net itself. And

332
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.900
not these kinds of sub
systems, I guess, is the

333
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.710
lack of better word. First
off. I think you bring

334
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.140
up a great point. I
think we, we still fail

335
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.960
on, on that file. New
project. It should be a

336
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.290
checkbox. Exactly. That was something
we wanted to address in

337
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.770
and, and vs 2010 and
did not get around to

338
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.840
doing it. We'd love to
be able to say that

339
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.830
you just say, Hey, I
want to start a new

340
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:48.040
website. And then you get
a, a dialogue box that

341
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.790
says here enable the features
that you wish Ideo.net data

342
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.440
services and a little of
this little, I want to

343
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.380
cafeteria. Exactly. I mean, it
should be, and you should

344
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.940
be able to bring that
up after the fact. So,

345
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.820
you know, just because I
didn't know, I wanted NBC

346
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.620
when I first started, I
can later on go, Hey,

347
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.470
I want to VC and
turn that on. You've heard

348
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.870
us saying this. We know,
Oh, we actually have a

349
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.620
feature that we were prototyping
called a, I think it

350
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.520
was called web enablement, web
enablement. Yes. Something crazy like

351
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.130
that where, but basically the
idea is basically what you're

352
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.600
saying. You know, I would
get a bunch of check

353
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.820
boxes and I could launch
it multiple times. And so

354
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.920
I don't, as you said,
it feels draconian. Now you

355
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.410
make this decision and then
if you want to start

356
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.880
off, you know, if you
want to change your decision,

357
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.270
start over. Sorry. Yeah. And,
and, and, you know, even

358
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.770
now you, you have to,
if you want to get

359
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.900
that dynamic data folder, where
does it come from? Right.

360
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.510
You have to bring it
in from another project. You

361
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.480
know, anytime a developer has
to hit beyond compare or

362
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.910
window to figure out what's
going on. It kind of,

363
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.060
it's a problem, but now
you can have an application

364
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.130
that is all of those
things. It's like an NBC

365
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.500
app. And it's an, it's
a dynamic data app and

366
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.880
a web forms yet kind
of all at the same

367
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.060
time. Yeah. Do you see
like more people doing hybrids?

368
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.980
Cause I get email, you
probably do too a couple

369
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.340
of times a week where
someone says, you know, please,

370
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.920
mr. Hanselman, we're about to
start a new project. Should

371
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.580
we use MVC or web
forums? And I said, I

372
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.280
cannot answer that question. I
need to know about the

373
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.960
kinds of data that you're
going to be doing. The

374
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.110
kinds of interactions, how important
is testability? I mean, there's,

375
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.940
you know, you know, the
whole list, the standard list,

376
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.250
what percentage of people do
you think would be using

377
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.710
hybrids? I think it is
increasing. I can see it.

378
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.290
It's interesting that you bring
that point up because I

379
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.380
actually just three or four
days ago actually had had

380
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.330
a customer come to me
with that exact question. They'd

381
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.000
actually built an MVC application
and they put a dynamic

382
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.360
data backend on it for
their administration. And you know,

383
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.100
we're asking, is this a
valid way to build equity?

384
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.020
I've done that. Actually. It's
funny that you mentioned that

385
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.300
I did a project with
a friend of mine where

386
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.700
the whole backend was dynamic
data, web forums and the

387
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.040
whole front end was NBC
just because it was faster.

388
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.170
But then I realized if
I looked at some of

389
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.260
the stuff in NBC two
and done some of the

390
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.070
cogeneration, I could have potentially
generated the backend. And then

391
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.080
I got a little paralyzed
because there's so many different

392
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.610
options on the way I
could have, I could have

393
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.390
achieved the same goal with
a number of different technologies.

394
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.580
I had to decide whether
or not it was speed

395
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.900
of initial implementation versus potentially
how hard it was to

396
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.950
maintain it. It's hard to
make these decisions. Yeah. That's

397
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.110
and I'd actually argue that
something where we're not the

398
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.710
best at actually describing to
our customers, what technology choice

399
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.300
should you make at the
right times? I mean, that's

400
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.860
something that I think we
still need to get better

401
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.680
at is when should I
choose linked to sequel or

402
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.190
NG framework versus writing my
SQL myself? When should I

403
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.100
choose NBC over web forms?
Or should I just put

404
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.140
them both in the same
project? I mean, there's all

405
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.300
these questions and, and you
know, I hope in the

406
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.140
future, we can get better
at providing guidance on the

407
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.020
path you go down. But
as you said, that, that,

408
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.050
that works great. You can
put all these things together

409
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.240
in the same project and
things will work perfect together.

410
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.940
So yeah, No, I reckon
you're bringing stuff in though

411
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.540
from like, like jQuery ship
with NBC, but I noticed,

412
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.640
and maybe I shouldn't say
this, but I was peeking

413
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.170
over your shoulder when you
went, found a new project

414
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.870
on a, an early build
here. And I saw J

415
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.470
query inside of web forms,
project you and file new

416
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.940
project and J Craig and
that, cause I guess we're

417
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.820
shipping it anyway. Yeah. We
w why don't we give

418
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.890
the love to web forums
as well? Yeah. That's one

419
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.210
of the things that, you
know, you mentioned earlier that

420
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.450
it looks like we have
these like pillars of technologies,

421
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.570
like NBC or dynamic data
or web forms. And one

422
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.430
of the things that I
like to say, we try

423
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.840
not to be pillared. It
might look that way just

424
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.420
because of the way we
release things. You know, MVC

425
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.600
was releases an add band
release, dynamic data was part

426
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.630
of a service pack, right?
So it kind of holds

427
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.440
our hands on how we're
allowed to build a framework,

428
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.750
but, you know, dot net
for comes down the path.

429
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.090
And then suddenly we can
take routing that used to

430
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.760
be this thing that kind
of NBC had put it

431
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.890
directly in the framework, give
full support to it for

432
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.810
web forms as well. So
now you can use routing

433
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.590
against all those things, right?
We've taken the ideas, dynamic

434
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.620
data, brought this notion of
having attributes from data annotations

435
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.870
that you could put on
your object model. And we

436
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.300
would do validation. Well, NBC
two is coming down the

437
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.460
pipe and wow. It takes
advantage of this, these same

438
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.100
things as well. So you're,
we're trying to blur things

439
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.140
together and make it feel
like more of we're building

440
00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.870
a platform than we are
building pillars of stuff. So

441
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.770
the idea is ASP net
enables you to do dynamic

442
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.620
data type things, whether you're
using NBC, you're using web

443
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.240
forms and there's some other
work going on where you

444
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.420
can actually use these same
mechanisms inside of Silverlight as

445
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.240
well. So it's not about
really. Yeah. Yeah. It's not

446
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.170
about a particular technology. It's
it's about being consistent. Well,

447
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.820
so there's a whole class
of people out there that

448
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.920
maybe want to do things
a little differently. They maybe

449
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.290
want more classic ASP style.
Like what kind of stuff

450
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.020
could, could, could, could I
offer a classic ASP person

451
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.620
moving forward? Yeah. So, you
know, if you look beyond.net

452
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.960
for you look beyond visual
studio, 2010, you might ask,

453
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.420
you know, what, what is
the ASP net team thinking?

454
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.240
You know, we think that
we've got a really cool

455
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.160
platform in VC for the
pattern developer that wants full

456
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.150
control of markup of concerns.
You know, MVC is a

457
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.700
great solution for that. If
you're an enterprise guy and

458
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.180
you're building applications quickly, we've
got a great, great solution

459
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.360
with web forms for that.
But one of the areas

460
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.670
that I think we've kind
of left behind and we

461
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.220
need to look at it
again, is, Hey, I'm, I'm

462
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.510
just a simple guy and
I want to throw a

463
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:08.200
website together really quickly. I
know HTML really well, you

464
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.870
know, but I don't know
a bunch about controls and

465
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.180
I don't know about separation
of concerns and stuff like

466
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.180
that. How do I get,
Yeah, I know I four

467
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.130
loops and I know my,
if statements and I just,

468
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.320
I know HTML great. I'd
just like to get to

469
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.510
the site and maybe talk
to a database, you know,

470
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.160
for my little league or
something. Exactly. So I, I

471
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.740
would say one of the,
one of the pillars that

472
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.160
we're focusing on moving forward
is simplicity. Okay. And this

473
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.980
is saying, you know, Hey,
I just want to grab

474
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.590
an app, drop it into
directory and have it work.

475
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.270
You know, I don't want
to have a configuration file.

476
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.070
I don't want to, and
you know, I don't know

477
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.130
what page directives are. I
don't know what a code

478
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.290
behind is. I, when I,
when I first look at

479
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.380
one of these ASP files
and I see, you know,

480
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.740
public partial class, I'm like,
what is all that stuff

481
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.020
I don't even want to
compile? Exactly. I mean, you

482
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.640
know, I'm sure you did
this. I know I did

483
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.370
it, you know, years ago
is, was classic ASP. So

484
00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.900
I'm not saying we're going
to go back to classic

485
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.600
ASP, but we are looking
at how we can provide

486
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:07.230
a simpler developer experience for
That's. Cool. So that's something

487
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.230
that potentially you're thinking about
going, going forward beyond, beyond

488
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.620
that for us or anything
else done it for you

489
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.420
didn't get in that you
wish you did, but you're

490
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.570
gonna come back to there's.
There's always stuff in Dutton

491
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.420
for that we wish we
got in and didn't get

492
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.370
back to him. I'm sure
there is. There's a backlog

493
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.950
that goes on forever. I'm
sure we can't talk too

494
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.840
much about, but what about,
is there a new respect

495
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.280
for web forms? Cause you
know, a lot of the

496
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.250
people are saying that maybe
the asp.net teams moved on

497
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.820
and it's all about MVC.
Now we talked about the

498
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.310
better markup and stuff like
that for, for web forms,

499
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.850
developers, but I mean, development
is continuing in earnest, right?

500
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.280
Yeah. I mean, I'm, you
really see this? I mean,

501
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.990
we have a white paper
up on the ESPN site.

502
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.360
If you just, if you
just being, you know, what's

503
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.300
new and.net for, it'll take
you to a white paper,

504
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.470
that'll show you a lot
of the things we're doing

505
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.630
in <inaudible>. And I think
it'll show that we did

506
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.900
a lot of work for
web forums addressing the common

507
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.820
customer complaints and web forms.
That's it? That is something

508
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.870
we always look at is
common customer pain points. We

509
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.180
got some stuff in, you
know, you'll see some stuff

510
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.710
in the future. And as
I said, you know, one

511
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.660
of the, one of the
things that you noticed yourself

512
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.910
was that you saw our
technology is kind of sliding

513
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.250
across all these different areas.
So it's not, not just

514
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.740
focusing on one particular area.
So I think what you're

515
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.820
going to see in the
future is you're going to

516
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.140
see us building, you know,
maybe helpers that, but there'll

517
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.600
be technology agnostic. You know,
you'll use the same helper,

518
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.910
whether you're in web forms,
whether you're an NBC, whether

519
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.130
you're an Ajax. Yeah. Well,
that's a really good example.

520
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.810
So like the Ajax stuff,
I was talking to Steven

521
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.940
Walther and he was showing
me some Ajax that was

522
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.680
going on with the a,
I guess they just released

523
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.070
preview 66. And I was
like, Oh, this is pretty

524
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.320
cool. And I was like,
yeah, but I am not

525
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.560
really into the whole ESPN
Ajax thing. And he says,

526
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.450
Oh no, but this is,
this is all JavaScript. It's

527
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.630
a client side library. Exactly.
That. And it just kind

528
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:51.770
of, it's like, wait a
second. Well, what about the

529
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.380
whole Ajax Microsoft thing? It's
like, well, no, but look

530
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.830
how I can make an,
a Microsoft Ajax control using

531
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.770
jQuery to do it. And
that was really kind of

532
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.530
cool to see the J
query syntax to create a

533
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.400
Microsoft Ajax control, toolkit control.
I don't know. I know

534
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.640
that the whole Microsoft openness
things creeping me out. Can

535
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.280
we be more closed please?
Because it's making me uncomfortable.

536
00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.160
I think you're going to
see as a kid more

537
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.080
open, but, but you bring
up a good point. I

538
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.850
think, you know, if somebody
does go to go to

539
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.940
COVID Plex and downloads that
Ajax preview you'll find that

540
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.220
most of the samples in
there aren't, aren't ESPN, the

541
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.950
samples <inaudible> files, there's nothing,
you know, restricting you to

542
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.380
use asp.net to use those
things. And so one of

543
00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.690
the things that I think
that, you know, we've also

544
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.760
heard, heard from our customers
is, you know, we've got

545
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.070
this great Ajax control tool
kit out there, but when

546
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.250
you, when you hear the
word Ajax control toolkit, that

547
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.380
brings the notion of, Oh,
I can't use that because

548
00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.620
I'm not using controls, I'm
using HTM files or I'm

549
00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.130
using MVC. And the reality
is all that stuff is

550
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.420
actually usable from these other
technologies. We just haven't. And

551
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.390
that's where we kind of
bring the whole discussion forward

552
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.570
is that prescriptive guidance explaining
to people how to do

553
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:05.980
things, how it fits together.
I feel like, and I've

554
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.630
said this to people privately,
and I guess I'll say

555
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.000
it publicly in the podcast
that we're kind of starting

556
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.370
to get our technology thing
under control here. We're starting

557
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.010
to think. I was saying
that actually in Mexico last

558
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.860
week I was talking to
a large, a large soda

559
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.400
pop bottling company. And I
said that Microsoft with, with

560
00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.980
2008 and even more with
2010 is starting to get

561
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.390
the Lego pieces, the right
size. Right. Not too big,

562
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.300
not too small. Right. You
know, you've got technologies that

563
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.110
finally work together cleanly. And,
and with, with like, like

564
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.500
a story at ado, tenet
data services, talking into MSA

565
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.670
jacks and binding into, you
know, working with NBC all

566
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.400
kind of white box technologies.
You know what I'm saying?

567
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.770
There's nothing hidden. There's no
magic. It's not like, you

568
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.850
know, drag, drag a grid
over and then poof Northwind

569
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.770
database. And then we walk
off the stage and drop

570
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:57.700
the mic. It's more a
that we're giving people a

571
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.150
collection of Legos that are
appropriately sized using open technologies

572
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.650
without any secrets behind it.
And that's like, now I

573
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.060
can start. I can build
a little, this, a little

574
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.610
of that. And it's freaking
people out because they want,

575
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.420
And there's more coming. I
mean, that's, that's exactly what

576
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.220
the program or we expect
in the future is, Hey,

577
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.680
I know HTML and I
want to use some coding

578
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.930
in it. I don't want
to have a, I don't

579
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:21.580
want to put something on
my page and go, what

580
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.910
does it do? Why does
it do it right? What's

581
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.560
this opaque blob here. Or
as you said, the worst

582
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.230
case is the, the demo
where, where, Hey, I've got,

583
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.300
I've got this demo. It's
like, God, I drag this

584
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.580
thing here. I wire this
thing to it. I walk

585
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.080
off the stage and then
you go, I want to

586
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.230
customize it. Good luck. Okay.
That's great. Can I sort

587
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:43.500
those calls? No, sorry. Yeah,
totally. Well, cool. Well, I

588
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.630
really appreciate You sitting down
with me today and having

589
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.520
a chat about ESPN at
four and hopefully we'll see

590
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.430
a beta too soon. Yeah.
Thank you very much. This

591
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.130
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes. See you again

592
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:53.520
next week.
