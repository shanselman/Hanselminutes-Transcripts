online at www dot <inaudible>

10
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.680
Scott and Carl discussed the
connection gaming. Hi, this is

11
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.160
Carl Franklin. You're listening to Hansel
minutes. I'm here with Scott

12
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.650
Hanselman. This week's topic. Scott
is next generation gaming. That's

13
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.050
right. You're not a gamer.
Are you Carl? You know,

14
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.020
no, I'm not a hardcore
gamer. I mean, I've seen

15
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.090
in played a few games
that I've liked and they

16
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.670
were a nice diversion for
awhile, but I have like

17
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.850
an addictive personality when it
comes to technology and things

18
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.910
that I like. So I
have to try very hard

19
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.960
to not get sucked in.
And you know, I'm sucked

20
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.110
into code. I'm sucked into
music and production and development,

21
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.410
and those are, you know,
that consumes enough of my

22
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.770
time and money and energy.
If I got into gaming,

23
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.990
I think I'd be a
freak. One of the things

24
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.020
about gaming in general and
the personality types of people

25
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.570
who will play 50 hours
or a hundred hours of

26
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.580
some, you know, RPG, some
role playing game is that

27
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.040
you kind of forget that
you're playing against another bunch

28
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.470
of programmers. For me, it's
like when I started playing

29
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.480
a game about a level
or two into it, I

30
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.610
go, wait a second. Am
I playing a game or

31
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.730
my fighting with another program
or mentally, you know, once

32
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.590
I figured out how the
programmer thinks, then I go

33
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.910
and say, all right, well
screw it. I'm not going

34
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.500
to go to level 80
just to see that I

35
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.510
am proved that I'm a
badass, but which brings us

36
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.800
to now the topic of
the day, which is this

37
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.400
notion of next generation gaming,
right? We had the PlayStation,

38
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.500
the regular X-Box and they
had a good run and

39
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.600
a lot of really cool
stuff was done with the

40
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.380
PlayStation two with the original
Xbox and to the limited

41
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.170
extent with the GameCube, although
that was to a different

42
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.860
audience. And now suddenly kind
of all at once, although

43
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.230
the Xbox three 60 has
been out for awhile now

44
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.560
you've got a Christmas holiday
season. That's coming up here

45
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.120
with the Xbox three 60
in easy availability by one,

46
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.590
anywhere in there about 300
bucks. And you got PS

47
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.990
three, where you'd actually have
to give a kidney to

48
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.700
get a cop to get
one of these. And they're

49
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.780
about 600 bucks, 600 bucks,
two versions. There's a 20

50
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.780
gig hard drive version. I
think there's a 60 gig,

51
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.200
two 60 and 80, but
you're looking at 600 bucks.

52
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.930
And then there's this weird
little thing from Nintendo called

53
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.560
the we, the Nintendo, we,
the WWI. And I've been

54
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.240
talking to some different guys
at work. Cause a lot

55
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.230
of programmers are also gamers
kind of at night about

56
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.300
what does it mean to
be a next generation game?

57
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.460
And most times people will
say, well, you know, you've

58
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.560
got to have high Def,
right? And we did a

59
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.950
high Def talk, Hey Scott,
let's get back to that

60
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.540
week for one sec. Before
you jump into that, my,

61
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.350
my kids have the Nintendo
DS, you know, the whole

62
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.860
Nintendo dogs was the thing
that sold them on that.

63
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.940
And the little portable one.
And I had a little

64
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.710
bit of a history with
them cause we did some

65
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.640
podcasts for Nintendo on the,
on the DS. But what

66
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.100
a w what's the diff
between that and the week?

67
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.420
Well, the, the, we is
really interesting. Everyone was laughing

68
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.040
about the name. They're saying
this is going to be

69
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.370
stupid. It only does four
80 P. So it doesn't

70
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.320
do high definition, but just
as they aimed at a

71
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.830
totally different market with the
game cube, the we is,

72
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.880
is just flat out fun
to play. The deal is

73
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.490
that the, we is a
tiny little thing. It's actually

74
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.110
smaller in size than the
Xbox three 60 add on

75
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.480
DVD player and an idea
of how small it's about

76
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.120
the size of a four
of a five by a

77
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.960
five and a quarter inch
internal drive for your, for

78
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.990
your desktop. Very small, just
like the game cube is

79
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.460
just so tiny. The deal
is it has a ethernet.

80
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.170
So it'll hook up to
the net all the time

81
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.020
and we'll let you download
any Nintendo game ever going

82
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.730
back in time. So you're
talking about Nintendo 64 Nintendo,

83
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.380
you know, it's NES super
Nintendo. You wanna play Mario

84
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.840
brothers, you wanna play whatever.
You'll be able to download

85
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.900
those off of the, off
the net. But the really

86
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.540
amazing thing about the we
that I think is, is

87
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.310
gonna surprise a lot of
people that they're going to

88
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.560
have to actually touch it
and try it is this

89
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.830
controller. It's got it. Doesn't
have a standard kind of

90
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.440
holding your hand controller. If
you want one of those,

91
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.180
you have to buy it
separately. It's called the wi

92
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.140
classic controller. It comes with
two remote controls. You hold

93
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.360
them in your hands, like,
like literally like a remote

94
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.300
control, a tiny remote control.
And if you want to

95
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.080
have Zelda us, you know,
the little elephant Zelda swipe

96
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.910
a sword, you told the
remote and you slash in,

97
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.100
in the air. If you
want to play tennis or

98
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.210
baseball or bowling, you just
make the motion natural. So

99
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.130
it's got gyroscopes. And then
is that how it works?

100
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.360
Yeah, it's got, it's got,
you know, six axes of

101
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.450
motion detection. Nice, totally, Totally
revolutionary kind of thing. Now

102
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.410
there's been lots of motion
detection devices in the, there

103
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.880
was the, all the gyroscopic
controllers that we saw, the,

104
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.220
the gyro, what is it
called? The gyro remote that

105
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.140
you can point it in
windows, media center and control

106
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.080
the mouse. But this is
basically saying we're going to

107
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.680
rethink how games ought to
be played. I went in,

108
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.630
went in, played with one
for awhile and they had

109
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.400
a car driving game and
I was like, well, how

110
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.080
are they going to adapt
this to a car driving

111
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.690
game? Well, you, you take
the remote control and you

112
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.230
hold it in your hand
lengthwise with one end in

113
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.210
each part of your hand
and you just rotate your

114
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.600
hands left and right. Like
you're holding around a steering

115
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.100
wheel and you drive. And
it really, really works. It's

116
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.910
and it's 250 bucks. That's
crazy. So for the price

117
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.020
of a single PlayStation, you
could buy a we and

118
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.280
an Xbox three 60. So
they're pricing it at the

119
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.670
kind of, Oh, that's fun.
Right? Let's just pick one

120
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.590
up. I mean, like I'm
thinking about getting one and

121
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.650
I'm not even in Tinto
person, right. It's, it's a

122
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.430
really, really clever thing. Scott,
let's get back to the

123
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.600
whole idea of what next
gen gaming is. Yeah. So

124
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.120
people usually say that next
gen gaming means high Def

125
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.530
and 5.1 surround. And they're
always arguing about, well, do

126
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.680
you want a 10 ATI
or 10 80 P right.

127
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.320
Do you want your high
definition to be interlaced at

128
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.160
10 80 horizontal lines are
progressive. Now that's the big

129
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.410
kind of argument right now.
Everyone says the true high

130
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:26.090
definition, which has kind of
an arguable point is 10

131
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.420
80 P because that's simply
the highest and best quality,

132
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.500
but very, very few high
Def TVs actually do that

133
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.480
now more and more they
do. So, you know, in

134
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.370
a year or two, they'll
all be like that. But

135
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.160
nearly all the content is
at the sweet spot, which

136
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.850
is seven 20. And if
you do the math, you

137
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.150
have to actually sit about
four feet away from a

138
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.650
10 80 P screen. If
that screen is about 42

139
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.160
inches, which is kind of
the standard size, right? If

140
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.950
the stand sit four feet
away to really notice the

141
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.350
difference. So if you're sitting
on your couch, 10 feet

142
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.080
away in a standard 42
inch screen, there's really no

143
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.190
way with normal eyesight. You
can tell the difference. So

144
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.430
the whole, the whole graphics
resolution argument breaks down real

145
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.390
quickly. There's the, the quality
of the 3d, like how

146
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.570
many, how strong the graphics
card is. And they say

147
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.120
that the Xbox three 60
and the PS three are,

148
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.890
are pretty darn close. I've
looked at the, the games

149
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.160
close up myself and they
look real similar. You know,

150
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.260
I, I saw what they
call a second generation game

151
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.630
on an Xbox. It looks
darn a lot like a

152
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.770
PS three game. They're saying
that at the math level,

153
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.350
that PS three is slightly
stronger. It's a, you know,

154
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.410
it's a newer machine, some
more powerful machine. It's got

155
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.740
more chutzpah than the Xbox
three 60, but the Xbox

156
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.440
three 60 has two years
of people learning how to

157
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.480
program to it behind it.
So it's kind of a

158
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.020
balance. So they'll always be
that religious VB versus C-sharp

159
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.940
kind of argument. You know,
they're both really awesome things,

160
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.300
you know, pick the one
that makes you happy. I

161
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.950
do think that 600 bucks
is a heck of a

162
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.280
lot of money to spend
on something regardless. So I

163
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.400
would mean I'm an Xbox
three 60 guy myself. Additionally,

164
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.910
the Xbox three 60 has
just recently announced. And I

165
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.520
guess it's coming out in
about, well, actually it should

166
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.470
be out by the time
this podcast goes live. We're

167
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.850
doing this on a Monday.
We'll go live on Wednesday,

168
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.180
the 23rd. So on the
22nd, they're going to allow

169
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.190
downloads from an Xbox of
television shows and movies in

170
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.800
high death. Why is this
hot? So when you say

171
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.800
they're going to allow who's
they, so Microsoft is going

172
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.190
to change the live marketplace,
which is the online site

173
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.050
that you log into when
you turn on your Xbox.

174
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.140
So, you know, Carl Franklin missed
last this week, you could

175
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.780
serve, go up to iTunes
and pick it up, or

176
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.910
you can just log into
your X-Box and pay a

177
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.640
buck or two and download
it in full high Def

178
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.930
nice. Now it's not meant
to be burned or shared,

179
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.650
but it's meant to be
watched. So you might theoretically

180
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:01.130
download a movie rather than
going to blockbuster. And you'd

181
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.460
see that movie in high
definition. So that's, that's pretty

182
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.880
powerful. It will be highly
compressed, but arguably a you'd

183
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.100
rather watch a compressed movie
at seven 20 P than

184
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.990
a compressed movie on a
DVD at four ADP. So

185
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.080
that's pretty powerful thing. So
while they're launching the PS

186
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.260
three and the, we they're
really aiming at different people.

187
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.380
I think that the PS
three is aimed at PlayStation

188
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.920
fans. The PSD is backward
compatible. So they're saying it'll

189
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.250
play any PlayStation game ever
made. I think the way

190
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.260
that they're doing that is
very different than the Xbox

191
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.300
cause the Xbox allows most
games about 250 Xbox games

192
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.370
to be played, but it's
all done with emulation, which

193
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.310
is very clever. The PS,
the excuse me, the Xbox

194
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.910
three 60 uses a totally
different processor, totally different architecture,

195
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.270
totally different graphics card. And
they have a software emulation

196
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.240
layer, but you can play
250 of the most popular

197
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.180
X-Box games on the <inaudible>
side. I understand that they've

198
00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.070
actually just included a PS
to inside the thing. So

199
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.600
they've actually got that whole
hardware duplicated, but by doing

200
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.550
that, they're allowing you to
do whatever the heck you

201
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.430
want and live and play
any PlayStation game ever. So

202
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.950
it was pretty cool on
compatibility. Let's just shove the

203
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.430
old box in the new
box we got, because remember

204
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.540
the PlayStation two came out
with a big version and

205
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.400
then a slimmer version. This
is the thing that Sony

206
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.560
does. They'll come up with
the next version. When the,

207
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.220
when the manufacturing process becomes
cheap enough to make it

208
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.770
small. And you know, the
PlayStation was out for awhile

209
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.810
and then the PS one
came out and it was

210
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.780
about the size of a
CD because it became really

211
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.210
cheap. Right now you can
go and buy an Atari

212
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.390
2,600 for like 25 bucks.
Right. And if you open

213
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.280
it up, it's the size
of a cell phone, the

214
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.100
rest of it's just air,
right? It's an entire game

215
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.410
system on a chip. So,
you know, cool idea for

216
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.090
them. So the PlayStation's for
the absolute hardcore wants the

217
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.820
10 ADP highest quality don't
mind spending six bucks. The,

218
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.190
we, I I'm thinking about
getting one, just cause the

219
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.930
wife saw it and said,
well, this is going to

220
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.960
be fun. We could play
tennis together in this interactive

221
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.480
way. Cause she doesn't like
the controller. But when we

222
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.090
got the car driving controller
for the Xbox, it made

223
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.260
sense. So I think a
lot of casual gamers and,

224
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.170
and some women who have
not really been attracted to

225
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.200
gaming might find the way
to be really attractive playing

226
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.030
bowling on it as a
blast. I mean, you're literally

227
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.030
just moving your arm, like
you would be bowling and

228
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.770
it happens on screen. So
it's, it's a real kick.

229
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.840
And I think that it
could allow a lot of

230
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.540
party games, a lot of
casual games with family and

231
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.260
younger members to all be
involved when a Quaker first

232
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.900
person shooter really isn't friendly.
So I think the, we

233
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.450
is going to succeed when
people poo-pooed it. But the

234
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.970
really cool thing I think
is happening on the Xbox

235
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.520
side, not to sound too
much like an Xbox fan

236
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.880
boy is not just the
idea of reinventing this live

237
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.290
platform and they reinvented it
by including arcade downloads. So

238
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.990
if you have an Xbox,
you can download Frogger Pac-Man

239
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.410
Streetfighter. So they built in
an emulator and brought that

240
00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.400
software simulator down when you
buy these games, not just

241
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.400
the adding of the television
and movie downloads, but this

242
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.920
X and a framework that
I know you're interested in.

243
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.540
Yeah. And this gets us
to, you know, w what's

244
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.860
the story for developers before
we get into <inaudible> developing

245
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.580
games used to be like,
you know, you know, it

246
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.830
was the sort of the
dream job of the, of

247
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.270
the hacker slacker, right? The
hacker used to be motivated

248
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.040
by the fact that, well,
if I can just break

249
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.370
into enough systems, you know,
somebody will hire me eventually

250
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.710
to keep the, you know,
the, the nasties out exactly

251
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.430
as a resume. And I
think the same thing is

252
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.200
going on with gamers. Like
if I just play enough

253
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.650
halo and I can understand
the mind of the programmer,

254
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.080
then I can learn how
to program games and then

255
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.730
get a glorious job somewhere
working for electronic arts or

256
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.810
something like that. It, the
counter strike dream. Right. Right.

257
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.470
When, when, when half-life one
came out, it included an

258
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.830
SDK, which was a really
revolutionary idea, like here's our

259
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.720
game. And here's a way
to make your own using

260
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.600
our engine. And a bunch
of kids in college wrote

261
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.570
Counterstrike. And it became the
most played game on the

262
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.700
internet for a number of
years and still is really

263
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.490
up there. And it was
written as a mod and

264
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.500
then it became a whole
world and these guys became

265
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.470
game designers. So what I
think is cool about X

266
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.070
and a, which is a,
the Microsoft framework and game

267
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:24.750
studio based on express is
that by Christmas time, what

268
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.600
you'll do is you'll, you'll
spend 99 bucks, it's a

269
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.590
yearly subscription and you'll become
part of the, this X

270
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.570
and a club that will
let you publish your games

271
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.260
that you wrote in C-sharp
up to a community site.

272
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.820
And people who have paid
this money, this, this $99

273
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.820
kind of initiation fee will
be able to download your

274
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.440
games as well. And so,
yeah, it's pretty sweet. So

275
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.490
X and a is this
is framework. It's a direct

276
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.740
X based kind of framework,
but it's a, it's a

277
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.280
managed library or series of
libraries. That's kind of based

278
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.810
on direct X that is
really, really focused at making

279
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.780
games. So it's almost like
someone said, we need a

280
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.090
base class library, like the
dominant base class library, but

281
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.860
we want it to be
focused on nothing but games,

282
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.480
controller management, just abstracting, all
that stuff away, taking all

283
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.080
the direct X APIs and
making it simpler while managed

284
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.390
direct X, or I think
they used to call it

285
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.570
MDX was really just managed
API on top of direct

286
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:31.460
X. So you could look@itasalmostliketheway.net
three O is just trying

287
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.360
to abstract the fundamental business
problems that business people have.

288
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.440
XMA is abstracting away. The
fundamental problems that gamers game

289
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.930
developers have a way and
giving them on kind of

290
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.580
all that managed stuff. So
it's basically based on the

291
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.270
development environment is based on
express like visuals, visual, sharp

292
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.470
express. So you get a
visual studio like environment. And

293
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.590
then there's also a thing
called the content pipeline, which

294
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.110
is the creation of 3d
content. It makes it easier

295
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.740
to manage all of your
assets when gamers are creating

296
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.830
textures and sprites and, and
three D models. Those are

297
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.470
called assets. So there's a
content pipeline, cause you might

298
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.310
have a developer who's making
the game engine while there's

299
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.650
a content or asset maker.
Who's going to be the

300
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.560
artist creating all the content.
So the management of that

301
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.630
kind of stuff. So You'll
pay this money and it'll

302
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.760
let you write games based
on the X and a

303
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.030
framework. And the, the runtime
is going to be free

304
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.000
and to develop, it'll be
a hundred bucks a year,

305
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.460
but eventually you'll be able
to publish this stuff out.

306
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.490
And then it has a
cross compiler. So basically it's

307
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.480
got a custom version of
the dotnet runtime for the

308
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.000
Xbox three 60. So that'd
be a platform that you

309
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.290
will compile to. And then
you'll compile to Vista as

310
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.310
well. Although right now the
development environment only works on

311
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.940
XP service pack two. So
theoretically anyone with XP service

312
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.560
back to Vista, basically windows
or X-Box will be able

313
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.540
to play one of these
games. And this is a

314
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.410
really interesting move from Microsoft
because I was at target

315
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.540
a couple of days ago
and I saw a game

316
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.790
that looked like it was
a game for a console,

317
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.240
right? It had the DVD
case, the standard size, the

318
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.750
standard, a banner across the
top. And I picked it

319
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.870
up thinking it was an
Xbox game. It said games

320
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.710
for windows. So is a
Branding and a re a

321
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:29.440
restyling of gaming as if
windows itself and your PC

322
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.170
Wars. It was a console
and this is a movement.

323
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.480
I think that you're going
to see in Vista and

324
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.940
the new games, Explorer, which
if you go in Vista

325
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.970
and you look for the
games, explore, there's a section

326
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.610
there in Invista that will
say, here are your games.

327
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.770
You'll have a picture of
the box of the game.

328
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.170
You can click on the
game. And it'll say, we

329
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.510
recommend a windows experience index
of four for this game.

330
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.200
And your hardware is a
3.5. So it's kind of

331
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.380
an integrated experience as well
as an integrated install and

332
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.600
run experience. You want to
just put the game in

333
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.300
and have it work. And
that's part of this whole

334
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.360
games for windows. It's kind
of like, it's like plays

335
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.400
for sure, but for games,
Well, you have a certain

336
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.250
amount of infrastructure in the
box with when you run

337
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:18.350
Vista that you don't necessarily
have with XP. XP has

338
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.110
been around for a long
time and it didn't come

339
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:25.100
with direct X if I'm
not mistaken. Right. Right. And

340
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.210
then direct X is now
on version 9.0 sub version

341
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.780
three. And there's also the
direct X shaders. These are

342
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.050
these pixel shaders. There's a
thing called shader model 2.0,

343
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.860
which basically all the new
fancy video cards have. But

344
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.530
I think they're basically saying
if you're spending 400 bucks,

345
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.370
the price of a console
on a video card, you're

346
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.520
serious about your games working.
We would like the infrastructure

347
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.340
for all of your games
to work appropriately. You spend

348
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.300
400 bucks for a console
on a board. Like you've

349
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.730
got a pretty kick ass
video card if I understand,

350
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.300
right. Yeah. I was gonna
mention that I've got, you

351
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.200
know, for a person who
isn't like a hardcore gamer,

352
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.180
my video card is a
little over the top. One

353
00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.430
of the reasons that I
got such a fast video

354
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:14.810
card and I have a
one that has two dual

355
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.800
channel DVI, five, 12 Meg
chips on it. So it's

356
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.860
basically two video cards. So
I could run two of

357
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.130
those big Delmon 30 inch
monitors if I wanted. Right.

358
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.710
So you're in a sweet
spot. You probably have, and

359
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.530
this is an Nvidia card
or, And Nvidia chips. And

360
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.510
the reason that I, reason
that I have that is

361
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:37.160
because video rendering uses the
GPU. So when you're sitting

362
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.710
there and you've got like
a, you know, a two

363
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.080
hour video or something like
that, that you need to,

364
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.150
you know, with a whole
bunch of different tracks and

365
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.720
fades and wipes and blends
and titles and everything else,

366
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.810
when you render that down,
you know, if you don't

367
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.990
have a fast GPU, you're,
you're going to have to

368
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:58.760
run it overnight. Yeah, exactly.
Or more. And I was

369
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.940
very happy to see that
the software I'm using, which

370
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.960
is Sony Vegas video, which
is run on.net to, Oh,

371
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:11.270
by the way, also has
support for network rendering, which

372
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:15.260
is very cool. You can
right. Pallet game delegating. We

373
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.620
used to do that with
what was that thing called?

374
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.180
It was a Ray tracer
back in the day. And

375
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.730
you basically had as many
machines as you could throw

376
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.830
at it. And I think
that all the big Pixar

377
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.950
and those guys have fields
and fields of Linux boxes

378
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.880
that do parallel rendering, You
can basically five minutes and

379
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.370
you've got your movie. But
I know the thing I

380
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.220
wanted to say is when
I just got this new

381
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:42.560
mother system online and I've
been editing a video with

382
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.670
it, and when I got
it, it came the video

383
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.830
card with a Laura Croft
tomb, Raider, you know, nine

384
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.890
or whatever it is or
whatever the latest tomb Raider

385
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.680
is. Sure. And I popped
that thing in and I

386
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.440
ran it at the native
resolution of the 30 inch

387
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:05.910
monitor, 2048 by something. Yeah.
And 50 by whatever, 19

388
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.060
two or something like that.
And the thing ran at

389
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:16.500
60 frames per second. That's
hot at that resolution. Wow.

390
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.170
Yeah. I mean, that's crazy.
That's the kind of stuff

391
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.960
I was very impressed. Yeah.
And, and, and, and soon

392
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.910
that video card, you know,
a year or two, that'll

393
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.370
just be on the motherboard,
it'll just be standard. And

394
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.200
you expect that kind of,
you expect that kind of

395
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.810
quality. Right. Right. And you,
and you'd hate to have

396
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.450
to go through a whole
big convoluted set up process

397
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.000
to make, to make that
experience work. You'd like to

398
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.640
put the CD and have
it just happen. Yeah. It

399
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.570
was pretty, so there's the
movement for games, for windows

400
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.690
on Vista, which is the,
if you've got a machine

401
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.180
and it has an experience
index at a certain amount

402
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.070
that says that you're going
to have a good experience,

403
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.260
you've got a good video
card and a good processor.

404
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.590
Your Vista box should work
like a console. So I

405
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.740
think next generation gaming, isn't
just a decision about PS

406
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.800
three versus X-Box three 60
versus wi but it's also

407
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.260
the, maybe I'll put that
money into my video card

408
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.350
and we'll start seeing things
like, you know, call of

409
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.620
duty three, which you can
totally get for, for your

410
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.170
Vista box and have a
great experience or brothers in

411
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.200
arms or some of these
games. So people will look

412
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.050
at that as being another
kind of a console. They

413
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.780
won't necessarily be on a
giant monitor, but it'll be

414
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.340
a good experience in a,
in a different kind of

415
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.510
experience. But I think that
Microsoft's making some pretty ballsy

416
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:32.520
moves, frankly, forgive my French
for, for saying, we're going

417
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.500
to support you putting user
code Homebrew code on, on

418
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.750
an Xbox. Cause you know,
that there's the whole, you

419
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.290
know, PSP, the PlayStation portable
has actually been updating the

420
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:47.850
firmware like every other month
to keep the hackers from,

421
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.610
from hacking. Like you said,
people have broken into the

422
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:55.920
PSP and they've included all
sorts of cool things, emulators

423
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.260
for, you know, older arcade
games, outlook style, personal managers,

424
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.680
personal information managers. And then
the, the next version of

425
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.890
the Sony firmware shuts it
out, locks it down. I

426
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.830
think the issue is that
the hackers hate to see

427
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.430
really awesome hardware in their
living room that they can't

428
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.100
do anything with. I mean
the Xbox itself. And you

429
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.490
mentioned this to me offline
Carl, that the X-Box the

430
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.480
original Xbox has some really
great media center software. That's

431
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.540
an alternative to media center,
right. You know, people are

432
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.910
starting to hack into their
Xboxes as long as they

433
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.310
don't take them on live
or they'll put a switch

434
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.640
on the Xbox to prevent
the Xbox from being banned.

435
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.720
Because the, if Microsoft sees
a modified, X-Box go onto

436
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.750
their network. They'll, they'll shut
it down remotely. They'll, they'll

437
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.490
make it sick. But people
are using these X-Box as,

438
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.190
as medium poor man's media
centers. And they're actually pretty

439
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.520
darn functional. Why not? Let
us write the code in

440
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.980
C sharp, do our own
thing and give us a

441
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.290
sandbox to play in. And
I'm pretty stoked about it.

442
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.170
I think you're gonna see
a new generation of game

443
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.450
developers. You're going to see
young people get excited about

444
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.190
this kind of stuff. I
do wish they had a

445
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.950
VB version of this X
and a toolkit. That is

446
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.990
interesting. I don't know the
technical reasons for that, but

447
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.810
it is, it is. C-sharp
only it's dot net three

448
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.010
O and C sharp express
C sharp express. And what

449
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.100
it is actually is it's
a custom implementation, none of

450
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.420
the.net framework, but the dotnet
compact framework, which I don't

451
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.570
know. I don't know the
difference. There there's some subset

452
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.450
of API APIs, a lot
of stuff missing. It's more

453
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.700
like the AP. It's more
like the compact framework that

454
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.060
you would be running on
your smartphone than it is

455
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.550
like the compact framework. You'd
be running on your full

456
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.460
on Vista box. But if
you simply use their APIs,

457
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.260
you develop your game. You
don't worry about those kinds

458
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.420
of things. You just use
the APS that are given

459
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.050
to you when, when the
version comes out, that lets

460
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.120
you in this, this Christmas
that lets you put this

461
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.030
onto your Xbox, you just
say, Oh yeah. And target

462
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.430
the Xbox and it'll just
work. So then you'll be

463
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.980
able to play your games
on windows and on the

464
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.010
three 60 and share them
with people. So I think

465
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.970
it's only a matter of
time before we see a

466
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.150
really kick ass game that
was written entirely by regular

467
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.690
folk, turn into something that,
you know, someone could charge

468
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:15.800
money for it. So I
think that next generation gaming

469
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.620
kind of like to sum
up is less about the

470
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.230
technology and the hardware and
more about what the experience

471
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.270
is going to be like,
let me just kind of

472
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.310
sum it up like this.
I I'm playing this game

473
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.220
called gears of war. It's
a violent game. It's a

474
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.740
shooter and it's not for
the squeamish. I wouldn't recommend

475
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.680
it for anyone. That was
a, you know, anyway, you

476
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.540
should be playing this. If
you're out of high school,

477
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.620
frankly, it's pretty buddy. But
you know, you could just

478
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.500
say, Oh, well I as
a shooter, but this game,

479
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.380
yes, it's got great graphics
and yes, it's got Dolby,

480
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.770
but rather than a first
person kind of walk around

481
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.550
on a rail up, down
left, right. You know, halo

482
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.500
type thing, which is, we've
all seen a million times

483
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.190
before. It's, it's done with
a camera over the guy's

484
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.670
shoulder. So it's a third
person over the shoulder. And

485
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.820
as you run the camera,
it kind of rocks back

486
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.370
and forth as if you
were being chased almost by

487
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:11.030
like a, a wartime journalist
who is following you with

488
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.660
a camera and the faster
you run, the more the

489
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.900
camera shakes. If you, if
you're, you don't have, it's

490
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.570
cool. It's really immersive. Cool
gives you the sense that

491
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.560
you're really there. And as
you shoot, you don't have

492
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.930
a shooting. When you call
it a shooting ridicule or

493
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.020
a heads up display, you
don't get an aiming deal

494
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.290
unless you actually sit down
and aim the thing, you

495
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:37.010
can run up against barriers.
Or like if someone had

496
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.740
overturned a couch or a
car, you can go and

497
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.690
slam yourself up against it
and then use it as

498
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:45.900
cover. And then shoot blindly
by like just putting your

499
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.680
gun up over your head
and shooting over the car.

500
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.270
But of course you're gonna
be less likely to hit

501
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:56.100
something than if you were
actually aiming. And the cool

502
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.360
part is that, you know,
you spend a lot of

503
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.760
time managing the camera when
you spend, when you play

504
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.430
these games, right. Basically one
of the thumb sticks on

505
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.000
the controller manages your head,
but they've got a button,

506
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.610
the top button on the
control of the Y button,

507
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.940
which is the look at
interesting stuff. When it happens

508
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.820
button, which is such a
clever idea because you spend

509
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.740
so much time managing the,
where am I looking, where

510
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.710
my feet, that can be
really frustrating. But if you

511
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.160
hear a noise, maybe a
rumbling, maybe there's bad guys

512
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.590
coming, or a door has
been knocked down, you hit

513
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.100
this button and it'll automatically
turn yourself towards that thing.

514
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.850
That's making the noise and
then tell you what the

515
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.160
heck you're looking at. So
these bugs come out of

516
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.950
the ground. You hear this
rumbling off the screen, you

517
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.560
push this button, turns your
head towards it and says,

518
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.590
emergence hole. Someone's coming out
of a hole. Bad guys

519
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.520
are coming. Wow. You know,
that's so it's context sensitive,

520
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.700
right? And that's about, that's
about usability. It has nothing

521
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.860
to do with the graphics,
which gets to the whole

522
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.800
thing about the, we, if
I want to play, you

523
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.680
know, bat and hit a
ball with a baseball, like

524
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.170
a baseball bat, I swing
it. And we skip for

525
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:04.320
now, how do you spell
that? We it's it's WWI.

526
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.910
So wwi.com or shrinks or
slash K five H I

527
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.780
think wii.com is a little
easier, which gets into the

528
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.470
Sony. The Sony has the
identical controller as the PlayStation

529
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.650
two, which that controller used
to rumble. Like, you know,

530
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.620
if you get hit, the
thing would shake. They've removed

531
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.510
that feature and introduced a
axis six axis. So you

532
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.910
can turn it, move it
side to side forward and

533
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.990
backward on any of six
axes. Now they haven't pushed

534
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.210
that as much as the,
we cause the we as

535
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.730
a whole new way of
thinking about controllers. I mean,

536
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.340
if you want a regular
old controller, like I said,

537
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.040
you have to buy one,
right? Almost all the games

538
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.710
are different. You play legend
to Zelda. You move with

539
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.870
one hand and you swing
your sword with the other.

540
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.830
Well, a PlayStation there'll be
more traditional ones, but they

541
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:57.000
may make it. So if
you're boxing, you, you push

542
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.910
the controller quickly forward. Or
if someone in a game

543
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.370
is trying to grab your
gun, you shake the controller

544
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.130
back and forth, but they're
still kind of working those

545
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.350
things out. The Sony is
gonna, but it has that

546
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.290
capability of the PlayStation three.
They also have the capability

547
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:15.420
to plug your PlayStation portable
into the, the PlayStation three

548
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.200
as like a possible alternative
monitor. So like, imagine like

549
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.120
you're playing a star Trek
game. It might be your

550
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.210
tri-quarter. So you'd look down
at your PlayStation portable and

551
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.430
it would have another screen
and tell you something about

552
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.080
radar or something that's happening
around you. I already have

553
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.230
this one thing with thumb
controls on, in your right

554
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.410
hand or your main hand,
and then this other sort

555
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.800
of contoured joystick type, alternative
thing and your other. And

556
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.930
it could, What you might
think about this. You might

557
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.290
take the PlayStation portable, put
it next to your height,

558
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.780
your high Def TV. And
it may be it's your,

559
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.060
your rear view mirror or,
or whatever. Those are the

560
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.040
kinds of things. And they're
all going to be chances,

561
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.260
right? We're all taking chances.
They're there. They don't know

562
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.750
which one of those is
going to define next generation

563
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.460
gaming. But the whole point
of gaming, right, is to

564
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.430
be immersed on the play
on the Xbox. It's a

565
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.430
standard controller and a high
Def TV. But wow. I

566
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.330
felt immersed just by the
way, the camera moved, like

567
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.400
the difference between call of
duty two, which is a

568
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.400
first generation Xbox game in
call of duty three, just

569
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.400
changes in the way the
smoke is rendered changes in

570
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.780
the way the, the gaming
experiences makes it another generation.

571
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.220
It makes us a whole
new way of thinking about

572
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.190
gaming. I think it's pretty
cool that the, we people,

573
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:33.790
the, the Nintendo people are,
are so edgy, that they

574
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.860
would take a chance on
this, a whole new way

575
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.330
of thinking about controlling. We've
always been cutting edge in

576
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.100
terms of what you can
do with video games. I

577
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.280
mean, who would have thought,
you know, a virtual dog

578
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:49.290
on a screen, you know,
taking the gotcha. They carry,

579
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.480
they think they're real. They
carry them around. Like my

580
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.500
kids, my kids are completely
obsessed. And I say, we're

581
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.580
because, you know, they have
add also yeah. These things

582
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.720
burn out and the dog
dies and forget it. It's

583
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.760
like those little pendants kids
used to carry around with

584
00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.900
a little tiny top 100
screen Tamagotchi. Yeah. And they

585
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.020
would basically, you know, keep
this animal alive, this virtual

586
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.650
animal. Right. So, yeah. So
Nintendo's always been, you know,

587
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.620
about not just the going
for the, you know, they

588
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.450
do shoot them ups, but
they also go for these

589
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.790
alternative kind of things. And
they've always been Chasing the

590
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.030
hardware. None of the integrity
hardware claims to be the

591
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:32.700
cutting edge. They're really more
focused on the gaming experience.

592
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.180
And frankly, they're winning me.
I mean, I'll probably pick

593
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.980
up a weed because it
seems like such a clever

594
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.140
idea. If you've got a,
you know, a bunch of

595
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.680
family members over and you
want to play something casual,

596
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.320
play a little baseball, play
a little tennis. I think

597
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.180
it's a lot more fun
to, to use the control.

598
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.820
Like I hope the PlayStation
does the same thing and

599
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.250
uses the controller. The biggest
problem for me with video

600
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.050
games, Scott is just what
you were saying, you know,

601
00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.230
pick up the thing and
do a little tennis. I

602
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.450
mean, you know, most, most
of the time the learning

603
00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.520
curve on some of these
games is just like, you

604
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.500
know, by the time you
figured it out, you know,

605
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.310
the guests are ready to
leave. Yeah, exactly. And I

606
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.780
like stuff that's discoverable. That's
simple, you know, that, you

607
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.930
know, within 20, 30 seconds
you can be playing the

608
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:19.290
game. Well, you know, here's
an interesting marketing thing. Take

609
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:22.830
a look@thewe.com, right? we.com. And
they've got a thing called

610
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.170
that we showcase gallery. And
this is very clever. I

611
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.910
got to give them to
this. I'm like marketing side

612
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.880
that they beat. They kind
of beat everybody is they

613
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.220
basically put a bunch of
random people in a room.

614
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.470
They put a camera pointing
at them. So you get

615
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:39.060
their face shot and they
record them experiencing the controller

616
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.230
for the first time. Yeah.
They don't even show what's

617
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.360
happening on the screen. Basically.
They just like, here's some

618
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.360
people and their experience in
the controller, you see them

619
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.120
make mistakes and learn and
eventually kind of get a

620
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.000
certain sense of, Oh, wow.
This is, this is cool.

621
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.670
I get this. It's like
the very first time you

622
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.970
touch an iPod and you
just go, Oh, neat. Yeah,

623
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.690
I totally, I totally get
this. I think that's clever.

624
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.820
And they basically have this
gallery and it's a world

625
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.730
gallery. So they'll say here's
people in Spain learning to

626
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.670
use it. Here's a family
in Japan playing baseball. Here's

627
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:13.970
a random lady in New York
learning to play tennis and

628
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.430
they just move the controller
in a natural way. And

629
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.450
it, it works. I think
that it's interesting to see

630
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.720
these different gaming systems taking
a different tack. You've got

631
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:28.430
Microsoft, they've got the connected
living room, you know, being

632
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.150
able to download games, connect
to your pictures, your digital,

633
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.460
you know, your digital pictures.
I had people over yesterday,

634
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.680
I plugged in my digital
camera and I show them

635
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.170
a slide show. You know,
it just works. You got

636
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:44.030
the PlayStation, totally cutting edge,
10 ADP, super high Def

637
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:49.070
highest quality hardware, you know,
and it plays every PlayStation

638
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.410
game ever. So they're not
going to risk losing anyone

639
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.930
on the, in the PlayStation
world. Then you've got the

640
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.230
wee for ADP, but a
totally different kind of way

641
00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:01.250
about thinking about how to
interact with the system. And

642
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.760
then you've got Vista trying
to exploit the, the hardware

643
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.950
that you've got sitting on
your desk already. Right. Your

644
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.810
machine on your running Vista.
Right. In fact, I'm just

645
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.630
installing it now. And you're,
it's, you're running the 64

646
00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.840
bit version. No, no. The
64 bit version requires registered

647
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.020
drivers of which there are
none. So, Oh, that sucks.

648
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.780
If I didn't want it
to use the hardware. Yeah.

649
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.710
I could run that. But
Vista out of the box

650
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.810
should be a great gaming
system for pretty much any

651
00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.320
box. You know, Scott, you
were talking about media center

652
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.460
stuff and have you seen
photo story? Yeah. I have

653
00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:41.470
photo story makes videos with
pans and movement with integrated

654
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:44.620
audio. Right. So you know
that, you know, the great

655
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:48.460
media center feature of the,
the slide show with things

656
00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.380
move across in fade in
and out of each other.

657
00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:52.360
Right. It's very subtle, but
it makes the slideshow feel

658
00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.510
more. Yeah. The Ken burns
effect, I call that. Exactly.

659
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.330
So the photo photo story
does that, you just pointed

660
00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.060
at the pictures that you
want to use and you

661
00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:06.520
give it a background music
track and then also record

662
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.050
your microphone. Right. And then
it just shows you these

663
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.560
things and it compiles it
all to a WMV at

664
00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.980
the same time. And when
you're done, you, you know,

665
00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.350
you narrate the pictures, Oh,
this is when you know,

666
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.150
we went to blah, blah,
blah. Oh, here we go

667
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.700
with this and that. And
you get some background music

668
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.980
and you get your microphone.
And it's pretty cool that

669
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.840
you can just take this
video and then send it

670
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.810
to somebody and say here,
check out these photos. The

671
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:39.030
photo story is at shrinks.com/k
five L and Scott, Before

672
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.130
we wrap up, are there
any other resources that you

673
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.400
wanted to point out before
we, the, the XMA stuff,

674
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.630
the fact is at a
stir slash <inaudible>, you can

of at the CPU level

679
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.060
And the PlayStation three is
at the PlayStation site in

680
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.690
the U S at shrinks
or slash K five K.

681
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.260
There's an interesting video up
on YouTube at shrinks slash

682
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:26.490
K five E where they
basically explain what the point

683
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:28.410
of XMA is and what
you can do with it.

684
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.940
And, you know, I think
you brought up a good

685
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.390
thing, even though that discussion
of photo story might seem

686
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.810
kind of orthogonal to the
discussion. It really gets to

687
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.850
the issue of what are
we using all this systems

688
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.760
for it's to create and
to kind of reach out.

689
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.460
And I think that whether
it be the X and

690
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.980
a letting you write your
own games, the idea that

691
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.570
a 15 year old kid
might be able to sit

692
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.510
down and write their own
video game, or my mom

693
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:55.920
could sit down and write
a narrated slideshow with all

694
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.650
of the photos that she's
got from trips and then

695
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.140
send it to someone. And
it would just work kind

696
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.030
of gets to the whole
point of all these machines,

697
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.240
which is having a really
good experience. And I think

698
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.650
that the next four or
five years of, of hardware

699
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:16.380
of, of consumer hardware is
all about the experience, right?

700
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.860
I mean, the Zune that
the Microsoft just released is

701
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.230
an attempt at, you know,
Microsoft said, well, we like

702
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.300
the iPod, but we feel
that the experience is about

703
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.450
socializing. So we want to
be able to transmit music

704
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.230
from device to device wirelessly,
all of this, just trying

705
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.780
to push the, the extent
of experience. We should probably

706
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:38.100
do a show on UX,
on user experience and kind

707
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.310
of the, the Renaissance that's
happening around experience on the,

708
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.380
on the web and architecting
a really good experience for

709
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.850
a user as Richard Campbell says.
And every time somebody says

710
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:52.260
the phrase web 2.0 and
other startup dies. Yeah, totally.

711
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.160
All right, Scott, that's a
great show, a little off

712
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.490
track from the usual developer
topics, but very interesting, even

713
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:04.770
for a non, you know,
extreme gamer such as myself

714
00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:10.080
on geek gamer. Yeah. So
thanks very much. And thanks

715
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.900
for listening and we'll see
you next week on Hansen

716
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.200
minutes.
