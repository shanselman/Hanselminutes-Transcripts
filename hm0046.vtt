00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.900
episode, Scott and Carl discuss
the functionality and requirements for

11
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:08.930
WP F E windows presentation
foundation. Hi, this is Carl Franklin.

12
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.600
You're listening to Hanselman it's
once again. It's good to

13
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.630
be with you, Scott Hanselman.
How are you? I'm well,

14
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.440
how are you, sir? I'm
just fine. And this week

15
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.740
here, you might sound a
little froggy. Yeah, I got

16
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.720
a little Barry white going
right now. I'm about to

17
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.270
walk to his low. Yeah.
Got a few extra white

18
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.880
blood cells in your body.
I don't know what's going

19
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.710
on. I was at the,
I was at the hospital

20
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.830
today. I'm trying to figure
out if it was malaria

21
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.590
or not, the doctor doesn't
think it is. I thought

22
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.260
it might be stomach worms,
something that you would pick

23
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.980
up in Africa, but the,
the current current thinking is

24
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.180
that it's a bad teriyaki.
That could be, you never

25
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.880
know. I've been laid out
by bad teriyaki, nearly every

26
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.430
time the chicken I'll get
ya. So we're talking this

27
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.120
week about WP F E
w PFE. That's the code

28
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.240
name? A windows presentation foundation
everywhere. Otherwise known colloquially among

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.570
devs as the flash killer.
Although Microsoft doesn't like it.

30
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.580
When we say that you,
they don't like it, but

31
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.260
you know whether it's true
or not, we'll discover in

32
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.540
our talk today. Won't we?
Yeah, I have him. I

33
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.570
have a metric crap load
of links. This, this week

34
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.670
we saw a little light
on the links lately, but

35
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.710
if we, if we don't
get to some of them,

36
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.280
they'll all be listed on
the website. Okay. Now, have

37
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.600
you done any XAML work
yourself? You know, XAML work

38
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.300
is funny. The whole idea
of XAML is that we

39
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.000
shouldn't have to write it,
but I understand it fully.

40
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.200
In fact, you know, I
was very happy when, you

41
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.820
know, we were looking at
forms described as XML. I

42
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.280
had been doing that kind
of thing programming wise for,

43
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.130
for years, even when HTML
was, was just fairly new.

44
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.160
So, so it's an, it's
a good idea whose time

45
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.200
has come. But as far
as like rolling up my

46
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.600
sleeves and writing XAML no,
I don't. I hope I

47
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.970
never have to do that.
Yeah. It's really interesting. It's

48
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.760
it a good idea whose
time Has come or a

49
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.370
good idea? Who's time has
returned, you know, it wasn't

50
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.260
it just 10 years ago
when I was writing C

51
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.470
and C plus plus using
a MFC and we would

52
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.870
make our resource files be
separate from our code and

53
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.000
have used the class wizard
to hook them up. Right.

54
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.980
Is, you know, is this
just that with angle brackets?

55
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.910
I don't know. I do
know this, that the XAML

56
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.990
and the underlying markup idea,
the technology behind it is

57
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.590
a solid, and I think
it's a fantastic idea. Great

58
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.480
idea. We, you know, we
had this idea when I

59
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.620
saw prodigy, you know, the
very first time that we

60
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.270
were thinking of sending vectors
over modems, instead of bitmaps.

61
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.970
I mean, it's that whole
idea of, I want to

62
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.580
just send you a form
and have you render it

63
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.490
and you know, that's why
the browser is such a

64
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.920
big deal. And that's the
same principle of the browser

65
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.290
works. We're trying to get
those Pentium fours and core

66
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.380
two duals to do a
little work. Exactly. Here's the

67
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.180
thing. And we won't get
too into the politics of

68
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.720
it, but where I think
Microsoft is dropping the ball

69
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.040
is the Microsoft expression tools
you can read about them

70
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.130
at shrink.com/l for J they've
got this expression designer. This

71
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.580
was a, an evolution of
a tool that they bought

72
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.880
from another company. And now
they've broken it up. Now,

73
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.810
if I understand correctly, there's
a web skew, a blend

74
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.500
skew, B L E N
D blend, design, skew, and

75
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.470
immediate skew. I've read the
directions three times and I'm

76
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.470
still not clear, which one
of these works. The reason

77
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.470
that Photoshop is awesome is
that there's two versions, right?

78
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.790
There's Photoshop. And then there's
like Photoshop se which special

79
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.450
edition, which everyone always realizes
is crippled edition. So there's

80
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.210
basically the free crappy version
you get. And then there's

81
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.000
the $500 version. If there
were eight different versions of

82
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Photoshop, I don't think Photoshop
would be as ubiquitous. And

83
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.360
just as I was very
frustrated when visual studio team

84
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.810
system had half a dozen
different skews for testers and

85
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.240
architects and developers, and you
couldn't just buy the ultimate

86
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.400
skew, right? Vista's got what
seven now, seven skews, home,

87
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.790
home business, you know, home
premium home, basic business. At

88
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.250
least they have an ultimate
skew, right? The, everything in

89
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.460
the kitchen sink skew, right.
I just don't understand expression.

90
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.110
And then if I, you
can correct me if I'm

91
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.890
wrong here, but the MSDN
universal license does not currently

92
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.790
include expression. That's correct. Yeah.
So How are we supposed

93
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.700
to make this technology ubiquitous
and amazing if we're not

94
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.420
going to give people the,
the tools to develop, you

95
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.370
know, w with right now
you can get the CDPs

96
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.020
for free, but eventually you're
gonna have to start paying

97
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.360
Well. And I mean, I
can imagine all of our,

98
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.660
our, you know, paying listeners
out there who are used

99
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.600
to paying for everything saying
when, when, when you guys

100
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.810
are just upset, because you're
not getting some free software

101
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.750
from Microsoft, I disagree. I
think our paying listeners, if

102
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.050
they're smart, they've paid for
a universal license for developer,

103
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.030
not for production, but for
a developer. It's the smartest

104
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.650
thing you can do. You
show up at your new

105
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.870
job and, Oh, you have
a universal here's your license.

106
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.440
Yeah. Really agree. I, I,
I don't know why it's

107
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.780
not in the box. I
mean, maybe it's that they're

108
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.090
financially strapped and they think
this could be a big

109
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.050
thing, but unfortunately, you know,
that's a bean counter mentality,

110
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.350
exact things don't get big
by them, you know, just

111
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.830
being great. They also, they
also have to be accessible.

112
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.930
Well, that's enough politics that
I have my opinion and

113
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.420
I've expressed it. You've got
yours. Let's talk about the

114
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.400
underlying technology. Cause I think
that's what people want to

115
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.420
hear. Okay. And by the,
by the way, the regional

116
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.420
directors are on our side.
So we're, if we have

117
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.380
any influence at all, maybe
Microsoft will come around. Yeah.

118
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.960
I mean, it's, it's possible.
I think that blogs people,

119
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.480
you know, everyone who's out
there, whether they're a MVP

120
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.340
or not, if you blog
about it, you express your

121
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.340
opinion, you know, in a
civil way, as opposed to

122
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.500
starting a flame war. I
think all of that adds

123
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.810
up and you've got to
give people like, you know,

124
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.170
Scott Guthrie credit, this is a
guy who writes his own

125
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.330
blog. You know, he doesn't
have an assistant writing his

126
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.240
blog, right. He writes his
own samples. He reads in

127
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.970
response to his comments. And
if you make a reasoned

128
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.160
argument, you know, things will
change. And there are people

129
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.020
at Microsoft at very high
levels who have the power

130
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.390
to make, make change. So
I got to give him

131
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.100
credit for that. All right.
WPF, not WPF, but WPF.

132
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.840
Right? This is windows presentation
foundation, right? Codename, Avalon. This

133
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.870
is a gdi.next it's the
new rendering engine. You can

134
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.530
get it by downloading the.net
framework three. Oh, which includes

135
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.670
also of course, Indigo, which
is when windows communication foundation

136
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.550
and the first really awesome
application that I think we

137
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.410
talked about on the show
a couple of weeks ago,

138
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.390
or a couple of months
ago was the, the New York

139
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.450
times application, right? This was
the New York times reader app.

140
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.740
It's basically a super blog
reader, except the only blog

141
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.820
it reads is the New York
times, but an amazing presentation.

142
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.940
It shows off the rendering,
the Nia, seeing the new

143
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.830
font stuff, the have flowed
text controls through, through columns,

144
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.670
all of the things that
made life hard under GDI

145
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.850
made simpler. And that was
kind of a showcase application

146
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.180
from the New York times. Yeah.
Now WPF requires, of course

147
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.220
<inaudible> which itself requires Dutton
to, Oh, so for your

148
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.630
mom, that's kind of a
significant thing to get set

149
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.790
up on her machine Is
starting at three O going

150
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.250
to be going to make
it into windows update as

151
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.490
a recommended update or, or
an optional update. The word

152
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.650
on the street is that
it's still optional, but I

153
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.500
could be wrong. I did
notice I was, you know,

154
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.770
I was in Tanzania and
I needed to update. I,

155
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.900
so this is an interesting
point about who out there

156
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.160
is going to be able
to get these things. I've

157
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.610
got two anecdotes. First one
I'm in Tanzania on a

158
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.490
9,600 baud dial up and
I want to get done

159
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.710
and framework to Oh, on
the thing. So I can

160
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.990
show some of the kids
over there, how to program.

161
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.310
I want to, I just
want to get them hello

162
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.670
world. I wasn't even gonna
download express. I was gonna

163
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.120
download sharp develop, right? Just
a very basic IDE. Right?

164
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.010
So to do this, I
got to get done at

165
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.060
two on the box. Well,
in order to get these

166
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.580
things on the box, I
needed like six, this is

167
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:05.040
on a windows, 2000 server
running service pack three. I

168
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.430
needed to get 2000 service
pack four. I had to

169
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.350
get 69 different security updates,
which took three days a

170
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.050
while running the modem all
night long. I had to

171
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.330
use tools like get right
to get the, the stuff

172
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.270
I needed. I had install
all of these just to

173
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.040
get I E just to
get done at two O

174
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.110
same thing happened recently with
a person who gave me

175
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.690
a laptop to give to
the kids in Africa. I

176
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.930
paved it. I put on
my XP box, my XP

177
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.290
disk, rather, it's not a
slipstream disc. It's just whatever

178
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.470
the skew I have is.
Right. And it took five

179
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.520
reboots and five visits to
windows update just to get

180
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.620
the things that would allow
me to get <inaudible> on

181
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.340
the box. Yeah. So if
your mom's machine is not

182
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.280
up to date and you
haven't set automatic updates, which

183
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.770
you should, you're going to
have a little challenge or

184
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.320
she will have a little
challenge trying to get those

185
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.020
prerequisites that you need to
get done at three Oh

186
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.750
two on your box. There
really isn't any other way

187
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.000
to do it other than
a download the updates. Right.

188
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.630
I mean, as there is,
does MSDN universal come with

189
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.210
some sort of Microsoft windows
updates It's list a that

190
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.340
you can insert Well from
DVD. That's a really interesting

191
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.330
point. I found myself wishing
for the windows update disc,

192
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.010
and I hope someone hears
us and works on that

193
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.890
because the problem I was
happening having was that the,

194
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.880
the wireless connection, the 9,600
baud CDMA cell phone connection

195
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.310
I was using was so
unreliable that windows update with

196
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.730
timeout and he could retrying
and retrying and retrying. Yeah.

197
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.850
If I could go in
and get the we'll, remember

198
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.120
that they've passed out CDs
of a windows service pack

199
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.490
to XP service pack two.
That was great. I carry

200
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.190
that around with me at
Christmas time and went to

201
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.260
all the family's houses. You
know, you could have you

202
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.610
go to Thanksgiving and you
say, Hey, you got a

203
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.200
laptop in the back. Let
me update it for you.

204
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.430
Right. Okay. So the point
is that for a corporate

205
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.720
application, for something that you
control deployment windows, dotnet three

206
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.440
O a framework is probably
something that's within your ability

207
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.500
for those people who are,
have their machines running automatic

208
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.170
updates, it'll be a no
brainer, but what if you

209
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.180
want to get WPF XAML
based rich media experience. You

210
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.990
want the flexibility of an
XML based presentation layer, but

211
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.630
you don't want all of
the, the Schmidt's on your

212
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.520
box. Right? So WPF is
fantastic. It is a one,

213
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.450
Meg might be a little
bigger when it gets down.

214
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.950
It's a one Meg download
just like flash or shockwave

215
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.430
that you download when you
hit a page. And it,

216
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.850
it does not have any
prerequisites on the dominant framework.

217
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.170
Now, current versions don't have
real rich, he sharp support

218
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.650
and framework is CLR support,
but future versions will It's.

219
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.610
Well it's because it has
a micro framework in it.

220
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.020
Right? Right. Exactly. It's a
tiny dot and framework of

221
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.190
its own. It's a tiny
render. It's basically tiny versions

222
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.290
of all these things that
you, that you would need

223
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.560
packaged up into one tiny,
tiny download one while tiny

224
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.720
for us. One Meg, I
think on a, on a

225
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.610
dial up that would probably
take you about 10, 15

226
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.180
minutes. Yeah. That's not bad,
but they're talking about adding,

227
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600
you know, much more support
for the base class library.

228
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.340
Cause they have to do
a subset of the library,

229
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.470
right? They, they can't give
you the entire dotnet framework.

230
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.570
Right. But they want to
give you enough where you've

231
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.880
got a rich enough environment
where you can build some

232
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.900
interactivity into your, into your
system. Now they just released

233
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.090
the December, 2006, CTP the community
technology preview. And to show

234
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.760
that they're serious, there is
both a windows and Mac

235
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.530
version. This is very cool.
So the window, yeah. The

236
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.660
windows version, is it shrink,
stir.com/l four C and the

237
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:45.070
Mac version as it shrinks
or.com/ <inaudible>. And of course,

238
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.590
being that I have a
Mac and a PC sitting

239
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.020
next to each other on
my desk, I can attest

240
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.170
that they work nicely together
and you can download a

241
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.020
bunch of samples that shrink
store slash L four B,

242
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.990
that includes a bunch of
the stuff you can unzip

243
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.720
and play with. And you
have to get the documentation

244
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.620
separately. That's at shrink slash
L four D as in

245
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.770
David, the samples are at
L four B. Yeah. So

246
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.510
I think the fact that
it works on the Mac,

247
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.950
and I can only assume
that there's going to be

248
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.920
a, a, a Linux version
out there as, and the

249
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.490
windows version works on both
IE and Firefox works in

250
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.180
Firefox one, five and two.
Oh. And there's an actually

251
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:28.150
a really interesting article on
getting started with WPF. It's

252
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:33.580
shrink, stir.com/l four L this
is an MSDN article. And

253
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.060
about halfway down, there's a
section on exactly what works

254
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.400
and what doesn't and Firefox
right now, when you visit

255
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.790
a page that uses WP
F Slash E, it will

256
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.430
be Prompt you to go
and look in the Firefox

257
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.960
plugin finder directory. And because
WPF slash E is not

258
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.530
a, a published official helper
yet, right. It's not a

259
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.620
real application. It's paid up.
It doesn't actually get listed,

260
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.810
but you can go in
and manually install it. And

261
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.140
it works just fine and
Firefox. So when it eventually

262
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.260
comes out, the experience that
someone gets, whether they're using

263
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.990
IE or Firefox is going
to be really smooth. It's

264
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.640
just going to be like
getting flashed. They're just going

265
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.040
to show up, click a
couple of things. You know,

266
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.320
we want two clicks. They
don't have to go through

267
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.980
a big installer. I just
went next, next finish. And

268
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.010
it was, it was taken
care of. So the thing

269
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.620
is, you've got to, you
got to see these, these

270
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.780
samples. You have to see
some samples to really understand

271
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.270
how clean this has. I
think one of the nicest

272
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:34.320
samples that I saw was
a guy called the rogue.

273
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.110
His website is kind of
a dodgy, but he's got

274
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:42.720
some nice samples@shrinksor.com slash L
for R. He's got like

275
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.290
an all black website with
flashy, animated gifs and stuff.

276
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.600
But he's got a lot
of good information about wind

277
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.520
effects. And as a banker
type, I'm always looking for

278
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.430
things that are going to
move banking and online finance

279
00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.260
to the next level. The
Woodgrove finance application was written

280
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.520
by a lady whose blog
is called scorps.com. I don't

281
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.460
think I shrink derived that
S C O R B

282
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.990
s.com. And she worked on
an application called the Woodgrove

283
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.380
finance application. And just last
month, they released the source

284
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:21.020
code of this app at
shrink.com/ <inaudible>. And this application

285
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.630
was a basically takes over
your browser. And this is

286
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.870
an what's called an XB,
a P and X pap.

287
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.320
It's an XML browser-based application.
And this is going to

288
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.780
be a little confusing to
people until Microsoft has some

289
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.720
positioning on this, because there's
a couple of different ways

290
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.940
you can use WPF, right?
And you can compile an

291
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.850
application. I could give you
an exe. And if you

292
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.340
have dotnet three on your
box, you can use it

293
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.870
like the times like the
New York times reader, then I

294
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.310
could make an X bap,
a browser based XML XAML

295
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.630
based application. It would have
an X bap X VAP

296
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.620
extension. And I would just
visit that Earl. And it

297
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.200
would actually show up and
fill up the browser. There'd

298
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.560
be no HTML involved. The
would grow finance application is

299
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.280
like that. And then the
WP F E stuff is

300
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.730
more like flash. It's really
focused on living in an

301
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.460
asp.net page. It's not meant
to be a whole new

302
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.500
application or a whole new
kind of application all by

303
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.660
itself. It could, but it's
really about adding interactivity, like

304
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.030
a really great example of
kind of a web 2.0

305
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.630
interactivity would be the Google
finance page. I'm sure you've

306
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.070
probably seen that you visit
finance.google.com enter in anything. And

307
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.740
this is a really great
chart and it really fits

308
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.100
in to the current, the
current layout and the flow.

309
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.000
But then you realize that
the chart has interactivity with

310
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.210
the HTML and vice versa.
So for example, they'll show

311
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.320
a chart of your running
stock price with letters pointing

312
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.800
to points of interest on
the actual chart. So they

313
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.480
might see, you might see
a peak where you went

314
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.180
to four bucks and you
have a letter a, there

315
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.130
you click on the letter
a and then they'll actually

316
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:04.670
find the press release that
was released that day. And

317
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.430
then draw a correlation between
the two. This is a

318
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.720
flash based application, but the
flash app is communicating with

319
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.120
the Ajax aspect of the,
of the application. So if

320
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.420
you already got an AI,
an Ajax, asp.net application, you

321
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.480
could enable aspects of it
that would have been difficult

322
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.310
in Ajax with WPF might
be Richard charting might be

323
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.710
a dropdown combo that, you
know, works the way you

324
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.650
want it to work. Another
good example would be Nickeel.

325
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:39.800
Kotara is a flicker photo
viewer@shrinkstir.com slash L four H.

326
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.930
And McKeel is brilliant, brilliant
asp.net guy. And I'm a

327
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.200
huge fan. He has a
thing called script sharp, and

328
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.870
you can see it at
shrinks.com/l for G. And he's

329
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.860
been starting to apply this
to WPF and script sharp

330
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.800
is a way to write
C-sharp if you're a C

331
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.360
sharp programmer and get JavaScript,
he is extending that. So

332
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.960
one could write C-sharp and
get XAML kind of sounds

333
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.660
silly, but the idea is
if you're really good at

334
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.470
expressing your intent in one
language, stick with it, right,

335
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.050
and he'll handle the generation.
So he's got a really

336
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.290
great example of the flicker
photo viewer, but basically you

337
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.490
visit that site at shrinks.com/l
four H type in a

338
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.480
tag, a flicker tag, and
then he'll pull using the

339
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.160
Jason J S O N
JavaScript object notation, Jason kind

340
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.420
of web services API that's
exposed by flicker and pull

341
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.140
down images and then bring
them into the WPF space

342
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:45.180
and show you an animated
slideshow. And that slideshow will

343
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.240
include reflections and translucency and
all of the things that

344
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.380
you're used to seeing on
WPF application really, really slick

345
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.900
stuff. And actually, there's another
one that is written@ashrinkstir.com slash

346
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.530
L four S it's basically
kind of a rewrite of

347
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.820
the virtual earth application, but
it's done in WPF. Now,

348
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.060
this is just a, a
big a start, but you

349
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.430
know, if you go to
mics, Oh seven, right mixes,

350
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.630
the, the web interactivity conference
that is hosted by Microsoft,

351
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.360
but not run by Microsoft,
right? It's gonna be in

352
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.550
Vegas this year. There's going
to be a lot of

353
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:26.310
stuff on WPF. There is
an announcement up at Scott

354
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:31.020
Guthrie's blog at shrinks.com/l for
N, where he announces the

355
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.810
CTP. Any kind of gives
some, some hints, some, you

356
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.960
know, a harbinger of what's
to come. And the impression

357
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.780
that I get is that
in the first half of

358
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.280
2007, they're going to want
to have Firefox on windows,

359
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:52.470
on XPN up, and then
they're going to have Mac

360
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.600
and possibly Linux. And then
they're going to have a

361
00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:00.390
limited CLR within that working
and already bigger companies are

362
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.030
starting to pick that up.
If you take a look@shrinkstir.com

363
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.650
slash L four Oh, Yahoo
is actually rewriting the Yahoo

364
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.810
messenger using windows presentation foundation.
Now they're not using the

365
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.630
WPF III stuff, which again,
I think is going to

366
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.070
cause some confusion because there's
these different levels of, of

367
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.410
requirements. I think the same
thing happened with shockwave and

368
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.750
flash. Don't you think? Yeah,
there was a time where

369
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.340
it's like, well, do I
need flash, which is easy

370
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.200
and small, or do I
need shockwave, which is a

371
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.430
bigger deal to install. You
know, what can happen here?

372
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:36.920
If WP Effie gets some
real popularity, is that people

373
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.550
will be willing to download
and install WP F you

374
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.340
know, because that's where all
the cool stuff is happening.

375
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.710
But when you go to
a click once application, that

376
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.870
requires the entire framework. Oh
my God. Why, why should

377
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.440
I do that? Yeah, I
think you totally nailed it.

378
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.990
I think you nailed it.
A couple other blogs to

379
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.570
check out Mike harsh, one
of the PM's and shrinks

380
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.330
her slash L for K.
Again, all of these links

381
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.970
are going to be up
on the Hansel minutes site,

382
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.360
including two really great channel
nine videos. One with Mike

383
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.840
harsh at shrink stir slash
L for E, and one

384
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.320
with the lead PM chose
Stegman at shrink stir slash

385
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:17.760
L for F. And there's
also a WPF blog at

386
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.470
shrink her slash L four
P. I think that WPF

387
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.860
E is for my mom,
for the public, going to

388
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.090
be a more interesting thing
than WPF proper. I think

389
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.660
we'll, we'll see applications written
in WPF for, for the

390
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.740
back office for intranets, but
I can really see myself

391
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.880
making a pretty amazing banking
application, a better experience with,

392
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.500
with WPOV. Now we should
talk about this versus flash

393
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.060
because a lot of people
say, well, this is just

394
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.540
Microsoft, Pete non flash. What's
the point? Sure. This is,

395
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.680
you know, arguably, this is
their offering in that space.

396
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.460
This is what they want
to compete with flash with.

397
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.910
And I think you'd probably
agree with me when I

398
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.180
say that, frankly, I don't
understand why flash didn't take

399
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.870
off. You know, I've seen
some amazing didn't take off.

400
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.090
I thought it was like
one of the most popular

401
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.080
plugins for, for browsers in
all history. Well, let me,

402
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.840
let me, let me rephrase,
not take off in the,

403
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.190
you know, cutesy ad cutesy
game kind of sense, but

404
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.970
in the why people didn't
write entire applications on flash.

405
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.090
Ah, I mean, we were
here. We are here. We

406
00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.540
are. Futsing with Ajax, right?
We're putting together angle brackets

407
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.600
and bailing wire. We're fighting
with JavaScripts and Dom's, and

408
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.250
there's, you know, 20 different,
well, hell more than 20,

409
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.090
probably 50 by now, different
Ajax frameworks where people want

410
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.630
to string together this stuff.
But here we've got flash

411
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.690
that is cross-platform runs on
Linux runs on Mac runs

412
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.960
on windows. Why aren't we
willing to write an application

413
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.850
that fills up the browser
and runs everything is flash.

414
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.430
I can, I have my
ideas? I don't know if

415
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.880
I'm sure you do, please
share pretty much what hits

416
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.380
me right away is a
development. You know, it is

417
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.150
confusing. That is the development
for flash is limited. I

418
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:18.630
mean, it's, you, you use
action script. There's stuff that

419
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.270
you can, and you can't
do. Is it action script

420
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.630
now or lingo? Well, before
it been ad spin action

421
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.150
script for many years, but
wow. I'm getting old. Then

422
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.780
I remember when it was
future wave. Remember that future

423
00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.580
wave technologies and it was
called future splash. Yeah. I'm

424
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.720
getting old, but yeah, it's
it's you have to use

425
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.550
their tools, their language, and
it speaks a binary thing.

426
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:44.370
But now arguably with Microsoft,
you have to use quote

427
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:49.010
unquote, their tools, their language.
But interestingly, you've got Adobe

428
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.890
coming up with XAML exporters'
where you can load something

429
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.860
up into illustrator and go
file save as, and XAML

430
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.730
pops out. Yeah. Why is
it that you can spit

431
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.160
out? XAML so easily and
people were so quick to

432
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.740
jump on the bandwagon, but
I don't know. Can you

433
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.610
go into illustrator and then
export a Swift file? A

434
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:12.110
flash file? A I don't
know. I don't even live

435
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.840
in that space. Yeah. I
don't either. Which is kind

436
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.790
of a nice thing, which
gets into what you were

437
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.520
talking about before with the,
the way that developer flow

438
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.040
should work. Like at Karelian,
you know, we do a

439
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.850
finance, we have a full
time interaction designer, right. And

440
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.600
she manages user interface and
experience for the, for all

441
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.000
the applications. I would love
it if she had a

442
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.260
bunch of designers under her
writing the UI, and I'll

443
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.040
worry about the, the inner
workings and plug them into

444
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.660
each other. Right. And if
she wants to do it

445
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.170
in Excel, you know, Microsoft
expression, or if he wants

446
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.920
to do it in illustrator,
I don't really care. Yeah.

447
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.970
Interesting. We'll have to wait
and see what happens with

448
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.580
that. I'm very curious as
to how it's gonna play

449
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.000
out. Yeah. Right now, I
just want to make it

450
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.580
easy for me to get
into it and play with

451
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.920
it within visual studio, 2005.
Cause that's kinda where I

452
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.230
live. So Sean Burke has made
a toolkit, extender, a trickster.com/

453
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.820
<inaudible> that once you have
the SDK installed, you do

454
00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.860
have to do a little
bit of manual installation with

455
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.670
small zipping of files into
your visual studio directory. But

456
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:24.820
this allows you to drag
A WPF fee Components onto

457
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.690
your under your Desktop. But
I think that the, the,

458
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.600
the summary that we want
to leave people with is

459
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.700
just kind of a reminder
about what the difference are

460
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.000
between these different things. So
dotnet three O, which was

461
00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:42.880
previously when effects. This is
Avalon Indigo. Now WPF WCF,

462
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.980
the dutton@threeorequiresthe.net framework to Oh,
right. So once you have

463
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.680
those two things on your
system, you can run windows,

464
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.400
presentation, foundation applications that are
compiled. You can run them

465
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.270
that, or click once, or
you can run X, PA

466
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:03.610
X, BAPS, XB, AP XML,
XAML based browser applications. These

467
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.030
are with an X bap
extension. All those you can

468
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.310
run when you have gotten
a three, Oh, you get

469
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:13.780
all of <inaudible> functionality, you
get all of WPF and

470
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.410
the applications, including like ex-pat,
they live in a sandbox,

471
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.160
right? It's like a active
X document. They're running inside

472
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.190
the context of it. Now
those only work on windows

473
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:30.130
server, 2003 Vista and XP.
And they're not cross-platform. So

474
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:35.800
when FX is not cross
platform, Carlos WPOV is cross

475
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.650
platform with a very small
subset of the three O

476
00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.270
stuff. They live in the
browser, just like the <inaudible>

477
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.760
except they're cross platform. And
they do not have access

478
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.520
to the, the, the entire
dotnet framework. They have a

479
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.720
very, very small subset. Now,
at some point, WP Effie

480
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.060
I'm sure will, will live
outside of the browser. You'll

481
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.130
be able to use it
in a WinForms application as

482
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.230
a, as a component. And
we'll see, I think we'll

483
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.020
see more and more sharing
of componentry as people, right?

484
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.760
Shims that let you talk
back and forth. But right

485
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.820
now, the WPF stuff, you
can talk to it via

486
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.210
JavaScript very, very easily. So
there's an object model. You

487
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.750
can pull information in and
out of WPP. So if

488
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.680
you've already made some investment
in Ajax, but there's perhaps

489
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.830
some aspect of your application
that you weren't really satisfied

490
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.180
with, WPOV could potentially add
that level of rich interactivity

491
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.760
to your existing site, without
you having to change a

492
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.130
lot of stuff, you can
still call web services or

493
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:41.730
Jason applications from your WPF
components. So I think you

494
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.250
would look at it, something
that would augment your strategy

495
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.250
as opposed to causing you
to shift your strategy entirely

496
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.520
in a different direction. Scott,
are we going to see

497
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.920
support for WP Effie in
visual studio 2005? Or are

498
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.560
we going to have to
wait for <inaudible>? Yeah. So

499
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.560
you actually can do this
in 2005. Now you do

500
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.130
need to get the web
applications, project support. So you

501
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:08.150
have to go to shrink
stir.com/l for M M as

502
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:12.140
in mom. Once you have
that support, you can get

503
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:16.700
the getting started stuff under
shrink star slash L four

504
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.180
L. Once you get the
getting started, stuff installed, you

505
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.120
have the, the SDK, the
docs and the runtime for

506
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.770
WPF, remembering that your end
users only need the runtime.

507
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.410
There's some project types that
you have to go and

508
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.680
manually install. You unzip them
into your visual studio project

509
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.890
types folder. And that will
let you go file new

510
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.900
and actually say WPF application
from within visual studio 2005.

511
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.040
Okay. And then of course
your XAML can be written

512
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.700
in any application. You can
get trials of expression, the

513
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.170
expression stuff can be downloaded
at a shrinker slash L

514
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.170
for J, or you can
use any tool that will

515
00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.680
export XAML and actually be
enough. People are excited about

516
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.500
XAML. There's lots of conversion
tools. So if you have

517
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:09.230
some SVG, scalable vector graphics
code out there, or even

518
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.410
some, some old fashioned windows
Mehta files, you can get

519
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.790
those converted into XAML fairly
easily, which can take existing

520
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.150
applications that are vector based
and move them into this,

521
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:25.400
this realm in a fairly
painless way. Okay. Sounds like

522
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.070
a show. Okay. Yeah. You
know, I, there's so much

523
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.200
stuff to look into about
this. I could talk even

524
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.780
more about it and maybe
we'll do another show sometime

525
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.810
and talk more about the
samples and writing your first

526
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.000
application. Well, I think we're
going to have a lot

527
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.520
more interest once we get
out of, you know, CTP

528
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.680
land and some shipping Code.
Yeah. I think definitely that

529
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.620
the first half of 2007
is going to be really,

530
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.740
really interesting if they, if
they hit their schedule on

531
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.860
WP IFE. And if some
of the speculation out there

532
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.820
about possible Linux support, better
support for C-sharp and the

533
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.000
CLR, if those things come
to pass, it's gonna look

534
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.650
great for everybody. Awesome. Scott,
thanks a lot for being

535
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.650
sick and doing the show.
I hope it was not

536
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.330
too hard to listen to
me. No, not at all.

537
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.030
And we'll see you next
week on Hanselman.
