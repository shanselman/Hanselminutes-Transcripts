<inaudible> Hansel minutes.com. It's Hanselman.
It's a weekly discussion with

2
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.010
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

Scott talks with two dash

7
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.710
soft employees, programmer Lemmys and
senior systems analyst. Hi, this

8
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.780
is Scott Hanselman and this
is another episode of Hansel

9
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.960
minutes and I'm here in
Cairo, Egypt. In fact, at

10
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.360
the German university of Cairo
at Cairo code camp two

11
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.850
day event here in Egypt
on the weekends. And I'm

12
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.320
sitting in one of the
rooms here and you might

13
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.960
be hearing people walking by
because we're in a very

14
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.380
busy university in Cairo, and
I've got the opportunity to

15
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.820
sit down with two employees
of dash soft, who is

16
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.820
sponsoring me coming here to
Cairo. We've got Lemese who's

17
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.150
a programmer at desks off.
Is that correct? And then

18
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.750
over here, who is a
systems analyst and project manager.

19
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.080
Yeah. Fantastic. So I thought
it would be really interesting

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.930
to sit down and talk
a little bit about you

21
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.780
guys in your career, because
even though I've traveled around

22
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.320
the world and around the
Muslim world, I was really

23
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.100
impressed with the level of
integration of women in technology

24
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.390
here in, in, in Cairo,
it looks like it's about

25
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.240
40 or 50% of this
code camp is women. And

26
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.510
I say that with shock
because 40 or 50% of

27
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.510
the population of the world
is women, but in the

28
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.410
U S I'm lucky to
see 10 or 20%, this

29
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.800
doesn't match in my head.
Is this unusual or is

30
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.880
this typical in Egypt, actually
in the it community? I

31
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.520
think it's typical to find
50, 50% of men and

32
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.020
women in universities and conferences
and in companies as well.

33
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.890
It's very typical here. Really
women and men, Oliver workplaces,

34
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.910
we worked together. So it's
usually 50, 50%. And today

35
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.640
I find it pretty weird
that that's not the case

36
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.790
in the U S and
Europe. It's pretty few read

37
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.250
to me. The, why do
you think that is? Because

38
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.690
I think that in the
U S we discourage women

39
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.440
and girls specifically young women
to get into technical things,

40
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.780
to get into math, to
get into science, to get

41
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.910
into compute and logic. And
you, then in your opinion,

42
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.140
work most in as circuitries
and the office office, they

43
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.550
don't get into technologists. They're
not, they don't get difficult

44
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.440
jobs, but It's actually, it's
weird. I don't know why

45
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.830
is that? Let's try to
see if we can figure

46
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.750
that out. Cause I think
that that's the interesting question

47
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.070
of the day. Is this
a, a, a uniquely Egyptian

48
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.260
thing, or is this something
about the Muslim world or

49
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.180
maybe the Arab world that
is do young fathers encourage

50
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.720
their women, their girl, child,
and their boy child's similarly

51
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.780
towards science and math. Okay.
Let me tell you my

52
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.570
side of the story. And
then we can try to

53
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.940
figure it out in Muslim
world. Education is very crucial.

54
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.720
We are, we are encouraged
to be educated on the

55
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.110
highest level of education since
we are three or five

56
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.980
years old. So we go
to private school. There is

57
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.590
nothing sad about not being
able to handle science and

58
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.800
mathematics. This is the first
time I've heard that from

59
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.210
you. Now. We are always
encouraged to study hard study

60
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.440
Wells. So the everything personally,
I wanted to go to

61
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.800
an art school actually, after
I graduated and the one

62
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.770
pushed me to computer science
as my father, he insisted

63
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.400
on me going to computer
science because it's, it's the

64
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.390
next booming thing and would
provide me with a better

65
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.380
career and better income and
make me a more independent

66
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.950
and useful to the community.
So we don't have that

67
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.620
kind of discrimination or difference
on the contrary, we have

68
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.060
to study well and hard
to be recognized as to

69
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.480
have our parents proud. And
our family's proud. It's it's

70
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.510
the very norm. You can
go to engineering schools here

71
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.980
and colleges, you will find
50, 50% in all levels,

72
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.660
mechanics, engineering, electronics, and everything.
So we don't have this

73
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.080
idea here on the country.
We need to study hard

74
00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.090
everything. Actually, the Egyptian parents
are usually very pushy about

75
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.280
education. So when someone gets
low degrees, they're the punching

76
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.430
them into. Yeah. And they
get frustrated there. You don't

77
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.530
mean actually punching them, but
I mean, pressuring them to

78
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.580
move and Yes, and yeah,
and they get sad because

79
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.860
of that. So Egyptian parents
are very pushy about education

80
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.520
and encouraging people to, to
get higher degrees either they

81
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.920
are girls or boys. So
do either of you have

82
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.220
a brothers or have a
younger brother. Okay. So do

83
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.750
you feel that you're being
encouraged and pushed towards greatness,

84
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.430
I guess is a good
way to put it as

85
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.580
equally as your brother? Yeah.
Yeah. Him and my father

86
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.700
actually always puts me as
a role model for my

87
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.780
brother and he wants him
to be an engineer on

88
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.050
a programmer like me. So
he really encourages him by

89
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.660
me. So the thing that
I'm trying to reconcile is

90
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.580
I think that for a
lot of the listeners who

91
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.860
may not necessarily have traveled
that much or who have

92
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.270
an assumption about, and I,
and I think that we

93
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.770
also tend to, we as
Westerners tend to group, we

94
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.550
say Arab world than Muslim
world, and then specific country

95
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.130
cultures, you know, cause not
all of the Arab world

96
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.230
is, is, is Muslim. Although
it's assumed, but there's probably

97
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.780
a 10% Coptic or Christian
here. I've, I've met a

98
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.260
number of Christians Egypt's and
sir, then there's so there's

99
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.910
the Arab world larger sense.
There's the Egyptian kind of,

100
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.370
there is the Muslim world.
And then there's the Egyptian

101
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.960
culture I'm trying to understand.
Is it one of these

102
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.140
three levels as we kind
of peel away the layers

103
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.690
that is, that is encouraging.
Is this an, a uniquely

104
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.300
Egyptian thing? Yeah. The middle
East all over the middle

105
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.040
East, you find women in
many technologies. So it's all

106
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.590
over the middle East. It's
not only Egyptian. Is this

107
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.010
a new thing? Is this
the, the new generation? Was

108
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.920
it like this in the
sixties and seventies? Is this

109
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.740
from the eighties or something?
I think it started from

110
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.510
the fifties or something because
my grandfather actually made sure

111
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.050
that my five aunts went
to education. So I'm in

112
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.850
Turkey. And so I'm in
Egypt and he was living

113
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.570
in Kuwait. So he would
send them to colleges and

114
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.750
it was the fifties. So
I think, no, it started

115
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.420
earlier. Now this is the
norm in the nineties and

116
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.180
the eighties. This is the
absolute norm. This is the

117
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.730
least you can do. Wouldn't
you say though, that this

118
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.880
is the norm in what
we would call moderate Islamic

119
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.630
countries. Because the, the messaging
that we hear, the marketing

120
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.760
quote, unquote, the marketing of
the Muslim world, that a

121
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.800
lot of Westerners here and
a lot of the Americans

122
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.370
here is this oppression of
women happening in the Muslim

123
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.410
world. But as we look
around us here at the

124
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.440
code camp, I see like
you say, 40, 50% women.

125
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.710
I see women with the
hijab, with the scarf women,

126
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.000
without everyone is talking and
interacting, sitting together. It's not

127
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.480
the seating area is not
in any way segregated where

128
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.250
we're eating, we're chatting. Is
this a moderate Arab world

129
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.090
thing? There are countries that
are not this progressive. I

130
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.390
agree. I have to agree.
Most of the Arab countries

131
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.860
are moderate, but some countries
are less, but they are

132
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:23.980
moving towards this direction because
it's, non-religious, that's actually Islam

133
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.620
as a religion, pushes people
to educate their children, boys

134
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:35.710
and girls. And by any,
by no means it discriminates

135
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.250
between a girl and a
boy. So I don't understand

136
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.770
how this happened, but I
think it's more of a

137
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.770
cultural thing than a religious
thing because in our own

138
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:53.230
illusion, everybody is equal and
that's a must actually that's

139
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.380
the basic of the religion
that everybody is equal colors,

140
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.810
gender, and nationality, anything. The
other thing you said about

141
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.330
people interacting with hijab without
to jab or different religions,

142
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.130
this is very common in
our worlds. And we, we,

143
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.270
don't never put this in
mind, whether I'm dealing with

144
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.140
a Christian. Most of my
friends are, I have a

145
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.270
lot of friends that are
Christian and have a lot

146
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.790
of girlfriends that are not
wearing hijab. And this was

147
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.150
never an issue because simply
there is no compulsion in

148
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.110
Islam. So everybody is free
to do whatever he wants.

149
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.250
Hmm. Would you say that
it is then an overly

150
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.000
strict reading of some of
the specifics of Islam that

151
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.220
have caused some other countries
to head in a direction

152
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.030
that is a little more
conservative? Because I think that

153
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.680
maybe people who are listening
to this who may not

154
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.480
be familiar with Islam, I
may not have read the

155
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.180
Koran may feel that well,
that's not what I heard.

156
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.450
I heard that I heard
that you can look up

157
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.740
and in this chapter in
the Quran and it says

158
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.110
that, you know, women must
do this and women must

159
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.270
do that. I mean, there
are things that say what

160
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.270
the relationship between a husband
and wife should be. And

161
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.600
there are sections of the
Koran that do discuss about

162
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.920
the appropriateness of certain interactions
between men and women. True.

163
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.450
But it puts a rights
on both sides, the man

164
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.730
and the woman, you will
never find a part of

165
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:26.000
Koran that just asks women
to do something. And not

166
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.420
men, that's not true except
for hijab, maybe because for

167
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.710
obvious reasons, but you'll never
find that in, in Koran.

168
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.230
Absolutely no, no, no way.
You will find rules. If

169
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.680
you will find directions for
a better life, a better

170
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.750
standards, ethics and stuff, but
it applies on both genders.

171
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.390
You don't find that in
a specific way to women.

172
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.820
So this is really interesting.
So applying this to the

173
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.280
business of software, because I'm
talking to a programmer and

174
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.770
then a systems analyst, I
came to your, to your

175
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.580
company and got a tour
and I was kind of

176
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.420
impressed and heartened to find
you guys working in what

177
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.090
I could only describe as
kind of a scrum like

178
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.360
environment. It is, it is
actually, that's very accurate. It

179
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.940
was, it is a scrum
project and an agile project.

180
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.820
We are leaning very strongly
towards a giant now and

181
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.210
as crime environment, because simply
it tightens the, and tightens

182
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.160
the communication between, between the
team and relies more on

183
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.280
individuals. And it's like, it's
like a small family in

184
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.820
the room. So everybody, everyone
that has a question or

185
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.450
a problem is supported always.
And that's, that's the way

186
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.700
we will. Yeah. I would
say that I was, I

187
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.930
considered myself fairly enlightened and
educated about how the way

188
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.750
of the world is. But
when I arrived in Egypt

189
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.970
and went into a room
and found, I think about

190
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.410
10 people around a room,
all working together, co located,

191
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.030
and there was a, what
appeared to be an, a

192
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.850
Kanban board up on the
wall. Was that correct? That's

193
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.280
true. And I'm looking at
the post it's saying done,

194
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.500
not done working and all
this kind of thing. Yeah.

195
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.870
I would have to say
that again, using the, the

196
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.000
lens by which I view
the Muslim world as a

197
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.450
westerner, I am surprised to
see you guys working literally

198
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.220
kind of shoulder to shoulder
in this room as, as

199
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.210
we would call it a
war room. Right. I mean,

200
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.640
it's just like you guys
chose to do this, to

201
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.130
make your project successful. You
chose to co-locate. I actually

202
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.740
mentioned that to the boss
and he's like, Oh yeah,

203
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.080
this is how they want
to run this project. It

204
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.890
doesn't seem to me like
it's compatible with what I

205
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.870
understood. The way things worked
over here. Just unique. No,

206
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.990
I was just about to
say, you will find this

207
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.560
in now. You will find
it in almost every company

208
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.130
that there is at least
one or two projects running

209
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.520
on a giant mythologies. Everybody's
in the room and everybody's

210
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.330
working together. I've been to
several companies that worked on

211
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.510
projects with the same methodology
over the past two years.

212
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.960
So let me say, as
a, as a programmer is,

213
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.940
have you always worked on
agile projects as long as

214
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.180
your career? Or have you
worked in other ways? No.

215
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.130
I usually work on agile
projects actually. I'm now transferring

216
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:20.070
into a system or care
transfer. Yeah. Transformation of your

217
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.520
career. So, but all of
my projects were agile at

218
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.630
two, and it's a way
better than the CMI or

219
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:34.950
something's great. Co-operative between the
team members makes everyone helpful

220
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.590
And you'd find it compatible
with the way the culture

221
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.960
works. There was no thought
like, Oh, we're going to

222
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.340
work this closely together. We're
not going to No, no,

223
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.140
no, no, no, please, no.
We, we go together to

224
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.050
college. We go together to
school, men and women. So

225
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.600
we, we are used to
that, all of our lives.

226
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.750
How long have you two
been in the industry? If

227
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.820
you don't mind Event three
in five years now, we're

228
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.290
I think seven years a
year. And if you have

229
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.380
you worked at multiple companies
or only at Dasha and

230
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.980
for me, it's only their
stuff I've worked in like

231
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.950
five companies, I think five
women, seven years. Yeah. And

232
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.930
some are nice. I know
it looks bad. I know.

233
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.890
Yeah. I don't know if
they, even as agile as,

234
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.770
as, let me say this
experience has been for the

235
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.890
past three years. Yeah, really?
Yeah. Before it wasn't, this

236
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.520
is a movement, this agile
way of managing projects and

237
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:38.160
systems is absolutely global and
cross-cultural. Yeah, Because it has

238
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.580
proven value to everybody. It
has proven to work more

239
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.340
effectively with clients and with
the team and everybody's happy

240
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.970
and content. So why not?
Do you have a scrum

241
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.520
masters or agile coaches that
have come in from either

242
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.240
other Egypt or outside of
Egypt? Or how did, how

243
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.030
did you each as a
systems analyst and then now

244
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.100
as a programmer who is
transitioning into a role as

245
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.680
assistant manager, how do you
learn this and, and, and

246
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:09.400
use best practices First introduced
to <inaudible> through an agile

247
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.250
coach? Yeah, he came, but
he was an Egyptian with

248
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.430
a PhD from the United States
on the job. And he

249
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.790
came and he gave us
a training and he coached

250
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.880
a program. That's how I,
I was initiated to the

251
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.040
jail. If we can say
for me, it's a bit

252
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.310
different. We started agile. So
we, yeah, we started to

253
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.880
read about agile Oliver, all
of the team now. And

254
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.640
we started helping each other
to understand agile. We started

255
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:40.300
to, to apply different methodologies
and practices. And so we

256
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.240
were trying to reach the,
the best practice of using

257
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.510
agile, but we didn't, we
didn't use a coach or

258
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:50.020
something to, to help us
through a job. It was

259
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.710
all self, self reading in
self practicing. How many people

260
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.230
are on the team of
the project that you're, We're

261
00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:01.300
now eight or seven. So
we have a team leader

262
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:07.180
and three developers. And when
DBA and me is assistant

263
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.650
managers and area is, is
a senior system analyst. And

264
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.360
at the same time. Okay.
And what does a systems

265
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.760
analyst in the context of
how you're using that word?

266
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.010
Cause that that word is
kind of an overloaded term.

267
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.010
You know, it can be
anything, he'd be the person

268
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.210
who is the bridge between
the business and the Yes.

269
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.520
Yeah, exactly. That's how we
contact the customer and get

270
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.880
the, the requirements from the
customer and transfer, transform it

271
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.230
into terms that team can
understand. Then we plan together

272
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.970
the sprint. And then we
are where delivering to the

273
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.650
customer, what he wants. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman from

274
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.930
another parallel universe, got to
tell you about some of

275
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.390
our things our sponsors are
doing. They make this free

276
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.930
podcast possible. If you're developing
a new line of business

277
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.450
application, you've probably tried the
latest version of server lines.

278
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.210
Now you can get even
better results by combining the

279
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.210
functionality and server for beta,
with some of the richness

280
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.280
or the third party controls
from our friends at Tellerik,

281
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.760
they're the first vendors to
offer native support for the

282
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.340
server Lite for beta and
their rad controls. You've got

283
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.490

dot and rock supporting Hansel
minutes on their Facebook fan

291
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.590
page at facebook.com/tellerik. Now back
to the show, what kind

292
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.050
of tools are you using
to maintain a product backlog?

293
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.420
Sometimes there are specific scrum
tools and it can be

294
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.640
something that you would buy
and host, or it can

295
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.770
be as simple as a
list of posted notes. No,

296
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.270
it's actually a video, the
team system. And of course

297
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.150
the information role we used
to, we put the E

298
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.130
the posted notes of the
tusks. So we move it

299
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.210
every day in this Chrome
meeting. So are you using

300
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.670
some of the scrum templates
for the team system or

301
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:08.180
Yes. It's creme for SIEM
systems. Contango. Yeah. Template. Yeah.

302
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.920
Contango. Yeah. So it's a
contango scrum templates for TFS.

303
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.360
Now you guys are actually
an outsource you're you are

304
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.880
outsourced. So you're on the
other end of outsourcing, right?

305
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.190
This is being driven from
another country. Yes. I work

306
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.510
for a Remi current company
in the Netherlands and the

307
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.020
older customers are in the
Netherlands. So they're only an

308
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.510
hour away. So effectively you
don't have the kind of

309
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.620
outsourcing problems. No. But other
teams do have the, they

310
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.040
work for a Canadian, a
Canadian customers. So they have

311
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:45.050
like seven, seven hours difference
their time zone. Yeah. What

312
00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.020
are some of the challenges
that you've, you've dealt with?

313
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.090
I mean, I think, again,
speaking from the point of

314
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:51.800
view of an American, which
is the only point of

315
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.160
view that I know at
this point, the Dutch and

316
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.370
the Egyptians are as pretty
different culture. I mean, the

317
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.670
culture is equally out there
as I think Americans perceive

318
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.290
them. They, they are a
world to be out there.

319
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.380
What does that relationship like?
Hey, this are pretty decent.

320
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:11.240
People exited Mean decent people,
but you know, they're extremely

321
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:19.130
progressive socially progressive individuals. Yeah.
Actually they, the theme American

322
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.950
with and the Netherlands are
pretty helpful and we work

323
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.950
together pretty well. So I
don't think cultural differences interfere

324
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.920
ever whether work in an
it community because we all

325
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.160
have the basic same knowledge.
We have the basic same

326
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:40.100
thinking. We are all focused
on a very different goal,

327
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.670
which is to develop a
good product that makes everybody

328
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.940
happy, that testifies the needs
of the client. So I

329
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.390
don't see, we never get
into cultural differences that is

330
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.760
never an issue. And I
have, I have the chance

331
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.500
to work with an American
client using an angina methodology.

332
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.070
And the time difference was
like seven or eight hours.

333
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.460
And we just adjusted rework
a little bit plate and,

334
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.730
and the whole team started
coming to us at noon

335
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.990
and leaving at the evening.
It's, it's pretty much just

336
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:16.820
logistics, but never had any
cultural issues interfere in the

337
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.600
job. Never. Yeah. And w
would you, let me, let

338
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.220
me see if I can
paraphrase a little bit. Would

339
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.590
you say that it is
the culture of being a,

340
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.280
a programmer or maybe even
going so far to say

341
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.610
that nerds are the same
everywhere? You know what I'm

342
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.250
saying? I have to agree
with that. Although this is

343
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.530
not what I meant, but
yeah, because we have the

344
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.290
same education, the same way
of thinking. You have to

345
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.260
admit that we think a
little bit differently than everybody

346
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.370
does from an it point
of view. So we, we

347
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:52.510
share a base of understanding
and knowledge that makes everything

348
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.600
easier. Even with clients. I
mean, I had a client

349
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.620
that has absolutely no idea
about how it works, but

350
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.160
she just had faith in
the team and she would

351
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.080
say what she wants. And
we would tell her how

352
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.450
the best way to do
it. And we call Pruitt.

353
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.710
It's still, I think we
were having, having a shared

354
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.340
goal is what makes everything
easier and drives everybody as

355
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.860
long as we are both
committed and we have faith

356
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.310
in each other. That's a
really, that's a really positive

357
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.580
attitude. Do you think that
that's maybe an overly idealized

358
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.180
attitude That has been my
experience so far? I think

359
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:33.300
absolutely. There are different experiences,
but can we say it's

360
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.840
the majority? I think that's
the exception. Okay. What are

361
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.940
some of the things that
you've struggled with if time

362
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.390
zones are not too much
trouble? And are you back,

363
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.790
are you having any bandwidth
issues or power issues? Do

364
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.760
you just do the work
locally or are you remoting

365
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.060
into other people's machines? What's
the general setup. We, the

366
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.450
developer, the development environment is
in Egypt and we deploy

367
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.900
it on a remote environment
for the client to see,

368
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.010
we don't have bandwidth issue
or a communications issue. We

369
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.970
all use Cabi or a
voice over IP. So we

370
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.530
never faced any technical challenges
in terms of technology. It's

371
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.370
just the distance. And sometimes
we have issues with the

372
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.940
remote deployment, but it's usually
fixed within a day or

373
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.750
two. So it sounds like
the infrastructure of a, of,

374
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.320
of Egypt, which is there
are other countries in North

375
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.240
Africa that have a little
bit more trouble with their

376
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.820
infrastructure. You have, haven't gotten
in trouble with your internet

377
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.160
connections here. No, I think
Egypt is one of the

378
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.620
most advanced countries in, in
African, the middle East in

379
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:42.030
terms of infrastructure. Because in
other countries you will find

380
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.550
this as a, as a
problem, but here the norm

381
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.790
is having a DSL line
in every house. So you

382
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.190
can find that you can
chase a problem like this

383
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.730
here pretty much improving now
over time. So we have

384
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.200
a larger bandwidth and the
wireless connections are starting to

385
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.750
be in every cafe or
something starting to improve over

386
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.330
time. No, I, I, and
in the U S I'm

387
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.360
in a, a, a unique,
but growing group of remote

388
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.670
workers, I do a lot
of work from home. Cause

389
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.900
I don't live in Seattle.
If you have the option

390
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.880
to work from home, if
you know, if there's a

391
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.980
sick child or something that
needs to be managed at

392
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.470
home. Yes, we do have
that too. And do you

393
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.630
have internet straight to your
home or do you use

394
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:28.350
3g? And we have internet
every, every, I think every

395
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.250
homeowner is having a DSL
line. Now I, I forgive

396
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.290
me if I'm asking silly
questions here, you guys are

397
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.420
looking at each other like,
yeah. I mean, who doesn't

398
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.720
have internet? We recently had
a, a report in the

399
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.420
U S that about 35%
of people in the U

400
00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.790
S use, dial up. No,
I, no one uses dialogue

401
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:52.010
here, really, especially in the
IC community now, because it's

402
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.890
a must to go through
college to have an internet.

403
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.350
So you have to have
internet the SLR, Really. So

404
00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.660
DSL is the minimum. There's
no dial up around here

405
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.230
for at least for the
it people. No, not that

406
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.980
the statistic I gave that
just came out in the

407
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.500
U S it's 30 to
35%. This is the larger

408
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.160
general popular. No, I think
this is pretty reasonable. I

409
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.620
think it might be a
little less even in here,

410
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.280
but, but, and on it
community, the norm is DSL

411
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.010
line. I'm getting back a
little bit to the concept

412
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.430
of, of, of women in
technology. Are there any barriers

413
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.290
when you come, when you
choose to have kids, or

414
00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.350
if your husband is also
working in, in the industry

415
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.470
or is it where you
have to choose to stay

416
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.020
home or not with the
child or where you have

417
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.140
your grandparents to take care
of the kids? Oh, there

418
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.630
are a lot of solutions.
I think most of the

419
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.230
women in the Arctic community
already are married and have

420
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.830
kids. Usually the law here
is to have a maternity

421
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.800
leave for three months. And
after that, a lot of

422
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.710
women abused their parents, babies,
or the child, or pull

423
00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:02.560
them in, in, in a
nursery. Some companies now have

424
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.610
nurseries in the company, like
the GUC the GC have

425
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.220
a nursery for the employees
to have Cancer. Do you

426
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.470
see it here as the
German university? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

427
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:16.210
The German university uses the
concept and it's it's I

428
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.150
have to say it's, it's
going very well. And it's

429
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.960
a very widespread idea. So
no, we don't have that

430
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.950
constraints unless you're not able
to satisfy your child's need

431
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.190
that in that concept. You
will probably put his best

432
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.490
interests first. Yeah, of course.
So let me ask you

433
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.790
this, then it seems like
you guys, and I'm referring

434
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.330
here to Egyptians seem to
have got this male, female

435
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.510
engineering thing worked out. What
can you help us? What

436
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.390
can you tell us what
tips or advice? Because it

437
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.990
seems like the in, in,
in, in the States, we

438
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.350
don't do enough to encourage
young women in technology, such

439
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.790
that they may even decide
that, you know, quote unquote,

440
00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.610
math is hard by the
time they're 10. And I

441
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.180
see this in my nieces,
you know, and my, my,

442
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.070
I have two boys, but
my, my family members that

443
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.500
have daughters that by the
time the child is 12

444
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.460
or 13, if they haven't
gotten hooked on science, the,

445
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.660
the, the women, the young
girls may have just given

446
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.540
up, is this something that
needs to happen at the

447
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.620
parent at the parental level
or The school level? I

448
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.270
think everyone shares the responsibility.
The parents need to, to

449
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.490
mainly focus with their kids
and never let them have

450
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.540
the idea that they can
do something because evidently math

451
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.130
is not hard for a
woman and apparently not. Yeah.

452
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:44.220
So the concept propagated by
the media and the, this

453
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.820
to you typing of being
unable to understand math is,

454
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:52.230
is a myth. I think
it's the responsibility of society

455
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.580
as a whole, to, to
eliminate that myth and foremost

456
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.970
as the responsibility of schools
and the parents. Because if

457
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.490
I tell my daughter, you,
you might understand math. She

458
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.270
will never even try to,
it's a mental, it's a

459
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:10.170
mental barrier. So if you
eliminate that mental barrier and

460
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.320
show role models of women
in the technology, I think

461
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.470
everything will go well. Yeah.
I think there is maybe

462
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.310
their daughters too much of
a, of science or something.

463
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.100
That's why they don't even
try. So they have to

464
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.880
encourage them more into, into,
into math and science. They

465
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.300
may show them small, small
price of it when they

466
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.290
are charged. And it may,
may make them encouraged to

467
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.460
go into that business. And
am I hearing both of

468
00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.380
you say that your parents
very much encourage you to

469
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.830
get into this field, even
for you beyond art, you

470
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.560
have to have is like,
Hey yeah, focus on computers.

471
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.210
You probably have to do
art on the side. Do

472
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.720
you, do you have memories
of them, of your parents

473
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.570
being interested in things that
are science, watching science shows

474
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.000
on TV and walking around
and looking at bugs and

475
00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:00.410
all that kind of Yes.
Yeah. Going to science museums.

476
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.440
My father took me a
couple of times to science

477
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.810
museum and showed me around.
He started to ask people

478
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:13.160
about the computer business since
he was 15 or something.

479
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.580
So he prepares me for
that since it was a

480
00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.940
teenager, he starts to ask
people about it. And if

481
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.290
it's good for me or
bad for me. So they

482
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.360
started encouraging us pretty, pretty
young. Was your father in

483
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.090
the business or was he,
he's an English teacher. Oh,

484
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:36.560
really? Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. And
what about your family? Same

485
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.190
applies here. My parents are
architects, both of them, but

486
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.730
my father is pretty much
into technology. I remember having

487
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.970
an IBM PC at home
whenever, when early in the

488
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.030
days when it was like
these large flip floppy desks

489
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.780
and everything's running on doors,
the windows green, and that's

490
00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.970
it. I have this at
home. I still have it.

491
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.180
I think so. And he
would just upgrade the system

492
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:08.990
every time, anything, new games,
new games. And so I

493
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:14.180
grew up having technology at
home. Actually, I was very

494
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.730
good at math and my
father noticed that when I

495
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.570
was young. So he, he
was always telling me, you

496
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.230
gotta be an engineer because
you're good at math. So

497
00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:31.460
I think that push into
being something that's as valuable.

498
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:37.850
And knowing that I Excel
in math and technologies are

499
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:44.710
at home, is made thinking
of, is, is evidence a

500
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.580
result of my education? Oh,
it definitely sounds like you've

501
00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.320
kind of, you've kind of
nailed it right there, which

502
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.930
is the, you had technology
around you all the time.

503
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.190
You had encouragement all the
time. Your parents identify that

504
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.040
you had a skill and
reminded you of that all

505
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.380
the time. Hey, you can
do this. This is interesting.

506
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.570
You have the, you have
the power. And I think

507
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:06.960
that that's definitely the formula
for success regardless of gender.

508
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.440
Absolutely. I was the math
genius of the home. My

509
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.830
sister was the science genius
of the home and she's

510
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:19.890
a girl, so no, we
never have this, this, I

511
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.380
don't know what to call
it. Even this limitation, the

512
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.360
stereotype limitation of not me
able to do something. I

513
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.840
think it always comes to
what they expect from you.

514
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.180
If they expect you to
be a doctor or an

515
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.850
engineer, you will do your
best to be a doctor

516
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.790
or an engineer. But if
the society as a whole

517
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.330
treats you as less and
expect less from you, or

518
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:47.940
even not less, but different
a model of what you

519
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.390
should be as a woman,
probably you are gonna go

520
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:56.490
naturally into that direction. So
this might be a weird,

521
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.370
this might be a weird
question, but do you think

522
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.940
that the, there there is
less because there is less

523
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.330
or visibly less? And the
only way I can think

524
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:10.440
about this as the less
sexualization of women in public,

525
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.440
that this enables you to
be more of an equal,

526
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.630
I mean, in the U
S some women, some young

527
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:16.950
women might say, well, I
want to be in a

528
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.860
music video, or I want
to go do dancing or

529
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.100
other kinds of things that
are unique to their sex

530
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:27.330
and possible only because they
are women, because that's not

531
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.780
something that is encouraged or
out in the public, people

532
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.150
are people. And there are,
other than the hijab, there

533
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.520
is really no gender distinction
about what you can do.

534
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.040
Would you, would you think
that that's the, that's the

535
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.060
case Today? They're pretty different
going in a music video

536
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.980
and being an engineer. So
they're pretty different, extremely different

537
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.280
careers. But what I'm saying
is that, that, that idea

538
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.800
that, well, math is hard.
The only thing I can

539
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.010
do is use my body
to, you know, my, my

540
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.400
woman to get a job.
Well, here, I'm hearing, I'm

541
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.440
hearing, I'm only hearing brains.
I'm hearing. I can use

542
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.880
my brain in this way.
I can use my brain

543
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.250
in that way. Yeah. It
might be the case men.

544
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:09.000
I think if women in
us are encouraging more too,

545
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.270
that they can do it
to go into science and

546
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:16.140
math definitely would do it.
I think I have to

547
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.110
agree with your conclusion a
little bit more than Lemmys,

548
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.150
because I think it's now
built in, in, in their

549
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.820
brains that they are, this,
this is the best I

550
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.850
can do. This is, wow.
This is the, the ambition,

551
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.980
The idea that I'm a
woman first, and I should

552
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:36.750
look towards my womanliness to
support myself as opposed to

553
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:43.310
my intellectual and in our
culture, Our sexuality is not

554
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.830
the, the main at all.
It's not the main asset

555
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.190
that we have at all,
because our gender and our

556
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:57.170
body, or whatever it is
is, is, is typically needed

557
00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:02.780
for family and for husband
and the kids. And that's

558
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:07.100
why that's, those are the
people that will benefit from

559
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.810
me being a woman, as
a woman, typically in the

560
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:15.020
normal society. That's not the
case. And I'm just a

561
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.690
person that is a productive
person. And this is what

562
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.320
Well, and this is one
of the things that I'm

563
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.810
realizing that even myself, as
what I think of myself

564
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.530
as a fairly forward thinking
and progressive individual, I still

565
00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:30.400
have these built in Western
stereotypes of women versus men.

566
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.710
And I hope you won't
be offended to me, but

567
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.510
I'll tell you what, this
little bit of information I've

568
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:38.290
been interacting with you on
email for three months as

569
00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.800
we've been organizing this. And
I've had literally dozens of

570
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.950
email conversations with you. And
I didn't know that you

571
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.130
were a woman until I
arrived at the airport and

572
00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.200
the man, the man who
picked me up at the

573
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.440
airport and handed me the
telephone. And you said, hi,

574
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.320
it's Lemmys. And I said,
in my mind, I went,

575
00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:00.730
well, That's shocking. I don't
know. See, I don't know

576
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.560
Lamesa is a man's name
or a woman's name. So

577
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.450
of course, if I was
familiar with Arabic names, I

578
00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:07.270
would know, but it took
me a moment and I

579
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.900
was actually a little ashamed
of myself because I had

580
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.800
any reaction at all, because
I'm so used to a

581
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.730
proliferation of men in technology
that I just, again, I

582
00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:22.720
apologize. I assumed that in
Arab country that the organizers

583
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.480
would be men. And I'm
not saying that I had

584
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.180
the thought and set the
thought it was just a

585
00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.670
background assumption. Yeah. So, yeah,
I literally, I landed in

586
00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.980
the airport and the man
said, Oh, Lemmys wants to

587
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.840
talk to you. And I
said, hello? And I expected

588
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.980
her. Oh, and I got
you. So I, I, that

589
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.590
got me thinking about this
topic and got me excited

590
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.330
to sit down with you
guys and chat with you

591
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:50.300
about this today. Yeah. And
we have pretty much, pretty

592
00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:55.510
much changes to technology. Actually.
It's shocking me that he

593
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.080
didn't realize that, but it's
pretty, yeah. Pretty common here.

594
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.390
Why should? And this is
where I'm learning too, is

595
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.340
that why should it matter?
And I think that's the

596
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.460
whole point and a good
place to end our podcast

597
00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.390
today. Thank you very much
for talking to me today

598
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.540
here at Cairo university in
Cairo, Egypt. This has been

599
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.030
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'll see you again

600
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.510
next week.
