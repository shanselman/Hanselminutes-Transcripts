00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.300
talks with his wife Mo
about relationships with the technically

9
00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.300
oriented. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

10
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.590
of Hansel minutes. It is
Christmas Eve Eve, and the

11
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.560
presents are wrapped. The children
are asleep and we are

12
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.650
doing a podcast. Hi. Hey
love. How are you? I'm

13
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.170
okay. Small life. How are
you? Very well, thank you.

14
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.000
This is my wife Mo
IMO. Hey Scott. We've had

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.100
Moe on the show. A
couple of times, one of

16
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.870
our more popular. One of
our, she had looked at

17
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.690
me saying in the third
person, like there's more than

18
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.080
one. You there's me and
Lawrence basically, but you know,

19
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.100
the Royal, the Royal Hanselman,
one of our more popular

20
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.240
shows was the relationship tips
with Mo I think that

21
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.880
was just episode two 14.
And then of course, we

22
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.910
did a show with our
little medical situation last year.

23
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.100
If you're not familiar with
that, go and take a

24
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
look at this developer's life.com
and you can hear all

25
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760
about that and we'll do
a followup. I love that

26
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.110
our little medical situation. How
do you want, how do

27
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.520
you want to call it?
Yeah, it sounds good to

28
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.930
me. Well, you could call
it our cancer year or

29
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.480
you could call it our
little medical situation either way.

30
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.450
Indeed. Do you have a
preference? A little medical situation.

31
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.900
Sounds good. Okay, cool. I
think it was interesting that

32
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.230
you insisted on getting a
piece of paper before. Like

33
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.940
we were sitting here getting
ready to do the show

34
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.280
and you're like, I need,
I need a piece of

35
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.770
paper because we need to
write down like the agenda.

36
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.860
And then I said to
him here, take the iPad.

37
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.920
And you're like, no, I
need a piece of paper.

38
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.280
You haven't written on the
paper though. You just have

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.590
it here. I'm going to
write on it. When you

40
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.930
get out of hand, mid
show, it's going to be

41
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.290
quicker for me to write
the show. Isn't edited. Like

42
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.580
I'm not going to stop
in the middle and give

43
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.440
you an opportunity to write,
but your need for the

44
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.680
paper was really interesting. Of
course makes me feel like

45
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.830
I'm in control. You know,
like you were in control

46
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.280
of your flip phone that
you recently upgraded from. Oh

47
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.280
yeah. Well that's that's disaster.
So I mean, what, having

48
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.650
a flip phone or upgrading
to a flip? No, no,

49
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.520
I didn't upgrade to a
flip phone. Right, but you

50
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.370
had a flip phone up
until like April. Oh yeah.

51
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.290
I mean, I just I'm
teasing you with the paper

52
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.640
and the flip phone. I
mean, just like, what is

53
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.150
it? What is it like
in 1995? That's it? That's

54
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.100
it? Yeah. No, I mean,
look, you gotta do what

55
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.170
works for you. Right. You
know, I really liked my

56
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.100
flip phone, but I think
the real pressure came from

57
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.330
my family and what's app.
I just, the, the texting

58
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.030
application. Yeah. For most people
that don't know it, it

59
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.390
allowed me to text with
my family. Almost like, like

60
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.970
texting, except it didn't cost
me anywhere near as much

61
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.280
as it did. You know?
So that was why in

62
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.800
the end, I, I gave
into peer pressure and I

63
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.540
have graded, but yeah, you
gotta, you gotta do, it

64
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.010
works for you, you know,
paper, paper and pencil is

65
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.260
still good for me. It
helps me think clearer and

66
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.680
better and process better and
faster than if I'm using

67
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.560
my iPad or anything else.
So, yeah. Yeah. I mean,

68
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.690
I tease about that, but
I've, I've talked about this

69
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.260
before in my productivity videos,
where if you get stressed

70
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.890
out, turn off the computer,
get the paper. And if

71
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.630
you, and I don't know
you do this sometimes, like

72
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.690
I lay multiple sheets of
paper out on the floor.

73
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.650
Like that's the way I
get more resolution. Right. People,

74
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.720
people will say, Oh, I
need another monitor. Cause I

75
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.520
can't see everything I'm working
on. But what I'll do

76
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.110
is I'll print it all
out and then lay it

77
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.860
out on the floor and
then back away. Okay. That's

78
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.690
just crazy talk. I don't
know what that's about. No,

79
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.480
well, you've taken over like
the living, like the dining

80
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.330
room table is covered in
paper. Like you spread it

81
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.760
out, right? Don't you take
your notes and put them

82
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.170
on the floor and then
back away to get the

83
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.930
big, Oh, I take my
notes and I studied them

84
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.270
to get the big picture.
You've never done that. Am

85
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.890
I the only person who's
ever been backed away from?

86
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.460
Yeah. I mean less the
literal paper, but more the,

87
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.740
you know, any situation, right?
I mean, you and I

88
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.170
are notorious for our disagreements
when I'll just say, okay,

89
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.910
I'm done here. You know?
And I feel like I

90
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.390
need to walk away from
the situation slowly. Step backwards.

91
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.660
Yeah, Sure. No. Well, I'm
talking about like, if, if,

92
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.490
if things are overwhelming, I
don't know about you, but

93
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.800
like there's like Evernote in
one note and all this

94
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.840
stuff where you can keep
track of your life. Right?

95
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.700
Like when I get, you
know, you've noticed when I

96
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.410
get stressed out about my
calendar, what do I do?

97
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.780
I print the calendar in
the calendar and I put

98
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.570
it on the, put on
the floor and I stand

99
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.760
as tall as I can
or standing on a chair

100
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.950
just to kind of go,
okay. I can see the

101
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.020
whole year from here. That's
how you, that's how you

102
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.800
get retina display. Right? Right.
Big picture. Yeah. It all

103
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.160
together. Yeah. No, I hear,
I hear have I provided

104
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.670
adequate tech support to you?
You in fact have not

105
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.920
Hang on. So you find,
you find my technical skills

106
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.650
inadequate. Oh, I was going
to say lacking, but sure.

107
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.660
Inadequate works too. We can,
we can go with that.

108
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.510
Suboptimal. Some power need. I
go on here The nine

109
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.520
day trip or in this
case it was the longest

110
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.380
trip I've taken in a
couple of years. It was

111
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.590
the 11 or 12 days.
Right. Right. But it happened

112
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.130
to be back to back
with the smaller trips. So

113
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.590
it felt like a lot
more than, yeah. Yeah. I

114
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.810
wouldn't say every six months
you have a long trip.

115
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.820
I'd say every three, four
months you have a couple

116
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.070
of trips back and to
each other almost where you're,

117
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.580
you know, you're gone for
four days. You're back two

118
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.860
days, you've gone five days
back, three type of thing.

119
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.840
And it feels, it feels
like a month to go

120
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.480
on, but it's not really
a mine, Lowercase F but

121
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.220
we fight about this idea
of like, am I really

122
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.470
gone that long? And I'm
not like, I'm not like,

123
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.620
like these traveling salesman that
you see, it's like, they

124
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.930
leave, they leave on Sunday
and they come back on

125
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.960
Saturday. You know what I'm
saying? It's a couple of

126
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.500
days a month, but it's
consistent. But what happens like

127
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.650
you were saying is like
in March and October, like

128
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.800
when you have like build
or tech, it, they, they

129
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.200
butt up against each other.
They do kind of, And

130
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.650
of course, inevitably, you know,
when you're here, everything works,

131
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.110
everything is fine. And the
second you turn your back,

132
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.590
everything falls apart. And it's
impossible. We never reboot the

133
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.640
router. Except when I leave,
that's it? The Vontage the

134
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.730
voiceover IP. Every time I
leave, we lose the dial

135
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.490
tone. Yep. Yep. All of
a sudden we're sitting without

136
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.090
a phone with no computer
and it's like, okay. And

137
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.420
the setup that you've got
is so fancy and so

138
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.110
slick, nobody has any ideas
how to fix it, you

139
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.220
know? So do, do you
provide adequate tech support? You

140
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.840
do not, sir. You do.
I feel like it's really

141
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.450
quite simple set up. There's
a server in the closet,

142
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.080
right? That's where the files
are. Right. There's just a

143
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.960
small issue. That for some
reason you're unable to access

144
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.050
those files. Yeah. I don't
know why. I don't know

145
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.700
why, what it is about
your account that will not

146
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.890
let you get those files.
I don't know. We've tried

147
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.170
now three laptops for you
and all of them have

148
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.270
the same problems. So it
must be your username. I

149
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.680
don't know what to do.
What I like is that

150
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.350
you actually seeing it too.
Well now with the third

151
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.140
laptop, this is okay. I
get it. Something is wrong.

152
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.110
Yeah, of course. The other
two, you had this sitting

153
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.780
there quietly thinking, Oh, my
wife is such a fool.

154
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.780
You had the grace. Not
just said, but There was

155
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.460
a time when I thought
there may have been an

156
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.940
error between the chair and
the keyboard. That's right. That's

157
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.210
diplomatic. Then you go. But
no, I mean, you know,

158
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.220
I, I we've talked about
it this way. You said,

159
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.830
you know, you're not going
to get any better support

160
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.200
than with me. And I
think to myself, ha I

161
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.300
laugh at that stage. Let's
see, this is the thing

162
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.990
computers don't always work. Like
it doesn't matter whether it's

163
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.560
Mac or PC or PlayStation
or whatever, like stuff just

164
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.870
doesn't work. It's a miracle
that it works at all.

165
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.500
Frankly. It was frustrating to
those of us that are

166
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.960
not in this space because
so much faith is put

167
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.500
on these things. Right. I
mean, goodness, you know, it's

168
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.750
like my whole life is
now stuck on this machine

169
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.850
and I can't get it
out. So when you're not

170
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.870
here and it dies, it's
like, okay, so what am

171
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.210
I options here? You know,
which is frustrating. Then I

172
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.120
think to myself, you know,
it must be like that.

173
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.340
I'd be curious to know
what happens for your listeners

174
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:45.130
between a techie and a
non-techie it's like, would I

175
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.550
do better to just pay
for regular support tech support?

176
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.800
If, if I may finish
before you jump in there.

177
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.390
Cause I can see you're
getting ready to jump in.

178
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.970
And the reason for that
is if I'm paying for

179
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.450
the support, it's not going
to talk back to me

180
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.120
and it's not going to
look down its nose at

181
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.070
me, you know, this kind
of support that I'd get

182
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.770
from best buy or whatever.
It's gotta be more professional

183
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.820
and more courteous than you.
So you feel that you

184
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.850
would get better tech support
from someone at best buy

185
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.120
than me Better, maybe a
little harsh, but certainly more

186
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.440
polite and more, you know,
more restrained. The thing is

187
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.020
you'll you'll ask a question
like why doesn't like, like

188
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.620
you were taking a chemistry
class last term in school.

189
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.010
You're you're getting yet another
degree, right? Not that you

190
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.900
have a lot of degrees,
but you do. And now

191
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.570
you're getting another one and
you're doing a chemistry class

192
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.990
and you were like, why
is this not working? It

193
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:43.040
worked before. Right. And why
is this not working? Was

194
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.010
the question you want an
answer? But the answer was,

195
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.860
well, you were in Firefox
in another machine with an

196
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.720
older version of Java. Now
you're in Chrome on this

197
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.280
machine, but then you were
an eye on that one

198
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.440
and you need to be
using this one browser because

199
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.100
your company, your schools system
is out of date that,

200
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.200
that, you know, and then
you're like, that's way too

201
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.870
much history. Right? Just tell
me why it doesn't work.

202
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.280
But I'm like, well, why
it doesn't work requires at

203
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.330
least five paragraphs and a
history lesson and possibly some

204
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:17.390
white boarding, the handsome in
style and whiteboard. And usually

205
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.940
when I bring the whiteboard
out that you're like, okay,

206
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.860
but see, this is the
part that's frustrating. Then you're

207
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.330
like, I'm just going to
find someone else to do

208
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.420
tech support. This is the
thing in the nineties. You

209
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.220
could hire somebody to do
tech support. I don't think

210
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.900
those people exist anymore. You're
going to have to pay

211
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.490
someone like real money. Like
it will cost more than

212
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.430
the laptop is worth to
get support, to get someone

213
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.520
to come to the house
and work on your router.

214
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.160
No, man, they don't need
to come to the house.

215
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.520
They can talk me through
it because they will speak

216
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.790
my language. They will, they
will bring it down to

217
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.120
my level and not, I
think this is what happens

218
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.790
with between spouses though. You
know, we're joking about you

219
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.670
teach him how to drive,
drive a stick. And I

220
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.110
was saying, I just don't
think we could do it

221
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:04.790
without killing each other because
Well, it's just because there's

222
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.980
two ways. There's two ways
to teach someone how to

223
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.620
drive a stick. Yeah. There's
the way you want it,

224
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.270
which is efficient, organized, methodical.
You want me to say

225
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.780
lift your left foot up?
Well, pressing forward slightly with

226
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.080
your right foot. And that's,
that's the mechanical how to

227
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.230
drive a stick. Right. But
what I want is to

228
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.140
explain to you the history
of the internal combustion engine

229
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.800
and then how it relates
to clutching. Right? Right. And

230
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.520
through that lesson of history,
we will work together the

231
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.430
journey of our way to
the modern engine, which cause

232
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.140
you don't know what you
got to see how to

233
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:47.000
visualize the clutch and the
disengaging and the engaging of

234
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.660
the clutch now. And then
why too deep for me.

235
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.030
I mean, especially with a
truck coming right at us

236
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.800
know in that moment, perhaps
a quick 32nd response might

237
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.380
be Hoovers might save our
lives better than, you know,

238
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.010
the full blown seven minute
deposition. You might have the

239
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.050
bag, you know, prepared for.
I don't know. The part

240
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.970
I don't understand is how
you can argue against literally

241
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.030
like against the laws of
physics. Like we have arguments

242
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:20.820
at which at, at, at
one's core is gravity or,

243
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.170
you know, centripetal motion, like
stuff like that. And you're

244
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.640
like, no, that doesn't work
that way. And I'm like,

245
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.090
no, it very much works
that way. You see what

246
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.520
I'm saying? Like, how are
we, why are we disconnecting

247
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.250
at that level? It's one
thing to disconnect on learning

248
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.820
style. Why do we disconnect
on the sky is blue?

249
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.910
And I guess, I don't
think we do. We just

250
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.030
disconnect on the interpretation thereof.
I just feel like your

251
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.410
interpretation is this off thing.
Then nobody thinks like that

252
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.450
Everyone who's listening to this
show thinks like that regardless

253
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.050
of gender, there is spouse
and there is nontechnical spouse.

254
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.550
I'm telling you, yeah, this
is the case. And then

255
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.570
my jaw is dropping Shaw.
I'm telling you, I believe

256
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.870
there's a class of person
the first time in their

257
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.290
life that they made toast.
Right. They wanted to disassemble

258
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.590
the toaster and find out
sure how that toast got

259
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.750
made so that they can
put it back together again.

260
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.970
Right. And then there are
those who simply make toast

261
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.710
and have no concept of
how the toast got made

262
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.350
and you'd sit there and
take a moment to enjoy

263
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.580
it and appreciate it. Right.
But only through understanding the

264
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.490
essence of the toaster can
one. Nope. I can enjoy

265
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.890
my toes. Just fine. Without
understanding how the toaster works.

266
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.890
I just can Polish that
sucker off and be like,

267
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.550
Ooh, this was delicious. And
move on. I do not

268
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.060
need to Some tasty toast.
I put it in the

269
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:51.390
magic slot machine and it
popped out Brown. I mean,

270
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.940
I hear your point, especially
again, when we think about

271
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.880
like say all kids, right?
I was talking to a

272
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.250
friend of mine. So I
was raised not in the

273
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.460
States. Right. And we were
lamenting the test scores that

274
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.890
were recently announced on too
long ago, about how the

275
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.350
U S is slipping and
all this stuff. I have

276
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.590
an education background, so to
speak, not so much that

277
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.560
I'm a teacher, but both
my parents were educators. And

278
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.510
I worked for a nonprofit
sometime back. That was an

279
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.400
education. So, you know, I
always kind of keep my

280
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.110
ear to the ground on
what's happening in the world

281
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.180
of education. And now that
our kids are in school

282
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.490
and all that stuff, it,
you know, has become even

283
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.490
more meaningful to us. Anyway.
So this friend of mine

284
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.350
and I were talking about
how the U S is

285
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.870
slipping and test scores and
our kids are not performing

286
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.660
as well as, you know,
other students, blah, blah, blah.

287
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.620
And it was just fascinating.
So both she and I

288
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.740
were talking about calculators, how,
when I was growing up

289
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.140
in doing math, I mean,
boy, you had to plot

290
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.550
that sucker hand by hand.
I mean, you know, and,

291
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.720
and just, you know, to
get all those curves and

292
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.440
everything else, there was no
scientific calculator that do that

293
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.240
for me. I remember that
We did that too. I

294
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.130
mean, in the eighties. Yeah.
You understood it and mean

295
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.600
if you were able to
plot it, you could, you

296
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.090
could understand why, why you
were wrong. If you got

297
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.400
it wrong, where you went
wrong, as opposed to now,

298
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.650
you know, you just get
so used to using your

299
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.990
calculator or using your phone.
I mean, remember we had

300
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.910
to call my niece one
time she was babysitting for

301
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.360
us and neither you nor
I knew her phone number

302
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.390
by heart. I can't remember
the context, but for whatever

303
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.070
reason, We were having a
conversation about how many numbers

304
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.140
we still remember. I still
got about 10. No, we

305
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.820
forgot. We forgot our phones
or something like that. And

306
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.470
we need to call her.
And it was like, okay,

307
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.780
now we have access to
somebody's land line. What is

308
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.930
her number? We couldn't remember
because it's programmed. It's like,

309
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.570
Oh, she's number seven on
my speed dial. So it's

310
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.760
almost as if our minds
are shrinking and as much

311
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.240
as well. Well, one could
argue that the, yes, that's

312
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.320
true. But theoretically, for those
that are conscious and trying

313
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.590
to be attentive, that has,
that, that has released those

314
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:49.210
brain cells for more interesting
work. Right. So for example,

315
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.240
one would argue that a
caveman does not have a

316
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.280
lot of time given Maslow's
hierarchy of needs where he

317
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.660
doesn't have a lot of
time to go and make

318
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.830
art, because I was going
to say that actually that's

319
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.550
a new thing. That's actually
a good there's nerds, geeks,

320
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.390
dweebs. It's a whole thing.
No, I'm that person doesn't

321
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.630
have a time to like,
you know, deal with art

322
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:20.260
because, and higher, higher pursuits,
for lack of a better

323
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.910
word, I gotta get lunch
today. But so then the

324
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.910
argument is if you've got
Google and Wolf from that,

325
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.780
you can ask questions of
that. You can then use

326
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.450
your brain to like, worry
about other things, but perfect

327
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.600
example, we're getting ready for
the Christmas dinner and you

328
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.370
needed some yams. Right? And
I got a 16 ounce

329
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.280
container of yams and I
needed to know how much

330
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.400
that wasn't cups right now.
Here's the part where we

331
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.730
both agree that the world
is falling apart. Right. I

332
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.360
know the conversion. I just
didn't feel like doing it

333
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.500
in my head. Well, so
I asked the computer and

334
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.100
Siri told me how many
ounces is right. And I,

335
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.950
but in the old days,
10 years ago, five years

336
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.960
ago, I had to do
that by myself. I think

337
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.370
where we both agree is
that if you're 19 and

338
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.970
have only a cursory understanding
that those things exist, but

339
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.800
no real understanding of what,
the difference between a fluid

340
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.430
ounce and weight mass and
all the different kinds, then

341
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.220
you're probably just using the
phone as a crutch. Right.

342
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.860
So is it an exoskeleton
where I'm going to be

343
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.830
bigger, faster, stronger, better, right?
Or is it going to

344
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.420
be a crutch where it's
like, you know, I really

345
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.930
can't even figure out the
basics of cups announces without

346
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.780
these. And I think the
tragedy is for so many

347
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.090
of us nowadays, and we
don't even realize that it's

348
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.980
a crutch. I mean, you
just don't know it. You

349
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.020
are so used to using
it and having to work.

350
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.300
You turn it on. And
it works That I use

351
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.890
the GPS in the car
when I know where I'm

352
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.850
going. Oh, that's points. I
mean, let's that tells me

353
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.440
about the traffic. You don't
know that. See people, unnamed

354
00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.900
people in your family, go,
go places and get into

355
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.760
traffic, traffic situation, traffic get
into traffic situations that could

356
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.800
have easily been solved. The
first thing I do when

357
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.120
I get in the car
is I put the traffic

358
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.840
part of the, the GPS
on. And then I take

359
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.240
one of the three ways
that I know. Okay. But

360
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.010
if there's a detour or
whatever, I'm gonna get out

361
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.210
of the way, I feel
empowered by that. See what

362
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.550
I'm saying? You're like, you're
like, we're going to Fred

363
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.620
Meyers. Why are you putting
the GPS on, you know,

364
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.970
the way I was like,
yes, but I don't know

365
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.250
if there's construction. It could
be a car on the

366
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.700
side of the road. Right?
I want that information so

367
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.390
that I can be empowered.
And I hear you. I

368
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.430
mean, and I think that
serves a purpose in his

369
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.510
value where the information is
useful, where you and I

370
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.030
sort of disconnect is there
is only one way out

371
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.550
of our house. You have
to take that way. I

372
00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.190
don't know that I necessarily
care. If there's a car

373
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.840
parked on the side of
the road, I have no

374
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.500
choice. I'm going to take
that road with That oversimplification.

375
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.240
Once you get out of
our house and into town,

376
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.030
there's three different ways to
get to the store. So

377
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.980
I'm not gonna mess with
the phone while I'm driving.

378
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.080
So I get the phone
ready while I'm in the

379
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.170
driveway. And I plan my
strategy if I'm going to

380
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.780
the airport. Right? Like, remember
that one time, like six

381
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.760
years ago where I almost
missed a flight. And it

382
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.030
was absolutely because there was
a car accident right. At

383
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.640
the exit. And if I
had known, I would have

384
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.900
gotten out of the way
and I would have taken

385
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.810
a terminal totally different way.
I know that as it

386
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.060
happens. So this is an
example of, are you using

387
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.030
the GPS for the, I
don't know where North is

388
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.040
and I don't know like
that the sun sets in

389
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.580
the West. Right. Which it's
arguable that some people really

390
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.390
don't know that. Right. And
I, I'm sure there's lots

391
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.330
of like 15 year old
kids today. Maybe even relatives

392
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.250
related to us that couldn't
tell you which way the

393
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.520
sun rises and sets. Well,
I'm not going to even

394
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.530
touch that one because every
time you asked me which

395
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.540
direction am I heading, I
have no idea. You know,

396
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.430
But you know what I'm
saying? Yeah. But you, you

397
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.260
know that there are, you
know, the Cardinal directions. I

398
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.950
mean, just my point being
though that the GPS is

399
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.010
more than just the, I'm
going to blindly tell, you

400
00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.040
know, have this computer talk
me right. Tasha in, right.

401
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.710
It provides all this other
context. It's a calculator. It's

402
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.460
exact same example that you
gave. Yeah. No, I mean,

403
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.770
I'd have to consider your
point when you say that

404
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.890
it provides value on the
traffic. Yeah. That, that, that

405
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.620
makes sense. I, my take
on what you were doing

406
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.180
was just kind of saying,
yeah, let me just see

407
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.480
what the GPS says in
general. No, I think you

408
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.300
were looking at it as
me, me being unable to

409
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.950
make a decision on my
own and wondering of the

410
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.980
GPS was gonna chime in,
but do you know the

411
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.040
traffic? No, I don't. I
only know what I hear

412
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.590
on the radio or whatever.
So Yeah. Well, so this,

413
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.030
this gets to this larger
concept of whenever you and

414
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.190
I are fighting and I
say, guys say fighting lower,

415
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.910
lower case F right. Not
major capital F. Right. Okay.

416
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.890
It's almost because we know
that each of us competent,

417
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:54.280
well, presumably right. We're basically
the base assumption. Nice save.

418
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.400
Yeah. Thanks. We know that
each of us, without the

419
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.130
other could potentially get stuff
done. Right. But if we're

420
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.570
going to get it done
differently though, and that's where

421
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.630
we get into trouble. So
we're in the car trying

422
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.710
to do something, get food,
go somewhere, whatever. Right. The

423
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.000
argument always comes down to,
you know, we're going to

424
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.140
go this way or that
way, or when you go

425
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.730
here first, are we going
to stop there? Or, you

426
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:25.360
know what? Yeah. So why,
why don't we just chill

427
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.570
and let the other let
whoever's driving handle it? Like

428
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.400
I'm going to get there.
It doesn't matter what lane

429
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.590
I'm in. Just let it
go. I will get there.

430
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.770
Well, I mean, at 15
years, you know, I will

431
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.430
get us there. You will
get us there for sure.

432
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.340
I mean, but, but I
think it's that perception that

433
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.570
sense of I can get
us there faster, quicker, better.

434
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.830
Right. I don't think you're
an incompetent boob who can

435
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.740
barely, you know, get himself
dressed. In fact, I think

436
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.050
you're quite competent and you
can't get yourself. I'm glad

437
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.360
that you feel that getting
dressed is high on my

438
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.110
list of skills. Right. And
you know, but can you

439
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.060
do it faster, better? And
can I help you with

440
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.450
that? Getting dressed or going
places In general? I mean,

441
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.960
I'm just whatever, whatever, getting
dressed as an example, whether

442
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.090
it's driving, whether it's getting
the kids ready for school,

443
00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.330
whether it's making dinner. Right.
If I feel like I

444
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.210
have some insight that could
help us and save us

445
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.970
time, we'll save you time.
Hey, I'm your wife. I

446
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.220
love you DOE this is
what I'm here for. So

447
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.860
for instance, we'll be driving,
you know, we're at Costco

448
00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.160
today. We're driving back. I
look ahead, right? And I'm

449
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.190
looking, and I don't know,
you know, six, seven vehicles

450
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.310
ahead of us. There's a
bus, right? I'm a smart

451
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.610
person. I'm thinking to myself,
Oh, Scott's a smart person

452
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.210
to mistaken Lee. In some
cases, he is going to

453
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.790
change lanes. So we don't
get stuck behind this bus.

454
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.160
And I try to say
to myself, okay, don't say

455
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.500
anything. Just watch and see
what he does. And you

456
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.220
know, almost every single time
you stay in that lane

457
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.020
and wouldn't, you know it,
then we get stuck behind

458
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.630
the bus and I'm thinking
to myself, well, we've got

459
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.310
all the frozen stuff. We've
got the kids in the

460
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.570
car. Why wouldn't you switch
lanes? And just get in

461
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.140
that other lane, the left
lane that the bus people

462
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.550
in the bus just go
into space. And you know,

463
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.840
that way we don't get
stuck behind it and we

464
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.690
couldn't get home. You don't
do that. So here's the

465
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.640
thing where we get, we
get a little bit you

466
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.540
and I think disagree, we're
on we're, you know, we're

467
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.790
doing something and you can
get me there. Five minutes

468
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.070
faster. This happens all the
time. Like there's a particular

469
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.440
movie theater that we go
to. And we actually, one

470
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.230
time took two cars and
I went left. You went

471
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.920
right to see which way
was the faster way. And

472
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.070
it doesn't matter who won,
but meaning, meaning Moe. I

473
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.900
know that was the one
I want, you know what

474
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.560
I'm talking about? It doesn't
matter though. Yeah. Right. The

475
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.540
fact that I won is
neither here nor there. Yes.

476
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.160
So that, that let's say
that, that, you know, there's

477
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.850
8.8, do it, do a
action. A and actually be

478
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.840
able to say five minutes.
That five minutes is not

479
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.190
as meaningful as the 35
minutes that it took extra

480
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.800
to get out of the
house. So we have the

481
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.140
art, you know, the whole
kind of getting out starting

482
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.540
today. Sure. You know, we,
we start the day at

483
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.450
different speeds. I'm not trying
to like throw you under

484
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.440
the proverbial bus that I'm
apparently following. But, but you

485
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.230
know what I'm saying? So
you're, I'm thinking to myself,

486
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.160
you're worried about five minutes
on the backend. Right. But

487
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.710
you blew 35 on the
front end. I could sit

488
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.780
behind the bus for a
full half hour and I'd

489
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.260
still be ahead, but would
you be happy at squat?

490
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.250
You see what I'm saying?
So my, my, my initial

491
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.660
reaction, and I think those
that are overly analytical is,

492
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.450
and this is just kind
of saying it in a

493
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.550
very inefficient way. So I'm
not saying it, but you

494
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.410
know, you don't get to
talk to me about the

495
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.720
five minutes that we're going
to sit behind this bus

496
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.040
when it took you a
half an hour to get

497
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.990
out the door in the
morning, but you seem to

498
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.230
conveniently forget stuff like that.
Oh yeah. I have no

499
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.450
idea what you're talking about
right now, but I'm saying,

500
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.330
so what I'm saying is
that when you're like, you're

501
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.030
wasting my time, we have
to go every second counts.

502
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.960
But for me every second
counts all the time. Right.

503
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.890
Does that make sense? It's
okay for you to sit

504
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.080
behind the bus because you
choose to sit behind the

505
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.020
bus and it's just not
that. And the minute or

506
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.030
two I lose there will
be made up through the

507
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.580
efficient use of GPS is
in traffic while you on

508
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.040
the other hand will get
out of the way of

509
00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.280
the bus zoom forward, and
then hurry up and wait

510
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.170
at the rate of the
red traffic light or the

511
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.090
red light that you totally
didn't see coming. No, I

512
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.490
saw it coming, but you've
also lost a half an

513
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:25.720
hour. Cause it took you
that long to get out

514
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.020
that morning. Yeah. W which,
I mean, I'll have to

515
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.300
disagree on that. It took
me half an hour and

516
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:36.190
then that's another, that's fine.
20, 25 minutes. That's another

517
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.530
conversation because I mean, I
think one would want to

518
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.730
know what is Moe doing
for those 25 minutes? It's

519
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.510
more than just the get
up show. Well, that's the

520
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.520
whole, like, we're about to
leave the house. Is it

521
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.760
appropriate to do the dishes
now and come home to

522
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.970
clean dishes or get out
the door and you pay

523
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.010
for it in the basket?
Yeah. You know, and that's

524
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.470
the funny thing about dishes.
They will be there. They

525
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.660
don't do themselves, but they'll
be there when you get

526
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.180
back. Which means there's no
reason to do them when

527
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.880
you leave. But I mean,
at the same time, you

528
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.130
know, it's, it's more than
just the dishes. Sometimes it's

529
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:10.000
the butter. Sometimes the milk,
not the butter because somebody

530
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.130
didn't see it. It's never
the butter. I don't know

531
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.820
what that means. There are
never any, there's no like

532
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.210
perishable items on the counter.
I'm just talking about you

533
00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.700
get up, you take a
shower, you roll out the

534
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.340
door. It's a six minute.
No, you got to pick

535
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.780
up a little bit. We
can't do it. When our

536
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.940
pigs said, we're going to
live in this day. So

537
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.310
we're going to organize ourselves.
You know, the boys are

538
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.460
not living in the jungle,
so we're going to comb

539
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.620
their hair. Yeah. This is
an absolutely us sitting in

540
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:40.090
the car, waiting for you.
If I may push back,

541
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.370
that's a little, it's work
as a team. We'll just

542
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.010
get it done in less.
So when you say work

543
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.420
As a team, that means
let's do it my way

544
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.100
Work as a team with
another woman's dread my way.

545
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.610
That's up to you. The
listener right now, The point

546
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.910
being though that like, if
he writes on days when

547
00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.180
you sleep in, we take
turns, right? Right. If I'm

548
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.970
getting the boys ready, it
inevitably goes incredibly smoothly. And

549
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.160
I think to myself, why
is this a big deal?

550
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.480
But on the flip side,
when I sleep in the

551
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.900
same, presumably it goes incredibly
smoothly. But when we were

552
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.540
up at the same time,
the boys are almost always

553
00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.590
late or almost like, I
mean, this year has just

554
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.350
been every single day. We
get there with like barely

555
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.910
two minutes to spare these
four kids. There's like, if

556
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.420
there's stress in the air.
Yeah. We gotta just see

557
00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.090
that each of us is
getting them there. So just

558
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.310
chill out. It's going to
get done. I don't like

559
00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.380
come over to you in
Microsoft word and turn on

560
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.510
the paragraph, Mark. It started
making you feel bad about

561
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.300
your white space, right? I
mean, I'm thinking it, you

562
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.400
know, you want to make
sure you're clear. I'm thinking,

563
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.470
no, if you worked for
me, you'd have been fired

564
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.770
long ago for poor use
of work, worldwide space. You

565
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.530
know what I'm saying? Like,
it's just like, that's not

566
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.510
how you left a line
of column. It's just not

567
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.690
how it's done, but you'll
say, Hey, it's left, aligned.

568
00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.380
Same thing. It's the whole
ends justifies the means thing.

569
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.500
But I don't say anything.
I let it go. So

570
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.970
let me just So, so,
well, let me ask you

571
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.550
this then. I mean, Scott,
the engineer, the efficient guy

572
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.890
who has all these tools
and these gadgets, you really

573
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.840
would like to just be
left in the dark. You

574
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.090
want to continue to be
blind to the errors of

575
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.850
your ways. I not kind
of get that feedback that

576
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.250
says here's a tip on
how you can simplify your

577
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.280
life, make it better. No,
I'm all about collecting tips.

578
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.750
It's just come from your
wife. Well, there's that? But

579
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.260
I'm talking about the I've
already done the analysis and

580
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.530
decided that your way is
inefficient. If it was more

581
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.140
efficient, I'd be doing it
that way. I thought of

582
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.850
it though. You haven't, you
haven't tried it for awhile.

583
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.320
When I try to show
you how to do X,

584
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.880
Y, Z on a computer,
you don't want to hear

585
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.310
about it. I've been trying
to heat. You hotkeys basic

586
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.670
hotkeys for 15 years and
you have not learned one,

587
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.670
but you know that it's
hockey's will make you faster,

588
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.900
right? Yes. Do you use
any hotkeys? I do. None

589
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.390
that were taught to me
by you or whatever. That's

590
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.540
a whole other conversation. No,
on hockey's but you see

591
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:05.150
what I'm saying though? Like
people have their way. Yeah.

592
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.150
There's a lot of doing
their way. Don't you think?

593
00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.910
In geek and mixed marriages
between Gates and normals, just

594
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:16.310
somebody has to chill out,
taking turns, chilling out, and

595
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.750
then it will be fun.
Why do you have to

596
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.360
take turns? Where can we
both be consistently chilled? I

597
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.670
mean, why must it be
okay today is Scott stayed

598
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.620
at church. I mean, because
someone has to take the

599
00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.660
lead on any given, you
know, thing. You're, you know,

600
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.060
you go into the store,
like, you know, we were

601
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.420
going to the store today.
All right. Well, how are

602
00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.450
we going to run this?
I think it sounds a

603
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.490
little bit more dysfunctional. It
is to be clear. We

604
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.850
have lots of we're having
fun Right now, the same

605
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.360
person. And we should do
a show in person somewhere.

606
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.440
Like we got to Costco
and I'm like, okay. My

607
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.850
strategy is you go in
a snake, formation through every

608
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.530
single aisle. Cause you never
know what you're going to

609
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:57.840
get. You never know what
you bump into. And it's

610
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.170
very efficient. You, on the
other hand, it's incredibly efficient

611
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.010
to just zigzag exactly the
entire thing. And you're going

612
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.750
to see some stuff and
you're going to pick up

613
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.820
stuff when you pass it.
When you say efficient, can

614
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.650
you break that down for
me? On the other hand

615
00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.220
had like a whole traveling
salesman, pre fractal algorithm or

616
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.500
something, but you know, so
what I did is I

617
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.700
just said, all right, well,
we'll do it your way.

618
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.950
Yeah. And it worked and
we made it out of

619
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.670
Costco alive. I should do
that more in the car

620
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.930
too. No, I, I mean,
I think the point that

621
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.000
you made was well-made this
idea that when you do

622
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.210
it, it works well, you
are, you're capable, you're efficient

623
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.100
and you get the boys
to school with a minute

624
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.080
to spare. But by golly,
you get them to school.

625
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.080
And I do the same
thing, right? It's when we're

626
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.230
together. When you have two
people who are reasonably smart,

627
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.860
reasonably organized that are trying
to accomplish the same goal,

628
00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:52.140
you end up with, you
know, tension, right. Cause you

629
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.780
and I are similar people
in some ways, not obviously

630
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.030
from a technical point of
view, but the big picture

631
00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.910
stuff about how we think,
what we value. What's important

632
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.830
to us family, all that,
The values are the same.

633
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.570
We agree on that. It's
just about how we get

634
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.410
it, The execution. And we've
talked about this before, on,

635
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.700
on Hanselman, inside you and
I come at it from

636
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.760
two different points of view
altogether, we end up at

637
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.530
the same place. You know,
the boys get to school

638
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.360
on time. The boys get
fed, but how we get

639
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.240
there. But the point then
is that it's been 15

640
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.490
years. It feels like 15.
We're not going to switch

641
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.950
teams. Like you're not going
to come around and become

642
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.010
super analytical. Right? You're not
ever going to take my

643
00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.130
way and say, this is
a good way. You're always,

644
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.200
you're going to say it's
a good way for you.

645
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.750
Right? And I'll respect it
as such for you. Wait

646
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:39.240
a second. You'll respect it
as such for you. That'll

647
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.330
make driving tomorrow easier as
you'll let me now you

648
00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.810
respect it. You've said it
I've recorded it. So it's,

649
00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:46.770
it's let it be on
the record. I didn't say

650
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.420
that. I'd agree with it
or No, no, this is

651
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.070
great. Next time you bug
me in the car. I'm

652
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.620
going to say, I understand
that you respect my way.

653
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.210
Well, so this is another
funny thing we should end

654
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.960
on that because we, I
told, I told someone our

655
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.610
secret and now we'll just
tell it on the show.

656
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.480
There was a time I
think when we did actually

657
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.880
have some fights and sometimes
fighting turns into kind of

658
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.900
like, well, you, you, you
know, like fully on you,

659
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.780
let's just say, and we
didn't want to say phooey

660
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.330
on you or you know,
much worse because it's not

661
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:21.750
very nice to say that
to your spouse. So instead

662
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.990
we decided to say, I
stand corrected, which means the

663
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.720
exact opposite of what it
means for us. So whenever

664
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:37.740
I'm completely right about something,
and I nailed it, like

665
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.540
rather than saying, I told,
so we said, I stand

666
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.630
corrected. I stand corrected. Which
means you're a total idiot

667
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.710
and everything. Everything you just
said was complete crap. I

668
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.550
can't believe you're breathing. You're
so dumb. It's all encapsulated

669
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.670
in that phrase. I stand
corrected and you can do

670
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.880
that. It's like dinner parties
and mixed mixed company. And

671
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.130
people like, Oh, differential gracious,
Whoa, she's such a debutante.

672
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.570
And then you look at
them and you're like, if

673
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.840
you only knew, if she
says I stand corrected, that

674
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.970
means that I'm an idiot.
Well, but it's no different

675
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.340
than your yesteryear. You know?
That is true. Yes. Dear

676
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.900
does not mean yes, dear
me. It means something more

677
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:23.030
than that, but yeah. Oh
dear. I always enjoy talking

678
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.090
to you. Oh, that's nice,
dear. Because you're going to

679
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.910
turn it around the last
30 seconds. Tell me very

680
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.310
quickly your, your fans want
to know what, what are

681
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.650
you talking to? Do you
have any, any, what's the

682
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:38.330
word I'm looking for for
2014 new year's resolution. Oh,

683
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.640
it's the same one. It
always is. It's always hanging

684
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.020
out with the kids, get
a six pack and one

685
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.820
out of twin beds. Like
I like a Tupac. No

686
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.380
I'm going to get, I
want to get like abs

687
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.690
again, you know, I had
them when I was younger.

688
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.000
I'd like to have abs
again, I'm working on that.

689
00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.160
Abs would be good on
you. Thank you. I'm glad

690
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.440
that you're looking forward to
the amps. This is the

691
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.710
same. This has been the
same conversation. How many years

692
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:07.070
have I been trying to
get abs 13 years. 13,

693
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:11.480
soon. I'll have them. It's
possible. Yeah. The thing is,

694
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.430
this is the other thing
we've talked about is that

695
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:18.890
I'm really simple. Like really
simple. Like I don't need

696
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.500
anything. I'm quite happy. You
know? What's your motivation. I

697
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.210
just want to make people
happy and be nice and

698
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.790
watch TV and have an
Apple that's right. Half an

699
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:32.660
Apple. Is that too simple?
There you are a benefit.

700
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.960
Simple 10 bedroom by simpletons.
I'll keep you. Okay. Well

701
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.300
thank you. Do you want
to do the closing now?

702
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:41.570
No. Thanks. You sure. This
has been another episode. You

703
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.570
don't do that. No, but
thank you though. I stand

704
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:51.610
corrected. Well, it's done Bravo,
Bravo, right? This has been

705
00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.100
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we wish you all a

706
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.550
Merry Christmas and the holiday
season and all that good

707
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.380
stuff. And we'll see you
again next week.
