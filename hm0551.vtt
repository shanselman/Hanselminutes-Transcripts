00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.000
From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
a weekly discussion with web

2
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.740
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announced in

3
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
show number 555. In this
episode, Scott talks with Victor

4
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.690
Jaco about the use of
alcohol in the tech industry.

5
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.110
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

6
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.660
Hansel minutes. We're going to
try something a little different

7
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.890
today. I'm talking with Victor
Jaco and he emailed me

8
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.780
actually, I think in may,
it's been a while we've

9
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.830
been going back and forth
discussing this about a podcast

10
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.620
where we would talk about
the culture of, of alcohol

11
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.270
that we see in the
tech community. How are you?

12
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.860
Sure I am doing wonderful
today, Scott and you're right.

13
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.170
It's it's been a while
coming, but I'm really glad

14
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.660
that you had me on
the show and I'm looking

15
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.350
forward to our conversation today.
Yeah. Now you regularly write

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.080
and speak on kind of
the, you know, the psychology

17
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.960
of design and the tech
culture, but also with regards

18
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.580
to the idea that tech
culture somewhat promotes alcohol use,

19
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.440
what do you, what do
you mean by that? Is

20
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.190
it just like having beer,
A company party? Well, yeah,

21
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.560
but I think it goes
beyond that. So part of

22
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.500
it stems from my background
and my history was alcohol,

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.330
which is, I was working
for a user focused design

24
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.220
firm, digital design, and I
became sober. And I realized

25
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.480
once I did how heavily
prevalent alcohol and promoting the

26
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.140
use of alcohol is in
design and tech. And what

27
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.470
I mean by that is
really that it's everything from

28
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.070
having the office keg and
the beer fridge that we

29
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.730
show off when we have
clients over or potential future

30
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.560
employees to the networking events
that we call happy hours

31
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.720
and host in places like
bars. And then even our

32
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.890
conferences, which we know have
in the past had problems

33
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.110
with, with drinking and the
behavior that can be associated

34
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.870
with that. And we call
them parties and we have

35
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.020
after parties where there's an
open bar that people don't

36
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.850
have to pay for the
actual monetary cost for alcohol.

37
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.620
And all of that serves
to create a culture that

38
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.650
really suggests, Hey, if you're
a part of us, you're

39
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.200
drinking, you're okay with it.
And I can only speak

40
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.020
from my personal experience, but
I know a lot of

41
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.030
times, you know, when we're
going to have a long

42
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.850
boring meeting that either cater
it with alcohol, or they

43
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.070
talk about the fact that
maybe afterwards we're going to

44
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.220
go have a happy hour
to celebrate that we survived

45
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.360
the meeting or have a
happy hour that we landed

46
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.160
a new client. And so
what I realized was I

47
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.770
still wanted to participate and
be a part of things,

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.080
but I couldn't do the
drinking anymore. And that was

49
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.440
a personal decision. But the
way people talked about drinking

50
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.780
around me was, was something
that I had to then

51
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.210
add on to the fact
that I was trying myself

52
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.360
to stop drinking at the
problematic level, that I'd become

53
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.300
a drinker. So it's just
you and I on the

54
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.020
podcast. And I'm, I try
to act as an advocate

55
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.750
or as the, you know,
in the role of the,

56
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.270
of the people who are
listening. And we realized that

57
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.550
this is a complicated and
intersectional conversation, so I can

58
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.820
offer my actual thoughts and
how I feel and how

59
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.970
I, you know, how I
personally deal with this situation.

60
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.010
But then I will try
to also kind of offer

61
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.110
some of the perspectives that
I imagine that people who

62
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.320
are listening may also be.
So I would ask that

63
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.080
you and that people bear
with us as we try

64
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.720
to explore this, this topic,
I'm open to exploring it

65
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.500
as deep as you want
to go, and I'm excited

66
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.680
to do it. So I'm,
I'm a, I guess they

67
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.500
call it a Teetotaller. I
don't drink, but I don't

68
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.120
drink for any particular reason
other than I just never

69
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.550
got around to it. The
crowd that I hung out

70
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.090
with in school didn't drink.
I don't drink. And now

71
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.160
I feel like I'm kind
of on a roll, you

72
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.470
know, I'm in my forties
and I never got around

73
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.040
to it. So why start
now? So I, and, but

74
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.770
I also come from a
place of, of some privilege

75
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.630
in the sense that I'm
a, I'm a, I'm a

76
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.020
man with a job. And
I don't particularly feel like

77
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.680
I've felt pressured to drink
in order to keep my

78
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.890
job. But I have heard
from people in the community

79
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.640
that who don't drink or
may not necessarily be super

80
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.340
secure in their job, that
they feel they need to

81
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.680
go to these parties and
participate in these parties. And

82
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.180
at the end, you know,
and then they're pressured to

83
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.470
drink alcohol. I haven't seen
that, but is that if

84
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.410
do people do that? Well,
I think that when you

85
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.800
talk about pressure, some of
that is internal. And so

86
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.170
people might feel a certain
pressure that they're putting on

87
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.530
themselves while other people who
are fine with alcohol don't

88
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.750
necessarily realize that's what they're
doing. So I think that's

89
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.360
one thing, but I have
heard. And when I've given

90
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.100
presentations at events or conferences
specific to the topic of

91
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.910
alcohol have often had audience
members either share with the

92
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.600
whole audience or afterwards that,
you know, they've been put

93
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.660
in situations. And it seems
to be particularly females who

94
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.200
feel like they need to
drink to stay a part

95
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.570
of the in crowd where
they're working or the Dave

96
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.120
even been publicly called out
for not being fun for

97
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.180
not participating in the drinking.
And if we're talking about

98
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.630
creating an atmosphere of inclusion,
where we want people, regardless

99
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.170
of whether they drink or
not to feel welcome, then

100
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.890
I think that that becomes
a problem. If you don't

101
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.100
have an issue with alcohol,
that's fine. And you have

102
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.370
to understand that everybody has
their own individual relationship with

103
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.130
alcohol. And it's not really
on any one of us

104
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.260
to determine whether or not
it's right for someone to

105
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.070
be drinking. And if someone's
choosing to drink, it really

106
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.470
shouldn't be an issue because
it's not the kind of

107
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.690
thing that becomes then offensive
or overlaps into, into being

108
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.020
your problem. If I'm choosing
not to drink, it's actually

109
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.980
because I'm aware of my
limitations or there might be

110
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.320
a thousand other reasons which
are really none of anyone's

111
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.100
business or related to medical
conditions related to mental health

112
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.450
and related to religion. And
so where, where I find

113
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.830
it, a problem isn't that
individuals are drinking or that

114
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.040
individuals want to drink and
have a good time. But

115
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.370
when it becomes, I want
to ask you, when you

116
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.550
show up to an event
why you're not drinking, then

117
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.620
it borders on what I
think is exclusive, an environment

118
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.230
that we create. And in
tech, I think we've sort

119
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.300
of been called out for,
for doing that in other

120
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.680
ways already. And so I
think just by talking about

121
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.890
it is one step towards
raising awareness because the alcohol

122
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.580
is frequent and prevalent that
we might make assumptions. Everyone's

123
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.130
okay with this. And everyone
wants to have, you know,

124
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.850
the joke about let's go
get, go to the bar

125
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.680
after work, because it's been
a hard day. And like,

126
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.060
maybe I still want to
go to the bar with

127
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.250
you, but don't worry about
it. If I don't order

128
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.920
alcohol Right now, when people,
some people may have made

129
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.230
it five, six minutes into
this podcast, and they may

130
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.650
already think that we are
being a, you know, quote

131
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.380
unquote, politically correct, or, you
know, to, you know, everyone

132
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.850
needs to just relax. If
you don't want to drink,

133
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.610
don't drink. What's the big
deal. Right. People may be,

134
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.730
be thinking that. But I
think that that point of

135
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.980
being inclusive or exclusive, I
think is a good one.

136
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.390
And I don't feel like
we are trying to be

137
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.300
politically correct. I think that
you're proposing just trying to

138
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.780
treat people like human beings.
Like if, if we went

139
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.470
to a, a, a, a
pig roast, which is a

140
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.040
thing, and I didn't eat
pork, right. Like, you know,

141
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.080
there's, I've been to pig
roasts and like, Hey, we're

142
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.000
gonna roast a pig. Oh,
I don't eat pork. You

143
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.430
don't eat pork. That's weird.
Why would he do that?

144
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.040
Like just justify your decision.
I'm just not into it.

145
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.160
That's just not my thing.
That is a way of

146
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.070
excluding well, simply saying, Oh
right, well, we have, you

147
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.410
know, we have hotdogs or
we have, we have something

148
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.360
else for you and then
simply calling it what it

149
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.900
is. Right. And I agree
with that. And I think

150
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.990
that I don't look at
it as being politically correct,

151
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.900
because I'm not trying to
make the argument that alcohol

152
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.670
shouldn't be a part of
things. But what I am

153
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.330
trying to argue is that
we should be aware that

154
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.960
it's not cookie cutter. So
just like some people don't

155
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.840
eat pork for a multitude
of reasons. And we shouldn't

156
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.610
think that that's an issue
by accommodating them, that having

157
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.830
decent, soft drinks available at
an event, calling something, not

158
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.850
calling something, you know, a
frat party or a happy

159
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.210
hour where the assumption is
everyone's going to get part

160
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.280
of the open bar. And
part of the process of

161
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.920
just being fitting in is
going to be to drinking

162
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.950
beer. That that's something we
can easily make small shifts

163
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.650
in our language and how
we talk about events. And

164
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.020
even how we plan events.
You know, the company that

165
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.660
I work for has tried
to put a little more

166
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.620
thought into sayings after I've
been more vocal about my

167
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.690
issues. And some of the
things that we've come up

168
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.320
with can still include alcohol.
Like for example, we have

169
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.720
a company softball team, but
the purpose isn't that we

170
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.790
go out and drink as
much as we can. The

171
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.100
purpose of the event is
to go play softball. And

172
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.610
yes, some people drink and
they are the ones who

173
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.590
are choosing to do that.
And the people like myself

174
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.290
who choose not to drink,
there are other options available,

175
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.870
but I'm not feeling like
I'm the only person staying

176
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:36.060
around, not drinking. And so
specific to like my situation

177
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.720
where I was dealing with
sobriety and the issues that

178
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.660
come with realizing that, Hey,
you have a problem with

179
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.760
drinking. I felt like I
couldn't expose that side of

180
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.520
me to people because of
the fear that you, that

181
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.010
comes along with that. Well,
if I'm drinking a beer

182
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.920
tomorrow, after telling you I
have an alcohol problem, what

183
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.320
might that mean for my
job and how people look

184
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.620
at me, but at the
same time, somebody who doesn't

185
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.860
have that issue at all
might feel completely comfortable in

186
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.870
an environment where people are
giving them a hard time

187
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.630
about not drinking, but, you
know, take yourself. I can't

188
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.430
speak for you. But if
you, if someone were like,

189
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.350
Oh Scott, why aren't you
drinking? And you just say,

190
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.210
I don't drink. Like, that's
the end of the story

191
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.330
for someone who might feel
that, like, that's not the

192
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.670
end of the story, because
maybe a day before they

193
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.500
were the one who was
drinking and they were taking

194
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.950
it too far, that that
can become a large barrier

195
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.030
to participation. And when we
do things and I'm coming

196
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.210
at it from more of
a consultant point of view,

197
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.520
where we don't have a
product where I work, we

198
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.820
serve other firms that do
have products and we help

199
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.760
them with their design and
their development. But we often

200
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.070
go out to happy hours
and dinners with our clients

201
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.260
and potential clients. And I
want to be a part

202
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.890
of that or somebody else
who might not, Why don't

203
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.590
you just say I don't
drink. And then is that

204
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.970
not the end of it?
Well, unfortunately it's not always

205
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.580
the end of it. I
think that I'm playing, we're

206
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.470
playing, no, the devil doesn't
need an advocate, but let's

207
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.720
bounce it back and forth
a little bit here. Right.

208
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.200
I've been in the business
now, 25 years. I've never

209
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.590
drank. It's actually funny. Like
I don't drink, I don't

210
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.430
even know what alcohol tastes
like. And I've for 25

211
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.650
years from being 20 years
old to being 40. And

212
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.530
on, I just said, no,
I don't drink. And it,

213
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.430
no one's ever pressured me.
Is that because of who

214
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.280
I am because of gender.
And, and, and, or is

215
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.110
that an age or is
that, And are there people

216
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.370
who, who, if they get
pressed hard on that? I

217
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.980
mean, in, in some ways
I'd be guessing to say

218
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.770
why it is that you
specifically don't feel that way,

219
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:41.780
but I can tell you
from my own experience and

220
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.840
from talking with other people,
that part of it is

221
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.290
definitely that if you haven't
had the problem with it,

222
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.560
then you might not feel
like, Oh, the spotlight's on

223
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.420
me when I'm not drinking
or interested. There's some reason

224
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.910
that people are going to
know I've gone from being

225
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.690
the fun guy at the
party to the teetotaler or

226
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.770
whatever the driver guy. Right.
And so I think there's

227
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.190
that level of aspect. But
then I have found that

228
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:14.230
people can be very juvenile
about alcohol and alcohol consumption.

229
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.110
And, you know, Scott, unfortunately
it seems to happen more

230
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.690
and more as people consume
more and more alcohol. And

231
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.770
so I have been put
in situations where, especially when

232
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.670
I first became sober, I
did go from the guy

233
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.460
who always drank way too
much to drinking nothing. And

234
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.740
I was proud of myself,
but I wasn't ready to

235
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.430
expose that part of me
to my colleagues. And we

236
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.700
would wine and dine clients
till late hours. And I

237
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.820
was fine drinking all the
Perrier, all the seltzer water

238
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.950
that I could get my
hands on at the bar

239
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.010
and being a part of
the conversation. But yeah, I

240
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.470
had some people and some
of them were in management

241
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.050
positions who would always pester
me and say, okay, why

242
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.530
aren't you drinking? And at
that time I decided I

243
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.540
was going to use the
excuse. My wife was pregnant

244
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.270
and I was just being
supportive of her. And so

245
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.340
then the conversation turned to,
well, I bet you just

246
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.110
can't wait until that's over.
And we can't wait to

247
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.000
take you out drinking after
that's done. And it's like,

248
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.430
these are not the conversations
that I want to have.

249
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.800
And when I did come
out and actually write and

250
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.710
talk about my experience, these
very people came up and

251
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.350
apologized to me and said,
Oh, you know, I have

252
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.380
family members that have this
situation. You know, I would

253
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.990
have never said these kinds
of things to you had

254
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.590
I known. And to me,
I accept there. I accepted

255
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.720
the apology and I understood
at the time, even that

256
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.420
it was all supposed to
be in good fun, but

257
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.090
I also think it never
had to happen because it

258
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.730
was never, it never should
have been a big enough

259
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.270
deal. If somebody is not
drinking, that's zero in terms

260
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.190
of being a big deal.
And if you're paying for

261
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.010
it, it's actually a better
deal for you as the

262
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.800
one paying for alcohol, that
somebody is not consuming it.

263
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.880
So let me, let me
try to, let me ask

264
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.280
you this. I'm going to
take a chance here and

265
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.790
give you a possible analogy
to something that relates to

266
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.860
me. And you tell me
if this relates at all.

267
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.830
Okay. So if you, if
you and I are standing

268
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.140
next to each other, you
can't look at either one

269
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.760
of us and tell that
you had a problem with

270
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.760
alcohol and you can't tell
that I'm a type one

271
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.760
diabetic wearing an insulin pump
and a half dozen different

272
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.980
implanted systems to keep me
alive. I was traveling in,

273
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.810
you know, we look competent
when you look at us,

274
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.200
right. I was traveling in
choices. When people look at

275
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.900
me, maybe he's right. Yeah.
I can kind of rough

276
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.570
looking. I was traveling in
China, it was working with

277
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:32.100
another person. We were giving
a workshop and I'm traveling

278
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.800
overseas. I'm managing my blood
sugar. I'm dealing with time

279
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.290
zones. It's, it's a, it's
an internal struggle that I'm

280
00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.680
not talking about with people.
Right? And then the day

281
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.350
before the workshop, the in
person I was going with

282
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.810
says he wants to go
and try some really crazy

283
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.540
food. He wants to try,
you know, local native, you

284
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.620
know, Chinese food, you know,
squid or Callum or something

285
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.260
that I couldn't do. And
I said, you know, I

286
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.860
saw that there's a subway
sandwiches across the street. I

287
00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.750
know subway. I know how
much insulin I need to

288
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.790
take. I know that if
I eat subway tonight, I

289
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.640
will be successful at the
workshop tomorrow. I know that

290
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.180
if we go to eat
something new and unusual, you're

291
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.500
going to love it. And
you're going to have fun.

292
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.110
You're a foodie, but I
may spend all night long

293
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.980
dealing with that. The outcome
of that, I didn't really

294
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.920
want to go and explain
how diabetes works, how my

295
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.860
blood sugar works. The fact
that food isn't a joy

296
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.500
for me. It is fuel.
I just want to go

297
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.120
to subway. I want to
eat my sandwich. I want

298
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.630
to do an amazing workshop.
But the pestering from both

299
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.100
the individual and the, the,
the, the, the people around

300
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.950
them was just incessant. And
then I feel like I

301
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:38.330
gotta go and make a
big deal out of it.

302
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.130
And I'm a square. And
then they all go off

303
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.350
and have a great time.
And I sit alone at

304
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.580
subway. You know what I
mean? Yeah. That is kind

305
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.330
of what I'm hearing you
feel. No, I think that

306
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.370
you nailed it. I wanted
to find a way to

307
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.920
disagree with you somewhere or
add to it. But I

308
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.480
think that's a pretty dead
on analogy. This the thing

309
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.380
that's wrong with you, isn't
visible. And it really, isn't

310
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.210
a thing that you want
people to make a big

311
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.850
deal about. In fact, it
makes it worse when they

312
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:11.290
do. Okay. And, and the
fact that, you know, you

313
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.120
didn't want to, you don't
want to get into talking

314
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.320
about it and describing it
is like, it's not something

315
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.090
that I want to talk
about. It doesn't make it

316
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.810
better. It doesn't make it
worse. It makes it inconvenient.

317
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.270
And it makes me feel
like I need to explain

318
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:30.040
something to you. And you
know, now then imagine that

319
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.510
I don't have a problem
because I can't control myself,

320
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.060
which, you know, some people
argue is, or is not

321
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:41.830
a disease, but I have
a pregnancy that I don't

322
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.050
want to tell you about,
or a mental condition that

323
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.870
I'm taking. Some medication that
doesn't mix well with alcohol.

324
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.930
Why would I ever explain
that to you in a

325
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.690
way that, you know, especially
if it's a more collegial

326
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.500
relationship, but I actually say
that you shouldn't even ask

327
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.900
your friends about this kind
of thing until they're ready

328
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.820
to talk to you about
it, because it is a

329
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.440
very personal decision to make
yourself exposed like that and

330
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.290
say like, this is my
situation. And this is something

331
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.020
that has impacted my life
to the point where I've

332
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.760
decided to stay away from
alcohol. Okay. So I'm hearing,

333
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.380
you know, we hear it,
we hear it, you know,

334
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.190
buzzwords or terms like diversity
and inclusion. I prefer the

335
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.310
word inclusion. It seems to
me like, you're just arguing

336
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.310
for, let's just try not
to exclude people on necessarily.

337
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.970
Yeah. And I think that
when I give my presentation

338
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.270
that I've given at conferences,
and when I talk about

339
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.600
it, the ideas that I
have for helping the situation,

340
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.460
aren't stop drinking, stop providing
alcohol. Don't ever talk about

341
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.180
alcohol. Those I think are
actually the wrong solutions because,

342
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.310
Hey, I don't think it
would work at all. I

343
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.140
mean, prohibition work for a
reason, but B I don't

344
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.370
think that the problem isn't
on the people drinking to,

345
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.280
to solve it. But it's
simple things like if you're

346
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.290
going to have an event
and it's going to be

347
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.860
at a bar, or it's
going to have alcohol served

348
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.490
via explicit in the invitation
that soft drinks will be

349
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.220
available as well, because that
does two things. It tells

350
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.890
the person like me, there
will be selection for me

351
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.470
there at the event, but
what it does beyond that

352
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.780
is it says, and I'm
welcome. I'm welcome to the

353
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.620
point where you've specifically said,
this event has alcohol, but

354
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.340
it also will have non-alcoholic
options. Meaning I want everybody

355
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.410
to be there, regardless of
whether they're going to consume

356
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.780
alcohol. When you make it
such a focus on the

357
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.340
open bar and the opportunity
to drink heavily, that becomes

358
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.390
a situation where anyone who
is afraid of being confronted

359
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.940
over, why they're not drinking
or anyone who's afraid of

360
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.670
possibly picking up a beer
and breaking their sobriety. If

361
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.760
that's their situation, they're going
to be less likely to

362
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.400
think that's an environment I
want to put myself into.

363
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.950
And if it's something where
you're entertaining clients, and you're

364
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.820
making business decisions, it's really
exclusive in a negative way

365
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:58.920
to put someone in a
situation where they're like, do

366
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.400
I want to be perceived
as a team player and

367
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.730
understand what, what decisions and
conversations took place at two

368
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.060
in the morning? Or do
I want to stay at

369
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.040
home where I know I'll
be safe, but then I'll

370
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.490
be looked at as the
person who doesn't participate or

371
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:18.890
doesn't come out and enjoying
the team after. Yeah. I've

372
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.410
always had, you know, that
there's the concept of FOMO,

373
00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.370
FOMO, fear of missing out,
right. You know, not, not

374
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.490
drinking in high school. And
college did give me a

375
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.020
certain amount of FOMO, you
know, like, Oh, I missed

376
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.310
that. They're doing something amazing.
And, you know, typically I

377
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.090
hear that really amazing stuff
doesn't necessarily happen just because,

378
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.570
you know, you went out,
but you definitely don't want

379
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.790
people to feel like they're
not a part of a

380
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.640
part of the team because
of that. And, And I

381
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.880
think that when it becomes
something where it happens frequently,

382
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.490
it can become this mystery
to other people. Oh, why

383
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.700
don't you do this? And
it becomes, it can become

384
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.830
a bigger deal than it
really ever needs to be.

385
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.730
Right. Exactly. Like, and I
don't need people commenting on

386
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.830
whether I'm going to eat
that Cupcake. Right. Have you

387
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.320
noticed it doesn't ever eat
cupcakes? What is wrong with

388
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.040
him? Well, and that's another
really interesting point. So trying

389
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.050
to, you know, maybe we,
maybe this analogy did work.

390
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.270
Like I appreciate that you
were looking for a reason

391
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:18.080
to, to disagree, but I,
I worked at an office

392
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.080
once with another young woman
who was diabetic, but she

393
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.930
asked me to keep it
a secret because she was

394
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.130
afraid that the office would
consider her possibly weak or

395
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.370
not send her on trips
for fear that her medical

396
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.940
problem would become a business
problem. And that shocked me,

397
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.120
but it is in fact
her right. To do that.

398
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.970
Sure. Yeah. And I've thought
about that in my own

399
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.690
situation, which, so I worked
for a very small ish

400
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.730
firm, you know, 50 or
less people. And we were

401
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.080
acquired a few years later
and I now work for

402
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.900
like a couple hundred thousand
person firm. And I've thought

403
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.920
like, what if I'm looked
at in a way where

404
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.560
I could I'm damaged goods
that they wouldn't want to

405
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.330
send, if they have a
big client that they know

406
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.420
loves to go out and
have big parties at the

407
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.020
bar like that, doesn't, it's
definitely not a situation I

408
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.500
want to be in, prefer
to be in, but I

409
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.260
do put myself in those
situations. And it's because I'm

410
00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.520
comfortable enough with the part,
my relationship that I've developed

411
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.670
with sobriety and was alcohol
that I know that I

412
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.390
can do that. But like
you said, if your colleague

413
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.930
who, you know, didn't want
to be perceived as weak,

414
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.540
that's the same way. I
think some, some of us

415
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.080
who have issues with alcohol
feel like I'm okay. I

416
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.850
don't, I don't want you
to worry about me. I

417
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.070
don't want you to not
give me an opportunity because,

418
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.130
Oh, you know, Victor, he's
made it clear. He has

419
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.740
a problem with alcohol that
we don't want to have

420
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.680
him hang out with certain
clients that, that really love,

421
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.240
enjoy drinking or whatever. So,
you know, we did this,

422
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.790
we do inclusivity training at
my company. And there was

423
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:00.690
this really interesting video where
there was one of the

424
00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.540
people in the, in the,
in the video and that

425
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.490
the gender isn't specific had
two young kids. And so

426
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.800
they weren't in the room.
And one of the managers

427
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.930
said, Oh, well, we shouldn't
send so and so on

428
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.360
this trip because they have
young kids at home and,

429
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.330
and that's, you know, and,
and the implication was having

430
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:22.050
young children would hold them
back. Right. That's not, that's

431
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:26.160
not that person's call exactly
right. And it's, that is

432
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.990
a way of excluding them
as opposed to letting them

433
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.320
be adults, just as if
I said, Oh, well, you

434
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.570
know, I've got, I've got
kids. So I can't work

435
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.970
the weekend as opposed to
a single person who, what

436
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.690
their weekend doesn't matter. So,
you know, regardless of situation,

437
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.910
when work is over, we
should have our free time.

438
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.160
We own, we deserve that.
And we should be able

439
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.610
to go to events and,
and feel comfortable and safe

440
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.560
regardless. Right. And my argument
is that also I can

441
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.010
be as social as anyone
who's drinking. I can, I'm

442
00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.480
the guy who once the
coldest bottle of fizzy water

443
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.980
and I'll sit in a
bar scenario, talking with people

444
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.250
and I don't have to
have that added alcohol. In

445
00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.080
fact, what it means is
I'm going to wake up

446
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.960
and be productive for you
the next morning. So, okay.

447
00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.370
Just like your conference scenario
or your workshop scenario, right.

448
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.810
You sure you could sit
there and eat all the

449
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.880
exotic food you wanted, but
then you'd pay for it

450
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.790
the next day. And then
that's not the situation you

451
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.760
want to put in yourself,
man. Exactly. Okay. So then

452
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.710
let's try to put our
selves in the mind of

453
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:32.790
the listener. Who's who's thinking
well, okay. Maybe what Victor

454
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.060
and Scott are saying is
no hard liquor, but you

455
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.610
know, beer, how, how can
beer be a problem? Right?

456
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.700
Like beer never got anyone
in trouble, wine, open bar

457
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.550
for wine drink tickets. What
about drink tickets? Well, I'm,

458
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:49.190
I'm actually Fine with my,
this is my own personal

459
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.490
opinion, but I think that
having alcohol at events is

460
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.120
still fine and having drink
tickets is, is fine. In

461
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.790
fact, maybe it's even better
if you have tickets, because

462
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.430
that suggests that there's some
level of limit that you're

463
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:05.330
willing to put out for
free as a company, or

464
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.740
at least you're going to
attach some accountability to people

465
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.510
tracking how much alcohol they're
consuming. I personally struggled with

466
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:19.490
veer more than anything else.
And there, whether the alcohol

467
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.100
content is the same or
not, you can obviously drink

468
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.220
enough beer, that it has
the same effect as whether

469
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.360
you were drinking whiskey or
vodka or something harder. I

470
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.570
just think that when you're
having so in an office

471
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.290
setting where you have like
an open keg or something,

472
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.860
you're asking people to be
responsible and you're making some

473
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.680
assumptions, which is the day
you're not going to make

474
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:48.200
poor choices, but at the
same time, your putting yourself

475
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.320
out there by saying, I'm
going to have this perk

476
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.180
or fringe benefit, whatever of
having free alcohol readily available.

477
00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.380
But what are you doing
to then either ensure that

478
00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.010
it's being consumed responsibly or
making sure there's other options

479
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.620
available? And I can give
you a real scenario where

480
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.670
I work. Once we were
acquired, the big, the larger

481
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.400
company said, no, you will
not have an open keg.

482
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.240
You will not have access
to alcohol. And they, they

483
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.250
didn't have an issue that
it was us who had

484
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.230
access to it, but they
didn't want it to be

485
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.080
a liability in the eyes
of if there was ever

486
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.710
anybody who was, was on
the premises, who wasn't going

487
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.540
to be of age or
anything like that. What they

488
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.480
ended up doing though, was
that they got us a

489
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.970
tab at a local bar
and they got us a

490
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.720
tablet, a local coffee shop,
and both tabs open at

491
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.800
one o'clock in the afternoon
every day, every day, since

492
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.240
this happened, there is a
line of our people from

493
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.680
the coffee shop back to
the office just about, and

494
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.990
that's on a daily basis.
And what it says to

495
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.530
me is that what people
are doing with the alcohol

496
00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.220
represented the open keg or
whatever it was a community.

497
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.860
And Hey, take a break,
have a beer with each

498
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.410
other. Well, now the coffee
is doing that and people

499
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.020
are voting with their feet.
And every day it's a

500
00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.110
very strong vote of, you
know, one o'clock, there's like

501
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.930
the great migration. We all
go grab coffee. We sit

502
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.550
in groups and chat. We
bring it back to the

503
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.310
office and chat. And it's
accomplishing the same thing that

504
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.470
I think the alcohol was
meant to accomplish in some

505
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.250
way, which was creating a
community, allow suggesting to people

506
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.190
it's okay to not just
be nose to the grindstone

507
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.380
here. You can have a
beer with your colleague. And,

508
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.680
and what it does do
though, is it allows people

509
00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.510
who are not interested in
the beer to also have

510
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.600
an option and to have
the conversation and participate with

511
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.790
a drink in their hand
that they're more comfortable with.

512
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.690
So what about Going all
the way to the other

513
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.930
direction then? And just simply
having no alcohol, like we

514
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.150
just declare as a culture
that it's just not what

515
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.360
we're doing, but I was
in Paris and I made

516
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.580
that comment to someone recently
and they looked at me

517
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.640
like, I was like, it
was completely insane because wine

518
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.060
is such a fundamental part
of their culture. What could

519
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.910
this be done in? Is
it a country by country

520
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.650
or even state by state
kind of a thing where

521
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.840
it's just like, well, alcohol
is always going to be

522
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.840
a part of San Francisco,
but maybe in the Midwest

523
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.070
less. So Agree. I mean,
I've talked to people who,

524
00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.580
you know, for example, a
conference in Utah would, is

525
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:24.170
definitely, is going to not
have alcohol. Right. And you

526
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.990
know, I'm going to one
in may. And I, it's

527
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.450
not that they're trying to
be more accommodating for me

528
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.870
or for anybody that's their
culture. But then I've heard

529
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.940
from people who are in
the South where the culture

530
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.700
is more of you don't
do your drinking, your heavy

531
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.520
drinking in public, that, that
when they do have their

532
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.820
conferences, it turns into a
situation where people who aren't

533
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.660
as used to drinking a
lot, then start to, and

534
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.900
it can turn sour. I
guess I would say that

535
00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.790
my argument isn't necessarily the
shift towards removing the alcohol,

536
00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:01.000
because I think that's a
really uphill battle. And what

537
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.810
I would want to do
would be just make it

538
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.960
much less of an issue
and less of a focus

539
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.950
in terms of this is
how we socialize. This is

540
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.580
how we entertain. This is
how we promote who we

541
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:18.740
are. And often wrongly call
it our culture, which, you

542
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.170
know, it's a keg or
a bottle of hard liquor

543
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.740
that people can have access
to is an artifact of

544
00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:30.560
a culture that says, you
know, these types of things

545
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.370
make us who we are,
but it doesn't make you,

546
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.220
it doesn't make your culture.
So, you know, again, in

547
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.360
the situation with my company,
remove the keg, insert coffee,

548
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.820
and the culture stayed just
fine. In fact, I think

549
00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.650
it got stronger. So it's
really, I think that I

550
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:54.590
asked people who organized conferences
and events and workplaces to

551
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.530
say, what are we trying
to accomplish with the alcohol?

552
00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.710
And are there other ways
of doing this? Are there

553
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.700
ways of making it even
broader by including something else

554
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.700
or thinking outside of the
box? And that's what I

555
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.310
like to see. And that's
what I encourage people who,

556
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.430
who do plans things to
actually think about, what do

557
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.440
I want to achieve with
this? If I took the

558
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.020
alcohol out of the equation,
would it makes the situation

559
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.740
less enjoyable? If so, why
do people need to get

560
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.100
drunk or have alcohol to
tolerate this situation that I'm

561
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.360
putting them in? Hey, B
you know, what could I

562
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.330
do with that money that
I'm spending on alcohol for

563
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.240
other things that would make
a situation or an event

564
00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:40.010
or a work setting enjoyable
for everybody, regardless of whether

565
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:44.130
they can consume or not.
Yeah, I definitely, I like

566
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.290
that. I R I mean,
I feel like I heard

567
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.140
you say that from a,
from a professionalism perspective and

568
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.690
from a company perspective, it's
not a reasonable thing to

569
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.230
say that alcohol is a
part of our company culture,

570
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.470
you know, being social is,
or spending time with each

571
00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:02.220
other and, you know, talking
and, you know, being out,

572
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.350
being together outside of work
and team building, those are

573
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:08.850
all cultural things, but one
shouldn't bake in alcohol, into

574
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.340
their company court culture, any
more than they should say,

575
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.040
you know, pork is a
big part of our culture

576
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.470
here at the company, or,
you know, weed, we all

577
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.090
smoke weed at the end
of the day, or, you

578
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.750
know, you know, there's a
slippery slope there. Right. Right.

579
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:25.200
No, I agree with that.
Interesting. Cool. Well, do you

580
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.540
have anything else to, to
give to the conclusion? What

581
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.550
is the takeaway? What is
the, what is the person

582
00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.670
listening to this podcast? What
should they do at their

583
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:34.440
company when they, when they
walk away from the show

584
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.920
share? So if you're a
listener, Regardless of what your

585
00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.580
personal relationship with alcohol is,
I would just ask that

586
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.870
you think about the fact
that not everybody consumes alcohol

587
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:50.070
and experiences at the same
way. And some people choose

588
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:53.280
to completely not experience that,
and it doesn't make it

589
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:58.590
a bad thing. It's just
different. And the personal ask

590
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.620
I would make would be
to simply never ask somebody

591
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.350
why they're not drinking and
that that's on the personal

592
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.870
level. And on the broader
level, it would just be,

593
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.350
if you have an office
setting where alcohol is openly

594
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.110
available, or if you have
a, a group or an

595
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.920
organization that plans events and
alcohol is often the focus

596
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.670
be more mindful of what
are you doing to make

597
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.720
sure that somebody who might
be your colleague, and this

598
00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.090
is a scenario often pose
to people is, you know,

599
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.440
I started writing successfully after
I became sober. I wrote

600
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.110
a book after I became
sober. My personal life was

601
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.800
straightened up after I became
sober. You pop, but everybody

602
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.080
was surprised that this happened
because nobody knew I was

603
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.140
struggling with alcohol. You might
be sitting next to somebody

604
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.540
who you like a lot,
who you call a colleague

605
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.970
and they might be struggling
with, or have had this

606
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:52.050
struggle in their past. What,
what by simply saying, how

607
00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:55.470
are we accommodating somebody who
might not want to be

608
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:58.890
drinking alcohol, but still wants
to succeed and reach their

609
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:02.250
full potential? Are we making
sure that we say things

610
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.940
like this event will contain
non alcoholic beverages? Are we

611
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.330
doing things that just make
it obvious on the surface

612
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:12.600
that it's not all about
trying to be drunk and

613
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.270
get drunk and leading to
a scenarios that might make

614
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.760
people too uncomfortable to show
up or too uncomfortable to

615
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.400
stick around? Very cool. Well,
thanks for coming on the

616
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.970
show for being public about
your, your opinion around this

617
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.880
issue. And I appreciate, I
appreciate you, and I appreciate

618
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.460
the audience for coming along
with us on this, this

619
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.190
discussion. Thanks, Scott. And I
hope that, you know, if

620
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.400
you hear good things or
bad things that at least

621
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.150
keeps moving the conversation forward
and raising awareness, and that's

622
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.000
my hope for the whole
thing. And are you, are
