Hi, this is Carl Franklin and

11
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.830
you're listening to Hanselman it's
I'm here with Scott. It's

12
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.690
going to be a quick
show today, Scott, we're talking

13
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.000
about start run replacements, Start
run. I'm not launching files

14
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.070
fast enough. I'm not launching
my programs fast enough. I

15
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.040
go down to my start
menu and I click all

16
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.830
programs and I've just, I'm
sitting here with Waiting and

17
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.580
I'm waiting and okay. Files
just popped up. I'm running

18
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.600
at about 1400 or 1600
resolution in my start menu

19
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.930
fills my screen. So shorter,
the computer, reading your mind.

20
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.060
What can we do about
this more and more people

21
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.920
have been using the, You
know, the windows shortcuts to

22
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.110
try to make things a
little easier. Of course, Jeff,

23
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.260
Atwood's got the kind of
canonical blog post on using

24
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.980
windows keys. We've talked about
this before on the show@shrinksyour.com

25
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.310
slash E B M. And
you can do things like

26
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.570
window R and that'll pop
up the, the run dialog

27
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.580
box. So when you say
start run, you can also

28
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.680
type window R and you'll
pop that up. And then

29
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
you can also remap your
hot keys. If you've someone

30
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.200
like me and you're using
an IBM or a Lenovo

31
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.500
ThinkPad that doesn't have a
window key, you can remap

32
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.290
that. So I type right.
All are, but it's the

33
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.050
same thing at this point,
a lot of people would

34
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.280
rather type out notepad, like
spell out the entire word

35
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.190
or calc, then go hunting
for it. Right. But I

36
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.840
really wish I could get
a faster experience than, than

37
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.460
that. So I've been kind
of collecting applications that would

38
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.220
help you do that faster.
Jeff talks about a few

39
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.400
of them on his blog
post there. Here's what I've

40
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.880
found so far. There's the
original and it's still a

41
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.420
pretty good one. Dave's quick
search task bar, Right? I

42
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.580
remember you talked about this
the very first time I

43
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.760
interviewed you on.net rocks. Yeah,
it has been around for

44
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.520
a very long time. This
is an interesting one. You

45
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.720
can see it at stir.com/e
B N N as in

46
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.110
Nancy. This is a text
box that will sit down

47
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.100
in your windows task bar
and you can type in

48
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.490
a web addresses directly. It
supports a number of hot

49
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.980
keys for like adding www.or.com
to the end of a

50
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.610
string to automatically you type
in CNN, you hit control

51
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.560
enter. And just like you're
used to in the browser,

52
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.730
it'll add the appropriate prefixes
supports a history. You can

53
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.350
drag texts to the search
bar. You can bind different

54
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.530
kinds of magic words to
a particular application. So you

55
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.590
might say that, you know,
a for Amazon G for

56
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.690
Google, it's kind of up
to you. They've had a

57
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.650
little trouble recently with windows
XP service pack two because

58
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.000
Dave search bar is largely
implemented in JavaScript. So service

59
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.210
choose local machine lockdown blocks.
Dave's quick search desk bar

60
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.480
from running on reboots, take
a look at the FAQ

61
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.650
on Dave's site, but they're
working actively on a rewrite

62
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.250
of Dave's search bar. That
will let you run under

63
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.800
service pack two, but they
continue to have trouble. There's

64
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.210
a current beta that's out
right now. It's a pretty

65
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.650
flexible thing. If you're a
person who doesn't want an

66
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.630
application to be right in
your face, you'd like it

67
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.520
to be available all the
time. You're not too big

68
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.400
into hot keys. It's pretty
powerful. You can add specific

69
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.970
websites. And there's lots of
information on the Dave's forums.

70
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.820
A lot of enthusiast around
Dave's search bars that have

71
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.600
set up speed shortcuts. So
you can type in like

72
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.810
Y H and then a
word and check Yahoo, or

73
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.270
you can type in definitely,
you know, define and go

74
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.330
straight to the dictionary. It's
kind of like Code, rush

75
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.810
for your system, huh? Yeah.
Like code rush. It's really

76
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.940
totally up to you. You
can write these extensions in

77
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.450
JavaScript. It can act as
a calculator because it's using

78
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.140
JavaScript for this kind of
evaluation. It'll sit down there.

79
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.600
It'll be a clock. It'll
be a calculator. And it's

80
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.670
always sitting there because it
is a tool bar that

81
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.890
sits in the windows and
the windows task taskforce. Hey

82
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.260
Scott, do you remember at
the beginning of the show,

83
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.540
you said, you know, you
like to use the windows

84
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.480
shortcut keys, but the menus
take so long to come

85
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.540
up. Did you know that
you can change the delay

86
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.620
for the menus? And the,
the default is like 400

87
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.190
milliseconds. I think if you
go into red edit, go

88
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.150
to H key current user
control panel, desktop, scroll down

89
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.100
the right panel and double
click on the menu. Show

90
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.600
delay in the value data
box, change the default value

91
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.200
from 400 to like one
and your menus will fly.

92
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.230
And it takes some getting
used to cause there's no

93
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.190
delay when you hover over
a menu. So you really

94
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.890
have to be a little
more careful with your mouse,

95
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.650
but the cool part about
that is mouse, keyboard, whatever

96
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.860
the menus just fly. Totally.
Yeah. That's something you can

97
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.440
get to from the tweak
UI control panel as well.

98
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.030
If you don't want to
dig around in the registry,

99
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.340
right? Little things like that
can make a big difference

100
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.250
into in your general experience.
You know, it seems silly

101
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.770
to say a couple of
milliseconds will add up. Yeah,

102
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.850
they really do. They really
do so. Dave's quick search

103
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.280
sits down there on the
task bar. But the one

104
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.610
that I use primarily find
myself, keep going back to

105
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.210
is systems slick run. This
is at shrinker.com/ebo, and lots

106
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.100
of people who read my
blog are familiar with this

107
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.340
tool because I've been pimping
it furiously for a number

108
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.310
of years. I like to
run mine with a large

109
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.130
font and I do it
with a black background and

110
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.720
a Kermit green. So it
kind of looks like a

111
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.980
little floating terminal window and
I've bound it to the

112
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.620
window are key. If you
go into the slick run

113
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.740
dot any, there's a option
that's buried deep in the

114
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.610
documentation says grab when R
equals one and you can

115
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.510
bind it to window R.
And this one is a

116
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.930
similar kind of experience as
the Dave's quick bar, you

117
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.880
can add words. I have
it set up for like

118
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.210
word definitions. I can say
define foo. And it'll run

119
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.310
up to the dictionary and
define food. It'll do Google

120
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.240
searches, but it also does
auto completion of paths. So

121
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.120
I can say C colon,
backslash doc, and automatically go

122
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.410
to documents and settings. Excellent.
You can also create macros.

123
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.840
So I have a macro
called morning that will do

124
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.190
all of the different things
I want to do in

125
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.250
the morning. Like launch up
these websites, bring up outlook,

126
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.970
run a backup program, run
fried, you know, defrag, whatever

127
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.460
I want to do. I've
also put together a couple

128
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.070
other ones, like stand by
me. That will turn my

129
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.880
machine on standby mode and
things like that. Yeah. Those

130
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.660
are all called magic words.
And this application is really,

131
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.240
really fast. That's the one
thing I can say about

132
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.600
a slick run. The also
the flexibility that you have,

133
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.130
I run both internet Explorer
and Firefox. Although Firefox is

134
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.640
in my, is my primary
browser. You can define that

135
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.250
some of the slick run
words will use IAE and

136
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.450
some will use Firefox by
calling I Explorer, Firefox yourself

137
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.030
manually. So some of the
things that we use in

138
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.290
our intranet, I prefer to
have them launch. I explore

139
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.270
some of my SharePoint sites.
I want them to automatically

140
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.760
launch. I E I've also
set up commands for loading

141
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.980
monad versus loading the dos
prompt. So I've got a

142
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.960
magic word for MSH versus
foreseen. Right. It's a pretty

143
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.910
good. Do you use any
of these or you just

144
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.870
kind of a click click
kind of guy? No, I,

145
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.110
I haven't used slick run
yet, but you know, that's

146
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.050
because I haven't had a
need to, so yeah, if

147
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.600
you're doing, if you're doing
stuff with dozens of winners,

148
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.580
those open and lots of
different programs that are little

149
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.320
tiny programs that you run
this and then jumped back,

150
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.380
you know, any kind of
big time multitasking, if you

151
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.210
spend most of your time
in one application, whether it

152
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.120
be a sounding application or
whether it be a, a

153
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.010
coding application, you have less
of a need for something

154
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.140
like, yeah, I do plan
to check it out though.

155
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.600
Cause I'm here. I hear
nothing but great stuff about

156
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.630
it. Yeah. I think that
this is really about deciding

157
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.590
whether or not those seconds
matter. Right. You know, I

158
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.380
know that for a lot
of people, the fact that

159
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.230
they can bring up calc
in two milliseconds versus a

160
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.420
half a second is really
silly and it's kind of

161
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.900
the badge of the geek.
Right. But for others, they

162
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.840
really do feel like my
brain is already had the

163
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.570
thought at this point, I'm
just waiting for my fingers.

164
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.380
And I think for the
real geeks out there, I

165
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.120
think that a lot of
geeks haven't to listen to

166
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.930
the show, there's this sense
that we're IO bound, you

167
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.090
know, that I'm really waiting
for the disc drive heads.

168
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.620
And at this point, the
disk drive heads are my

169
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.080
fingers. Is there anything at
all I can get to

170
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.190
speed that up. Now another
tool that is kind of

171
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.380
like a slick slick run
is called launchy launchy.net. This

172
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.880
is at shrinks.com/e B L.
This is actively being worked

173
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.110
on, I've got this bound
to Altspace on my system.

174
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.990
And this is a, an
interesting little application that will

175
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.660
pop up kind of a
transparent window. It's very much

176
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.720
known for its skinning ability.
So people will scan it

177
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.910
to match whatever theme they're
using for those that are

178
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.720
into the whole windows customization
crowd. So it indexes your

179
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.720
start menu and all of
your shortcuts. So if I

180
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.440
hit Altspace and type it,
I see that it automatically

181
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.030
knows I want to run
iTunes because it's automatically scanned

182
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.720
and indexed my, my start
menu. So if all you

183
00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.300
want is a, is a
skinnable program, launcher that's wicked

184
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.370
fast. You want to hit
a hot key and type

185
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.320
CA and start running calc
immediately, without having to think

186
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.470
about what those words are
then launch, it would be

187
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.600
an application you might want
to check out. Of course,

188
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.540
with all of these tools,
you really can't go and

189
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.300
say, gosh, this tool does
that. And not this other

190
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.630
thing, because launching applications, we
all know that we want

191
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.210
auto-completion. We want to be
able to go and type

192
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.700
something that's less than what
we would ordinarily type when

193
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.080
we hit start run. So
with launching, it's automatically suggesting.

194
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.100
So if I type C
yay, it says Picasa I

195
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.500
type Cal. It says calc
entering it launches. Now something

196
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.210
like something like slick run
wouldn't know that I meant

197
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.850
calc when I type CA
right. But once I've run

198
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.490
calc once, and then I
launched lik run again, I

199
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.120
type CA it automatically suggests
based on history that, Oh,

200
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.400
you probably meant calc. You
just did that. Right. So

201
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.850
slick run kind of learns
as you do this pretty

202
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.630
slick. It is pretty slick.
Launchy is another application to

203
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.050
check out. So check that
out. Okay. Launchy slick running.

204
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.050
Dave's quick switch, all kind
of similar. I like to

205
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.690
use slick run to have
it follow my cursor. There's

206
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.350
a fallout chase cursor equals
one option. So wherever my

207
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.780
cursor is, is where it
will pop up. And I

208
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.490
like that in the sense
that I don't have to

209
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.160
move my eyes too much.
I don't have to go

210
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.900
back down to a particular
location, right. And I'm launching

211
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.490
a will come up automatically,
wherever it was left. Now

212
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.370
I've bound launching to Altspace.
That happens to be the

213
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.130
default, that launch he likes
to set itself up on

214
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.670
there's another tool written in.net
that people are talking about

215
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.560
called app rock. Good. This
was at shrinks.com/e B P.

216
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:51.530
So app rocket is similar
to launchy launches a free

217
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:56.560
application that you can get
up a SourceForge, but app

218
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.850
rocket at shrinks.com/ebp. This is
an application that you buy

219
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.800
it's written in.net, and rather
than floating around your screen

220
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.070
app, rocket docs at the
top of your screen, it's

221
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.770
almost like a, a title
bar. It's like a little

222
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.890
tool bar, but it's very,
very small. And it indexes

223
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.740
not only your programs, but
an index has all of

224
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.570
your files as well. So
I've bound this to control

225
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.230
space. So I've got laundry
to Altspace and I've got

226
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.710
app rocket to control space,
and I can start typing.

227
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.310
Like I just wrote an
application called console application. I

228
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.330
can just start typing console
app. And then I dropped

229
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.850
down, pops down that shows
me all of the applications,

230
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.690
code files of any particular
type that I've set up

231
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.110
that have that in the
name. So it's almost like

232
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.410
Google desktop search, right? But
this is happening in your,

233
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.050
kind of in your title
bar, as you type these

234
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.800
things are coming up. So
I'm typing in MSDN and

235
00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.110
I see MSDN newsgroups that
are coming out of my

236
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.990
web history. I see an
application, a CS file I

237
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.050
had called MSDN dot CSS.
And I also see a

238
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.260
web query. So I can
type in MSDN space, hit,

239
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.450
enter, and then type in
the query. So I hit

240
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.230
MSDN enter system at XML
enter and it automatically launches

241
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.890
up my browser. Wow, cool.
You know, the one thing

242
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.930
I should mention is you
gotta be careful with too

243
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.580
many utilities that index your
hard drive because before you

244
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.500
know it, you know, those
things are chewing up a

245
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.170
lot of CPU space, and
a lot of disk access

246
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.160
to then if you've got
the Google tool bar and

247
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.240
you've got MSN search and
maybe rocket, you probably just

248
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.330
want to pick one, right?
You are 100% on, on

249
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.000
target. I've I selected every
single one of these in

250
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.130
order to make sure that
I could kind of review

251
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.830
them completely. But I, right
now I'm slick run all

252
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.080
the time. I use slick
run everyday all the time.

253
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.530
I love slick run. I
don't think launchy is going

254
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.330
to be for me. Cause
I can do everything I

255
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.100
can do with laundry was
slick run by setting up

256
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.590
magic words, I'm liking app
rocket more and more, but

257
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.040
it's only $18 to buy,
which is not too bad.

258
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.010
Slick run is free, quick
Dave's bars, free launches free.

259
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.670
All of them allow you
to do things like, you

260
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.850
know, MSDN space, whatever or
Google space, whatever, and look

261
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.770
things up. I like app
rockets look and feel. It's

262
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.910
very similar to an application
on the Mac called quicksilver@shrimps.com

263
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.380
slash EBR. Although quick silver
is largely considered to be

264
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.980
the greatest hot, key based
app launcher in the history

265
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.250
of the universe. This Quicksilver
is the windows version or

266
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.740
is this Mac only, or
If there was a windows

267
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.350
version of Quicksilver, these guys
would have a license to

268
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.140
print money, right? So there
is, there are, there is

269
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.800
not a hype. No, there's
no hyperbolic. There's nothing that

270
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.270
can be said about how
Quicksilver is automatic once you've

271
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.170
experienced it because Quicksilver doesn't
just take simple magic words

272
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.560
like we're talking about it
takes combinations of nouns and

273
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.810
verbs. So you might say
something like email too, like

274
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.760
you might say like open
this file and email it

275
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.200
to that person. All in
one kind of composite, it's

276
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.920
almost like a graphical. I
was gonna say graphical monad,

277
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.360
but it's it's greatest. Strength
is not the searching. It's

278
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.780
the idea that you can
take tasks and put them

279
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.390
all together. So you might
say there's a file on

280
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.460
my hard drive called Fu
I want to email it

281
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.660
to this guy. So you're
basically doing three actions and

282
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.030
you're linking them up. So
Quicksilver knows how to find

283
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.580
the file. And it knows
you have email and it

284
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.310
knows about the different contacts
on your machine. So it's

285
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.670
the linking together of those
verbs. And a lot of

286
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.210
these applications have the, the
simple notion of one verb.

287
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.830
I might want to open
this file or might want

288
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.200
to print that file. Right.
But they don't link them

289
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.010
together. I see. Now there
is another application that is

290
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.040
a paid application. Cause we're
kind of going up the

291
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.340
up the food chain here
from free applications to applications

292
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.780
that start doing a little
bit more. Okay. This is

293
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:08.990
called active words. This is
at shrinks.com/ebq. Now the applications

294
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.050
we've talked so talked about
so far have user interfaces.

295
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.140
Active words is interesting in
that. If you don't want

296
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.280
to really see it, you
don't have to, you just

297
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.030
see, see what, see the
user interface. If you don't

298
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.670
want to know that this
thing exists. Oh, I see.

299
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.360
So active words is actually
listening to everything that you

300
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.360
are listening. It's watching every
single thing that you type.

301
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:37.400
Huh? So if you just
type the word word and

302
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.970
in notepad or just at
the command line or just

303
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.700
in Explorer and the keys,
aren't really going anywhere. They're

304
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.230
not being typed in anywhere.
You can type in word

305
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.620
and hit F eight or
whatever function, key you've bound

306
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.370
to it. And then word
launches. They have a toolbar

307
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.040
that will monitor every single
keystroke that you, that you

308
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.040
type, but you don't have
to see that, you know,

309
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.830
if you don't want to.
Wow. So what's interesting about

310
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.030
that is imagine like auto
suggest like word auto suggest

311
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.070
where I'm sure we're now
you've used word long enough

312
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.130
to type in Karl. It
automatically assumes you're typing Carl Franklin,

313
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:18.440
right? So you could type
in the word SIG SIG

314
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.500
and hit space and then
have no matter where you

315
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.400
typed it in windows, have
active words automatically put in

316
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.970
your email signature. So it's
kind of a system wide

317
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:34.760
text-based, you know, keystroke, logger
pool. It's pretty, it's pretty

318
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.180
amazing. And they've got a,
a tablet PC version. So

319
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.220
then you can just do
the exact same thing except

320
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.700
with ink. Wow. So you
type in, you know, NYT

321
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.640
and it launches the New York
times. I love my tablet

322
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.830
PC, by the way, love
it, love it, love it.

323
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.810
Active words might be the
thing that could take that

324
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.320
to the next level. Being
able to type in almost

325
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.080
like, you know, not quite
gestures, but little shortcut words.

326
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.930
So there's a lot of
interesting demos up at the

327
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.680
active words, website it's active
words.com or <inaudible> dot com

328
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.450
slash EBQ. They've got some
screencasts where they're inside of

329
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.760
word. They type in the
word Excel and then launch

330
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.060
Excel. You know? So it's
this, it's watching everything that

331
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.880
you do, right? Each of
these applications has a, a

332
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.960
Zen to, it has a
style and you just have

333
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.380
to buy into the one
that makes you happy right

334
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.650
now. Interestingly, while I was
in the middle of evaluating

335
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.610
these tools, I noticed that
the Google update or the

336
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.560
little tool that sits in
the corner and tells you

337
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.400
if when any of your
Google applications has been updated

338
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.850
recently notify me that a
new version of Google desktop

339
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.700
was out. So I upgraded
cause I'm an upgrade whore.

340
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.920
I just upgrade anytime any
application tells me there's a

341
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.040
new version and I'm doing
my thing. I haven't thought

342
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.200
about any of the new
features. And I accidentally bumped

343
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:58.920
control twice. And this weird
translucent white dialogue box pops

344
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.160
up with like a 20
point font that says, Google,

345
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:07.050
just Google switch, Google quick
search box. I'm going to

346
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.850
sit here right now. I
hit control control, and I

347
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.840
type in Carl and it
says search web Carl. And

348
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.050
then it says Carl Franklin and
mentioned some text files that

349
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.410
I've got. I see an
email here from you. I

350
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.980
see you referenced on Google
groups. This is all popping

351
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.070
down, just like you ordinarily
see with app rocket, but

352
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.170
it's happening right in the
middle of my desktop. It's

353
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.170
popped up as a mode
list dialogue. Wow. I can

354
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.200
still do other things. And
then I can just hit

355
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.350
enter and see all of
those results in my browser.

356
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:42.030
So I'm seeing Google autocomplete
as a little application. That's

357
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.510
just kind of leapt out
of my desktop. So I

358
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.640
think I'm probably going to
end up with a combination

359
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.090
of slick run and the
Google desktop. I tried windows,

360
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.430
desktop search for awhile. I
like it, but I keep

361
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.540
getting a, my index keeps
getting corrupted. So your point

362
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.430
about having too many of
these on your system is

363
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:05.190
definitely true right now, Google
app rocket all fight trying

364
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.400
to index my hard drive.
Really, Especially if you're trying

365
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.890
to do any recording or
anything like that, told you

366
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.020
to turn all that off.
When I do a presentation,

367
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.110
I always turn off Google
desktop, and I just use

368
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.840
a slick run because it
doesn't do any indexing at

369
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.210
all. Hey, I don't know
if you're into this, but

370
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.820
if you do any sort
of recording audio recording with

371
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.350
your PC, there's an XP
tuning tips, you know, tuning

372
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.510
XP for audio at shrinks.com/ebt,
which I swear by and

373
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:35.420
I, anybody who does any
recording for me, I, I

374
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.990
send them to this, to
this page. And that's where

375
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.050
I found the, the, the,
the trick to the menu

376
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.130
show, delay registry setting that
you can turn down. Very

377
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:50.230
cool. Yep. So, So far
we've talked about the standard

378
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.840
wind keys stuff, and we
saw Jeff Atwood's article. It

379
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.890
shrinks your.com/ebm. We looked at
launchy, which is a shoe,

380
00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.620
a freeware application that's you
can get. So we talk

381
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.470
about wind ki. Well, when
you ask a Winky is

382
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.480
kind of a complicated thing.
Winky used to be the

383
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.440
thing that everyone would use
to make up new windows,

384
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.910
key combinations. But if you
go Google and around for,

385
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.050
for wind key, you'll find
that the company that makes

386
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.900
it decided that it's was
too, it was too free.

387
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.840
And as such was causing
too much of a support

388
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.570
burden on them, right? So
they got rid of it.

389
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.880
And if you go to
the wind key site, you'll

390
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.860
find that we don't sell
that. We don't give that.

391
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.170
We don't let you have
it anymore. So there's lots

392
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.240
and lots of mirrors that
you can find of this

393
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.050
application, but it is currently
dead ended. It's stuck at

394
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.590
whatever version was most recently
released, which is very sad.

395
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.730
So, but there's a site
on coding horror. So coding

396
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.100
horror has a celebration of
the windows key with a

397
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.970
list of all of the
different windows keys that you

398
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.510
might want to, to use
the builtin stuff in windows

399
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.740
like window D for desktop.
What I'm talking about is

400
00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.740
an application that was called
wind wind key. Yeah, that's

401
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.110
the Winky was a really
great application that lets you

402
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.710
take all the other 26
letters of the language and,

403
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.630
and bind them to whatever.
So you could have windows,

404
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.410
whatever, but of course that's
gone now, so you're going

405
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.790
to have to go hunting
for it. And I think

406
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.950
we actually talked about that
a little bit ago on

407
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.420
a previous episode of Hansel
minutes, we did now in

408
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.300
the interest of productivity, one
of the other things that

409
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.320
I wanted to talk about
is this getting things done.

410
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.390
We've talked about that a
little bit before David, Allen's

411
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.180
getting things done. The idea
of, you know, getting your

412
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.660
inbox down to zero items
and stuff like that. But

413
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.670
there's this crazy application that
I've been using and I've,

414
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.660
I've actually set up as
my home page. This was

415
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.860
called tiddly Wiki. And this
has, this takes a little

416
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.140
bit of time to get
one's head around. This is

417
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:52.690
a Wiki run entirely in
a single HTML page. It's

418
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.530
not a server side thing.
You go up to tiddly,

419
00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:01.270
wiki.com or shrinker.com/ebs and download
it. It's like a, you

420
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.000
know, a hundred K file
and you run it and

421
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.490
I've got it running on
my desktop. So it's, I

422
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.970
set up my desktop, my,
I set up my homepage

423
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:16.000
as this particular file and
it's a complete Wiki all

424
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.230
done in, you know, Ajax.
She D HTML with animations.

425
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.830
It works in both browsers
and you can keep your

426
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.760
notes in there. It's almost
like one note done entirely

427
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.750
as a JavaScript application, totally
editable as a Wiki with

428
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.270
all the formatting and the
graphics and the nice stuff.

429
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.020
And the one I'm using
is the GTD or getting

430
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.820
things done, tiddly Wiki plus
that has the philosophy of

431
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.760
getting things done. The idea
of keeping track of all

432
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.500
the different things in your
life and all the different

433
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.980
contexts and all the different
to-dos and keeping them in

434
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.910
one in one Wiki. Wow.
So rather than to do

435
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.790
lists and outlook or textiles,
which is really what I've

436
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.950
been doing for years, everyone
has a text file called

437
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.050
to do dot text on
the right stuff to do

438
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.480
that text. So rather than
doing to do dot text,

439
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.430
I wanted to give this
a try and I use

440
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:11.510
folder share, you know, to
keep my files synchronized. So

441
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.580
I've got to have we
talked about folder share. I

442
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.670
think we might not sure
we might have, but folders

443
00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.650
shared folders share.com has now
been purchased by Microsoft. Of

444
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.700
course they are now a
windows live beta service. And

445
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.550
this is a, a feature
that lets you, it's not

446
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.450
really sharing folders as it
is synchronizing folders seamlessly between

447
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.940
between systems behind firewalls. So
on my desktop, I've created

448
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.380
a file called a folder
rather called shared desktop. And

449
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.840
then I shared it to
myself, securely using the folder

450
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.210
share service. So now if
I put a file called

451
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:48.350
Karl dot text in my
shared desktop, it'll automatically show

452
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.320
up on my tablet, my
work PC, my home PC

453
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.470
and my Mac. Yeah. So
folder share shrinks or.com/e B

454
00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.820
V E boy vital. So
I've been using this to

455
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.630
synchronize my, to do not
text, but then I started

456
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.090
thinking, well, shoot, you know,
I've got this tiddly Wiki,

457
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.850
and it's such a more
rich way of looking at

458
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.540
things. It works anywhere. It
works in any browser. And

459
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.360
it gives me that kind
of dynamic Wiki feel without

460
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.240
the concern of a database
or any kind of files

461
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.900
in the background. It automatically
saves itself. So I started

462
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.570
using it as my homepage
on all of my machines

463
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:31.030
automatically synchronized using folders share.
Wow. So I've got things

464
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:34.120
to blog. Got it is
server-based or it's not server-based

465
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.490
so what it does Just
because it's running on your

466
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.700
local machine and it's using
JavaScript, it's storing everything in

467
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.580
a JavaScript array. So it's
not like a site that

468
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.740
you have access to. That's
why you have to share

469
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.200
to central. Exactly. But that's,
what's so brilliant about it.

470
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.920
You can actually use this
for your, for your homepage.

471
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.100
So if you go to
like hanselman.com, not handsome on

472
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.810
a comp slash blog, but
just hands. When I come

473
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.500
my homepage at the, at
the root of my domain

474
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.840
is it is a tiddly
Wiki. Okay. What, you know,

475
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.900
what simpler way it also
has built in uploading where

476
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.110
you can, you can teach
it how to upload itself.

477
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:12.460
So you could use this
to maintain an application or

478
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.580
a, a personal homepage. Very
cool. But I'm using it

479
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.520
for mostly for, you know,
for organization, for keeping track

480
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.690
of my life. I keep
trying to get into the

481
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.900
whole one note way of
thinking, but it's just, it's

482
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.980
just so darn complicated. I
I'm really finding that a

483
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.800
Wiki is what I needed.
It's it's more free form.

484
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.810
Right. And the fact that
tiddly Wiki ran entirely in

485
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.750
a browser had no service
side, no components to install.

486
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.480
It's just open a file
up. Very cool. Very cool

487
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.550
stuff that alongside all of
different utilities to make life

488
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.180
a little faster is, I
don't know. I'm think I'm

489
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.810
reaching a productivity Nirvana, right?
Is that a show? I

490
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.170
think that is All right,
Scott. Thank you very much

491
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.170
for sharing your, your, your
list of stuff with us

492
00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.870
again this week. And as
for you, dear listener, we

493
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.210
will talk to you next
week on handsome minutes.
