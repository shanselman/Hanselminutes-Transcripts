episode, Scott and Carl, talk

10
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.660
about the latest technology for
dealing with diabetes and include

11
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.530
a short discussion on the
basics. Hi, this is Carl Franklin

12
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.660
and you're listening to Hansel
minutes. I'm here with Scott.

13
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.440
Hey Scott, how are you?
How's it going, sir? This

14
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.510
show's going to be a
little different. This is like

15
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.900
different month. Isn't it. We've
got to mix things up.

16
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.310
You've got to try different
things. We can always sit

17
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.500
around and chat about stuff,
but we've done a couple

18
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.480
of interviews shows recently. Why
not try a little something

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.220
different occasionally? So this show
is all about diabetes technology,

20
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.890
which is a subject near
and dear to your heart,

21
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.450
right? Yeah. I'm a type
one diabetic. This is a

22
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.480
you've blogged about this quite
a lot. And I know

23
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.730
a lot of your, your
readers may or may not

24
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.270
be diabetic, but a lot
of them know about this

25
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.460
side of you because you
blog so much about it.

26
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.650
In fact, you've got some
really good general layman's explanations

27
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.110
of what diabetes is and
how, how it happens and

28
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.390
how it works and what
you can do on your

29
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.990
blog. Some great stuff. Yeah.
All of my diabetes category

30
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.970
is@shrinkstir.com slash J C X.
And that'll take you to

31
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.870
a page archive view with
all of the different posts

32
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.910
that I've done over the
years about diabetes and diabetes

33
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.870
technology. But if for somebody
who's just had cursory knowledge

34
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.370
of it in passing, give
us the elevator speech. Okay.

35
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.040
So the nutshell is a,
I'm a type one diabetic,

36
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.890
and I was diagnosed a
couple of months before my

37
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.160
21st birthday in the old
days, they would have called

38
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.800
that a juvenile diabetic, but
now they call it type

39
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.810
one. And this means that
I don't produce any of

40
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.900
my own insulin and insulin
is the stuff that picks

41
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.740
up a blood sugar. Well,
this is kind of, again,

42
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.430
a layman's more complicated than
this, but delivers it to

43
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.770
the sales drivers. It's actually
technically, it's a, it's a,

44
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.310
it's the key that unlocks
the sales and allows the

45
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.350
sugar to go into them.
Yeah. So you eat a

46
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.340
bunch of food and no
matter what you eat, Whether

47
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.340
you eat pure sugar or
whether you eat gummy bears

48
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.340
or apples, it all turns
into glucose and gets to

49
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.250
adjusted and put into your
bloodstream. And that's a whole

50
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.830
complicated process through the stomach
and the gut and the,

51
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.390
And your brain basically glucose
is brain fuel too, right?

52
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.610
Yeah. Totally. It goes, that
is what runs the brain.

53
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.130
Totally. Yeah. So it flows
around in your blood sugar,

54
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.620
in your blood as blood
sugar, we call it BG

55
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.880
or blood glucose, and then
the insulin unlocks the cells

56
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.830
and lets that sugar in.
And you'd like to keep

57
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.730
a certain balance of blood
sugar, too much sugar in

58
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.450
your blood will over the,
over the years, start to

59
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.840
clog the tiny capillaries, the
little tiny blood vessels that

60
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.690
are in your feet, that
are in your eyes. It'll

61
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.180
start to wear down your
kidneys and your liver. As

62
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.860
those are kind of the
filters of your, of your

63
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.500
body. You sort of hear
those stories about people going

64
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.560
blind or losing limbs. That's
the kind of stuff that

65
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.590
you're talking about. Yeah. Diabetes
is the number one cause

66
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.870
of blindness in the U
S at least I'm not

67
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.990
sure about worldwide and the
number one cause of amputations.

68
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.290
Yeah. Most, if you're diabetic
for a very, very long

69
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.230
time and you don't manage
it, well, things will definitely

70
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.440
start falling off. Things will
start falling off Eventually. And

71
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.140
if you don't have enough
blood sugar, what happens if

72
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.870
you have too much blood
Sugar in your system is

73
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.050
called hyperglycemia hyper meaning too
much, not enough means hypoglycemia.

74
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.990
And then basically the brain
starts to shut down because

75
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.750
you're not getting enough fuel
to it. This is when

76
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.450
you see people getting shaky
And dizzy and that kind

77
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.770
of stuff. Exactly. Yeah. So,
yeah. Diabetics who do not

78
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.660
produce their own insulin like
myself have to supplement. So

79
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.290
I have to add insulin
into my system. And as

80
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.390
you eat, your blood sugar
goes up as you take

81
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.690
insulin into your body, your
blood sugar goes down and

82
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.440
you try to keep that
altitude level, just so, and

83
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.660
that's why I always use
this air airplane analogy. And

84
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.170
it's the pancreas that creates
insulin Meredith. The thing called

85
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.530
the isle, the Isles of
Langer, Hahn's the little kind

86
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.550
of cell in the pancreas
that produces the insulin. And

87
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.070
the, the presumption is at
least in my case and

88
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.340
a lot of type one's
case that it's an autoimmune

89
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.970
disorder. So I actually got
the flu in, I think

90
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.930
it was in November of
1994. And after the flu

91
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.300
was over, my body had
beaten up the flu and

92
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.490
in the progress and the
process had beaten up my

93
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.660
pancreas. Wow. Everyone has different
perspectives about how that works,

94
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.780
but the general belief is
that it's an overreactive immune

95
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.480
system. And so the type
one could really happen to

96
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.150
anybody. Yeah. I mean, it
really can, it can happen.

97
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.400
I mean, type one can
happen at age 30 or

98
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.830
it can happen when you're
two years old, more and

99
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.410
more, unfortunately we're seeing people
over 20 getting it, which

100
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.170
is really odd. There's definitely
a, I mean, I don't

101
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.660
know if it's more people
being diagnosed or more people

102
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.480
really literally getting it because
something in the environment's changed,

103
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.290
but it's definitely coming up
more and more often. So

104
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.670
type two, what Is type
two normally? So type two

105
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.900
is often hereditary, but type
two is actually so different

106
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.430
from type one that it
might as well be called

107
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.040
a totally different disease that
they're both called diabetes is

108
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.440
interesting type one. Doesn't produce
enough insulin while type two

109
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.460
are actually resistant often to
their own insulin. So it's

110
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.760
almost as if they've produced
so much over the years,

111
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.070
they become resistant to it.
Like they have become resistant

112
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.430
to any drug. So then
you might be a, let's

113
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.540
say that a person is
a 200 pound person, but

114
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.040
for the large part of
their life, they were maybe

115
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.100
150 pounds. And then suddenly
they became 200 pounds, but

116
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.430
their body is still producing
the amount that would be

117
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.490
normal for 150 pound person.
They might need to supplement.

118
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.900
Or they got really big
And was, was eating a

119
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.930
lot of carbs more than
is that a reasonable amount?

120
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.780
Maybe they lose, you know,
carbo loaded in a major,

121
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.900
major way. Then the body
just starts producing so much

122
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.080
insulin. I guess that's why
the low carb diet has

123
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.800
been very popular among type
two diabetics. Oh yeah. Because

124
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.090
you just going back to
the airplane analogy, if you're

125
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.070
you eat food, your blood
sugar goes up. So let's

126
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.560
say that your altitude raises.
And if you take insulin,

127
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.130
your altitude goes down with,
with food. If you eat

128
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.640
something that is high in
carbs, something would has a,

129
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.390
what we call a high
glycemic index, meaning that it

130
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.000
hits you fast. That's kind
of like pulling back on

131
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.280
the airplane stick really quickly.
And that's, I know a

132
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.790
little bit about this. That's
why I'm actually intelligent discussions

133
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.820
this week, but that's why,
you know, the, the, the

134
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.540
rush sugar, the refined flour,
all that stuff, that's like

135
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.280
very converts very quickly to
energy is the worst stuff.

136
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.730
Exactly. Yeah. For example, like
White rice is worse than

137
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.490
Brown rice, right? Yeah. White
bread is really bad for

138
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.420
you. Yeah. Like a really
simple example would be that

139
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.630
an Apple with a skin
on it would hit you

140
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.330
slightly slower than an Apple
without the skin. Cause your

141
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.850
body has to chew through
all that and spanning energy

142
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.420
to digest. Yeah. Yeah. Slows
it down. Right. Okay. So,

143
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.980
so what, let's talk about
the technology available to diabetics.

144
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.290
And first of all, I
want to, before we talk

145
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.350
about the stuff that you're
into, I had heard last

146
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:19.270
year that somebody was perfecting
or bringing to market and

147
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.520
inhalable insulin, and this was
supposed to be like the

148
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.590
biggest thing in the world,
because if you're a diabetic,

149
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.140
like you are, you're pricking
your finger, checking your blood

150
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.490
sugar, you're shooting insulin with
needles in, you know, out.

151
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.630
Yeah, totally. So what's the
status of inhalable insulin. I

152
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.000
know that you're up on
this. Right? So, so as

153
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.190
a, as a type one,
I've spent the last 10

154
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.270
years giving myself shots, some
type ones give themselves as

155
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.240
few as one or two
shots a day, which would

156
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.420
be the equivalent of changing
your altitude, you know, once

157
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.700
or twice a day. So
fly from New York to LA

158
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.120
and then you only allowed
to touch the stick twice.

159
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.410
Yeah. And you have to
prick yourself to check your,

160
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.780
you prick your finger to
check your blood sugar. And

161
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.700
then you, that's a, a
small finger prick. It's a

162
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.310
very, very small needle and
it heals very, very quickly.

163
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.920
But when you give yourself
a shot, you're usually using

164
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.670
a 30, I think it's
a 30 millimeter or micro

165
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.620
meter. It's a, it's a,
they call it a 30

166
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.440
gauge needle or a third
needle. Very, very small needle.

167
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.830
It's a needle. Yeah. Nine
millimeters, long, 30 gauge needle.

168
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.590
And you're injecting stuff into
the fat, right. It sits

169
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.380
basically into the, into your,
into your belly, into the

170
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.500
back of your arm, into
your thighs and giving yourself

171
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.320
what are called units of
insulin. Okay. If you, the

172
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.370
more you want to have
control, very precise control. You're

173
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.820
going to give yourself more
shots of smaller amounts more

174
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.690
often, right? So to be
a really good diabetic, to

175
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.400
be very much in control,
you need to be giving

176
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.250
yourself shots all the time.
So inhalable insulin kind of

177
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.980
promised to let people use
it like an inhaler, like

178
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.380
an asthma inhaler. They literally
just suck it in. And

179
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.130
then the inner, the inner
lining of the lungs would

180
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.700
do the absorption of the
insulin. So you're basically inhaling

181
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.750
a fine mist and atomized
mist of insulin. Yeah, it's

182
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.330
good. But the problem with
this is that it's plus

183
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.570
or minus a unit. So
for example, if I went

184
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.580
to, I went to Chipola
today and I had some

185
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:19.140
tacos and I gave myself
five units of insulin. That's

186
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.840
how much I need, not
four, not six, four would

187
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.480
be too little, six would
be too much for me.

188
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.600
Inhalable insulin would have meant.
I really don't know until

189
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.770
after it's done, how well
that was absorbed. It's a

190
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.500
plus or minus. Cause you
just, this there's an, there's

191
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.550
an error for someone who's
taking 10, 15 units of

192
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.580
insulin in a meal plus
or minus one might not

193
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.920
be much to them for
someone who is taking five

194
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.710
or four or five, like
me, that's 20% of the,

195
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.670
that dose and then texts.
And by the time you

196
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.980
get to measure its effect,
it might be too late.

197
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.050
Is that the deal? Exactly.
So one of the things

198
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.570
that's tricky about this, going
back to the airplane analogy

199
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.480
is that when you prick
your finger, you're really looking

200
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.210
at your blood sugar 15
minutes ago. And when you

201
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.410
take insulin, your effecting your
blood sugar in about an

202
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.900
hour. So it would be
as if you looked at

203
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.210
the airplane, saw the altitude,
but that was your altitude.

204
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.280
15 minutes ago, you pushed
on the stick, but the

205
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.960
plane's not gonna move for
30 minutes and insulin pumps.

206
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.560
Okay. So, so I use
an insulin pump because rather

207
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.230
than pricking myself with a
needle, 10 times a day

208
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.890
or 20, or however many
times I want to, I

209
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.550
have a tube that's connected
to a plastic cannular. It's

210
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.210
basically a plastic needle. That's
into my stomach and then

211
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.940
taped down with medical tape.
So I put that in

212
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.790
every three days, I've got
this big, long needle with

213
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.450
this kind of launcher looking
plastic device that goes and

214
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.970
shoots the needle into my
gut. And just before the

215
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.730
show you did that, right?
Yeah. Actually just before we

216
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.730
started, started the show, I
switched my, I changed my

217
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.060
pump refill that. So I
moved it from one part

218
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.680
of my body to another,
because you don't want the

219
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.280
insulin to be absorbed by
one section of the fat

220
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.650
in your body. Cause it'll
eventually break down. So it's

221
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.020
a needle with a tube
around it. You shoot the

222
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.450
needle in, you pull the
needle out and it leaves

223
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.200
the tube that it brought
along for the ride With

224
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.650
it. Oh yeah. But this
allows me to give myself

225
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.660
insulin at a 10th of
a unit resolution. So we

226
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.240
were talking about doing a
unit here, a unit there.

227
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.730
I can give myself one
10th of one unit with

228
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.660
something that's not possible. Now
I would say not possible,

229
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.690
but really, really difficult with
a needle. So when I

230
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.340
can do this all day
long, I only have to

231
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.540
give myself this shot, this
kind of dramatic entrance every

232
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.530
three days. And then I
can give myself ongoing background

233
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.170
insulin. I can put it
into buffet mode if I'm

234
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.760
going to be at a
buffet and snacking for a

235
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.340
long period of time, keeps
track of all sorts of

236
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.860
things. And I was on
a pump about five years

237
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.230
ago. Actually I went on
my first date with my

238
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.930
wife, which was the first
week that I'd ever used

239
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.510
the pump. Hmm. So who
knows how it would've gone

240
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.370
down if I had a
lousy blood sugar week right

241
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.060
Now, when I first interviewed
you for dotnet rocks, you

242
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.200
told me about a little
program that you had written

243
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.820
on your, your iPod or
not your iPod iPad pilot.

244
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.320
My Palm pilot. Okay. It's
called gluco pilot. Right. I

245
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.290
wrote that like September of
98 and it was, you

246
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.590
know, the preeminent blood sugar
management system for diabetics on

247
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.990
a Palm pilot. And it
was basically done with the

248
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.800
idea that, you know, your,
your, your tattoos, your tasks,

249
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.950
your contacts, your calendar and
your blood sugar, it's all

250
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.470
peers. They're all the same
thing. Yeah. I sold it

251
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.970
to a company and they
sold it to a company

252
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.860
who sold to a company.
And now, unfortunately it's not

253
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.130
being maintained anymore. And one
of these days it's on

254
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.080
my list to go and
write a really awesome one

255
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.420
on the, the AIPAC or,
you know, one of the

256
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.050
compact framework pieces. Yeah. So
that's a really good thing

257
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.940
to bring up because this
is an example of a

258
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.280
device that had a bigger
screen, more batteries and a

259
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.220
lot of memory. Yeah. So
before, when I had my

260
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.500
insulin pump, it was just
a delivery mechanism. A lot

261
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.480
of people look at it
and they think it's automatic.

262
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.270
It handles everything for me
in this case, it just

263
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.750
delivers insulin. It just has
a screw drive that turns

264
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.570
the screw moves forward, pushes
against the bottom of a

265
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.500
syringe and squirts insulin in
it's very, very low tech

266
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.210
in that sense, it's very
high tech in the sense

267
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.250
that it can never ever
break down. It's like I've

268
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.230
got a million fail safes
and a thousand checks a

269
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.830
minute, you know, but it's
pretty much just a, a

270
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.790
fancy, you know, it's a
fancy Ivy, but it's just

271
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.880
done. I'm into the fat
right now. It doesn't have,

272
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.230
in the old days, it
didn't have a lot of

273
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.290
information. So then a new
pump came out. I could

274
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.810
check my blood sugar by
pricking my fingers. The value

275
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.580
would show up on the
blood sugar meter. And then

276
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.940
it would be transmitted wirelessly
to the pump because the

277
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.090
pump knows how much insulin
it's been giving me the

278
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.970
information it didn't have was
what's my blood sugar now.

279
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.120
And then it has a
wizard where I can say

280
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.450
now that you know, my
blood sugar, because it came

281
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.390
in wirelessly and you know
how much insulin you've been

282
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.250
giving me because I've been
setting it and you have

283
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.190
a history, how much insulin
should I take for this

284
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.340
particular meal? I can describe
the meal in carbs and

285
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.950
it will make a suggestion.
Now I still have to

286
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.660
close the loop. I still
got to push the button,

287
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.600
right. Because if they killed
me by making the, the,

288
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.420
a decision automatically, that would
be bad. So I'm always

289
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.820
the one who has to
say and do it. Yeah,

290
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.360
none of it's automatic. Now
what's amazing is that six

291
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.970
days ago, I just got
a new what's called a

292
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.590
continuous blood sugar meter. And
this is another device that

293
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.800
sits attached to me on
the other side of the

294
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.830
body. I put the pump
on the one side and

295
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.810
I put the meter and
put on one side output

296
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.750
on the other, exactly, same
kind of thing. It's got

297
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.490
a tube that kind of
goes into me with a

298
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.310
big long needle and I
shoot it in and then

299
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.920
pull the needle out. And
the tube stays in and

300
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.120
it sips it sips the
interstitial fluid into, in the

301
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.870
fat and generates a value.
And then I check my

302
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.540
blood sugar by pricking my
finger. And then it does

303
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.240
a correlation and it says,
Oh, well, I'm going to

304
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.540
trust your blood sugar meter
because this is the authoritative

305
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.460
source, right? Blood sugar meter
has been around for years

306
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.920
and years. We trust them.
This is a new technology.

307
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.740
We don't fully trust it.
Okay. So we're going to

308
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.050
calibrate it. So maybe it
comes up with some number,

309
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.180
right? Some arbitrary number that
has nothing to do with

310
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.510
blood sugar. And it's going
to find a correlation. You

311
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.880
know, when I think this
number, your blood sugar must

312
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.090
be this because historically, so
actually right now I'm because

313
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.310
I've just changed it. I'm
in the middle of the

314
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.850
warmup period. So it's actually
learning about me right now

315
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.430
over the next two hours.
And then once that warmup

316
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.520
period is done, I'm going
to have a real time

317
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.080
graph, mostly real time, every
five minutes of my blood

318
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.380
sugar on the screen of
my insulin pump. This is

319
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:46.460
freaking huge, correct this, right?
This is the difference between

320
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.030
checking your altitude twice a
day, versus actually having an

321
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.720
altimeter that changes the, to,
to really push the airplane

322
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.840
analogy. This is kind of
like an artificial horizon. I'm

323
00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.680
not actually gonna use it
to make really substantive decisions.

324
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.570
I'm still going to trust
the pricking of my finger

325
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.840
because this is not sipping
blood. It's just sipping some

326
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.850
of that inner fluid that
you have running around in

327
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.250
your system. Yeah. But it's
going to give me a

328
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.180
trendline. It's going to give
me valuable information about what's

329
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.150
happened between this time and
that time when I hear

330
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.400
about diabetics who check their
blood sugar twice a day,

331
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.800
I just like, how does
that provide you any information

332
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.470
at all? Right? Oh, it
was 100 at four in

333
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.170
the morning. And now it's
three in the afternoon. What

334
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.420
does that tell you? Yeah.
You know, our altitude was

335
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.770
a thousand feet over Ohio.
Totally useless information because there's

336
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:38.660
such crazy stuff happening in
between. This thing has already,

337
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.120
I've had the best blood
sugar of the last, the

338
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.250
last three days of my
life. Now the best blood

339
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.500
sugar means you've been in
the most control of it.

340
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.660
Right? Yeah. That's a very
good point. What, I mean

341
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.920
the best blood sugar. I
mean, my blood sugar has

342
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.950
been as close to normal
that I then has ever

343
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.420
been As you've been able
to react to the readings

344
00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.680
in a timely manner. Yeah,
Exactly. Like for example, sometimes

345
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.450
I'll take a nap and
my blood sugar will go

346
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.610
high and I'll wake up
and I'll feel like I've

347
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.430
been marinating in my own
juices, you know? And I'll

348
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.260
sit there and I'll go
ahead and start beating yourself

349
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.940
up. It's like, Oh man,
I've had high blood sugar

350
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.260
for four hours. You know,
this is horrible. Now this

351
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.290
thing will actually beep when
it notices the trend that

352
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.110
I'm trending upwards, right. It's
kind of like that early

353
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.900
alert meter. You know, what
is the Staub thing on

354
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.030
the, on the airplane that
says, you know, engine stalling,

355
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.490
you need to handle something
Now, do you think there

356
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.890
will come a day when
these two devices will combine,

357
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.740
Well, the word on the
street, and I know this

358
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.180
from a couple of people
who are working kind of

359
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.660
internally and I'm, I'm seeing
more and more press releases

360
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.850
because these companies put up
these early, The press releases.

361
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.960
But the word is that
Hockey, pucks, hockey puck shaped

362
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.550
device, that is a total
combination. And this hockey puck

363
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.080
gets basically implanted in your
abdomen. So it sits on

364
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.960
your body liver inside your
body. And it would have

365
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.900
like a, a funnel in
it, like a hole that

366
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.840
funneled down like kind of
the way that an anteater's

367
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.840
home looks like. It would
kind of be a concave

368
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.720
funnel. You take a big
fat needle and stick it

369
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.780
through your gut until it
hits that that kind of

370
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.170
funnel. And then the meter
would notice that you've entered

371
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.330
in this, this giant needle
and it would start sucking

372
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.600
insulin. And so you could
actually refill yourself for like

373
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.510
six months worth of insulin.
Basically we draw in this

374
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.490
stuff. So you could basically
fill up at the pump

375
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.930
and then because it's inside
official pancreas kind of. Yeah,

376
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.550
it really is. I mean,
it's the closest, it's like

377
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.070
an artificial heart artificial pancreas.
It's going to be in

378
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.630
there able to deliver insulin
in a much quicker way.

379
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.240
Right now I'm injecting insulin
into my fat. So it

380
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.970
takes an hour to do
anything. This is going to

381
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.250
be right there in the
middle where it's all happening

382
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.370
and it could release it
right to where it's needed

383
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.140
immediately. If they could get
rid of that needle and

384
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.260
replace it with a gas
cap, you know, little screw

385
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.320
off thing, A really awesome
thing on the, on the,

386
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.890
on the TLC. Apparently I
didn't know this, but amputees,

387
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.930
you know, they have the
bone and then it goes

388
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.810
down to a stump and
there's really nothing between the

389
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.850
bone and the stump. It's
just kind of like flesh.

390
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.040
Yeah. And then they have
to put their leg on.

391
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.410
So you've got, you know,
bone from the hip going

392
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.480
down your leg and then
flesh, and then you've got

393
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.320
your, your leg, but you've
got this basically two inches

394
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.230
of flesh. That's really taken
all the brunt. So there's

395
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.690
this guy, I guess he's
in Norway who basically came

396
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.020
up with a, a port
like a standard port that

397
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.540
would actually stick out. It
would basically drills it into

398
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.690
your bone sticks out of
your body. And you can

399
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.050
have like interchangeable feet and
it's an ex it's actually

400
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.690
an extension of your bone.
So then the little stumped

401
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.300
doesn't hurt so much, but
the big deal there was

402
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.750
that the body really doesn't
like stuff sticking out of

403
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.370
it. Right. It doesn't like
to have an entrance links

404
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.610
is a self contained. Yeah.
And interestingly, the same thing

405
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.500
applies with my pump, but
that if I keep it

406
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.640
on for more than three
or four days in, in,

407
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.470
in one hole, basically the
system starts to reject. I

408
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.390
mean, the body's like, I
do not want that here.

409
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.760
I'm going to start covering
it with what are called

410
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.450
microphages and try to expel
it from the system. You

411
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.010
know, you hear about people
who get shot and then

412
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.320
years and years later, the
body finally pops the bullet

413
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.070
out. Yeah. They really, the
body does not want stuff

414
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.580
in it. That is not
as not natural, which actually

415
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.190
brings us to transplants. Everyone
says, well, why can't you

416
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.860
have a transplant? Well, the
theory is that anything that

417
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.070
you transplant into me, I
would end up killing the

418
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.650
same way I killed my
own stuff. Hmm. So then

419
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.730
you would basically have anti-rejection
drugs to keep yourself from

420
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:34.990
doing this. So then you
can base it. You know,

421
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.820
which evil do you want?
Do you want to take

422
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.060
insulin your whole life or
take anti-rejection drugs? So somebody

423
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.700
had the cool idea to
take these cells, these little

424
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.900
eyes, eyes lit cells and
cover them in some kind

425
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.030
of a basically think of
it as a cellular wiffle

426
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.820
ball with a hole, with
holes in it that are

427
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.000
small enough for insulin to
get out of, but not

428
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.370
big enough for antibodies to
get in and beat it

429
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.600
up. Wow. So you'd basically
encompass these things in this,

430
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.280
in this, this mesh sets
that they'd be protected naturally

431
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.490
and physically from your immune
system, that's in Germany. There's

432
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.680
like seven. This, yeah, it's
pretty cool. There's like seven

433
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.530
diabetics in Canada that are
cured and they're eating ice

434
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.040
cream all day long and
Oh, wow. So this is

435
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.200
the thing with diabetes research.
If you follow this, you

436
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.480
know, no matter what it
is, it'll be solved in

437
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.000
10 years. So 10 years
from now, I'm like, Oh

438
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.340
yeah, 10 more years. And
we'll have it handled. So

439
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.410
the attitude of most diabetics,
especially ones that are into

440
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.900
the techie stuff like me
is to stay in as

441
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.810
good a control as possible
for the next 10 years.

442
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.760
Of course, I've been doing
this now for 10 years,

443
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.490
until I can go and
get that, that shot or

444
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.280
that pill or that, that
hockey puck and planted in

445
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.570
me to, to make it
all fixed. Now, what is,

446
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.620
is there any evidence that
if you are a type

447
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.080
one diabetes and you do
have control over your blood

448
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.860
sugar, that you're any more
or less at risk for

449
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.760
other diseases or shorter life
or, or anything like that

450
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.400
then than if you didn't
have it. I mean, can

451
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.880
you live a completely normal
and healthy long life as

452
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.610
a type one diabetic, if
you stay in control of

453
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.020
your pool. So there was
a diabetes control, a thing

454
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.130
called the DCC. I think
it was called basically the

455
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.970
diet diabetes association got together
and said, ask that question.

456
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.970
If you stay in control,
what's the difference. And apparently

457
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.970
if you do stay in
tight control, which takes a

458
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.370
partnership between you and your
spouse and your doctor, I

459
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.320
mean, it's complicated, but if
you can pull it off,

460
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.440
if you can become at
least normal or high normal,

461
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.820
your, your chances of kidney
disease drop your heart disease

462
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.090
drops. I have a diabetic
friend who's been diabetic 50

463
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.550
years, literally 50 years. So
even though most diabetics do

464
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.670
die of diabetes, it is
absolutely feasible. And there are

465
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.790
many, you actually get a
interestingly, Eli Lilly, the, the

466
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:56.090
diabetes, the people who invented
insulin in 1922 will give

467
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.950
you a certificate if you
make it 50 years on

468
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.830
insulin. And there's a bunch
of people who have, have

469
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.380
in fact made that, made
that happen. So yes, you

470
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.670
can survive 40 50 years.
So it's conceivable. And certainly

471
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.230
the technology is gonna get
better. I mean, my buddy

472
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.030
who did it in 50
years for 50 years a

473
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.940
did it by being a
boiling needles on his stove

474
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.520
when we're using them, you
know, wow. When you couldn't

475
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.980
prick your finger and check
your blood sugar, you had

476
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.350
to pee on a stick
and a stick would turn

477
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.060
color, and then you'd hold
the stick up to this.

478
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.740
Yeah, that looks kind of
blue. It looks kind of

479
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.430
purple. I mean, it was
very dark ages. I mean,

480
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.430
here I am, you know,
complaining when my little realtime

481
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.450
chart turns off. I have
no question. If he can

482
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.340
do it like that for
50 years, then I will

483
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.340
be able to pull it
off with it. It's very

484
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.210
cool. Well, I'm sure you're
an inspiration to diabetics everywhere.

485
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.920
You must get up. You
must be in contact with

486
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.560
a lot of diabetic friends.
Well, I, you know, I

487
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:52.690
really like getting email from
diabetic programmers, right? It's like

488
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.040
a little club, you know,
you're, you're a geek, you're

489
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.180
programming.net and you're a diabetic
and we're always conspiring to

490
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.420
write like the next great
diabetes management application is one

491
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.250
of the things that's funny
about diabetics is that we're

492
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.680
all interested in solving this
in Excel. You know, whatever

493
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.900
it is, it's going to
be a chart that can

494
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.900
make it happen. And for
me, yeah, one day It

495
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.130
has got like, you know,
I always had like a

496
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:15.220
web service and an online
site where he's got his

497
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.770
blood sugar automatically uploaded, just
so the world can see

498
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.780
it. And he was using
that as a way to

499
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.640
motivate himself. Like, well, if
the whole world can see

500
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.920
my blood sugar, then I'll
be more likely to be

501
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.190
in You turn that data
into art somehow. Right. When

502
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.510
music To express this data.
And like in this example,

503
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.530
I now get 250 data
points every day from this

504
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.140
new meter when, before I
had 10. Wow. So one

505
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.810
of the interesting things diabetics
do is they do, what's

506
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.920
called a modal day. They
basically take their data from

507
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.220
a single day and they
overlay it with other days.

508
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.190
So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, every
day of the week is

509
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.880
overlaid with seven different lines
on an, on a single

510
00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.340
line chart. So then I
can go and say, wow,

511
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.720
every day at two, my
blood sugar goes up and

512
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.360
say, Oh wow. Or every
night at three, this happens

513
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.330
Data that you couldn't do
before you had this sort

514
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.110
of real time. Yeah. It's
like, it would be very

515
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.420
coarse data, right? I mean,
if my blood sugar was

516
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.380
a hundred at 6:00 AM and
200 at 6:00 PM, I could

517
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.330
draw you a nice straight
line. Cause I have two

518
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.690
points, but with 200 points,
it becomes a subtle curve.

519
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.180
And I can start figuring
out all the different causal

520
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.800
relationships about how particular foods
work for me. How's how,

521
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.590
how, how long it takes
me for insulin to react.

522
00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.960
When, when you get the
insulin package, they tell you

523
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.610
how you know, what the
curve is and how long

524
00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.190
it will take for it
to work. But now I

525
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.560
can actually see that it's
personalized. It's personalized to, right.

526
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.410
My doctor can't tell me
things now. Not how it,

527
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.080
how it ought to work
because now I know actually

528
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.840
how it does work. It's
like getting new contacts. I

529
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.180
mean, my eyes have been
opened. It is truly amazing.

530
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.250
Now it's expensive though. I
ended up having to pay

531
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.480
400 bucks for this part
and another 600 out of

532
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.380
my pocket for, for some
upgrades and stuff. But they're

533
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.410
saying that this is real.
This is so valuable. It's

534
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.540
such good information that once
they get the production up,

535
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.810
they're gonna start pressuring the
insurance companies to get this

536
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.700
out to the regular folks.
And I got to ask

537
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.920
you as a program, are
there any IO points on

538
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.180
this thing that you can
read into a application? This

539
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.260
is the coolest, so I've
just figured this out by

540
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.020
talking to my local rep,
but apparently there's a USB

541
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.070
port suite and I can
download all this data and

542
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.320
there's a website I can
upload it to. But you

543
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.520
know, the first thing I'm
going to do is hack

544
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.810
into this and figure out
how I can get that

545
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.880
data off. So I'll literally
be doing an article on

546
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.200
that. Absolutely. Scott, if you're
listening out there and you

547
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.410
say, you know, this really
sucks, my eyes are opened

548
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.110
and I want to spend
a little bit of money

549
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.590
on diabetes research to, you
know, help, help out, help

550
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.080
Scott stay on the air,
you know, in a roundabout

551
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.730
way. How can, who who's,
who's the best, where's the

552
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.220
best place to spend some
money to depends on what

553
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.070
country you're in. Certainly support
the diabetic organization in the

554
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.370
country that you're in. But
net, you know, last year

555
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.500
from my blog, we raised
about $13,000 for diabetes research

556
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.100
and something like 77 cents on
the dollar goes right back

557
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:19.050
into diabetic research. The rest
goes to overhead and fundraising

558
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.050
in America. Who's the, who's
the, it'd be the ADA.

559
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.190
So diabetes.org. Now next year,
though, I'm looking to rate

560
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.650
I'm, I'm raising my, my
goal here. You know, we

561
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.130
pulled together 13 grand. I'm
looking to do maybe 15

562
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.320
grand next year. Awesome. So
if you really want to

563
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.440
help wait till next dog
next August when the fundraiser

564
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.310
starts and let's see, we
can do some damage. Scott,

565
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.110
this has been a fun
show. I mean, it's a,

566
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.390
you know, it's a serious
topic, but you know, if

567
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.210
you're science minded, like we
are, I'm sure you found

568
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.610
it interesting. And I'm glad
we did it. Well, I

569
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.280
do appreciate you letting me
have the venue because even

570
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.640
though it's not necessarily.net, it
is interesting. And if you're

571
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.650
not interested in diabetes, you
can look at it in

572
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.770
terms of blood pressure or
any of the other, you

573
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.740
know, or asthma or whatever
kind of metric that you

574
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.920
might want to protect ship,
potentially read in and do

575
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.160
analysis on the data does
kind of set you free.

576
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.710
And in this particular instance,
I'm convinced of it and

577
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.750
just make sure if you
ever get any medical equipment

578
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.630
that it comes with a
frigging USB port. All right.

579
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.910
I totally insist on the
USB port for whatever you

580
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.060
want, whatever you get pay
extra for that. Okay. All

581
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.220
right, Scott. Thanks a lot.
And we'll see you next

582
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.750
week on canceling it.
