Scott discusses Microsoft office 2007.
Hi, this is Carl Franklin and

18
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.530
you're listening once again to
Hansel minutes. I'm here with

19
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.220
Scott Hanselman, of course. And
this week we're talking about

20
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.410
office office 12 office 2007,
right? Scott, absolutely everything you

21
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.180
need to know on the
way to work about office

22
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.750
2007. So where do we
start? I mean, this is

23
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.660
such a huge thing. There's
a lot of topics to

24
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.900
cover and some news it
newsworthy issues. Where do you

25
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.150
want to start here? Well,
let's start with the UI.

26
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.920
I posted a thing recently
about the UI that I

27
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.340
called. Everything, you know, is
different. Our office is very

28
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.530
different. It's freakishly different. It's
totally different. It's it's completely

29
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.190
redesigned reinvented. Re-skinned realization the,
the whole tool bar menu

30
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.410
kind of thing that you're
used to the whole right

31
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.100
click on the toolbar is
kind of gone. Yeah, I

32
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.530
would say the, you could
sum it up by saying,

33
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.130
Hey, where did my menus
go? Yeah, everything is different.

34
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.830
There's a new thing that
they're calling the ribbon and

35
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.390
the ribbon is that area
at the top of the

36
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.330
window, that's got everything that
you would need to use

37
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.030
to talk to the machine,
talk to the system. Just

38
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.350
on another note, I sort
of lost the traditional menus

39
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.440
too. They don't have a
ribbon, but you know, they're,

40
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.580
they're clearly Microsoft is, is
got some ideas with accessibility

41
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.090
after 10 years of, of
menus and Toolbars. Everything is

42
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.360
getting shaken up. So Vista
will look different. I seven

43
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.400
to look different and office
will look different. So what

44
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.500
do you make of this?
I think it's, I think

45
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.020
it's a good thing. I
think that I would like

46
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.540
to see even more dramatic
changes myself. I think that

47
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.260
the windowing metaphor is seeing
it's kind of the end

48
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.570
of its days, but there's
just not much more that

49
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.000
one can do other than
point and click at pictures

50
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.850
as humans. We're kind of
limited, I think, but on

51
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.070
the ribbon, the thing about
the ribbon is that you'll

52
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.170
look at it and it's
not quite a menu. It's

53
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.050
not quite a toolbar. It's
really a series of tabs.

54
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.760
It's like a mode list,
tab dialogue, where there are

55
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.340
a series of menus at
the top home insert page

56
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.130
layout, references, review view. These
are all kind of menus,

57
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.600
but when you click on
one of them, they act

58
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.740
more like tabs. Yeah. Bringing
up a very complicated stacked

59
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.370
toolbar. And the thing about
the toolbar is these toolbar

60
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.870
ribbon pieces that come up
are varying sizes. This isn't

61
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.340
just tabbed toolbars. Each of
the buttons on the toolbar

62
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.980
will be sized according to
how often you would need

63
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.040
to use it. So for
example, the paste button on

64
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.040
the home toolbar is very
large. It's a huge 96

65
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.150
by 96, big icon. It's
impossible to miss styles are

66
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.480
much larger. The find button
is huge while things like

67
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.560
strike out and highlighting are
much smaller buttons. So they're

68
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.190
really taking user interface design
and taking user interface metrics,

69
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.100
actually sitting down with regular
people and seeing what they're

70
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.730
looking for and applying it
directly to the UI before

71
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.170
every piece of functionality and
word was appear. Everything, the

72
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.680
bold button and the italics
button were the same here.

73
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.110
They're really applying that knowledge
about how the users were.

74
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.760
Is this knowledge dynamic? Does
it change as the user

75
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.540
uses, say a particular feature?
Does that button get bigger?

76
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.250
So I have not seen
that to be the case.

77
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.690
I do not believe that
to be the case. I

78
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.060
believe that this is, is
not like the time when

79
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.450
they introduced the chevrons, the
little pieces of menus, the

80
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.480
dynamic moving menus. I think
it was decided that folks

81
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.690
didn't like things moving out
from underneath them. The, if

82
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.630
I understand correctly from, from
talking to the office team

83
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.920
and meeting folks on campus,
the thought was that 80

84
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.650
to 90% of the features
that are requested in office

85
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.360
are already there. They just
can't be found. So rather

86
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.820
than adding a whole bunch
of fantastic new features, even

87
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.130
though there's lots of new
features, they've really brought the

88
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.760
ones that were really amazing
and powerful upfront. My mom

89
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.360
is working on her master's
degree and I, I showed

90
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.950
her for the very first
time how to create a

91
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.100
table of contents, taking a,
you know, a 50 page

92
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.180
thesis document and turning into
a, a really indexed dynamic

93
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.690
document with references footnotes and
a table of contents. She'd

94
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.680
been maintaining the table of
contents manually. This is a

95
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.870
feature that's been around since
office 95, but it's just,

96
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.340
it's buried. It's hard to
find in the new office.

97
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.430
It's not, I would say
there's been a lot of

98
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.270
buried features in office. Don't
you think? Absolutely. Absolutely. Doing,

99
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.990
reviewing, like adding comments and
doing track changes has always

100
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.990
been kind of buried a
little tiny track changes button.

101
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.050
Another example would be the
tiny, tiny, tiny, and most

102
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.630
clicked on button in PowerPoint,
which is the little tiny

103
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.420
start slideshow button right down
on the very lower left

104
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.310
corner. You watch people try
to struggle to hit that

105
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.730
tiny eight by eight button.
That's a big giant thing

106
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.680
on the slide bar, a
ribbon tab. Now there's also

107
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.810
an interesting new thing. And
this is actually of all

108
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.840
the changes. I think this
is the least righteous change.

109
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.780
The, the ribbon bar is
weird, but once you get

110
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.090
it, you'll get it and
you'll go, Whoa. Wow, that

111
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.520
thing I wanted it's right
there. It's almost like it's,

112
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.100
it's thoughtful. It's they've actually
put thought into it. But

113
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.230
the thing that is not
very cool is a new

114
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.920
thing called the Microsoft office
button, which is a big

115
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.330
fat kind of logo of
the Microsoft office system. Big

116
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.120
32 by 32 icon in
the upper left corner. And

117
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.790
you click on it and
that has got, that's your

118
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.510
file menu. That's your open
start, publish print. That's your

119
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.540
button that you click if
you want to do something

120
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.730
right. So you're going to
do something with your document.

121
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.060
You click the office button
problem is I keep double

122
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.700
clicking on this button trying
to close the application that

123
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.380
I'm currently on. And all
it does is show the

124
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.980
menu and make it go
away. So it's the whole

125
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.860
double click in the upper
left corner is gone and

126
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.810
you've got at least in
beta two and you had

127
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.780
this strange office button of,
it's almost like a start

128
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.340
button for office, but everything
is so intuitive and makes

129
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.970
so much sense in the
ribbon bar really feels right.

130
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.460
And then there's this weird
logo in the upper corner

131
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.350
that you have to click
on to do something as

132
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.520
simple as filing file open.
But next to that is

133
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.620
a new thing called the
QA T or the quick

134
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.410
access toolbar. And this is
the, the quick launch, you

135
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.750
know, using Explorer terms. This
is the quick launch bar

136
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.390
for office, which I think
is a little odd if

137
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.490
you think about it, because
we just made that analogy

138
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.610
between that parallel, rather between
the office button and the

139
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.580
start menu right now, we've
got the quick access toolbar

140
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.680
and the quick launch. So
basically in your lower left

141
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.380
hand corner and in windows,
you've got your start button

142
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.930
and your quick launch and
the upper left hand corner,

143
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.380
you've got your office button
and your quick access toolbar.

144
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.840
They're just going to mirror
images of each other. This

145
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.910
is where you put your
save button or any button

146
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.190
you use all the time.
This are where you'd put

147
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.260
buttons that you want to
push. No matter what the

148
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.200
context is of the document
that you're working on. Ironic

149
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.050
to me is that all
these software packages that have

150
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.890
quick launch buttons that go
in the system tray, you

151
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.650
know, to make it easier
to inf you know, faster,

152
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.340
to get the application up
and running well, everybody has

153
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.160
these now and they clog
your system so much with

154
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.900
CPU usage and memory and
all that stuff. That there's

155
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.300
nothing quick about it. I
mean, you've got 10 of

156
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.130
these things loaded up, you
know what I mean? The

157
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.930
whole system slows down. I
am referring not to the

158
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.960
tray in the lower right
hand corner. You mentioned quick

159
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.210
launch button. And I was
responding to that. Okay. The,

160
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.550
this is the kind of
the place that you put

161
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.370
a bunch of stuff. This
is the cut, the most

162
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.640
customizable place in the, in
the system right now, the

163
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.700
things you'll find up there
are undo, redo, print, and

164
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.410
save, but you can right.
Click on any feature on

165
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.600
any feature anywhere in office
and say, Ooh, I like

166
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.130
that. I want to bring
that up to the top

167
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.380
now. That's cool. Yeah, that
is kind of cool. And

168
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.650
interestingly, that actually is not
a toolbar. It lives in

169
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.620
the title bar. So they're
making a lot better use

170
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.290
of their vertical space and
your title bar says the

171
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.110
document name, and the fact
you're running Microsoft word, they'll

172
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.680
put information in that title
bar. So the ribbon actually

173
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.010
takes up a little bit
less space than that in

174
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.960
previous versions of office, which
gives you more room for

175
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.540
your documents, which is pretty
cool. Cool. Now there's a

176
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.500
really interesting document that you
can download that explains this

177
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.220
new UI it's called welcome
to the new ui@strengthstir.com slash

178
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.930
F O L. And this
was on a blog by

179
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.110
a person named Jensen Harris.
And this is a user

180
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.350
interface blog specifically for office.
So this is a, a

181
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.850
user interface designers who worked
on the office team is

182
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.670
working on the office team
and all things, office, user

183
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.520
interface related why we did
this, what we were thinking,

184
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.360
what kind of user interface
analysis and usability analysis we

185
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.970
did cool and Jensen Harris.
His blog is his shrink

186
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.180
stir slash Fon. And I
really tend to tell you

187
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.810
that there's a lot more
openness this time around with

188
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.560
the blogging. Everybody who's involved
in an office product has

189
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.400
got a blog. Developers are
up there, PMs. There's an

190
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.360
access blog at shrink stir
slash FLQ. There's an Excel

191
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.130
specific blog at slash F
O R all of these

192
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.880
things just add up to
better feedback loop, because I

193
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.980
know when they designed office
2003, I didn't go through

194
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.290
any usability testing. Right. Did
you, did you, I didn't

195
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.620
go anywhere and get filmed
since they can't fly me

196
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.290
up to ask me about
where I want a button.

197
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.810
I can sure. Talk to
them on their blog and

198
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.330
they really do answer, which
is pretty cool. Yeah, that

199
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.550
is cool. Yeah. We had
talked before about, we'd had

200
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.010
a back and forth with
the, the outlook team and

201
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.010
the RSS where the fact
that they're putting RSS directly

202
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.810
into outlook and some of
the issues I had with

203
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.350
that blogging totally made that,
made that possible. I was

204
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.310
definitely feeling that, Hey, Scott,
does office look any different

205
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.910
with the arrow interface of
a Vista? And I guess

206
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.430
we're at beta two now
of windows Vista, then on

207
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.580
say windows XP. So I
put windows Vista on my

208
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.390
tablet, PC my tooth, my
Toshiba <inaudible> and it comes

209
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.990
out and kind of a
slate gray with a, with

210
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.200
the upper part of the
toolbar being transparent. And then

211
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.980
it's bright blue on my
windows XP machine with no

212
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.020
transparency. It doesn't look dramatically
different. I mean, I think

213
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.840
that, I think that arrow
in glass is, is shiny

214
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:04.770
and wonderful, but, you know,
so yeah, not really That

215
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.140
thrilled about it. There aren't
any other features in the

216
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.850
Vista implementation. They definitely have.
They have feature feature parody

217
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.100
in that, in that respect.
That's cool. And I had

218
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.310
to hack my tablet PC
to get a glass. Anyway,

219
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.460
apparently you need more than
64 megs of video Ram.

220
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.680
Now you need 128 megs
of video Ram in order

221
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.480
to get class. So there's
going to be a haves

222
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.390
and the have nots and
the <inaudible> while it was

223
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.720
touted as Longhorn ready when
I bought it, apparently not

224
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.570
so much. So I'm a
little bummed about that. And

225
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.360
there's a lot of great
links about Vista and office

226
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.980
at shrinks.com/f O M by
Michael Swanson. Who's collected a bunch

227
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.080
of those links and done,
done my job for me,

228
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.960
which is pretty cool. Great.
Now, have you written any

229
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.870
office extensibility stuff? Have you
written even macros and stuff?

230
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.690
Yeah, I've written macros, but
that's about it. Yeah, The

231
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.910
extent of it. So the
new UI is, is as

232
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.610
extensible, if not more so
as the old one, particularly

233
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.160
the ribbon extensibility allows you
to create all sorts of

234
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.270
new gadgets and things. Unfortunately,
we're still, we can still

235
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.340
do it in VBA. You
can, you can write things

236
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.760
using the Microsoft visual studio
for office pieces, but a

237
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.920
VBA is still the way
to do things. And there's

238
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.850
a really neat article on
ribbon extensibility. It's shrink storage

239
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.080
slash <inaudible>, and there's a
whole new concept of trust.

240
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.290
They're really paranoid about security.
So rather than just loading

241
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.870
up a document and saying,
Hey, it's got macros that

242
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.090
cool with you and, you
know, hitting a button, right?

243
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.820
There's a notion of trusted
locations, which I think is

244
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.450
pretty cool. You actually list
in the interface, a list

245
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.850
of folders that you believe
are trusted, like could be

246
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.300
a network folder or a
folder on your desktop called

247
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.300
trusted, or maybe your, my
documents folder. And if you

248
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.300
trust those places, then you
could download it, download something

249
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.190
from the internet and it
wouldn't be trusted, but if

250
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.280
you copied it directly into
your trusted folder or your,

251
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.340
my documents folder, then it
would be trusted and you

252
00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.140
don't have to worry about
all that macro nonsense. It's

253
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.960
a real nice trade off
between usability and security. Do

254
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.570
you see any security holes
in that? I mean, what

255
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.140
about a script that copies
to that folder and executes?

256
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.510
It was kind of scripts
have to be allowed those.

257
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.480
So, yeah, it's totally possible
that someone could potentially find

258
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.240
a trusted folder and copy
themselves there, but you'd have

259
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.240
to have okayed the copy.
So as with all things,

260
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.850
at some point you have
to say, yeah, I think

261
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.740
this is cool. So there's
always a way they could

262
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.950
fool you into, into pushing
a button like that. But

263
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.270
I don't think that someone
would want to trust their

264
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:29.400
temporary internet files. Yeah. Okay.
Good point. Sure. Now there's

265
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.220
a lot of training going
to be available in 2007

266
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.770
because I tell ya if
you're taking a 2003 class,

267
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.950
now, everything you know is
wrong, right. But up at

268
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.750
shrinks.com/f O U there's some
really nice beta videos explaining

269
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.240
how they're going to do
the training. And I think,

270
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.310
I, I think I talked
about this. I can't remember

271
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.930
who was I talking to
you on the last show,

272
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.640
but it was really neat.
I tried do an existing

273
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.130
shortcut key. You know, you
go like all T for

274
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.640
tools over options. So I
just did it kind of

275
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.760
unconsciously. I just want LTO.
And as I did that,

276
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.190
what's called a super tip,
not a tool tip, but

277
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.710
a super tip. These are
really giant tool tips with

278
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.130
like paragraphs of information. Wow.
Pop popped up and said,

279
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.650
office 2003 compatibility mode, please
continue your office 2003 hot

280
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.280
key. So even though the
menus are gone, it understands

281
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.860
that all T used to
bring up the tools, man,

282
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.750
You know, I'm really glad
they did this because my

283
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.780
concern, when I first heard
about the ribbon was, you

284
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.990
know, all the moms and
dads out there who have

285
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.640
their keystrokes memorized and, and
you know, what's going to

286
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.430
happen to that. And it
was unclear at that time.

287
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.280
So I'm glad they did.
And, and interestingly, they've taken

288
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.550
that to the next level
with another, another thing they

289
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.120
have, if you just push
Ault, like for example, I

290
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.520
had pushed the Microsoft office
button and I got the

291
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.760
big file menu thing, and
I just bumped the alt

292
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.240
button. And interestingly, they put
a little tiny picture of

293
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.660
a keyboard key, a little
key on top of each

294
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.680
of the different visual elements
with like an F over

295
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.830
file and over open S
versa. So just by tapping

296
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.570
it, it'll actually cover the
screen in little tiny keyboard

297
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.030
keys telling you, Oh, you
could push this if you

298
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.400
wanted it. So not only
does it support your old

299
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.940
keystrokes, but it actually promotes
the use of new keystroke

300
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.310
usage, which is something that's
really difficult. A lot of

301
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.920
people waste a lot of
time putting miles on their

302
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.980
mouse when they really could
be speeding that up with

303
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.660
a, with a hot key.
That might be a really

304
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:36.010
good use of opacity of,
you know, somewhat transparent. I

305
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.380
wonder if there's somewhat transparent
Invista, have you seen that?

306
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.710
So speaking of, of really
good uses of transparency, if,

307
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.980
if you select a chunk
of text, a paragraph or

308
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.850
a couple of words, a
little tiny, transparent toolbar will

309
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.300
pop up kind of fade
in from nowhere and just

310
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.620
appear. And it appears right
where your cursor is. Cause

311
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.670
you don't have, you don't,
you don't want to have

312
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.730
this select text scroll up
and not scroll up. Rather,

313
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.010
you don't want to have
this select text, go to

314
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.160
the toolbar, come back. You
actually want context sensitive, right.

315
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.340
But instead of, instead of
selecting and right clicking, it's

316
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.040
fair to assume that if
someone has just selected text,

317
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.460
they probably want to do
something with it. Why not

318
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.640
give them a tiny, transparent
toolbar with the most commonly

319
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.460
used things, fonts, font size,
a talents, and things like

320
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.630
that. Again, with, with hotkeys,
for all promoting things like

321
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.120
control being in control. I
wow. That's so from a

322
00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.470
usability standpoint, word and Excel,
particularly stand out with just

323
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:37.060
some really amazing leaps and
in, in usability. Sweet. That

324
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.540
sounds great. Now all the,
all the, the Microsoft is

325
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.890
great offices. Awesome. Kind of
Microsoft apologists stuff aside. I

326
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.850
have had some hellish install
experience With the beta software.

327
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.540
Oh my God. I'm going
to have to ghost my

328
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.700
mocks at work back to
a known state because office,

329
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.550
I mean, outlook rather on
my outlook, 12 or outlook,

330
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.550
2007 on my machine at
work is just, it's a

331
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.870
it's carnage. It's absolute carnage.
First, I got into a

332
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.390
situation where every time I
opened outlook, I got the

333
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.730
little MSI thing popping up,
telling me I needed to

334
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.810
install visual studio, 2005 disc.
And then I got into

335
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.300
a thing where every add
in was crashing. So it

336
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.090
would be launch outlook, this
add in crashed shutdown, launch

337
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.340
outlook, this ad in crashed,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

338
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.410
So all of my admins.
So then I went into

339
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.990
the registry and just deleted
all my admins. So outlook

340
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.850
will run for 15 minutes
and then I'll just sit

341
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.150
there and it'll just crash.
Poof. That's what you get

342
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.120
for running beta software, man.
This is why I ghosted

343
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.460
my machine ahead of time.
So I would encourage people

344
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.350
to try this. I mean,
don't wait, this is awesome

345
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.740
stuff from a usability standpoint,
but yeah, it's beta. It's

346
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.180
not our <inaudible> it's beta,
right? It will probably just

347
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.910
rip the guts out of,
of your system. And if

348
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.220
you're working on your degree
or you have an assignment

349
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.880
due tomorrow, tonight would not
be the time to install

350
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.640
a copy of the office.
But yeah, I'm in a

351
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.980
hellish hellish place right now.
So I'm just going to

352
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.770
bring that back now, on
the other hand at home,

353
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.470
on my home machine, it's
cool in the gang. It's

354
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.280
happy. It's loving, it's wonderful
outlook. As another thing, words

355
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.190
wants one thing, but outlook
man, the new stuff and

356
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.450
outlook, you're going to love
it or you're going to

357
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.850
hate it. I love it.
Yeah. I love it. Category.

358
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.810
Yeah. Flags search folders are
more obvious in the new

359
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.270
TuDu bar on the right
hand side, they're showing you

360
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.550
kind of like your life
at a glance. It's almost

361
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.040
like a mini dashboard Outlook
is the center of my

362
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.640
universe. Really? Yeah, it really
is. And, and, you know,

363
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.150
for all of the, all
of the issues, you know,

364
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.080
little, little annoyances that I
have, even with the older

365
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.590
versions of outlook, it's still,
you know, the inbox is

366
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.980
the sort of the center
of my universe. Yeah. The,

367
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.390
the, the admin thing is
the only thing that's really

368
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.790
frustrating me, but I actually
got an email from the

369
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.920
PM on the admin team
and they're doing their best

370
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.010
to work on compatibility. But,
you know, it's funny. I

371
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.510
kind of feel like a
bit of a schmuck when

372
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.600
I have things like 15
addins running and Explorer or

373
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.630
five, six admins running and
outlook. And I, and I

374
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.670
complain, you know, gosh, why
does not look run with

375
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.010
all this third party code
running in process? You know?

376
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.900
Yeah. I feel a little
bit like a schmuck, cause

377
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.140
I'm saying, Hey, this should
work. But you know, I

378
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.170
understand the problems writing a
really robust add in model,

379
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.410
especially when the add ins
are written in a couple

380
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:21.890
different versions of.net plus comm
plus plus script. It's pretty,

381
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.310
it's pretty hardcore stuff, but
I'm having no problem at

382
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.310
all at, with my outlook
at home, I'm running Plaxo

383
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.350
and three or four ad
ends and everything is working.

384
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:34.070
Great. Cool. Now one note
and outlook have got some

385
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.700
pretty neat integration points and
you can read about that

386
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.660
at a shrinker.com/foo foo. We
finally got to the food

387
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.290
shrink stir. I noticed that.
Yeah. Very cool. Yeah. This

388
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.220
is Chris Pratley's blog. This
is a really cool guy.

389
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.960
I actually was able to
sit on a plane with

390
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.420
this guy a couple of
years back. This is the

391
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.460
guy who actually kind of
came up with the idea

392
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.680
of one note we need
to, we need a note

393
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.380
taking application and word's not
it because you know, the

394
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.110
end of to do dot
text. And this is also

395
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.480
interestingly, a guy who's very
interested in language. And he

396
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.780
was one of the fellows
who tried to get Ethiopian

397
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.140
support into word, the next
version of word and Vista,

398
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.360
along with a couple other
people like Michael Kaplan at

399
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.540
Microsoft. So meeting this guy
was amazing. I was just

400
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.560
sitting on the, he actually
lived in Japan and I

401
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.150
was anyway, I was sitting
on the plane with him

402
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.280
and I started talking about
Microsoft. You were from Microsoft.

403
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.750
Well, what do you do?
I'm on the word team

404
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.280
and I'm work on office.
Oh really? Why don't you

405
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.360
do now? I work on
it. It's just one of

406
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.770
these kinds of things like,
and I'm sitting next to

407
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.620
you. This is the guy
who can get Ethiopian support

408
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.740
into word. I was just
totally stoked. He's got a

409
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.980
great blog. It's primarily a
OneNote blog. Now he has

410
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.710
an interesting post on one
note and outlook being best

411
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.770
buddies. Cool. So that's pretty
cool, which is more than

412
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.560
I can say for Adobe
and Microsoft who are not

413
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.400
best buddies right now. Can
you believe this nonsense? What

414
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.340
is up with that? We
talked about this on dotnet

415
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.720
Iraq's yesterday and apparently Adobe
has told Microsoft that they

416
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.240
can't include the free and
available save as PDF API

417
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.290
implementation in, in word. For
some reason they want Microsoft

418
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.900
to either charge for it.
Which to me doesn't make

419
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.230
sense because it costs people
money, right? And, but OB

420
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.320
doesn't get the money or
they want to make it

421
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.800
available as a separate download
if it's free. So apparently

422
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.590
the result is that it's
going to be available. It's

423
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.020
just going to be a
second download. So you'll everyone

424
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.120
in the world will get,
get office. And then they'll

425
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.120
download this little thing, which
doesn't make much sense because

426
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.800
I can make PDFs now
using PDF creator for free

427
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.370
PDF creators available on SourceForge
you install it. It makes

428
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.250
a printer and everyone can
make PDF. The difference is,

429
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.590
and Adobe's beef is that,
you know, all those other

430
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.980
little applications are one thing.
But if it's in the

431
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.280
most popular word processor in
the world, why would anybody

432
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.760
need to buy Adobe? Well,
and it begs the larger

433
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.540
question. What's Adobe fork again,
right? Why, what is the

434
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.300
point of Adobe? Like the
company To make money off

435
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.320
of Acrobat? Yeah. I don't
know. Acrobats still like 500

436
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.110
bucks or something like that,
but I don't understand who

437
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.120
cares if Microsoft does it,
you can go into open

438
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.990
office@openoffice.org and they have save
as PDF and no one's

439
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.570
complained at them. And not
only is the PDF support

440
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:20.610
free the whole suite. Well,
the save as PDF API

441
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:26.100
is under Adobe's licensing free
for anybody to implement. Yeah.

442
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.710
They've opened the whole format,
right? The whole PDF formats

443
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.240
open. So I don't know
what the price is. You

444
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.450
can see their paranoia because
whether they're justified or not,

445
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.920
they think that having that
feature in word is enough

446
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.530
because there's millions and millions
of word users all over

447
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.670
the world to, to persuade
people, not to buy Adobe

448
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.570
Acrobat. But your point is,
is good. You know, maybe

449
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.700
it's time for Acrobat the
product to, you know, for

450
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.710
them to find other ways
to make money off of

451
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.720
their publishing PDF stuff. Yeah.
Or just, you know, I

452
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.420
mean, give up, they've opened,
they've opened up the, this

453
00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.660
is the thing word has
a new XML format. Right,

454
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.000
right. And you know, you
save your files in the

455
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.430
new version of word and
you'll get a dot doc

456
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.700
X extension. That's the new
format. And by the, you

457
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.920
know, by default, if you
don't have compatibility mode, turn

458
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.890
on, that's what you'll get.
And of course you can

459
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.500
always download add on. So
if you are a 2003

460
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.950
user, you can go now
and get the open tools.

461
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.080
So these are file conversion
tools that would allow you

462
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.130
as a 2003 or previous
user to open up word

463
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.000
2007 XML file format. So
that's real nice for compatibility

464
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.880
purposes, but this is an
open format. Now it's a

465
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.720
crazy, funky XML thing that
is difficult to create. But

466
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.290
if open office wants to
support that, then I'm sure

467
00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.970
that they will, right. They
may already, I don't know.

468
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:50.260
Microsoft has to say, well,
we make better word documents.

469
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.080
It's an open format, but
our editor rocks. Right. And

470
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.530
what I'm hearing is that
Adobe's Acrobat maker Doesn't rock.

471
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.410
No, it sucks actually. And,
and so does their reader,

472
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.200
quite frankly. And that's why
Fox reader is the bomb.

473
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.240
Yeah. Ever since you turned
me on to Fox, it

474
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.680
I've removed Adobe Acrobat from
all of my machines, the

475
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.990
reader. Do you have no
Adobe product anywhere on your

476
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.260
system for making or reading
again? What is it? Oh,

477
00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.950
before right. Very uncomfortable. There's
an interesting blog post about

478
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:22.840
it by Brian Jones of microsoft@shrinker.com
slash F O S I

479
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.370
think that, you know, I
gotta say, I think the

480
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.340
Microsoft guys, or at least
the, the personal people, the

481
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.530
actual people that we talk
to, the bloggers, the ones

482
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.290
with personalities and faces and
names are handling it well,

483
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.470
because they really genuinely seem
to want to provide value.

484
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.040
Right? I mean, I don't
think that Joe program manager

485
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.990
on the word team is
out to stick it to

486
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.930
anybody. He just wants to
make it awesome for, for

487
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.990
his users, users want file
save as PDF. That's you

488
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.610
know how often you want
to do that a couple

489
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.080
of times a week, you
want to make a PDF

490
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.290
and all Adobe is doing
is complaining and making it

491
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.910
so well, I have to
go and download it and

492
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.120
run Acrobat really is, is
an add on to word

493
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.430
to allow you to save
as PDF. That's what Acrobat

494
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.700
is. If you think about
it, right? Yeah, Yeah, absolutely.

495
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.380
But now Mike, Betsy, with
thing I don't understand is

496
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.370
Adobe just agreed to an,
a settlement, which is Microsoft

497
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.940
we'll we'll pull the feature,
but make it available via

498
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.730
a free download. Well, that
means that they have to

499
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.100
go to the Adobe website
and blah, blah, blah. Yeah.

500
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.460
They they're going to put
it on microsoft.com. Really? Yeah.

501
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.700
That's what is making any
sense? So according to this

502
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.970
website here at Brian Brian Jones website,
who's one of the PMs

503
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.750
you'll go to microsoft.com, Microsoft
update or whatever, you'll download

504
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.940
it separately. They just don't
want to integrate it. It

505
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.280
makes sense to me. And
the reason it makes sense

506
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.520
is that I'm coming from
I'm coming from the perception

507
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.490
of Adobe being paranoid, that
just having it there, available

508
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:50.310
brainless as a standard feature
is going to put Acrobat

509
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.310
out of business. I see
what you're saying. If it's

510
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.100
already there, why even bother
now these by separating it

511
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.260
there's a choice. So now
they have a choice that

512
00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.950
they can buy Acrobat or
they can download this feature,

513
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.100
which doesn't, you know, doesn't
have the features of Acrobat.

514
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.590
That's a very good point.
Then they'll say, don't use

515
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.900
this, use our better one.
Exactly. Pay a little bit

516
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.880
of money, yada, yada, yada.
You know, and, and the

517
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.380
thing that's funny is that
all of it might mean

518
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.840
nothing. When you have new
things, like the, the idea

519
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.880
about a web office coming
out, have you seen this?

520
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:21.830
Yeah. tincture.com/fov. You've got these
folks like Ajax, right? An

521
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.320
Ajax sheet and these different
sites that are saying, well,

522
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.700
you don't really need office.
All you want to do

523
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.810
is fire up a, an
Ajax Cepheid word and do

524
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.080
everything in the browser. Yeah.
It may happen office live.

525
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.510
Right. I don't know. I've
never been a fan of

526
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.780
this just because there's so
much stuff that you can

527
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.210
put on the client that
doesn't make sense on the

528
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.930
web, you know, a spellcheck
dictionary, for example. I mean,

529
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.910
you could do that as
a web server, I suppose.

530
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.910
Well, there's lots of Ajax
defied. Spellcheckers that just go

531
00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.730
back and forth to a
server side dictionary. It's possible.

532
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.890
You should take a look
at Ajax, right? Dot com.

533
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.500
Bring it up in Firefox.
You get a full version

534
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.360
of om office, 2005 in
a browser. Wow. Now it

535
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.880
needs to be connected, but
it's, it's a real thing.

536
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.010
I mean, believe me, take
a look at Ajax, right?

537
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.410
Dot com. It'll blow your
mind in Firefox. Only works

538
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.750
in Firefox though. And it's
really not Ajax it's with

539
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.670
the called Zul XUL, which
is a Firefox specific, it's

540
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.670
basically Firefox click once. But
this is that guy who

541
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:23.000
runs a, what form of
the formerly Lindos Lynn Spire,

542
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.180
Michael Robertson. All right, right. He's
the kind of the rich

543
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.810
madman behind all of that.
And he's off paying Ajax

544
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:33.680
developers to create applications, to,
to show Google up and

545
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.560
to show, you know, Microsoft.
But, you know, even if

546
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.930
you don't believe that Michael Robertson
is a, his nuts are

547
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.390
not Google, one day will
come out with, you know,

548
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.790
they, they just bought rightly
which isn't, it was an

549
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.970
online word. They may just
come out with something star

550
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.150
office over the web. You
never know. Yeah. There's also

551
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.810
the privacy issue that a,
you know, whatever you're typing

552
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.950
is going back and forth
across the web could be

553
00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.580
the potential is there. And
maybe you don't, you know,

554
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.440
maybe you want the privacy
of being on your own

555
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.750
machine, You know? And I
agree that that may be

556
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.300
enough for you and I
to be concerned about, but

557
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.130
I don't think my son
is going to care in

558
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.310
10 years when there's some
entirely connected thing. He won't

559
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.170
be thinking about things like
that. Because by then we'll

560
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.870
have info card, we'll all
have our own personal certificates

561
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.690
implanted behind our ears. And
we'll sit down in the

562
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.970
RFID, we'll talk to the
PC and then it'll all

563
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.530
just be thought from there.
So Scott, let me end

564
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.080
this week show with a
story. That's kind of funny.

565
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.200
I've talked about my mom
on dotnet rocks a few

566
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.430
times. She's sort of a,
she's addicted to the internet,

567
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.880
but she's complete neophyte when
it comes to learning anything,

568
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.190
windows, you know, she, I
could look right at her

569
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.600
and I've done this. I
look right at her and

570
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:52.510
I said, mom, do you
have a DVD drive? And

571
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.840
she'll look at me and
say, I, I don't know

572
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.440
what you mean. What do
you mean by that? You

573
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.140
know, do you have a
DVD drive? That thing that

574
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.330
we press the button and
the tray comes out. I

575
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.030
have to say that. And
then you put the things

576
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.930
in there. Yeah. So anyway,
so my mother calls me

577
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.590
up the other day and
I'm, it's like 45 minutes

578
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:16.420
before I have to go
to a function. I have

579
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.470
to be somewhere. And she
calls me up complaining about

580
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.250
my brother who went up
to her house to fix

581
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.780
her computer or something. And
she's saying, Oh, I told

582
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.720
him not to empty the
recycle bin. And he did

583
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.230
it anyway. He's so disrespectful.
I gave him a what?

584
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.620
And I said, well, mom,
you're, you're supposed to empty

585
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.890
the recycle bin from diamond
time. I told him not

586
00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.940
to cause I had stuff
in. Yeah. Well, what do

587
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.740
you mean? Well, I find
out that she's recording off

588
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.200
the radio. She records off
the radio into a cool

589
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:55.800
edit or something. And she
had a program coming up.

590
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.080
She needed to record in
her hard disk was full.

591
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.540
So she didn't know what
to do. So my brother

592
00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.210
goes up. First thing he
sees is all this stuff

593
00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.700
in the recycle bin. What
does he do? Gets rid

594
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.670
of it. And she says,
no, don't get rid of

595
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.310
that recycled. Don't empty the
Harrison. Then he goes, well,

596
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.830
mom, this is, this is
how you get your space

597
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.340
back. Watch shwoop there it
goes. And then she threw

598
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.450
a fit. So what happens
was she was moving stuff

599
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.940
in the recycle bin, thinking
it was going to give

600
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.930
her more space on her
desk. So I had to

601
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.670
explain that to her. And
then, you know, of course

602
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.890
my brother's an engineer. And
the last thing he's thinking

603
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.840
of is that she's actually
doing that. Right. So I,

604
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.710
I told her I had
to go somewhere, but I'd

605
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.050
buy a hard drive and
bring it over in the

606
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.930
morning. So I did, I
went to staples and I

607
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.000
got a 300 gig Mac
store, hard drive off the

608
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.060
shelf. And the next morning
I go over there and

609
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.920
I pull it out and
I'm looking at it and

610
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.770
it looks kind of funny.
And, and I can't really

611
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.710
figure out, what's funny about
it. The label on the

612
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:58.800
top is a little fuzzy.
And then I noticed that

613
00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.520
there's some Stickum on a
couple of the sides, you

614
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.560
know, like as if a
label had been there and

615
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.620
then been pulled off and
I noticed lots of fingerprints.

616
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.190
And then I see some
wear on the, on the,

617
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:17.040
on the cable connectors and
a little dust. And I

618
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.830
noticed that there's no jumper
shunt, you know, for the

619
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.580
master slave stuff. So I'm
thinking, this is, this is

620
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.270
used and it was in
the box. So I plug

621
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:30.060
it in, pull it up.
It's a 20 gig drive.

622
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.550
I think I was buying
a 300 gig drive. It's

623
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.490
a use 20 gig drive.
It happens all the time.

624
00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:36.960
You heard about you even
heard about this. I haven't

625
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.710
heard about this. So people,
people buy the key drives.

626
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.080
This is what I'm assuming
is that somebody bought the

627
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.400
drive, swapped, theirs said brought
it back, said it doesn't

628
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.680
work. You know, they slapped
a label over the old

629
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.070
label. Sure enough. Yeah. I
appealed it back in the

630
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:55.130
original label for this drive
was underneath. Yep. There's actually

631
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.190
some controversy about this. It's
not clear whether this is,

632
00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.250
I mean, it's probably happening
locally, but there's some talk

633
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.500
that it may also have
happened at the factory. Yeah.

634
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.900
I mean that, that would
be more sinister. Oh yeah.

635
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.420
But at any point in
the chain, right. Somebody looks

636
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.830
at it and says, Oh,
that's a fine looking drive.

637
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:10.910
I want to get, I
want to get me some

638
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.220
of that. Right. And I'll
just swap it with this

639
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.230
old one. And you know
that when all you gotta

640
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.420
do is go to best
buy or, or one of

641
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.490
these little places when they're
just a little too busy,

642
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.740
it's a little too busy
to pay attention. Right. It's

643
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.900
very sad. All they gotta
do is open it up,

644
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.120
look and say, yep, that's
the 300 gig drive. All

645
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.570
right. You know what was
on the drive? No, you

646
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.280
know, there was nothing on
the drive. And the first

647
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.350
thing I did was I,
I looked at it with

648
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:35.720
like an undelete program to
see if it found any

649
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.140
files and it didn't. And
if I have time, I'm

650
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.400
gonna look at it with
something like I'm on track.

651
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.130
Yeah. Spin, right. Something like
that. Yeah. Something like that.

652
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.270
So recovery software, you might
find a couple copies of

653
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.520
like, you know, staggered versions
of dos for, well, I'm,

654
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.980
hopefully what I'm going to
find is some personal information

655
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.360
about the guy. And then
I can bring that back

656
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.480
to staples and say, look
at your records and see,

657
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.540
you know, that you, that
you sold a 300 gig

658
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.880
drive to this guy. And
I bet you'll find it

659
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.340
in his computer. That's evil.
That's what I want to

660
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.260
do, but I'll let you
know how it turns out

661
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.680
next week. Alright. In the
meantime, I have a good

662
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.370
week and we'll talk to
you next week on canceling.
