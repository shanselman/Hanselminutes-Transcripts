That's bitly.com/data dog shirt. All

12
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.900
right, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is Hansel minutes. And

13
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.660
today I'm chatting with Matt
Westcott. How are you, sir?

14
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
All right, thanks. Absolutely. So
you're a web developer in

15
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.980
your regular life, but you
have a secret superpower that

16
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.730
I think is quite amazing.
You write for the ZX

17
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.140
spectrum. This is a 36
year old computer. Yeah, that's

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.120
right. Yeah. That's to come
that's a bit, it's an

19
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.490
obsession. Yeah. Is it just
that computer you're obsessed with,

20
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.320
or are you also obsessed
with BBC micros and commerce?

21
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.290
60 fours and amp? Strads,
that's kind of a passing

22
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.610
interest in the whole range
of them, but the spectrum

23
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.800
was my first love and
that said I would spin

24
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.070
my yet. My name one
retro computing. Well, it's a

25
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.650
quite a big one. So
you need a focus that

26
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.220
describe this for people who,
who are listening, who maybe

27
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.530
haven't seen one before. It
is, it is visually an

28
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.060
unusual looking machine. Yeah, so,
so well it was made

29
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.920
by a Sinclair UK based
company and think that, well,

30
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.600
Sinclair was all always about
cost cutting and making things

31
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.990
sort of miniaturized. And they
set out to create a

32
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.450
computer that was kind of,
I think it's much cheaper

33
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.820
than anything else that was
on the market at the

34
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.510
time. So this was a
micro computer, kind of the

35
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.600
whole, the whole unit was
the keyboard and the, the

36
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.160
computer itself for a single
unit. And it's kind of,

37
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.740
I guess, about the size
of a dinner plate, the

38
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.610
original one, and rather than
having us proper, proper of

39
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.540
hard key keyboards, it was
all this kind of a

40
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.990
rubber mats, I guess, kind
of light, maybe our old

41
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.120
pocket calculators. So it's a,
it's this very compact design.

42
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.920
So this sun shiny black
thing, and then it would

43
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.360
plug into your television sets.
And this was a really

44
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.080
popular bit of kit for,
especially in the UK. It

45
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.420
is definitely a machine that
I think we, we could

46
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.760
look at and dismiss, you
know, you might see it

47
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.230
at a thrift shop and
you say, Oh, this is

48
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.430
just a fancy calculator, but
it was extremely popular and

49
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.100
was, and went along for,
for many years. It wasn't

50
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.700
even discontinued until the early
nineties. Yeah, yeah. That's right.

51
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.230
Something is the, well, there's
a few different models that

52
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.230
came out. And I think
as time went on, they

53
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.550
started looking more and more
like a real computer that's

54
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.330
I think it, yeah, it
really, really captured the imagination

55
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.640
of, of just dead children
learning to program. And, and

56
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.770
there's a thriving game. Is
it something you'd add a

57
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.020
keyboard to like, is like,
I don't think I could

58
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.570
imagine myself programming on this
with the little Chiclets it's

59
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.720
just little squishy gray keys
seems like it would be

60
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.070
exhausting. A few third party
keyboards where you'd to unscrew

61
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.790
the original case in drag
and drop and drop the,

62
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.420
a motherboard in and get
a better keyboard. That way.

63
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.060
Actually, the one that I
started out with was the

64
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.210
spectrum plus, which has proper
plastic keys, but it was

65
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.080
still kind of the plastic
membrane under that. So it

66
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.860
was a bit still short
of being a proper professional

67
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.310
keyboard as you think of
it. But I think that

68
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.390
I, I was spared the,
the, the pain of the,

69
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.770
of the actual rubber one
back in the day. So

70
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.960
there were five or 6 million
of these out in the

71
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.890
world and it hasn't been
inactive. No, no. One's been

72
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.630
making these since 1992, but
there were 40 software titles

73
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.580
released in 2018. That that's
impossible. I mean, it wasn't

74
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.440
all written by you. There
must be a whole huge

75
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.590
community of people excited about
this machine. Yeah. It's it's

76
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.310
yeah. People are interested in
this as a retro thing,

77
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.140
but, well, in my case,
I was, I, I stayed

78
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.920
to interested in it AF
after it had died to

79
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.040
commercial death and it was
just as a very niche

80
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.200
hobbies thing, but yeah. In,
in the last 10 years

81
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.860
or so, he's had a
real resurgence from the nostalgia

82
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:37.200
crowd and yeah, this lots
of people, mainly around Europe

83
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.410
who are developing for it.
And yeah, it's a great

84
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.470
community to the parcels. Do
you write, like, I assume

85
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.100
it comes with a basic,
basic emulator, but it has

86
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.860
a basic interpreter, but are
you right? You're not writing

87
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.950
in basic, right? No, I
think it's pretty much all

88
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.780
a 80 assembler, 80 assembly.
So what Kind of processor

89
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.850
are we talking about? <inaudible>
so it's a it's, it's

90
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.450
kinda kind of a, it
was a derivative of the

91
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.530
80, 80. That's a, well,
it was a clone by

92
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:19.090
Xylog. It was the creators
of it. And so where

93
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:25.390
one brunch turned into a
x86 and the button PC,

94
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:31.090
but yeah, they, so the
<inaudible> was a micro processor

95
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.980
that still exists to some
extent, but I think it

96
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.120
had its heyday in the
eighties. Yeah. So you said

97
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.970
Zed, we say Z the
Z eight years, that 80

98
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.730
from Xylog was something that
came out in the early

99
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.690
seventies, mid seventies. So this
is a software compatible, Intel,

100
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.390
80, 80. It's like you
said, it's a predecessor to

101
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.230
the 80, 80, 86. And
does it, when you're on

102
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.260
it, does it feel like
a shadow or the beginning

103
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.470
of, of the Intel processors
that we're, that we're using?

104
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.410
Do you, do you think,
like you're looking at a

105
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.900
piece of history, a piece
of Intel history there, even

106
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.510
though it's not, It's, it's
hard to say really I've,

107
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.220
I've never released dig into
x86 assembly to the same

108
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.980
extent that I have with
that AC let's. I think

109
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.130
the, I guess the computer
architecture is back in the

110
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.370
eighties, everyone was very much
doing their own thing. So

111
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.250
it was the wild West
in a way. No one

112
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:36.280
was really sure what would
become the final standard. This

113
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.620
is yeah. The spectrum and
this at a release of

114
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.360
one out of many possibilities
readily. So you're in the

115
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.690
UK, you're doing your web
thing. You're designing and playing

116
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.300
around with software and as
a hobby on the, on

117
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.610
the ZX spectrum. And then
you get a, you get

118
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.340
a phone call or an
email from, from someone at

119
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.320
Netflix and they just called
you out of the blue.

120
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.800
What happened? It was through
a friend of a friend

121
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:05.970
on Facebook actually. So I'm
involved in a way it's

122
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.460
a community called the, the
demo. So, you know, to

123
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.750
properly explain a bit about
what that was, but very,

124
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.380
very briefly, it's a community
of people doing like visual

125
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.820
audio, visual, artistic things on
computers, new and old. And

126
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.710
I, a lot of my
spectrum work is doing there's

127
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:34.510
these little art pieces Deafo
for this community and a

128
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.140
contact as mine, Chris mill
Ray, or the way otherwise

129
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.750
known as a C Trek
CEO just sent me a

130
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.310
Facebook message saying that I've
got this as a producer

131
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.150
from a TV show that
you've definitely heard of. And

132
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:54.010
they're interested in getting some
spectrum programming done for it.

133
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.570
So yeah, I thought, well,
this is definitely a of

134
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.630
my streets. So at this
point, I didn't know anything

135
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.990
about what the, what the,
the show in, in question

136
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.220
was, but, but yeah, they
put me in touch and

137
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:15.570
I signed the NDA and
I started getting these small

138
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.570
fragments of information about what's
the, this so and well,

139
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.480
the show turned out to
be a black mirror and

140
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.070
yeah, got, we've got this
very basic outline of what

141
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.620
the show is going to
be about. Namely about that

142
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.500
programmer from the 1980s, creating
video games for the spectrum.

143
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.930
And they were keen to,
as a kind of Easter

144
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:48.960
egg to take some of
the fictional programs from the,

145
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.950
from the show and make
them into actual real world

146
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.990
spectrum programs. You only, like
you said, you had pieces

147
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.240
of the information and even
until they probably came out,

148
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.300
you still only had fractions
of what was really going

149
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.370
on. Right? Like they didn't
like, say here's the script.

150
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.640
What do you think? They
said, here's a theoretical video

151
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.820
game. That's gonna, that exists.
What as mockups within the

152
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.460
game, within the show that
doesn't the game didn't exist,

153
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:19.400
right? No. So the, they
created mockups of these games

154
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.590
and I think Adobe premiere,
so everything that is actually

155
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:29.180
seen in the show is
it's a very clever mockup

156
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:35.310
of, of the spectrum graphics.
And so I had these

157
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.820
10, 22nd clips of the,
of the games, just the

158
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.290
snippets that you see in,
in the show. And I

159
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.400
was tasked with making that
into a real spectrum game.

160
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.260
Wow. That's gotta be challenging
someone rather than designing the

161
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.130
game. Your specification was like,
here's, here's a Adobe premier

162
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.800
thing, or here's a flash
game. That's not really the

163
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.040
game. And, you know, from
an angle or whatever, like

164
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.570
go and figure this out
and go write us a

165
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.880
game. And they weren't, they
weren't kidding. They wanted it

166
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.010
written for a real ZX
spectrum. Yep. That's right. And

167
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.770
to their credit, it was
a really well done mockup

168
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.670
for 'em. Right. And so
a lot of like when

169
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.100
people are trying to create
something in an eight bit

170
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.180
style, they all just take
some like modern video game

171
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.000
graphics and just scale it
down. But they'd sort of

172
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.280
taken the time to figure
it out the like the

173
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.810
correct screen resolution and right
down to the little graphical

174
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.080
quirks that the spectrum had,
where it's called a color

175
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.530
clash, where if you've got
one Sprite of one color

176
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.610
moving on top of another
one, then the color will

177
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.830
bleed from one Sprite to
another, because there's on the

178
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.260
number of colors you can
have in a particular bit

179
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:02.530
of space and did some
research. Yeah. Yeah. There's definitely

180
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.430
a people on the production
team with a real lift

181
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.320
the spectrum. Wow. Okay. The
image resolution of a spectrum

182
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.110
is, is two 56 by
one 92. This was kind

183
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.050
of thing that we imagine
a resolution that we'd see,

184
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.750
like on a tiny, tiny,
old led screen, the size

185
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.840
of your thumbnail, but this
is on, and it also

186
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.600
has a kind of a
grid overlay with a quite,

187
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.630
quite a lot of limitations,
limitations in size limitations in

188
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.810
color, not to mention the
color clash that you called

189
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.170
out. Yeah, that's right. So,
yeah, you've got a w

190
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.160
so you have the, the
basic two, five, six by

191
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.820
one, nine two. And that
that's kind of just a

192
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.230
monochrome image with the color
overlay on top. And th

193
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.760
the, the exact limitations are
within an every eight by

194
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.200
eight pixel square, then you
can use two colors out

195
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.700
of a pallet of eight,
and you can also have

196
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:07.320
the whole that that's square
designated as Brian. Oh, wow.

197
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.710
That is complicated. And, and
they're, they're, they're basically trying

198
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.900
to do all of this
because of limitations. Right. This

199
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.410
is all about constraints. That's
probably why people find coding

200
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.270
for the spectrum. So fun
is that this is an

201
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.450
exercise in constraints. What can
I do with so little?

202
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.620
Yeah, exactly. So, so the,
the, the screen restrictions that

203
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.100
comes out of the, just
the memory limitations, I think

204
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.620
you had 48 kilobytes of
memory in, in the, the

205
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.460
entire thing. And by having
this mostly monochrome screen, that

206
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.660
means that that's only takes
up six K. And, but

207
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.710
yeah, the working in those
limitations, it's a, that's really

208
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:51.300
what appeals to me. And
it's in a way it's

209
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.440
kind of a bit of
escapism from working with computers

210
00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.900
in my day job, because
you can really understand the

211
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.680
machine at their really low
level. You're not in working

212
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.820
at the top of the
stack of abstractions. It's some,

213
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.030
you can get your head
around the entire architecture of

214
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:16.620
the machine, just in your
head. There's nothing hiding. There's

215
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.500
no, there's no layer of
abstraction. There's no sea runtime,

216
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.470
there's no JavaScript. It's just
you and a piece of

217
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.200
hardware and some registers that
you can, you can play

218
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.130
with. Yeah, exactly. And it
means that you're kind of

219
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.790
free to kind of invent
ways of doing things, trying

220
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:38.790
to you use the 18
instruction, setting, creative ways to,

221
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.800
to squeeze out a bit
more performance, push more pixels

222
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.280
than you normally would be
able to. And just by

223
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.770
doing things in sort of
nonstandard ways. So yeah. Kind

224
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.310
of breaking the rules of
structured programming. So yeah, it's

225
00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:00.740
really a sandbox way yet.
And anything is possible early.

226
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.090
They pull out more performance.
It might, it might seem

227
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.100
odd for people to listen
and think like, well, what

228
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.690
kind of performance are you
going to get from this?

229
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.300
But that's really the, the
essence of the whole demo

230
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.790
scene is to see what
can I do with smaller

231
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.830
and smaller constraints? What can
I do in three K

232
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.940
and four K and Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. There's all kinds

233
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.380
of different limitations. So like
the size limitations working with,

234
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.940
with the limited hardware, like
the spectrum and yeah, it's,

235
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.570
it's, let's say it's kind
of in way escapism from

236
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.910
what you would do at
what you'd be working on

237
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.280
in some law to mainstream
programming. Hey folks, you're a

238
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.210
very good developer, probably regardless.
You do write bugs. That's

239
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.390
unavoidable. What is affordable is
wasting time trying to track

Visit century.io. Was there anything,

253
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.150
when you were writing this,
that you thought wasn't possible,

254
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.600
or was it a straightforward
game as spectrum games go?

255
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.810
And in this case it
was, it was fairly straightforward.

256
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.100
I think normally when I'm
doing a demo, seeing things

257
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:53.140
and trying to push the
limits, then it's because I'm,

258
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.530
I am the one that's
deciding, this is what I'm

259
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.950
going to create. And this
is I, this is my

260
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.560
plan of attack. It's kind
of a bit of a

261
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.470
different approach when you're given
something to create a and

262
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:12.190
so that was kind of
a bit more constrained than

263
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:17.950
I would usually be if
I was left to my

264
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.060
own devices. How much time
did you spend on this?

265
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.710
Is this something you bang
out in a weekend or

266
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.920
is this many weeks of
work? I think it was,

267
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.680
well, it was Mo mostly
it was after I was

268
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.300
in my evenings. I think
it was maybe two or

269
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.130
three weeks of evenings. Oh,
that's not too bad. Quite

270
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.400
a lot of it. It
was, there's a few things

271
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:48.400
I'm not really, I taken
this, this approach before. Usually

272
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.380
if I'm doing demo scene
things where it's very focused

273
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.680
on just this specific visual
effects and everything that you

274
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.070
you're able to really plan
out exactly what's happening on

275
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.910
screen at any moment, but
with a game, because it's

276
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.360
always variable, how much action
there is on screen, then

277
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.420
it's, that's ended up being
kind of a different approach.

278
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:22.020
And so I had to
rethink how to deal with

279
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.250
clearing and reprinting sprites and
making sure that it didn't

280
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.660
clash with where, how the
screen was updating. And so

281
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.780
there was quite a lot
of rethinking the way I

282
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.880
usually do things in that
respect. How did people load

283
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.300
their applications? There's no SD
cards, there's no hard drive.

284
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.610
What is the input output
of a, of a spectrum?

285
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.330
Well, back in the day,
at least it was a

286
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:53.840
cassette tapes. You would have
these tapes with the five

287
00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.800
minutes or so of these
high-pitched bleeps that sort of

288
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.920
encoded the binary data. And,
and since I'd say this,

289
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.880
the spectrum, it was a
very much a cost cutting

290
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.330
thing. The idea is that
you would just take your

291
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.810
tape recorder that you had
laying around the house and

292
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.060
just, and just plug that
into the spectrum. And you

293
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.200
would hit play and wait
five minutes for this whole

294
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.840
thing to load into the,
into the memory. And at

295
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.070
the end of that, you
would have the game. And

296
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.950
I think one thing that
was quite unique to the

297
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.760
spectrum and thinking quite a
few of different microcomputers how

298
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.660
they used cassette tapes, but
the spectrum was kind of

299
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.650
unique in that you actually
heard these bleeps while it

300
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:56.810
was loading. And I think
there's some speculation that that

301
00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.990
was more a hardware bug
than something intentional. But, but

302
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.100
yeah, it did mean that
you had this very anyone

303
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.070
who was loading games on
this thing, they would, it

304
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.590
would be a very familiar
statement. This sort of B,

305
00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.480
B lots of statements. Sometimes
when I'm trying to explain

306
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.990
how this works, I use
the idea of, of modems.

307
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.060
Is it almost like a
one way modem? It's that

308
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:27.020
it's almost like you called,
like the computer called somewhere

309
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.030
and it played back to
them except the own. It's

310
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.250
only one way it's going
from the tape directly into

311
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.980
the, into the device. Yeah.
I think that would be

312
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.490
a, an accurate way to
describe it. Yeah. Yeah. So

313
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.400
it's whistling and it's going
doing it's it's high bit

314
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.730
and it's low bit based
on the tones. That was

315
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.040
how it was done in
the eighties. But you were

316
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.100
writing this in a text.
How did you go from

317
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.620
a text editor to a
tape? And what, how did

318
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.540
you deliver this to them?
So the, so the D

319
00:20:54.610 --> 00:21:00.570
developing it, I I'm mostly,
well, pretty much exclusively using

320
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:08.340
an emulator on the PC
and this, the, there are

321
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.860
a sort of utility programs
that, that deal with the

322
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.000
file formats on, on the,
with the emulator that kind

323
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.860
of simulate the Tepe image
and can convert that to

324
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:28.710
just a wave file. So,
and yeah, I'd say the,

325
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.900
the development I do, it's
pretty much exclusively on, on

326
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.030
emulators. It's a certain more
convenient way of working and

327
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:45.750
bots. They, these, these, they,
they do have support for

328
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.050
loading and saving as audio
files or the various disc

329
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:56.970
systems that existed for, for
the spectrum over time, You

330
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.640
do the work on a
modern PC, you test it

331
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.520
in an emulator, you save
it as a dot tap

332
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.490
or dot tape file. And
then you can also export

333
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.980
it as a wave effectively
a sound file that could

334
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.140
then theoretically be put on
a real tape if someone

335
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.320
wanted to load this on
it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay.

336
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.770
Dude, our spectrums hacked is
such that you can feed

337
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.620
stuff into the spectrum faster
than a real tape, or

338
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.350
is if you wanted to
go and do a final

339
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.130
production test on a physical
real machine, would you really

340
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.770
export record to a tape,
play it back and wait

341
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:35.130
five minutes. Well, over time
there's been plenty of more

342
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:39.240
advanced storage systems for the
spectrum. So these days there

343
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:46.740
are SD cards out on
interfaces. So it's most of

344
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.790
the time, I think you
just take these emulator files,

345
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.600
just drop them onto the
SD card. And there's a

346
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.200
custom phone West of the
spectrum that can load straight

347
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.640
from that to, but yeah,
over time, this is something

348
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.990
that's evolved quite a lot
for quite a long time.

349
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.730
In like in the 1990s,
I was working with floppies

350
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.620
and yeah, it's so it's
something that the, the, the

351
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.720
tech, the technology, the spectrum
has been catching up with

352
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.670
with modern, not it wasn't
hardware in its own way.

353
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.330
It's so wonderful to see
all of these older pieces

354
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.110
of hardware get little hacks,
little mods, I've got a,

355
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.870
we have Nintendo, we, and,
you know, they can load

356
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.650
off of the SD card.
I've seen a USB port

357
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.140
added to a, a gold
star 3d, Oh, everyone wants

358
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.090
to make it nice and
easy so that someone can

359
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:51.610
get involved in retro computing
or retro gaming. Yeah, it's

360
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:56.320
a, well, when I think
back to the development process,

361
00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.770
before I, before I moved
on to emulators and the,

362
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:06.550
well, the thing with developing
in assembler is that if

363
00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.120
something, if you, if there
is a book, then there's

364
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.940
not really any way of
just of just stopping with

365
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.390
an error message and then
going back into like, fixing,

366
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:21.220
finding your book that it
would just hard crash the

367
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:25.900
machine. So, so well in
the worst case that that

368
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.560
would mean that you'd have
to spend five minutes loading

369
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:35.860
everything from tape all over
it again, or, well, this

370
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:40.900
is again where the, the,
the more modern hardware accessories

371
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.200
over time really helps. If
I had a disk system

372
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.660
where you could save a
snapshot of the memory to

373
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.660
desk before running a program,
and then if it crashed,

374
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.510
then you'd still be able
to load that snapshots out.

375
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:57.070
But I think being able
to do everything instantly through

376
00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:02.500
the emulator, just have a
single command that can compile

377
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.260
everything from a text file,
and then just fire up

378
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:10.660
the emulator. I think it's
a real luxury compared to

379
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.100
what we used to have.
Yeah. Watching the character in

380
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.910
the black mirror Bandersnatch show,
there was just a lot

381
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.070
of him staring at the
screen with his head in

382
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.250
his hands, which I feel
like as someone who developed

383
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.340
software in the eighties that
really represents, you know, very,

384
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.650
very accurately what it felt
like there was no internet,

385
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.840
there was him a stack
of books and he was

386
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.300
staring at a screen looking
sad for a very long

387
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.410
time. Yeah. And well, I
think it's worth mentioning that.

388
00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.020
I think they used a
bit of artistic license in

389
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:45.130
the show in that they
showed him programming in basic.

390
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:50.590
I think that's a, I'd
say acceptable artistic license with

391
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.820
making programming, look how the
audience might expect it to

392
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.050
look, Indeed. It would have
been much more, much less

393
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.540
glamorous at we'd been running
it, doing it in assembler.

394
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.320
Yeah. Where did they hide
this then? So how did

395
00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.630
people find this game? So
there's, you know, they could

396
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.280
have just mocked the whole
thing up and called it

397
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.530
a day. So it's so
the, they, they stashed this.

398
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.350
It was at the, at
the end of the, it

399
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:22.840
was one of the endings
because the, the actual process

400
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.880
for getting to this particular
ending, it's kind of a

401
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.170
bit vague, but they, they,
there is the scene of

402
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.030
the, of the main character.
It's, it's a kind of

403
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:35.740
call back to an early
scene where he's on the

404
00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.980
bus, listening to music on
his Walkman, but it's rather

405
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.910
than putting a tape of
music. And he, he, of

406
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.400
his, his demo of his
program in, and starts listening

407
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:53.160
to these high pitch and
bleeps and well it's people

408
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.940
as, as this is a
kind of a very distinctive

409
00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.410
sound to a small fragment
of the audience. So I

410
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:06.300
think what, once people discovered
this scene, I think there

411
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.720
are some, there's a certain
portion of the audience where

412
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.120
they had this light bulb
moment of, ah, I know

413
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:17.850
what this is. And so
yeah, they found the right

414
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:22.500
setup to take that audio
and feed it into, into

415
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.200
the spectrum. It's so wonderful
that in 2019, in, in

416
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.350
modern television right now, you
realize that if that had

417
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:33.740
just been honestly screeching and
nothing had been hidden there,

418
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.690
I think we would have
all been disappointed. And it's

419
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.830
so wonderful that people like
black mirror or mr. Robot

420
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.530
like puts the work in
and hires people like you

421
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.160
to do fun Easter eggs
like this, because it, it

422
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.960
helps us engage in such
a deeper way with the,

423
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.430
with the medium. Yeah. It's
a, it feels amazing to

424
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.870
me that I am getting
this. Yeah. Paige work doing

425
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:03.700
spectrum developments in, in 2018,
2019, but yeah, it's, I

426
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:07.010
think, yeah, obviously the, the
creators of the shows they

427
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.610
grew up in this area
as well, and this, there's

428
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.240
obviously some, a real passion
for the old computers there

429
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.870
and, you know, it's, it's
great for them to be

430
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.360
dragged along with that same
enthusiasm. So were there two

431
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.230
programs written because the screeching
noise and Bandersnatch demo, isn't

432
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.450
actually the game, right. Because
that would have required a

433
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.810
lot more audio. Is it
our code that points to

434
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:37.280
the game? Yeah, that's right.
So that's one bit of

435
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.180
briefing I got from the
producers was that, okay, whatever

436
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.150
we do, the bit of
audio that plays in the

437
00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:48.230
show, it can't be longer
than one minute. So I

438
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.120
see that that would have
been quite tricky if that

439
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.480
had been the entire code
of the game. So their

440
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.940
suggestion was that the audio
that you hit that plays

441
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.760
in the show would just
display this QR code. And

442
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.450
so this was at the
point where I was able

443
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.660
to sort of upsell them
a bit and said, well,

444
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.990
since I'm used to doing
these like visual effects on

445
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.200
the spectrum, I thought, well,
rather than it just displaying

446
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.270
a static QR code, then
how about add, add a

447
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:27.950
bit of like VHS style
glitching and to kind of

448
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.820
make it a bit more
of the black mirror ambiance.

449
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.600
And, and so that was
a lot of fun to

450
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.170
do is to try and
create these kind of fake

451
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:45.940
VCR noise effects. And how
long does it take, if

452
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.580
you did the entire game,
you said three, four, three,

453
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.760
or four or five minutes
of audio, something like that.

454
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.120
Yes. It's well, this, this
is one place where we,

455
00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.010
we can take advantage of
the lusts of 20 or

456
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.570
30 years of spectrum development.
So there's a people have

457
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.860
come up with a sort
of compression systems that, where

458
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.310
you're compressing things on the
PC and then unpacking them

459
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:18.040
on, on the spectrum. So
think things are a bit

460
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.880
more efficient than they would
have been for. Someone's making

461
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.060
this entirely on the spectrum
back in the eighties. But

462
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.120
yeah, I think it would
have been something I add

463
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.710
two or three minutes maybe
for the nosedive game. And

464
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:38.500
the nosedive game is something
like 13,000 bytes. And the

465
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.060
average transfer rate is 300
bod or about 38 bytes

466
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.460
per second. So you can
figure it would take a

467
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.380
while. Yeah. Something like that.
Yeah. Fantastic. So people can

468
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.780
follow you on Twitter at
Twitter slash gas, manic, M

469
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.510
a N I C I'll
put links to this in

470
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.410
the show notes, and you
can go to Tucker soft.net

471
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.730
and play a nose dive,
and O H Zed, D

472
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.150
Y V E. And hopefully
they can go out there

473
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.600
and Google and learn all
about the, the exciting ZX

474
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.500
spectrum community that I hope
has been re-energized by this

475
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.680
bit of nostalgia that they
inserted into the black mirror

476
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:26.410
episode, spinous, lots of those
in the spectrum scene, as

477
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:31.240
well as, and the black
mirror sound scene. So, yeah,

478
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.190
it's been really exciting to
see that over the last

479
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.060
few weeks. Yeah. Fantastic. Thanks
so much, Matt. Wescott for

480
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.360
chatting with me today. This
has been another episode of

481
00:31:43.360 --> 00:32:06.100
Hansel minutes, and we'll see
you again next week. <inaudible>.
