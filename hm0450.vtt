00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.460
is another episode of Hansel
minutes, and I'm talking with

14
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.710
Erica joy. Who's an engineer
at Google. How are you?

15
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.110
I'm doing all right, Scott.
How are you today? I

16
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.690
am very well. Thanks for
chatting with me today. Thanks

17
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.240
for inviting me. We've been
on Google plus for a

18
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.310
while now. Kind of orbiting
people who already each other

19
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.000
kind of like, Oh, there's
that person again? And I've

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.880
noticed you, we have lots
of shared interests in film

21
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.580
and comics and all these
kinds of things. So, and

22
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.140
of course, as, as engineers,
but you recently posted this

23
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.800
piece on medium called the
other side of diversity and

24
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.720
it was, it got a
lot of response, mostly positive,

25
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.450
mostly positive for sure. Harrison
pockets of the internet, you

26
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.910
know, Reddit, a little bit
of hacker news where it

27
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.430
wasn't so positive, but you
know, I didn't read too

28
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.560
much of those comments, you
know, never read the comments,

29
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.430
never, ever read the comments.
I believe in that. And

30
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.050
I thought it would be
interesting to talk to you

31
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.600
about, you know, kind of
your come up, you know,

32
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.140
like how did you start?
When was your first interaction

33
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.010
with computers and your relationship
with computers? So my first

34
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.520
interaction with computers that I
can remember was when I

35
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.700
was around seven, my mom
had a computer at our

36
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.280
house in Florida, and I
remember her showing me Q

37
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.060
basic and I poked around
with that as a seven

38
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.990
year old. I remember the
black and green screen. Yeah.

39
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.310
Was there a sense of
like I'm exploring something or

40
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.440
I'm this power here, or
did you have any sense

41
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.330
of what you're doing? You're
just poking buttons. There was

42
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.610
no sense of that. I
was just poking button buttons

43
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.640
and pressing, you know, 10
and 20 and all that

44
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.110
stuff. Typical basic stuff, but
I didn't really know what

45
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.880
I was doing. I was
just playing around, you know,

46
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.620
my mom prayed much, just
sat me in front of

47
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.240
it, just to me, something
to do. I think I

48
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.420
didn't really begin to love
computers until I went to

49
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.470
this HyperCard workshop as a
10 year old. It was

50
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.550
when I was living in
Alaska. And for some reason,

51
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.670
my school decided to send
me to this workshop that

52
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.560
was, you know, 30 miles
away. And I got to

53
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.950
play with HyperCard as a
10 year old. And that's

54
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.860
when I fell in love
with it, You just got

55
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.450
sent off as like a
talented and gifted kind of

56
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.730
thing. Like they put me
on the bus and they

57
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.250
were like, you know, you're
different. You should go do

58
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.620
this. Yeah, I was done.
I was in gifted and

59
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.460
talented classes. So it might've
been related to that. I

60
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.590
just remember they put me
in a cab at 10

61
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.450
year old me was like,
Oh my gosh, I'm already

62
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.700
in a catalog and myself.
And they put me in

63
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.800
a cab and sent me
30 miles away to this

64
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.840
thing. And was that, and
you say that was when

65
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.980
you fell in love with
him. You're like, that was

66
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.590
the moment for you. Yep.
I remember it vividly. I

67
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.030
remember using HyperCard and laser
disks to put together something

68
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.110
that might've looked, something like
a webpage before web pages

69
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.350
were a thing maybe. And
Ricard was so ahead of

70
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.170
its time. Yeah, it was,
it was so fun. I

71
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.110
just remember, like I had,
I was doing a thing

72
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.350
on diamonds and the hope
diamond was what my laser

73
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.240
disc was about. And it
was just as ten-year-old me

74
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.750
was just like, this is
the greatest thing ever. It's

75
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.610
like, it was like, it
was like PowerPoint, but you're

76
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.310
making a stack of cards.
You're building up knowledge. And

77
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.680
it was, it was like
a little web Yeah. Three

78
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.220
by five cards. Exactly. And
it was fun and it

79
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.110
was, I wanted to take
it home with me, but

80
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.980
you know, there was no
HyperCard at my house. Yeah.

81
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.000
They I'm relating to that
story a little bit. I,

82
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.560
I grew up in Portland
and kind of a middle

83
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.930
class, lower class and lower
middle class neighborhood. And there

84
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.660
was only one computer. Yeah.
You know what I mean?

85
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.170
So everyone wanted to take
it home, but I was

86
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.770
the troublemaker and they had
like meetings about me. I

87
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.120
don't know if you had,
if they had meetings about

88
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.640
you as well. Oh, there
was one meeting that was

89
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.100
just really phenomenal. It was
in high school and it

90
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.100
was around the time. This
was still in Alaska, was

91
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.310
around the time where I
was really getting into computing

92
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.180
and I was exploring the
world of like hacking and

93
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.450
freaking, and I had these
silly little scripts on my

94
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.900
computer, like on my directory
at school, because that was

95
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.540
the smartest thing to do.
Freaking for people who don't

96
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.350
know it's for messing with
phones. Yeah. Yeah. And so

97
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.380
I had, I had the
rainbow books saved on my

98
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.500
directory at school, as well
as, you know, silly little

99
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.920
scripts. And so I get
called to the office one

100
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.760
day and I'm like, what's
this about? And did someone

101
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.740
send me something? You know,
I was just, I had,

102
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.510
I was clueless. I had
no idea. So I get

103
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.970
to the office and there
is my mom and my

104
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.450
dad, the school principal, the
superintendent, the guy who runs

105
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.040
it for the entire school
district and the military police.

106
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.620
Cause I would just go
into military base, Holy mackerel.

107
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.230
Oh yeah. And I was
like, what is this? What's

108
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.230
happening right now? And they're
like, sit down. We need

109
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.790
to talking, you know, sit
down, we need to talk.

110
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.810
It's always bad. It's never
good. And so it turns

111
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:28.430
out that someone had hacked
the principal's computer. And I

112
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.920
eventually found out who that
someone was, but it wasn't

113
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.680
me. But they thought it
was because of the files

114
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.720
that I had silly, like
stored in that directory, on

115
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.170
my computer at school. So,
So they, they, they said

116
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.490
she's the techie. So she
must've been the one that

117
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.380
brought She's a techie with
the rainbow books. And the

118
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.680
Explain what the rainbow books
mean to people who The

119
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.840
rainbow books are just stuff
for freaking, like, they tell

120
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.840
you how to, you know,
hack phones Right back in

121
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.270
the day when we had
payphones for people who may

122
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.870
not remember this, there were
ways to get free, long

123
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.390
distance calls break into at
and T like you would

124
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:10.060
basically be as if you
were the telephone. Yeah. I

125
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.630
never, I never like did
anything to advance with that

126
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.330
stuff because that like put
a stop to it. I

127
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.260
was like, never again, I'm
not going to be called

128
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.460
to the principal's office and
get threatened with expulsion ever

129
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.430
again. So I was done
While you were telling that

130
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.010
story, I was like, I've
had that meeting, like, okay,

131
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.220
the teacher. Yes. Principal. Yes.
Superintendent. I'm like, I'm right

132
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.700
there. Military police. No, I
never had the military police.

133
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.440
So you win. I'm sorry.
I got the superintendent. And

134
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.440
they made a joke that
I was most going to

135
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.450
be voted most likely to
be convicted of a white

136
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.020
collar crime while he said
that time, I still have

137
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.440
time. And they, so they
loaned me the computer. They

138
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.290
basically, we made a deal
with my fifth grade teacher

139
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.350
that Friday nights, my dad
could back the pickup truck

140
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.740
up to the place, borrow
the computer for the weekend,

141
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.810
as long as it was
backed by Sunday night. And

142
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.410
they would not tell anyone.
Oh, wow. And that kept

143
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.750
me off the streets. Well,
there you go. You weren't,

144
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.480
you weren't in any danger
of being a hoodlum because

145
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.920
you had the computer that
you had to play it

146
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.930
on the pickup truck Pretty
much. I mean, I was

147
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.300
like, there was like a
$2,000 computer. Like it was

148
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.090
worth more than the pickup
truck. I think we drove

149
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.770
that truck about five miles
an hour. Cause we did

150
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.280
not want to break the
computer. Oh yeah, definitely. And

151
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.790
it was probably likely back
then You made hyper cards

152
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.950
and now you're 10. Yeah.
I was 10. I didn't

153
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.190
really do much with computers
aside from the standard, you

154
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.950
know, computer class stuff and
playing, you know, Carmen Sandiego

155
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.390
in Oregon trail, et cetera.
That was the best. Oh

156
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.270
God, wasn't it. Those are
the good games. Like where's

157
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.010
Carmen Sandiego now where in
the world is. But I

158
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.680
Do know that. So they
made a walking dead version

159
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.890
of Oregon trail and flash
shut up really? Oh my

160
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.810
goodness. So go and Google
for Oregon trail, Oregon trail,

161
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.430
Oregon, like our gin. And
it's basically the, the cast

162
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.150
of the walking dead on
the Oregon trail. And it's

163
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.200
like, you know, you're, you're,
don't play it now. We're

164
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.720
doing a PA. I'm not
going to play it, but

165
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.110
I'm looking at it. I
can see it. Yes. So

166
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.210
then you have to collect,
you have to drive your

167
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.990
truck across the, across the
Oregon trail. Try not to

168
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.920
get eaten by zombies. Oh,
wow. So do you think

169
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.560
you were a programmer already
at 10? I had no

170
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.840
idea what programmers were. You
know what I mean? Like

171
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.300
in your soul, like, was
this, you, you knew you

172
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.670
were a builder at least.
Cause you, you reveled in

173
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.040
the building of this staff.
I was a tinkerer for

174
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.620
sure. Like I used to
tinker with things. Like I

175
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.900
take her pump apart my
toys and put them back

176
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.940
together. I'm certain, if I
were allowed to take apart

177
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.000
the computer, I would have
done that. I took apart

178
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.220
my Walkman for sure. I
remember that. I remember taking

179
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.550
apart my Walkman just to
see how it worked and

180
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.260
then put it back together.
So yeah, I was a

181
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.740
tinkerer. I like to fix
things for sure. That's so

182
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.100
important for kids to open
stuff up and take it

183
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.210
apart. Yeah, definitely. Cause he,
you, I don't know. You

184
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.690
get a better sense of
what you're using. You know,

185
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.260
you form a connection once
you've taken it apart, put

186
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.810
it back together. It's like,
all right. That's, that's my

187
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.810
thing now. Like I understand
it. I wonder it seems

188
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.610
to me like, and I
don't mean to get all

189
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.640
like kids today, but you
know, if, if the only

190
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.440
device you ever opened up
and look inside, it's like

191
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.290
changing the battery on your
Samsung phone. Like how much

192
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.300
of a sense of physicality
can you have? I mean,

193
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.840
an iPad is disposable, right?
Nobody opens an iPad up

194
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.690
and fixed it. Well, Apple
doesn't want you to. Yeah.

195
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.480
Like they make their stuff
now. So you can't open

196
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.100
it up. Cool. And then
yeah, nothing can be opened

197
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.620
up anymore, right? Yeah. Yeah.
I've always said like, you

198
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.260
know, the whole Jedi builds
his own lightsaber thing. Like

199
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.540
you've built desktop machines. There's
something to be said for

200
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.370
that. And I'm sad now
that I don't have to

201
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.210
do that. Yeah. Well, yeah.
I liked building my machines.

202
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.530
That was fun. But you
know, I've always said that

203
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.580
if I could run iOS
10 on a PC, you

204
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.490
know, the right way. Yeah.
I had a hackathon it's

205
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.530
still upstairs. In fact, if,
if I could run Oh

206
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.990
10 on PCs the right
way, I would build like

207
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.640
a monster desktop and run
listed on it. Like, yeah,

208
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.580
that'd be great. I built
a machine a couple of

209
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.290
years back out of my
blog and we called it

210
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.730
the GOM G O M
God's own machine. How that's

211
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.370
awesome. So we basically, we
set a dollar amount. I

212
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.690
think it was $2,000 and
it's like, okay, let's all,

213
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.380
all the internet got involved
and we're like, let's see

214
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.860
how much computer we can
actually build. Wow. You know

215
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.380
what I mean? It was
like six, this is like

216
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.330
couple, three, four years ago,
16 gigs of Ram SSD

217
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.860
<inaudible> hexachord like, we don't
even know what hexachord means.

218
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.690
Exactly. And I'm actually still
running that machine now I've

219
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.670
got like three monitors and
I it's one of those

220
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.610
things where You just, Oh,
you just add a little

221
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.980
more SSD, add a little
more memory, you know? That's

222
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.830
yeah, Yeah. I built it
and we water cooled it,

223
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.070
you know, like that level
of craft, it's a sense

224
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.730
of accomplishment. Right. And I
miss that upgradability. Right. Like

225
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.560
you you're still running the
same machine cause you can

226
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.770
add things to it. Right.
Like I can't upgrade my

227
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.280
Mac. Like I can maybe
throw some Ram in it.

228
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.300
Wait a year till it
breaks. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks Apple

229
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.080
care. So, so you, you
went through high school and

230
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.500
were you like doing the
whole Norton commander thing and

231
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:43.140
check disking other people's disks
and fixing viruses? No, not

232
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.330
in high school. In high
school. I was just really,

233
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.190
I was the helper in
all the computer classes because

234
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.830
I always had a lot
of free hours. I don't

235
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.010
know how that happened. I
think I'm not sure. I

236
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.200
always, but I always wound
up in the computer class

237
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.290
helping the computer teacher. Her
name is ms. Londo. Yeah.

238
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.750
I was Lando Calrissian, a
L L O N D

239
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.680
O. Yeah. But yeah, I
always used to go to

240
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.630
her class and just like
help out with stuff. And

241
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.780
when like, I dunno, whatever
silly program wasn't working, I'd

242
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.940
have to go fix it,
but there's no Norton or

243
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.220
check disking or whatever. They
weren't going to have that.

244
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.520
But this was like being
the geek. You yeah. Yeah.

245
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.670
I was always threading the
projector. You know, projectors have

246
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.400
trouble. Let's get Hanselman in
that thread there Projectors. Yeah.

247
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.860
Floppy Days. Right. Moving up
that five, that 5.2, five

248
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.740
to three 25 transition. Yeah.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. So

249
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.950
you're the helper. You're the,
you're the assistant, but then

250
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.320
you kind of started your
career in tech, in college

251
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.020
when you started being, we,
I was beyond college, right?

252
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.810
You were the administrator for
the university of Alaska. Yeah.

253
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.000
Oh yeah. I was one
of the windows system administrators

254
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.660
there. So the way the
university of Alaska works, there

255
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.910
is a statewide office that
is administers the whole university

256
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.690
of Alaska system. Right. So
there's all the different campuses

257
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:07.290
around the state. And, and
I worked in statewide as

258
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:13.470
a window system administrator there
and we basically ran the

259
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:18.090
business and of the university.
Yeah. And in, in the

260
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.880
university you were not only
the only woman on the

261
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.500
team, but probably one of
the few women in the

262
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.060
organization. This is like early,
early 2000. Yep. We, there

263
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.880
were other women on the
team, but there was only

264
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.370
one other technical woman on
the team. Her name's Laura.

265
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.900
She's amazing. Yeah. She was,
I think she did either

266
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:43.350
phones or networking. Networking. Yeah.
Yeah. And, and w you

267
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.690
were the only black woman
in the Oregon. Oh, for

268
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.760
sure. Yeah. There were no
other black ones in there.

269
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.190
Is it? This has been,
I mean, not to be

270
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.890
apologetic, but were in Alaska.
Yeah. I wasn't Alaska for

271
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.930
sure. And you know, there
were black people there, like

272
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.960
a lot of people. Yeah.
It wasn't just me and

273
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.010
my family. I don't know
that guy, but yeah, there

274
00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.090
were, there were black people
in Alaska, but mostly military,

275
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.420
there were some non-military people
there, but yeah. I mean,

276
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.010
that's how I wound up
there, military my parents. Yeah.

277
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.790
You ended up kind of
at the firm from a

278
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.830
racial perspective at the polar
opposite, you ended up in

279
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.770
Atlanta. Yeah. Which is a
lot of cool tech, a

280
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.320
lot of great companies and
a lot of black folks.

281
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.350
Yup. For sure. I think
the demographics are like 54%

282
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:36.130
African American is what did
they say on Wikipedia? And

283
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.860
then you ended up working
at a home Depot Yep.

284
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.730
At a home Depot store
support center, which is what

285
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:47.830
they call their headquarters, started
there and network operations and

286
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.780
then moved into their desktop
support team. Yeah. And when

287
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.440
I, when I think about
like diversity, like I would

288
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.250
want what I would call
representational diversity. Like my team,

289
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.760
my org kind of like
expanding out from myself, me,

290
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.120
my team, my org, my
division, my company, my neighborhood.

291
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.690
I would want it to
look like it's representational of

292
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.140
like the, the area around
me. Right. If my neighborhood

293
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.080
has a certain balance of
black and white, but then

294
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.060
I go to work and
it's all white people that

295
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.740
would feel weird. It would
feel like Is it would

296
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.010
for all black people, like,
yeah, I agree. Like I,

297
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.370
yeah. I want that same
sort of makeup in my

298
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.920
teams. And that's, that's what
home Depot was like. I

299
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.640
mean, I read some comment
on the internet where again,

300
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.110
never made the comments where
someone like completely misconstrued that

301
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.630
bit of my post or
like, Oh, she's just wants

302
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.310
to work with black people.
Cause she said her whole

303
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.140
team was black and you
know, home Depot. And it's

304
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.660
like, no, no, not even
close my whole team. Wasn't

305
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.370
black. There were a lot
of black people. It looked

306
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.310
like, like the rest of
Atlanta, right? Like, yeah, there

307
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.720
are a lot of black
people, but then there were

308
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.840
some white people and there
were some Asian people and

309
00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.010
there's so many Indian people
like it was Because diversity

310
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.980
is about not just what
it looks like. Right. It's

311
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.860
about how everybody thinks. And
you all came from and

312
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.960
you may have been one
of the other black women

313
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.460
on the team, but you
were the only one from

314
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.410
Alaska. Yeah, for sure. And
because your background, I assume

315
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.100
it creates who you are,
you think for you, you

316
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.600
think like Erica, because of
all these different things. Right.

317
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.270
Because you know, as a
military kid who grew up

318
00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.050
all over the place, because
I lived in Alaska because

319
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.290
I, you know, lived in
South Carolina, which was completely different

320
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.020
from Alaska. And I lived
in Miami, which was completely

321
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.420
different from all those things.
Like all those things sort

322
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.490
of informed who I am.
And so, yeah. Like, I,

323
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.710
I, I don't know. I
think it's easy to forget

324
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.670
that when you see someone
that looks like you that

325
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.750
Oh, that be like me.
Oh yeah, yeah. There's a

326
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.950
lot of that. I get,
I get stereotype expectations from

327
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.920
everybody, you know, not, you
know, not just, you know,

328
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.420
white people or black people
too, like, there's this expectation

329
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.150
that I'm going to be,
you know, sassy black chick

330
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.770
or whatever. And it's like,
this is not me at

331
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.060
all. Like I'm already goofy
girl. Well, and I think

332
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.820
that, that's the thing that
I think we all should

333
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.440
learn from being on the
internet is that people, not

334
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.080
just black people, but people
are not a monolith. Right.

335
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.600
You know, I, I'm not
here to meet your expectations.

336
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.740
Right. I'm here to be
myself. Exactly. And to be

337
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.270
authentic, My wife, when she
came she's from Zimbabwe, when

338
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.730
she came over here, she
saw when she was like

339
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.480
19, she stopped in Germany.
First trip on a plane

340
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.280
in Germany, Germany stops in
Germany, freaking out first, you

341
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.080
know, first time out of
the country, she's out of

342
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.510
like a six hour layover
she looks around and what

343
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.000
does she do? She goes
to the first black person

344
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.320
she could find. And she's
like, hi. Cause she's they

345
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.630
speak English and Zimbabwe. I
think she did it with

346
00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.830
an English accent. Hi, I'm
Mo and I'm here and

347
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.810
I'm looking for, and he
did not speak a word

348
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.500
of English because he was
a German guy and he

349
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.410
was not interested in talking
to my wife. And he

350
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.780
just basically was very German
with all due respect to

351
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.570
my German friends and listeners
and walked away. And she

352
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.910
was just left with us.
And now 20 years later,

353
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.250
my wife still talks about
this. She's like, and that's

354
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.280
when I realized how big
the world. Yeah. And how

355
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.500
all the same, not everyone
who looks like me as

356
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.410
my first name. Yep. And
not everybody who looks different

357
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.500
as an enemy. In fact,
most of my friends look

358
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.200
different than me and I,
and I enjoy that. Like

359
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.070
I, I enjoy diversity. Yeah.
And you, you wrote about

360
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.890
that as you kind of
go from place to place,

361
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.280
the demographic changes, you know,
it was, it was one

362
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.790
extreme when you were in
Alaska and there was another

363
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.670
extreme at home Depot and
then you're still at, in

364
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.820
Atlanta, but then you, you
show up at Google. Yeah.

365
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.380
Yeah. That was fun. People
don't believe me. When I

366
00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.570
tell this story about how
I got hired at Google,

367
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:05.180
this is in 2006. And
at that point, Google was

368
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.740
still putting ads on Craigslist.
So I had just discovered

369
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.110
Craigslist because you know, Craigslist
had been around for awhile

370
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.690
at that point. But you
know, it wasn't really big

371
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.730
in Atlanta and I'd heard
about it online. I was

372
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:17.990
like, well, let me check
this out. And so I'm

373
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.180
poking around on Craigslist and
I see this opening for

374
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.190
a job at Google and
I thought it was completely

375
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.110
fake. Like I just like,
that's not real, but you

376
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.010
answered it anyway. I sure
did. And I, you know,

377
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.740
I sent in my resume
and like a few months

378
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.470
later they contacted me and
I still was thinking, this

379
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.080
isn't real. This is fake.
You know? And I I'd

380
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.310
use one of my throwaway
email addresses, like In 2006,

381
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.230
you knew that it was
like, yeah, it's all lies.

382
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.670
Yeah. Yeah. Like Craigslist now,
funny hires on Craigslist, get

383
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.150
out here, be serious. But
yeah. So I responded to

384
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.280
an ad on Craigslist and
went through the whole interview

385
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.960
process, which was a lot
and ended up getting hired.

386
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.200
And, and could you believe
it was just like a

387
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.240
dream or does it like
being swept away? It wasn't

388
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.940
even a dream. Like I
never, I never dreamed of

389
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.520
working at Google because that
just seems so far off,

390
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.040
like Google was in California
and I'm in Atlanta. Like

391
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.730
I didn't expect Google to
have an office in Atlanta.

392
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.150
Yeah. So, no, it wasn't
a dream. It was just

393
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:21.270
like an unbelievable experience. Yeah.
And when you got that

394
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.790
though, it didn't, it didn't
seem like that was the

395
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.610
most diverse way a place
of thinking. Like it was,

396
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.880
even though it was in
Atlanta, it was not home

397
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.330
Depot. No, it was not
home Depot. Nope. It wasn't.

398
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:41.160
I think the sales side
was a little bit more

399
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.900
diverse than the inside engineering.
So yeah, the engineering side,

400
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.390
but engineering was, you know,
not, not diverse at all.

401
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.790
It was mostly homogenous. I
mean, there were some, I

402
00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:57.600
believe there were some, you
know, Hispanic people I believe.

403
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.510
But does that, would that
make you more comfortable if

404
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.490
you're a group, if you're
in a group and you're

405
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.860
the only black woman and
it's like 10 white guys

406
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.420
in you in that, let's
say a couple of you,

407
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.140
like you just said, well,
maybe a couple of Hispanic

408
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.660
people do, does, does any
Brown face in a storm

409
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.570
make you feel like, Oh,
that's okay. Like there's so

410
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.510
and so no, it doesn't
help. Does it? No, not

411
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.210
really. No. It's How do
you explain that sense of

412
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:26.010
isolation to a random white
dude? It's, it's hard to

413
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.170
explain, right? Like, cause you
try to, you try to

414
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.490
say, okay, imagine yourself being
amongst a group of black

415
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.560
people, but that's, that's not
the reality for it. Yeah.

416
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.870
Yeah. And, and you know,
still white dude being amongst,

417
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.630
amongst a group of black
people, like you still know

418
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.800
that somewhere else, you are
still the majority, That's the

419
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.540
prescription of the privilege. Isn't
it? You can always just,

420
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.870
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. I
thought I got it because,

421
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.550
Oh, you know, I've got
all these black friends and

422
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.130
hang out with black friends.
This is 15, 20 years

423
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:03.450
ago. But then I went
to Zimbabwe. Yeah. We stayed

424
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.510
there for awhile and I'm
on the street with my

425
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:11.220
wife and everyone is staring
at us like, cause what

426
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.880
is going on over there?
Okay. So then we tried

427
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.760
an experiment cause my wife
was cool like that. I

428
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.850
stepped into a, an alleyway,
so no one could see

429
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.340
me. And we just kind
of, I stood there for

430
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.500
five or 10 minutes and
we watched the street move

431
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:30.000
on. Right. And my wife
disappeared and she said, I've

432
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.070
disappeared. I'm invisible now. No
one is looking at me.

433
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.130
And then we switched. And
then I stood in the

434
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:39.360
middle of the street and
I'm in I'm 3000 miles

435
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.610
from home. And the government
is black. The police are

436
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.350
black. That was the closest
I could get. But even

437
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.330
then a month or two
later, I got on a

438
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.210
plane and I flew back
here. But that's the closest

439
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.660
I ever got to that
I'm not in Kansas anymore

440
00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.440
moment. And the, the only
way I can describe it

441
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.740
and is it, it pushed
on my eyes, it pushed

442
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.860
against the, you know, that
headache that you get right.

443
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.830
Between the eyes and underneath
your brow. And it's just

444
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.370
like, Oh, every day, like
I was looking for anybody

445
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.710
to give a nod to.
I understood what the nod

446
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.940
was about. Right. Just like
the look of recognition, right?

447
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.460
Just like I see you.
It was all white men

448
00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.710
across it. How are you
doing? He didn't want to

449
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.260
talk to me. He's old
Zimbabwe. And he didn't, I

450
00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.650
don't want to talk to
an American guy. Yeah. That,

451
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.040
that, that tension. What is
that? That it's, it's, it's

452
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.100
a stress, but just a
stress. Yes. It's a constant,

453
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.760
constant stress. And it's hard
to explain that level of

454
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.600
stress. Like it's stress is
a baseline, right? Like there's,

455
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.590
I don't remember a time
where I wasn't stressed it.

456
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.080
Is it a stress of
not being, being welcomed for

457
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.820
some, some white person might
be listening to this and

458
00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.670
be going, I don't get
it. Right. We like her.

459
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:56.410
She's great. She's got a
job. Why is she so

460
00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:04.450
stressed? It's not, not being
welcomed. It's it's just, I

461
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.760
don't, I don't want to
call this microaggressions because I

462
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.020
don't consider them aggressions. But
like, like you said, being

463
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.650
stared at like, when you're
standing in a building full

464
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.780
of people who don't look
like you and you know,

465
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.860
my desk and my building
before last was an, a

466
00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.270
major like walkway. Right. So
all the people walking by

467
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.720
right. Are just staring, just
staring at it. I mean,

468
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.990
granted I'm a six foot
tall black woman, so Sure.

469
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.500
And they're not staring like,
like, like, like in a,

470
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.540
she needs to leave kind
of way. Right. It's just

471
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:42.670
like, Oh, that's unexpected. Like,
Oh, Hey, This is like

472
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.920
a double-take. It's just like,
they walk. I'm like, Oh

473
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.030
yeah, Yeah. Like you're different.
And that's what it is.

474
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.270
It's like, I am different.
I, I, I cannot disappear.

475
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.930
I am always visible. I
do not have the luxury

476
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.020
of anonymity. Like if I'm
having a bad day, I

477
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.080
don't get to just like
hide. And I, you know,

478
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.440
I I'm always visible. Right.
Because if that day you

479
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.630
come to work with a
sour face, cause you're upset

480
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:11.050
about whatever, you know, your
cat sick, he comes and

481
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.320
they're like, Oh, she's pissed
off about something. Right. People

482
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.780
will read into that because
you're the only angry black

483
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:21.100
woman on that day. Black
woman. I hate that stereotype

484
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.560
tries me up the wall.
Don't you feel like when

485
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.570
you go to work, if
you're not happy, then people

486
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.020
are gonna look at you
and assume. Yeah. I don't

487
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.270
know if I don't. I
don't know if it's, if

488
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.410
I don't look happy, but
I know that I feel

489
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.390
like people are going to
assume that I'm the angry

490
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:44.550
black woman. If I say
things that are angry ish,

491
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.040
right? Like not necessarily negative,
but like, if I am

492
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.230
critical of something, it's just
like in the back of

493
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.910
my head, I'm like, are
they thinking that this is

494
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:56.100
angry black woman? Or are
they accepting my feedback as

495
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.770
a coworker? Yeah. I don't
know how to explain that.

496
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.320
But stereotype, stereotypes when stereotypes
are dangerous because they make

497
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.700
it easy to dismiss valid
feelings as stereotypes, let's say

498
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.010
something bad happened to the
bill. They broke the bill

499
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.870
and you get angry. They
can dismiss that valid technical

500
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.030
fact that they broke the
build and you're angry about

501
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.160
it and just say, Oh,
well, you know, angry, black

502
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.240
woman, there you go. Yeah.
Right. Or Whatever other drunk

503
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.910
Irish men or whatever stereotype
all you have to do

504
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.430
is meet that stereotype once.
And you've given an excuse

505
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.420
for people to minify you
Yeah. Into that stereotype. Yeah.

506
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.600
And then you lose it.
You lose your you're legit.

507
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.670
Yeah. And also a little
bit, I think of here

508
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:44.810
personhood, because you stopped being
a person and you become

509
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.840
the stereotype. Does that mean
It hard to remember who

510
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.790
you are? Do you have
to, like you go home

511
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:53.870
to remember who you are
Or no, I don't think

512
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.060
I go home to remember
who I am. I mean,

513
00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.530
to be honest, like here
there's, there's really not much

514
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.080
of a respite. Like that's
why the whole bit about

515
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.410
Oakland. Right? Cause when I
was in Oakland, it's like,

516
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.110
Oh, this is what it's
like to be in a

517
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.080
diverse environment. And again, like,
I don't mean just like

518
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.950
around black people. I mean
around everybody. Right? Like the

519
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.350
guy I was dating in
Oakland was a white guy

520
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.650
and his best friend was
Asian and you know, we

521
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.140
would hang out and it
was just like, you know,

522
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.710
rainbow coalition time, like Benetton
an ad. Like that's the

523
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.790
sort of diversity I like.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I, I

524
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.220
w I live in Portland,
which is not known for

525
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.970
being diverse, although there are
pockets, but when I was

526
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.340
in New York last week, and
every time I go to

527
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.230
New York, I'm like, why don't
I live in New York? Like,

528
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.060
this is where I'm supposed
to be. And that's where

529
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.910
I realized that the television
show friends was just complete

530
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:51.200
crap because they hung out
for eight years, five white

531
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.980
friends, and they never met
anybody of color at all.

532
00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:00.690
And they were in Manhattan
for like separation. Yup. Yup.

533
00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.770
Yup. But it, but it's
just like, and, and, and

534
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.420
the people who are listening,
who may have made it

535
00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.040
this far, but still think
that this is a bunch

536
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.780
of garbage it's that your
life is more full when

537
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.380
you have such a diverse
bunch of friends and you

538
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.350
might have all white friends,
but they might still be

539
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.990
diverse. You might have people
from other countries, other religions,

540
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:28.130
other cultures, you know, converted
Muslim, who knows, but they

541
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:33.170
are people with different Viewpoints.
Right. And yeah, that's really

542
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:37.340
important. And so, yeah, like
just being amongst, you know,

543
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:42.670
diverse people, diverse backgrounds, you
know, I really enjoy that.

544
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.940
So I would like to
have more of that since

545
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.090
my move to Oakland in
that future. So you are,

546
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.740
you've decided that Oakland is
where you want to live.

547
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.660
Oh yeah. Definitely. Like I
picked out a house I

548
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.020
want to buy. Awesome. Yeah.
It's weird. Because for a

549
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.570
long time, I say, I'm
not setting down roots in

550
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.180
the Bay area. It's ridiculous.
Like the home prices here

551
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.860
are too much, but like
Oakland is the first place.

552
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.460
I've felt a sense of
real community. Like I felt

553
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.320
at some in Atlanta, but
it was not like, it

554
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.950
didn't feel like home. It
feels like home. Right. And

555
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.140
it makes me watch it
live there. So yeah. I

556
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.380
picked out a house. Would
you do me a favor

557
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.160
and go to your, your
medium article? I will do

558
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.590
this. And would you read
that last paragraph for me

559
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.870
as we close, I will
do this also. I'm waiting

560
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:35.740
great to load. No worries.
Cause it was a powerful

561
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.630
article. And I think that
it said a lot and

562
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.640
it spoke to a lot
of people of all colors

563
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.810
and all creeds, but I
appreciated the last paragraph, particularly

564
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.500
I will read that for
you. I know that I

565
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.690
am not my job. I
am not my industry or

566
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.150
it's stereotypes am a black
woman who happens to work

567
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.250
in the tech industry. I
don't need to change to

568
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.770
fit within my industry. My
industry needs to change to

569
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.890
make everyone feel included and
accepted. And I meant that

570
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.860
about everyone. Like not just
me. I don't mean the

571
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.100
industry needs. It's just changed
to include and accept black

572
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.810
women. We need to include
and accept everyone. Everyone needs

573
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:15.790
to feel like they are
free to be their authentic

574
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:19.060
selves. And if we do
that, we will all be

575
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.660
better for it. Yes. Thank
you so much, Erica joy

576
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.760
for talking with me today.
Well thank you for having

577
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.240
me. I really enjoyed it.
This has been another episode

578
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:37.200
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week. <inaudible>.
