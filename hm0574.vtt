Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.110
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking

9
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.690
with Linda come out. She's
the lead developer at OSHA

10
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.690
Haiti, and one of the
cofounders at Akira chicks. And

11
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.180
she's talking to me from
Nairobi, Kenya. How are you?

12
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.210
Hi, how are you doing?
I'm great. I'm glad to

13
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.340
talk to you. I saw
you just a few weeks

14
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.400
ago and, and now with
the power of the internet,

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.980
we're having an interview that,
that I promised you that

16
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.350
we do. And I appreciate
you taking the time out

17
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.490
of your busy morning. No
worries. I'm happy to do

18
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.000
it. Cool. So you are
the lead developer at OSHA

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.190
Haiti, and you've been there
for quite a few years,

20
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.930
haven't you? Yeah, I have
actually turned seven in a

21
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.070
couple of weeks actually by
April 1st. Yeah. Yeah. Congratulations. Thank

22
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.820
you. Did you, did you
get that job out of

23
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.380
school or how did you
end up at <inaudible>? So

24
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.850
I was actually a volunteer
at Trisha Haiti when it

25
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.690
started in 2000 back in
2008, actually I say volunteering

26
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.090
it's seven eat. And that,
at that time I was

27
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.710
working, I was an intern
at an, at an organization

28
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.290
where we were just doing
web development. So just building

29
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.920
websites. And then after I,
at the same time, when

30
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.140
I was in that organization,
I was still doing my

31
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.690
undergraduate degree. And so after
graduating, I moved jobs and

32
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.400
Cora a junior developer position
in a company where we're

33
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.100
doing, we were building mobile
money application and biscuit competitor

34
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.190
for M-Pesa. And I didn't
even last there for long

35
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.740
because I was still contributing
to shady on my spare

36
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.860
time. And so that's when
shady poached me, Eric poached

37
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.950
me and got me to
join shady in 2010. Yeah.

38
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.250
That's Eric heard people who
started off OSHA, OSHA Haiti

39
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.750
mean Shady means testimony or
witnessing it's a Swahili word.

40
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.950
And so they gave basically
the citizen or the crowd

41
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.820
being able to report what
they're seeing based on a

42
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.330
scenario. For instance, during an
election, people being able to

43
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.720
send in SMS is saying
either one they've gone, they've

44
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.200
gone to their polling station
and found that either there

45
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.540
are no ballot boxes or
the petition is not opened.

46
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.750
So basically giving the crowd
the power to actually report

47
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.940
what they see that and
relying on mainstream journalism. Wow.

48
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.160
That sounds like something that
would be useful, not just

49
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.900
in Kenya or other countries
using it. Yeah. We have

50
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.700
a, we actually, we we've
deployed the platform in more

51
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.860
than I think a hundred
countries now. And it's translated,

52
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.020
it's translated into about 50
languages are different languages because

53
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.790
of our different places like
French and opportunities and such

54
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.700
kind. And so it's useful
and it's been used for

55
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.980
different things. For instance, I
lectured mapping the crisis in

56
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.300
Syria reporting on, I mean,
simple things like mapping out

57
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.220
the bugger places in Atlanta,
the best burger places, like

58
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.460
find things like Louis. And
then even just, I think

59
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.790
also for people who are
doing schools have used it

60
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.790
to actually be able to
teach students on the power

61
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.030
of processing and tools like
that, that are being used

62
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.600
to give, to make people
raise their voices. So yeah,

63
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.460
it's been used in like
all manners of scenarios, but

64
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.860
I think the main one
is mainly crisis and electrons.

65
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.190
Those are the two main
areas that we've seen the,

66
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.230
it being mostly used. Like
right now. I think you've

67
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.370
seen a deployment of people
trying to map out the

68
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.280
drought, the drought that is
in Somalia. And that's about

69
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.490
to turn into actually a
farming and even like the

70
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.120
crisis in Syria, that one
is still running till now.

71
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.000
It's the longest running deployment
of Shahidi. I mean, I

72
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.800
think Syria has been going
on for a very long

73
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.750
time. So yeah, those are
the kind of use cases

74
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.130
that you've seen come up.
Wow. It seems to me,

75
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.920
just from a historical perspective,
it's one of the first

76
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.270
really successful examples of crowdsourcing.
Isn't it getting, getting lots

77
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.720
of incredibly valuable data into
one place from the power

78
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.020
of the crowd? Yes, yes,
actually. And I think that's

79
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.070
why it's been used really
widely cause it's very easy

80
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.250
to just get information from
people from just the basic

81
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.310
thing that everybody has a
mobile phone, where they just

82
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.890
send an SMS and they
can be able to actually

83
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.350
contribute to let's say election
or a crisis. So just,

84
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.550
I think using with the
power that everybody has, it

85
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.740
is basically the, the handset
respect, whether it's a smartphone

86
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.410
or a feature phone, you
know, like I think that's

87
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.970
how it, that's why it
has been one of the

88
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.550
most successful because you don't
get people to go looking

89
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.190
for other tools to be
able to like use it.

90
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.480
How do the feature phone
people talk to Shahidi with

91
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.660
SMS? Is it a structured
text message? Do they know

92
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.150
how to send commands or
do you have to parse

93
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.380
it? Somehow? Most of the
times we ask people to

94
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.590
go ahead and like we
w when we're doing an

95
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.590
election, we have to look
for instance, in Kenya, the

96
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.830
coming election is in August.
So what would be, what

97
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.790
we've been doing is trying
to get people. We communicate

98
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.040
a lot of marketing by
communicating to protect them. If

99
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.600
you're going to send an
SMS, make sure it has

100
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.410
a location or where you
are at and disclose their

101
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.610
message. So we tell people
just to say like, Oh,

102
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.180
the position is not open
incubator. So you don't just

103
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.610
say position is not open.
Just say polling station is

104
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.920
open in Kibera, but we
do. We still do receive

105
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.180
people who just say <inaudible>,
so what you've done, then

106
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.590
a message threading behind the,
the platform. And so we

107
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.660
are able to actually have
a conversation with the people

108
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.330
behind suppose you have administrators
who are receiving the raw

109
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.560
data in translate, translating that
into posts. So the people

110
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.600
who are doing that, they
actually go head back and

111
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.920
forth with the person and
go like, so where are

112
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.250
you reporting out? And they'll
say Kibera, or say Kibera

113
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.670
irony. And so they are
able to map out and

114
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.660
see that that's Kibera irony,
and actually put an, be

115
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.940
able to put, decide at
posts with, with a map

116
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.040
on it, with a marker
on it, on them up.

117
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.870
Oh, wow. Yeah. That sounds
like an opportunity for some

118
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.300
kind of a bot framework.
Right now you say you

119
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.120
have a human talking sometimes
to them to get more

120
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.370
detail, you could teach it
bot. Yeah, I think that's,

121
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.540
that's one of the things
that we've been thinking about

122
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.760
for a longest time ever.
I think resource wise has

123
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.800
been constrained, but I think
it's one of the things

124
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.500
that we are hoping with
time. We can actually just

125
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.680
figure out and be able
to come up with yeah.

126
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.260
A that can actually help
us figure that out. Cause

127
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.260
it's really like, like it's
really time consuming. And also

128
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.630
you have to have a
lot of, we have to

129
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.270
recruit volunteers like for the
Kenyan election right now we

130
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.810
started recruiting volunteers and such
training them on how to

131
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.140
like do the whole mapping
of reports and or posts.

132
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.660
And that means that we
will have to incur cost

133
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.400
of the fact that during
that day of the election,

134
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.650
you have to host them
like in a space in

135
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.390
a city, what you call
the situation room. You have

136
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.030
to make sure there's food,
there's all that stuff. So

137
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.690
it's more like it's actually
becomes a whole activity because

138
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.570
I think as they always
say, tech is 10%, humans

139
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.360
is 90%. I think we
really have the 90% alert.

140
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.020
Yeah. Sounds like it. Well,
how about after we're done

141
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.780
on the podcast, I'll try
to connect you to the

142
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.930
people who use the Microsoft
bot framework. Maybe they can

143
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.900
help you do that work
without you having to write

144
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.690
that part. Oh yeah. That
would be great. All right.

145
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.980
Cool. So you are the
lead dev now at OSHA

146
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.310
Haiti. And when you started,
you said that you were

147
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.100
kind of a junior developer.
Now you're a senior, you're

148
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.140
the boss you, the boss
have. Yes. I mean, the

149
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.600
fact that I've been here
a long time and I

150
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.960
mean, I've seen, we've worked
on version two of our

151
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.350
platform. That's after the first
one, the first, the first

152
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.200
one was basically the legacy
one was mainly actually on

153
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:45.430
ESP. <inaudible> actually vb.net. And
so when we transitioned to

154
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.550
a PHP and that was
our version two, which is

155
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.660
what as been running for
the longest time ever. But

156
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.920
I led that one. And
then after that started building,

157
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.110
I only version, which is
the version three of the

158
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.800
platform. And so still part
of it. And then at

159
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.640
the same time I took
a step. Like I, I

160
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.460
kinda stayed, I'm done working
on platform. I need something

161
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.230
else new. And so sorry,
I'm working on a new,

162
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.750
on a new product that
we're doing. It's called roll

163
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.930
call. And it's basically a
checking tool during emergencies. So

164
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.750
that's what I been leading
now and still working with

165
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.070
the plant with the rest
of the devs on the

166
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.110
platform team. So yeah. Okay.
So OSHA Hedy has the

167
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.820
Crowdmap product and the older
Swift river, and now one

168
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.630
called roll call. So Swift
river actually is legacy. We

169
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.400
are no longer working on
it or supporting it. I

170
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.710
think it's anyone who just
gets it. They can go

171
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.120
ahead and work on it.
And then Crowdmap, you're sunsetting

172
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.660
Crowdmap because with a new
platform, we are moving to

173
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.140
it's, we're moving everything. That's
on, Crowdmap into the new

174
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.680
platform, the V3 one, which
is <inaudible> IO. So we

175
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.930
are also going to be
sunsetting Crowdmap and now it

176
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.150
will be, which I hated
at IO because it's a

177
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.150
new, it's newer and there's
not so much support of

178
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.670
the old one we to
which trauma is on vitro.

179
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.060
So we are transitioning everyone
into B three. Nice. Okay.

180
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.940
So you're, you've really, you've
really gone from building, if

181
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.590
I may, an app to
now a platform and this

182
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.650
platform is what everything else,
that's the future of your,

183
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.010
of your whole system. Yes,
exactly. Very cool. And then

184
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.810
roll call. People can look@itatrollcall.io.
And this is for like,

185
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.990
you know, people checking in,
did they land safely? Are

186
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:31.250
they okay? Is everyone okay
in an emergency? Yes, exactly.

187
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.260
And I think one of
the biggest use cases that

188
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.750
we've seen from Bronco or
the people who have been

189
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:40.280
asking for it to actually
embassies, because being able to

190
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.510
like check on their people
when something happens, lecturing, Westcott

191
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.930
here in, when it happened,
when roll call was born,

192
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.110
things are born out of
crisis. And so yeah, when

193
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.880
you ask it happened, that's
when roll call was born.

194
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.310
And I think for, for
us, we remember the Swedish

195
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.500
embassy going, like, it'd be
really nice to have something

196
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.050
like this when it happened,
because it was very hard

197
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.620
to tell with our people,
we're actually like a West

198
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.330
kid. So to be nice,
if we could have sent

199
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.120
a blast message instead of
like sending emails, cause not

200
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.480
everybody reads emails on their
phones, emails, most people actually

201
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.490
end up reading them on
their computers. And especially on

202
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.340
a weekend, people actually own
just on their phone. So

203
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.720
to not be nice if
they could have sent a

204
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.680
blast and just checked on
anyone, everyone, and being, be

205
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.920
able to at least account
for most of the Swedish

206
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.640
people. And so from that,
we realized actually, it's, it's

207
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.460
the people who need action.
People who are really working

208
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.300
with bigger groups of people
and in, in, in crisis

209
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.790
prone countries like the UN
working in Somalia and in

210
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.590
the different places where the
environment is volatile. So yeah.

211
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.080
So roll call was born
out of that end. Currently,

212
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.590
actually we are doing our
tests without some flustered and

213
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.810
getting more feedback cause we've
just put out the alpha

214
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.960
and then based on that,
then we should be able

215
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.710
to actually roll out if
possibly in the media, meet

216
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.250
the beta, meet, meet this
year with some users. And

217
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.040
yeah, so roll call is
more a paid paid application

218
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.060
or platform actually. And so,
so it's not more on

219
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.390
the free version. Like the
platform is, so platform is

220
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.990
both free and we have
a SAS model, but we

221
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.930
can actually download any song
from yourself, but we haven't

222
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.000
done that for roll call
dev and open source TTL.

223
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.430
We will with time. But
I think we're just starting

224
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.190
out with people who can
actually clients who can actually

225
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.820
just go ahead and pay
up for it. So the

226
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.310
way we actually built both
roll call and platform, we're

227
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.310
trying to use the same
stock. And so currently we

228
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.970
can actually switch developers from
any of the two different

229
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.550
platforms. So you can, a
developer can be in roll

230
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.250
call the next two weeks
and conversion platform. The next

231
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.350
they are the next two
weeks like that, like that.

232
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.510
Cause at least we are
trying to making sure that

233
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.370
we have the same stack
when, when building their platforms.

234
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.520
That's, that's actually a really
good opportunity for us to

235
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.640
pivot the conversation because you
wanted to tell me kind

236
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.760
of how you, how you
came up in, in software

237
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.370
and how you kind of
learned software became a developer

238
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.940
and you just described, you
know, not just the growing

239
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.310
up of your stack, but
the way that you grew

240
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.730
as a software architect, like
you've now helped build and

241
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.300
architect a stack that many
people can use. People can

242
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.210
be easily migrated from one
product to the other. You

243
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.120
know, that's not, that's not
junior developer stuff. You learned

244
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.510
that with your coworkers and
your teammates over the last,

245
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.410
you know, almost decade of
writing software, that's being used

246
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.300
by, I don't know, millions
of people. How did this

247
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.000
all start? Where did you,
where did you start in

248
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.670
software? I actually started in
high school. So when I

249
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.520
was in high school, when
we joined what we call

250
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.710
form one here, which is,
I think grid, I'm not

251
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.100
sure there's nine or something,
but so the, when you

252
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.920
join form one, the school
I went to boarding school.

253
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.980
And so there were computers,
but there were those old

254
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.010
computers, people just use the
computer room to just learn

255
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.380
typing tutor, like just be
able to learn typing tutor.

256
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.170
But by the time it
was from two, they had

257
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.420
a new computer lab and
they had put up new

258
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.330
new computers. And so we
actually did have classes that

259
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.330
we used to go in
on computers. And so it

260
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.000
got, I got interested cause
it was, I really loved

261
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.100
the fact that like the
teacher would show us some

262
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.260
code and I'm like, that's
interesting that doesn't sound like

263
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.490
English. Neither does it sound
like it's really neither does

264
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.020
it sound like my mother
tag, but I think I'm

265
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.650
interested in learning. Like it
really like the numbers and

266
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:43.560
the whole logic thinking really
intrigued me and I, as,

267
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.220
as me, I'm actually, I
love, I really love mathematics

268
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.580
and physics. So having another
thing on top of each

269
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.720
course, I was really happy
about it. So in school

270
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.610
we used to choose the
subjects we do when you

271
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.830
get to form two and
nobody used to choose computers

272
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.010
like anyone who you to
computers was because when they

273
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.320
were pushed out of the
other subjects by the teachers.

274
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.570
And so they had no
option, but to just take

275
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.300
computers, cause people used to
go like, it's hard, it's

276
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.760
hard, it's hard. And it's
actually girls it's even worse

277
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.610
because we have this mission
that it's it's, it's something

278
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.250
hard. It's, it's a man's
world. So we, people never

279
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.410
actually used to take it
up. I actually signed up

280
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.250
for the competing club and
the computing subjects and the

281
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.080
teachers were like, what you
could, you know, you could

282
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.920
actually Excel in commerce. And
I'm like, no, I think

283
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.810
I want to do commerce
business is not my thing.

284
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.760
When it comes to that,
like I will do business

285
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.610
with just pass the exam
and that's it. So I

286
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.210
took up computers and informed
to actually I was busy

287
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.880
doing projects for the phone
force. The guys who are

288
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.680
like to wait two years
ahead of me when they

289
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.080
were doing their final projects,
they'll come and I'll hit

290
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.600
them out. Well, I'd get
like, you know, these kids,

291
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.430
you know, you know, getting
these kids in school was

292
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.760
hard. So at least I
could get whiskeys or someone

293
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.370
would offer to do my
laundry because I've done their,

294
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.910
their code or worked on
their project. And so that's,

295
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.420
my interest was fiscally sparked
in school and I knew

296
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.450
I wanted to do computers
irrespective. And after even coming

297
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.220
out of school and joining
into joining university, they actually,

298
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.340
so we select universities and
the courses that you want

299
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.560
to take up. And then
based on the Ingrid that

300
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.090
you get, the they'll actually
choose who joins what? Because

301
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.060
the cutoff points for each
of them. And so I

302
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.150
was thrown into doing a
bachelor of science, bachelor of

303
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.020
commerce. And I actually refused
to join the school. I

304
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.280
was like, there's no way
I was going to do

305
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.380
bachelor of commerce. I tried
getting them to change it,

306
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.900
to give me a bachelor
of science in computer science.

307
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.930
But they say that the
cut off points are not

308
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.270
admit a cup of cutoff
point actually missed the cutoff

309
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.350
point with just two points.
And so Do you think,

310
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.840
do you think that that
was because of your gender,

311
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.310
that they were pushing you?
Like you said that they

312
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.160
were pushing you at the
beginning and here, here, they're

313
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.190
trying to steer you into
a degree that you don't

314
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.850
want. Yeah. I think I
still think that was the

315
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.490
case. Because even when you
look at still, till today,

316
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.310
when you look at the
enrollments for computer science degrees,

317
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.920
they are more male than
the no male and female.

318
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.310
And it's not that the
female don't actually Excel at

319
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.650
last year's results. The female
are the ones who are

320
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.290
leading, but even by the
time they are giving the

321
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.560
they're giving out the, the
courses they'll push the ladies

322
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.600
to the less in, in
quotes, hard stuff. So they'll

323
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.720
become us and all that.
So they cannot push people.

324
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.970
The David is more on
that side rather than pushing

325
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.940
them on the engineering side.
Do you think that they're

326
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.400
doing this consciously, do you
think the men in the

327
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.160
department are just trying to
cause trouble? Or do you

328
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.220
think that they just don't
understand that? Like they can't

329
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.310
believe how talented women developers
can be? Like, I'm trying

330
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.560
to understand the root of
it. I don't think they

331
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.500
understand that actually women can
actually be real good or

332
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.950
engineers, so it's not done
consciously, but I think they

333
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.950
just, it's just a culture
problem. Actually we'll start there

334
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.220
where most people have believed
that women should be taking

335
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.040
the softer skills, you know,
and men should be the

336
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.550
ones being encouraged to get
into a competing lift. For

337
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.560
instance, at home, when I
was growing up, we were

338
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.390
just doing our family, me
and my brother and my

339
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.540
brother is older than me.
And I'd see him like

340
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.990
try a taxi radio and
try like play around with

341
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.540
it. And I think he'd
fix things when things are

342
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.090
not working. And so I'll
go like, even me, I

343
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.850
can try it and I'm
like, let's work together and

344
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.920
you could try it. You
could see it from my

345
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.470
mom's side that anytime anything
was breaking in the house,

346
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.060
it was my brother to
fix it. I know there's

347
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.890
a time. I was like,
I can also fix it.

348
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.060
So it's basically a culture
problem that people think that

349
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.640
they, women are meant to
be doing this softer skills

350
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.230
than, than the men should
be thrown in the hardest

351
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.280
side. They had a, stuff's
going to engineering and, and,

352
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.050
and computing and all that.
Yeah. When you were doing

353
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.140
your under, when your degree,
your form one through four,

354
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.960
did you didn't you become
tired weren't you just like,

355
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.840
ah, forget it. I'll just
do something else because it

356
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.960
sounds like you fought every
step of the way. Yeah,

357
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.920
I think it's, I think,
I think my, there were

358
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:07.370
people telling me, well, my
temperament is actually, I'm a

359
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.850
choleric and I do not
give up. There's one thing

360
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.130
I don't do is that
I, I push and push

361
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.640
and I think that spirit
or that kind of the

362
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.730
traits is basically what gets
me going. So even in

363
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.030
school, like I didn't give
up. And in fact, because

364
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.690
of that, then the computer
science, the computer studies teacher

365
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.390
had an interest in me,
the fact that I was

366
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.360
able to write code more,
cause in a normal day

367
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.880
people, cause it was very
hard for portrayed code. The

368
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.520
teacher will actually do three
quarters of the code and

369
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.470
then just tell the person
to finish up. But I

370
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.950
ended up doing even extra
and he would question some

371
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.290
of what he wrote. So
I think he got curious

372
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.350
and he actually ended up
having to go ask the

373
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.740
principal to exclude me from
any extracurricular activities. And I

374
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.200
was in like my last
year, because there's like this

375
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.810
one, this one just needs
to write code. That's all

376
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.700
she just wants. And she
was to concentrate and finish

377
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.860
and get her project and
actually did pass. Cause I

378
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.320
got an a as straight
A's in my computer studies

379
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.420
and that's because he had
seen that I really, really

380
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.670
wanted to do so. And
even after coming into school

381
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.810
before joining like a mainstream
university, I think I just

382
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.150
spend my time going to
the cafe. Cause I didn't

383
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.010
own a computer of myself.
I come from a really

384
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.990
humble background. So that time
my mom was not able

385
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.930
to buy me a computer.
And so I used to

386
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.870
just go like, I, I
I'll I'll, I'll tell her

387
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.380
I'll clean the house and
clean the dishes, but she'll

388
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.630
pay me. And then the
money she pays me is

389
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.130
actually to go to the
cyber. So I'd wake up

390
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.660
very early in the morning
when everyone else is going

391
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.960
to work and school and
I'll clean up and then

392
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.690
get my money just like
a hundred shillings is like,

393
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.990
I dunno, it's like how
much? It's like $1 and

394
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.750
then just go to the
cyber cyber cafe and just

395
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.010
spent like half my day
there with my diskettes. Cause

396
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.990
that time you were using
disgust to store our work

397
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.660
with my disgrace on my
project, I did in school

398
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.600
and just go try, like
improve it and just make

399
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.000
it much better. Cause that's
so that's how I spent

400
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.150
my time actually, before I
actually joined normal uni learning

401
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:06.580
university. So the, the, the
choices that I had, I

402
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.250
mean, I think my mom
allowed me to just like

403
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.830
be me and not force
me to things. Although her

404
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.130
relatives are the opposite where
my uncle was like, what

405
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.920
is computers? What are you
doing? What is computers? You're

406
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.500
just learning typing. You should
do that. And maybe you

407
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.710
just do something like CPA
and ACC. I was like,

408
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.830
guys, I didn't even do
business in school. Like why

409
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.660
would you want me to
go do business? It's like,

410
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.340
no, no, no. You should
be like, your aunt was

411
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.920
done up to CPA. CPAK
I was like, yeah, Africa

412
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.280
is it's hard and it's
not me. So let's just

413
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.610
be so, but my mom
is a little bit easy

414
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.650
and she was like, I
see what's what's coming from.

415
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.350
And then also my brother,
my brother had just done

416
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.620
a diploma in it and
I think he knew and

417
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.660
saw what was going on.
So he was more of

418
00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.210
a support system to me
and telling my mom how

419
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.420
valuable computers were. So I
think I had support at

420
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.400
least from that side. And
that's how I ended up

421
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.920
actually choosing what I did.
And I ended up doing

422
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.420
just drumming in school. Like
there was some other courses,

423
00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.970
but not so many. So
I didn't even concentrate on

424
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.640
them. And yeah, by the
time I was actually getting

425
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.800
into my final year and
I had the internship and

426
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.530
was doing an internship and
at the same time doing

427
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.860
my final year isn't even
in class student and then

428
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.610
grew into that into a
junior developer and then finally

429
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.950
good Pottsville shady. So yeah.
So, so what are you

430
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.700
doing to make it easier
for the next women? I

431
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.530
know that we should, Haiti
is one of the things

432
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.510
that you do, but Akira
checks is also something that's

433
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.240
important to you that will
hopefully make the experience for

434
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.720
the next young woman in
Kenya. Not so much, not

435
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.290
so difficult. Yeah. So we
realized, so when I was

436
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.810
working a specified, before I
joined the Shahidi, I was

437
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.230
working with in a company
where we were sharing an

438
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.320
office space with an organization,
another organization. So they're just

439
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.460
two, it companies sharing office
space and my own, my

440
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.070
company, the one we had,
we had several ladies. Yes.

441
00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:03.180
But most of them are
doing design as marketing. So

442
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.400
I was still the one
who was coding. And so

443
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.310
when we had a joint
event with the other company

444
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.800
that our company was this
full of men, like I

445
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.510
think you could count the
number of women. There were

446
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.190
like two or three. And
when you ask them the

447
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.340
why finance. So when we
used to go for lunch,

448
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.130
they used to, and we're
like really ask like what,

449
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.050
what do you guys do?
There was, I think that

450
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.990
most of us were actually
doing marketing or design or

451
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.360
such kind of things until
one day when you had

452
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.640
a joint event and they
came to us side of

453
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.930
the office only to find
us to the black screen.

454
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.310
Cause we were working online
next then. So then like

455
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.040
what you guys are programmers
is like, yeah, we are

456
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.720
actually developers. And I was
like, Oh, so actually people

457
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.090
still do not know that
women can actually be software.

458
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.200
So we're like, okay, how
do we change this whole

459
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.530
I'm thinking that only men
can actually be in the

460
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.900
software world. And so we
started thinking about it and

461
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.850
realize that the problem is,
is farfetched is from when

462
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.310
we are taking careers or
choosing our subjects in school.

463
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.150
So we decided why not
start out doing outreaches in

464
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.750
schools and girls schools and
showing them opportunities that are

465
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.750
there in the, in the
engineering world, in Biscayne STEM,

466
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.780
basically because people do career
fairs in school, but they

467
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.410
used to just bring in
doctors, lawyers, you know, such

468
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.440
the other professions, but nobody
ever brought in anyone in

469
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.910
STEM, in engineering, in March,
in statistics, anything in computing,

470
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.880
nobody ever brought anyone to
just speak to the students

471
00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.670
and show them what are
the outcomes, what careers are

472
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.310
there. And so we decided
we'll actually be doing the

473
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.700
outreach ourselves. So we currently
are doing outreaches in, in

474
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.010
Dallas schools and at the
outreach is a little bit

475
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.670
different. It's just not about
talking. We actually do a

476
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:47.780
hands on trainings. So we
go into their high schools

477
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.120
and tap into their clubs.
So we have all schools

478
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.790
have clubs. So which are
usually about an hour and

479
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.000
a half or 45 minutes.
And so during the clubs,

480
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.190
we have a curriculum that
you've developed where we'll either

481
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:03.470
train you in Python development,
we'll train you in graphic

482
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.640
design or we do adrenal
programming. So just showing you

483
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.820
what exactly the tech, what
looks like. And with that,

484
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.550
I've been seeing more girls
coming out and actually taking

485
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.180
up courses in computers other
than just going into economics

486
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.720
or law or medicine, medicinal,
SAS kind of things. Yeah.

487
00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.130
How do the girls feel
when they show up? Are

488
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.670
they young enough where they
don't feel like it's unusual

489
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.280
for girls to be doing
computers or have they already

490
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.250
at the age, they come
in have been told by

491
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.360
their parents, they shouldn't be
doing computers. So we, when

492
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.640
we worked with the Guzman,
Sarama the age of, let's

493
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.940
say 15 and 16 year
olds. So by then I

494
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.330
think people love excluding, especially
with the way the world

495
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.610
has been changing. So now
people lives with being exposed

496
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:53.590
to tech in, from lab
computers, to phones, tablets, and

497
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.710
such kind of things. So
they come in knowing that

498
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.290
yeah, those things work, but
most of the times they

499
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.800
are like, they're like, I'm
also sure how that will

500
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.960
work in Australia. My parents
will allow me to actually

501
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.320
venture into that. And so
what we do is actually

502
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.390
just trying, showing them that
you do love playing this

503
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.450
game. Okay, fantastic. Institu, how
to make your own game.

504
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.870
And that, that at least
generates curiosity. And they actually

505
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.840
were like, I can make
my own game and they

506
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.490
have wild ideas. So when
you start showing them, they

507
00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.820
can actually turn the ideas
into something. You start seeing

508
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.900
them opening up their minds
and actually being interested. And

509
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.940
at the end of it,
all he was saying, I'm

510
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.180
going to do mechatronics. I'm
going to do second of

511
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.670
things. This being the fact
that you've, you've, you've shown

512
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.310
them that whatever the ideas
are, can be turned into

513
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:44.790
applications or systems based on
them, just learning and being

514
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:47.910
able to actually do it
themselves. And so we thought,

515
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.580
yeah, the other biggest problem
is actually the parents, the

516
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.420
parents, especially if your parent
is not up to par

517
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.630
with what's going on in
the, in the industry, like

518
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.700
at least trying to keep
a know what's going on

519
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.190
in the tech industry. Most
parents tend to think that

520
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.070
you need to work hard
to actually become a doctor.

521
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.860
Like being a doctor is
really like prestigious in this

522
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.250
country. Like you viewed like,
yay. But this, it is

523
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.590
hard to do five years
in school. Like in like

524
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.650
six years in universities, I
had thing. So it's prestigious

525
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.080
and parents value that. Like
even when you listen to

526
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.080
parents talking, they're like, Oh
yeah, my, yeah, my daughter

527
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.410
is a doctor. You know?
And that that's, that's like

528
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.500
their pride. Like, they're very
proud of that. But nobody

529
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.870
says, Oh, my daughter is
an engineer is a computer

530
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.960
engineer or a computer server,
a software developer like that's

531
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.790
does, it's not viewed as
something prestigious, but, but he's

532
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.410
part of the book. But
for the parents who are

533
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.400
keeping up with what's, the
changing technology actually do realize

534
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.120
that it's really prestigious being
in the software world. And

535
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.760
we've changed that we've been
trying to change that notion.

536
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.000
Cause like even my mom
now, my mom didn't, they

537
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.030
never used to understand what
I do, but now she

538
00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.040
has a problem. She just
calls me, you know, you

539
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.990
should speak to this today.
You should speak to this

540
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.850
person. I'm like, no, the
person who's just have to

541
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.100
liquid talking to all those
kids who want to do

542
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.470
computer science and just tell
them how amazing it is.

543
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.990
So I think with time,
at least we are trying

544
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.900
to change the mindset of
the parents. And I think

545
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.960
that's, that's our biggest problem.
At least those kids know

546
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.680
that competing has a lot
of potential and they can

547
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.780
actually be it. So the
problem now is with the

548
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.930
parents. But I think with
time and as people are

549
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.030
growing and we've seen even
with our kids outreach, cause

550
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.340
we do a kids outreach
and we see parents calling

551
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.080
in us. You guys don't
have anything you're writing for

552
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.790
the kids that really want
to have my kid know

553
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.550
how to program as like,
well, that's good. It was

554
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.250
not so many come back
asking for that. Mainly mainly

555
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.080
it's like, we have to
really struggle to explain to

556
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.120
them why they should go.
But now we're seeing more

557
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.850
parents coming in asking what
can they keep doing? Which

558
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.210
I think is, is, is
that it's a nice way

559
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.090
of changing how things are
done, especially in terms of

560
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:56.360
choosing careers for children. Do
you think that the existence

561
00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.670
of smartphones versus feature phones
and the parents seeing and

562
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:05.420
using smartphones is part of
the thing that is allowing

563
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:10.610
them to, to understand like
what software, what software is

564
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.230
like, Oh, this is a
game I like to play

565
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.230
on my, on my little
phone and my now my

566
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.080
child can make this game
too. Yeah. I think that's

567
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.490
contributing alert. And like for
instance, WhatsApp, WhatsApp is revolutionary

568
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.430
in, in here. And so
when you try to explain

569
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.080
to a point like, actually
that, that one, you don't

570
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.030
load it. I didn't come
with a phone. That means

571
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:33.260
someone actually believes that. And
then now you installed in

572
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.810
you're using it. So that
being able to understand that

573
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.090
actually people a building, these
are young people, they are

574
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:42.760
not like, whatever, like crazy
people like the guys at

575
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.940
NASA or something like that.
So he's actually just normal

576
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.280
person like me. And you
can actually just write code

577
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.680
and come up with an
application that makes every communication

578
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.120
very easy. And especially in
the side of this era.

579
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.090
So like it's quite, I
think that's the internet, the

580
00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.580
fact that there's a lot
of changing things in the

581
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.930
technology industry, it's actually giving
them hope that, Hey, my

582
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.900
kid could actually be a
computer scientist, so yeah. And

583
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.760
giving them that option. So
Yeah. So as, as we

584
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.450
close our conversation, let me
ask you this. You're the

585
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.510
lead developer at OSHA, Haiti,
have any of the young

586
00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.380
women that you've worked with
at Kira chicks gone on

587
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.430
to work and software engineers?
Oh yes. We have a

588
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:32.370
very, very many of the
students who've graduated about 104

589
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.600
from, or our training program.
And so we've seen most

590
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.050
does actually join companies. We've
had some working at general

591
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.620
electric and then we have
some who are working at

592
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.050
some of the smaller startups
here in Kenya and even

593
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.320
SMEC in Kenya. So you
learned and Papa and even

594
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.690
a break, we have some
one who's working at brick.

595
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:55.560
And so we've, we love
the fact that we're seeing

596
00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.090
the numbers increase. They might
be small, but at least

597
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:04.590
we're seeing more women getting
into like the HUD stuff,

598
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.500
you know, such kind of
things like being able to

599
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.830
actually go ahead and write
code and be brave enough

600
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.010
to apply for jobs as
software developers and not just

601
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.640
getting is a normal it
officer and all that stuff.

602
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:21.210
Yeah. That's fantastic. Well, I'm
so glad to have chatted

603
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.510
with you today and people
can find you on, on

604
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.130
Twitter. They can check out
Cura chicks, a K I

605
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:35.550
R a C H I
x.com and OSHA, Haiti, and

606
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.480
also roll call@rollcall.io. This is
a great application. And I

607
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.180
love that. It says on
that website, you didn't know

608
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.490
you needed this tool. Neither
did we. It is a

609
00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.430
great tool that I think
maybe people don't realize that

610
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.990
they need. Yes. Very cool.
Thanks so much for chatting

611
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.300
with me today. Thank you
so much for having me.

612
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.260
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

613
00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.370
you again next week.
