developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.910
number 515. In this episode,
Scott explores the creative process

11
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.330
with comic creator and musician
fr Richardson. Hi, this is

12
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.240
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hanselminutes today. I

13
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.670
have the pleasure of talking
with a fuller Richardson. She's

14
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.880
a comic artist and a
musician and many, many, many

15
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.250
creative things. I'm so happy
to be chatting with you

16
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.350
today. Thanks for having me.
I first learned about you

17
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.170
when I was recommended that
I buy a copy of

18
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.410
genius, which is one of
your books that was done.

19
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.300
I think through top cow
comics. Absolutely. Yes, it's a,

20
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.450
a six issue mini series
written by Mark Bernard and Adam Freeman

21
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.830
about a 17 year old
tactical genius. That's born in

22
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.760
South central Los Angeles, Tactical
genius. So she's a, she's

23
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.350
like a savant. She is
beyond our abilities. She's a

24
00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.890
war strategist basically. And living
in South central in one

25
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.950
of the most dangerous parts
of the United States, it's almost

26
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.960
impractical. Like what application would
someone have, maybe a Hannibal,

27
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.530
someone who's born into a
war or a, a conquering

28
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.280
civilization would have an application
for that, but she sees

29
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.340
the possibilities. She sees the
probability and in growing up

30
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.980
in a, in an area
like I grew up in

31
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.700
Harlem, so I could relate
to the character. And my

32
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.590
dad's a physicist. When you
grow up in the hood,

33
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.150
it's almost a, what's the
word. It doesn't pay to

34
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.180
be smart. Basically. It's looked,
it looks, it's looked down

35
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.310
upon, It's an anachronism. It's
just like, wait a second.

36
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.290
You're not supposed to, that's
not, that's not the role

37
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.020
that we all assign. Well,
and it's not even something

38
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.040
that's externally happening from someplace
else. It's sort of within

39
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.380
the community itself. If I
speak properly, then I'm trying

40
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.720
to speak like a white
girl. I'm like, I'm not

41
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.490
trying to speak like anything.
This is just how I

42
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.880
speak. But if, if you're
a kid and you're growing

43
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.730
up like this, it's almost
it's looked at as if

44
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.340
you're doing it to slight
them. So she, the character

45
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.050
hid her intelligence. She would
intentionally Mark her papers wrong

46
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.250
because being smart, just didn't
pay. You get beat up.

47
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.770
You get made fun of
and standing out in a

48
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.640
situation where there are a
lot of broken homes, broken

49
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.340
families, broken philosophies means you're,
you'll be targeted and it's

50
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.770
not worth it. And she,
she uses this strategy first

51
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.080
behind the scenes. And then
in the front of the

52
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.090
scenes, when people start to
realize that there's a new

53
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.920
player in town and starts
moving chess pieces around, Absolutely.

54
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.190
She goes through a couple
of transformation, sorry for spoilers.

55
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.730
But she, she starts to
see that everyone's kind of

56
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.640
being engineered on the police
side. They're sort of being

57
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.760
used, you know, good one
men and women being used

58
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.690
as dogs of the state
to socially engineer people into

59
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.280
being cannon fodder for a
prison industrial complex. So people

60
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.170
are being pitted against each
other and they just end

61
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.050
up in jail. And that
generates money for the state

62
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.470
average of like 27,000 per
prisoner. And instead of coming

63
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.930
together, you know, they're, they're
at each other's throats. So

64
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.220
they're, they're doing the job
and they're just doing someone

65
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.570
else's job they're exterminating themselves.
So she starts organizing them,

66
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.060
removing leaders and starts taking
over square blocks of Los

67
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.660
Angeles. And at the same
time, sending in videos to

68
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.920
the local media, who we
presume are, are free and

69
00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:00.360
open thinkers. And they, they
start to debate back and

70
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.850
forth like, okay, well, here
are these corrupt police officers

71
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.050
who are selling drugs to
quote unquote undesirable neighborhoods and

72
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.840
destroying the people. No one's
forcing them to take this,

73
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.770
but if they're in a
really bad dire situation, they

74
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.950
just want to forget here.
You know, there's some heroin,

75
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.150
that'll destroy your chemicals. And
so people are preying on

76
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.400
each other. And so she's
starting to realize that pattern

77
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.070
and puts it on its
head and says, Hey, you

78
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.930
know, let's stop fighting each
other. Let's start taking back

79
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.220
these neighborhoods. And so she
starts, you know, this war

80
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.460
campaign taking over square blocks,
setting up traps. And it

81
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.370
was weird because I started
seeing things like that happen

82
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.810
in real life. There were
six police officers who were

83
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:56.820
tried and arrested and tried
for trafficking drugs and different.

84
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.440
And it was weird because
the lineup looks like the

85
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.890
character that I drew was
kind of eerie. And also

86
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.380
the bloods and Crips, which
were these gangs. And I

87
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.530
don't know where they necessarily
originated or if they were

88
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.950
engineered or, or what, but
they started coming together territory

89
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.470
wise because, you know, people
think, Oh, it's the bloods.

90
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.960
And the Crips that are,
that are really at each

91
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.190
other's throats. And there's so
many other gangs and things

92
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.830
like that. People just trying
to form their own families

93
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.870
and communities in ways to
organize themselves. But the violence

94
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.550
where, you know, we don't
know where it starts, why

95
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.310
it starts in white keeps
perpetuating. So she's just like,

96
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.560
yeah, I'm putting the kabash
on that. And all the

97
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.120
wild She's doing this, she's
a teenager, she's a petite

98
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.960
young black woman, not who
you would expect to be

99
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.400
listed along with Alexander, the
great Caesar Hannibal, you know,

100
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.880
like why shouldn't one of
the great military strategists in

101
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.570
history, just pop up and
be born in an environment

102
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.870
we don't expect. Absolutely. It,
it, it happens all the

103
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.960
time. And how often is
that capability squashed? You know,

104
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.750
not that I think it
would be great for people

105
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.410
to stop. Yeah. That, you
know, it's not always just

106
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.320
old white dudes in Carthage
that, that pop up. Right.

107
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.590
Right. I mean, I mean,
you, you, you kind of

108
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.590
see it throughout history, even
in a, I sort of

109
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.910
hate to go only towards
ancient Egypt because that sort

110
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.400
of erases any of the
advancements that, you know, the

111
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.400
entire continent of Africa has
accomplished in, you know, 5,000

112
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.950
years, but the first female
Pharaoh shit, I think that's

113
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.640
how you pronounce her name.
She, when her husband died,

114
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.900
she took over as Pharaoh
and she started implementing changes.

115
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.910
She allowed women to represent
themselves in court and they

116
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.570
could own property. And after
she died, that was the

117
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.660
end of that. They buried
her in any legacy of

118
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.370
her at all, but it
absolutely existed. I don't think

119
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.720
it's a big grand experience,
a conspiracy to suppress that.

120
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.660
But I think a lot
of times the mental barriers

121
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.170
stop people from having the
psychological permission to see themselves

122
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.690
as certain archetypes. So they
just sort of fall into

123
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.050
where they think they can
succeed. Yeah. And half shit

124
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.170
suit was actually one of
the most successful pharaohs considered

125
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.240
one of the most successful
ferals. And I think she

126
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.880
ended up living into her
fifties, which is quite significant

127
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.840
given the time she was
long lived for the time

128
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.050
and very, very successful in
one of the most successful

129
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.950
women of the early, you
know, 1500 BC timeframe. Right.

130
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.450
So backing up a little
bit, this is some pretty

131
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.380
heavy stuff. People who are
listening might be saying, wait

132
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.740
a second. I thought this
was a comic artist that

133
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.590
we've got here. Why do
you think that people don't

134
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.800
realize that really complicated themes
can be talked about in

135
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.850
the context of comics? I
think the, the way comics

136
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.290
are approached is it's thought
of as a child medium,

137
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:20.900
where they're superheroes, tights, superpowers,
and very juvenile and kind

138
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:26.510
of immature concepts that very
complicated things can't be expressed

139
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:32.150
through these new they're, they're
basically new gods. They're the

140
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:38.750
new, like Superman is his
Horace is Jesus. He's Neo,

141
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.500
you know, you see the
same sort of representations, the

142
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.430
same archetypes over and over
again. But I think in

143
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.420
America, it's viewed as you
know, no one's taking that

144
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.270
seriously. I did an interview
with someone on the radio.

145
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.780
They're like, no, one's really
taking comic books seriously. And

146
00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.370
I was like, Oh, have
you paid attention to any

147
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.220
of the films? The movie
that has been successful in

148
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.380
the last five years has
been about like, we clearly

149
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.670
are interested in these new
gods. Absolutely. Because they remind

150
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.730
us about things in ourselves.
We can see ourselves within

151
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.170
them. It's sort of this
heroic morale that people have

152
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:24.660
without having to subscribe to
a, a binding religion or

153
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.990
state delved out philosophy. That's
right. Really, that's a really

154
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.180
significant point that, that should,
we should just kind of

155
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.700
double click on, for lack
of another word for just

156
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.450
a moment, because it's, it's
clear like in the upcoming

157
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:44.330
Batman versus Superman situation, that
there's religious undertones in everything

158
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.670
there, but you don't have
to ascribe to a religion

159
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.460
nor do you have to
feel that you're there. This

160
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.060
is not an a frontier
religion. Yeah, exactly. People can

161
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.240
believe whatever they want to.
I feel like religion is

162
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:02.270
an interface for people to
interpret reality. And I don't

163
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:08.600
presume to know anything with
certainty. There's things that are

164
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.830
accepted as fact change with
technology all the time. I

165
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.590
think that a lot of
the early religions and things

166
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.960
of course were changed over
the time by Tyra to

167
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.940
wanted to users' these principles.
But I think fundamentally people

168
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:28.250
needed metaphors in order to
retain the information. You might

169
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:37.250
not remember that on December 31st,
the constellation, Oh, Ryan is

170
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.230
followed by Virgo. And then
from that point onward after

171
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.050
the winter solstice, the, the
arc of the sun across

172
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.600
the sky gets longer. But
you might remember that three

173
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.380
wise men, which is like
the belt of Orion followed

174
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.420
the Virgin, you know, follow
the, and they found the

175
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.850
Virgin. And then the son
was born like literally the

176
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.130
constellation Virgo comes up over
the horizon and then the

177
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.160
sun starts to get longer.
You know, it starts to

178
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.040
get longer, but it stays
longer in the sky. So

179
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.430
the sun is born, it's
reborn. And that can be

180
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.310
represented in so many ways.
And it's not to discredit

181
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.800
anyone's religion, but you know,
you have to kind of

182
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.470
look through time and see
where many of these things

183
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:25.300
were rewritten and changed and
manipulated to fit a particular

184
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.660
rulers idea. Right. It reminds
me of Joseph Campbell on the

185
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.930
power of myth and the
idea of the hero's journey.

186
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.010
And, you know, Luke Skywalker
is Jason and the Argonauts.

187
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.590
You know what I mean?
Like the story I was

188
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.140
in times before, I mean,
there were only so many

189
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.770
stories, Right? I mean, look
at Superman grant Morrison talks

190
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.660
about it in super gods.
And I have to finish

191
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.410
reading that book. So many
comics to draw, but it's,

192
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.450
you know, it's a really
great book where he starts

193
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:59.100
making the comparison between, you
know, Batman and Haiti's, he's

194
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.380
the guardian of the underworld.
And it's kind of like

195
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.010
Pluto. Pluto is the planet.
That's furthest out. It's near

196
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.390
the, the, the Oort cloud,
I believe is that, that

197
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.110
word cloud or the Chi
for disk, I think it's

198
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.130
your cloud, your cloud. So
he's sort of guardian of

199
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.240
all of these frozen stationary,
dead bodies that you have

200
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.840
to kind of cross a
sea to get to. And

201
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.490
Batman is kind of, he
is in the underworld, but

202
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.190
he's, he doesn't kill any
of them. He just sort

203
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:34.230
of keeps them at Bay.
And Jupiter is like Zeus,

204
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.570
hurling the Thunderbolt because when
objects from the work cloud

205
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:45.030
come in, it's, it's, Jupiter's
gravity that determines whether or

206
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.040
not it goes towards the
sun or away from the

207
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.540
sun. So it's, it's the
same personifications of, of natural

208
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.870
events that get repeated and
you see it in comic

209
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.320
books. And that's why it
resonates so much of the

210
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:05.820
speaking of Luke Skywalker. My,
my mom was Buddhist and

211
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.460
she would take us to
a Buddhist temple when I

212
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:15.030
lived in New York. And I
saw Mark Hamill at the

213
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.740
very front, we would, we
would pray. And we pray

214
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.130
to this sort of scroll
thing. And we repeat these

215
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.280
sutras and I didn't know
what I'm saying. It was

216
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.060
in Japanese, you know, so
sitting there chanting, like, alright,

217
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.790
I'm seeing something. And I
see Mark Hamill in the

218
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.040
front. I started, I pull
my mom's sleeve. I'm like,

219
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:41.220
mom, I thought, look, sky
welcome. I said, she's just

220
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.370
like, it's okay. Like he
can be both. And I'm

221
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.100
like, Oh, Oh, okay. He
could be both, you know,

222
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.850
Buddhist and they can share
philosophy. I was like, okay.

223
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.930
It is nice to remember
That we can share philosophies.

224
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.920
That's totally okay to do.
We can, like, it doesn't

225
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.530
have to be so finite.
Cause you know, we don't

226
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:05.170
know, but we can try.
I was telling someone recently

227
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.750
that I, I tend to
watch a lot of TV.

228
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.110
I watch, I unapologetically watch
a lot of TV because

229
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.880
I'm convinced that we are
in the golden age of

230
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.970
television. Like, you know, where,
like, you know, if you

231
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.370
ever meet someone that maybe
hasn't seen the wire or

232
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.770
they haven't seen breaking bad.
Right. And you just want

233
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.930
to like stop the conversation
and just like slap them

234
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.520
across the face and just
say, what are you doing

235
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.770
here? Why are you even
talking to me? You should

236
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.160
be home watching, breaking bad.
I feel the same way

237
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.990
about comics right now. Like,
I feel like there's this

238
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.360
resurgence, you know, and there's
just so much great comics

239
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.400
going on, like ms. Marvel
and just on and on

240
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.090
and on. Do you think
that we are like, is

241
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.190
this the new golden age?
Is this a new, is

242
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:47.080
there a moment that's happening
here? I think people are

243
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.190
coming to the actualization that
different kinds of stories have

244
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:55.390
been told in comics and
that there's a market for

245
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.470
it. And so with that
understanding, and also with the,

246
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:06.340
with Joe Casada is selling
the rights to the making

247
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.210
of the Marvel movies that
has opened up a huge

248
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:15.040
Avenue. So people are seeing
comics. Comics are basically now

249
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.910
the new I want to
direct because they see the

250
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:24.850
audience that, that the diehard
fans that will go out

251
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.610
and support a title that
will support a character. Because

252
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.680
you know, it's a piece
of them. It's a piece

253
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.570
of themselves. And now that
people are understanding, okay, we

254
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.140
don't have to sell to
just this particular demographic. We

255
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:43.420
can make things for different
kinds of people with different

256
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.010
philosophies, different ideas, not even
just different nationalities or different

257
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.890
ages, but you can make
a horror comics. You can

258
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.190
make, you know, just superhero
comics, superior comics are great.

259
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.590
We know them. We love
them. We can reproduce them.

260
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.590
We can make action drama.
And that is sort of

261
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.240
a pre storyboard and a
test market for a film

262
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.790
and people without having that
understanding, you know, they, they

263
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.250
assume it's a fast track,
but it's a lot of

264
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:17.440
work. Hey folks, I wanted
to take a moment to

Let me, Let me dig
into this a little bit.

280
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.970
If you don't mind. And
I hope this isn't too

281
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:19.220
personal because I feel like
Like the movies that are

282
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.270
making like a billion dollars,
you know, You mean like

283
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.840
Avengers, like a billions, one
of those words you'd have

284
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.340
to hit the B and
just like let it hang.

285
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.760
Right? Right. But billion dollar.
Well, when I I'm going

286
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.380
to go to a wizard
world in a couple of

287
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.770
weeks and I feel like
I'm still seeing comic artists

288
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.850
that are just talented beyond
belief. He's sitting at a

289
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.930
picnic table selling their art
and I get the impression

290
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.290
that they don't have awesome
health care and they're not

291
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.590
living in mansions, but they
are the creators of my

292
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:57.470
heroes is the, the movie
movie's, co-opting almost, maybe co-opting

293
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.110
isn't the right word, but
making billion dollar movies about

294
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.930
our heroes, is it leaving?
I don't know people like

295
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.420
you behind. How do you
get some of that billion?

296
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.740
Well, it, it depends on
the ownership. If you think

297
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.390
you can redraft Superman's costume
and then make a bunch

298
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.030
of money off of it,
that's not necessarily how this

299
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.080
goes. And these properties are,
if they've been around since

300
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.530
world war II, the way
they, an artist can make

301
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:31.070
a billion dollars is if
they own the intellectual property.

302
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.340
Right. You know, and a
lot of times, you know,

303
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.680
people can get screwed if
they don't have the right

304
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.130
representation, if they don't know
what they're signing over. You

305
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:46.070
know? So having that understanding
is important. The artists are

306
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.340
many artists are freelance, so
they're work for hire. There's

307
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.120
no W2, there's no taxes
taken out. There are no

308
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.630
health benefits. You have to
kind of create that on

309
00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.410
your own. And so it's
kind of a long and

310
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.850
grueling process initially, where you
have to hone your craft,

311
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:10.640
then make a name for
yourself, then work on properties

312
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.880
to show that you actually
can hit a deadline and

313
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:19.400
make something that's that sellable
and people want. Then you

314
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.980
have to maybe, maybe, you
know, some people get away

315
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:27.320
with it, not be a
douchebag. And it's sort of

316
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.180
like one out of three
things, you know, they like

317
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:33.050
you you're, you send in
work on time and you

318
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.330
know, you do good work
is a two out of

319
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.180
those three seem to work,
but people get left behind

320
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.430
when they don't know the
business and they don't know

321
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.010
the business of what they're
doing and I'm still learning.

322
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.930
There's still lots of things
for me to learn. But

323
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.080
with genius, that was a
word for hire. After I

324
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.330
completed that and I got
paid for my Patriot, you

325
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.430
know, it's being sold in
Barnes noble. And I don't

326
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.620
see any of that because
I'm not, even though I

327
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.910
created the characters and the
aesthetic and you know, made

328
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.630
a few changes here and
there, it's not my concept

329
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.960
and it's not my story.
So after I'm paid for

330
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.370
that job, that's it. They
own it. They can do

331
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.900
what they want with it.
If they would like to

332
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.910
include me in the making
of the film, that would

333
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.560
be fantastic. But I'm not
entitled to any of that

334
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.540
because a that's that wasn't
written to my original contract

335
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.780
and be like I said,
not the IP owner. So

336
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.150
people think that because these
properties make millions of dollars,

337
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.570
that comic artists are rich
more often than not. If

338
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.380
they don't turn in work
that is accrued, they don't

339
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.200
get paid. Does that underscore
the importance of what is

340
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.600
also a bit of the
rise of the, of the,

341
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.770
the comic artist owned intellectual
property? Like these, these not

342
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.860
the big Marvel DC, but
like, you know, you know,

343
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.200
Kirkman and then these different
folks that are saying like

344
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.420
artists should own their own
stuff. Like, is that going

345
00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.060
to change or are we
splitting where there's going to

346
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.300
be two kinds of comics,
the big corporate comics and

347
00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.750
then the little people and
nothing in between? Well, I

348
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:10.380
think, I think with books
like saga, that's changing, you

349
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.670
know, there are people who
are moving outside of, of

350
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.180
Marvel and DC and they
have great properties and great

351
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.540
stories and they can afford
to hire the best of

352
00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.950
the best and have that
team together and make an

353
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.250
amazing book. But indie artists
are finding a way to

354
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.520
go directly to their audience
and say, okay, this is

355
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.920
what I have in mind,
in order for me to

356
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.830
live in the meantime of
making this book, you know,

357
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.410
I could really use your
support. And now with things

358
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.790
like Kickstarter and, and different
social media platforms, people can

359
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.740
decide, okay, you know what?
I want to see that

360
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.670
happen. I want to see
that come into a reality.

361
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.550
So I'm going to support
this directly, whereas maybe 10,

362
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.090
20, 30 years ago, that
wasn't a reality and that

363
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.600
wasn't even, that wasn't even
possible. You couldn't have that

364
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.540
sort of platform or access
to the public in general.

365
00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.980
And both of those things
can coexist. I think, you

366
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.200
know, there, I think there
will always be a place

367
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.760
for the marbles and DCS,
but I think different kinds

368
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.160
of stories can be told
by different kinds of people

369
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:24.960
that I think companies like
Marvel can't necessarily facilitate because

370
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.120
of the amount of initial
investment. So with, for example,

371
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.730
a book like X-Men, you
have to consider average 20,

372
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:42.240
you know, 20 to 30
pages, right? The penciler inker

373
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:47.270
and colorist three different jobs
on average, you know, a

374
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:53.870
hundred to $200, $500, $600
a page. You know, every,

375
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.620
everything varies according to level
of experience. So you're looking

376
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.690
at, you know, 10, 20,000,
$50,000 for the production of

377
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.510
one book. Wow, you've got
to get that return on

378
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.300
investment. That means that they
can't make that kind of

379
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.080
investment on a smaller book
and then get a return.

380
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:17.090
If it's something that is
a little bit more nuance

381
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.100
and niche, but someone putting
in an initial investment of

382
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.240
$5,000 and getting a return
of 10 or 20, that's

383
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:33.440
something that an indie artist
can can benefit from. And

384
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.400
also when you think about
it, DC has vertigo and

385
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.150
that's their Avenue to tell
their independent stories. Marvel doesn't

386
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:45.230
currently have that, you know,
so they're using, when they

387
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.190
put in new characters, they're
inserting them into their universe.

388
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.020
Interesting. Yeah, you're right. That
isn't, that is the model

389
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.330
that most even movie theaters,
I mean, with moving with

390
00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.250
the shimmy production houses, right.
They'll have like the big,

391
00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.850
you know, new age cinema,
which is like, you know,

392
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.310
the, the, the arm of
a larger of a larger

393
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:08.950
organization. So you described three
different jobs there penciler inker

394
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.720
and colorist. Those are the
jobs that I think of

395
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.190
historically. I remember when I
was probably 20 years ago

396
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.950
buying, you know, the become
a comic artist kits with

397
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.560
a giant pages, you know,
and you learn all about

398
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.360
those individual jobs. And we
were always taught that they

399
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.870
were separate. But now with
the advent of digital, you

400
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.340
are all three of those
things, aren't you? Yes. I'm

401
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.110
working on a Marvel book
right now, and this is

402
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.040
the first time I'll be
doing just pencils and inks

403
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.930
because it does take a
lot of time. And I'm

404
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.990
trying to use new programs
because historically I've used Adobe

405
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.410
illustrator, which if anyone's used
illustrator, it's more of a

406
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.170
graphic design program. Cause that's
kind of how I started

407
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.520
out as a graphic designer
and just someone who loved

408
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.730
comics and taught themselves how
to draw in these programs.

409
00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:05.500
But I, I guess now
if you can draw by

410
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:11.200
hand and digitally, you do
have an advantage, honestly, with

411
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:18.070
these different types of programs,
vector programs, mango studio, illustrators,

412
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.670
sketchbook, pro people are drawing
on their tablets. Now you

413
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:27.460
can sort of circumvent those
things, but they're not obsolete.

414
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.380
There are some people who
are just anchors and they're

415
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.830
really, really good at that.
And that's still necessary for

416
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.920
those who are just penciling.
But if you can do

417
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.260
all three, you could probably
get through a book a

418
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:46.290
little bit faster and you
know, for a company, if

419
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.580
they can hit their Mark,
then you can pay them

420
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.760
for all three jobs. Oh,
okay. So being all three

421
00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.430
of those, isn't necessarily an
opportunity for someone to get

422
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.740
ripped off. Like you're not
going to say I'm going

423
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.540
to get paid twice as
much, rather than three times

424
00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.250
as much, even though I'm
doing three times the work,

425
00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.940
Sometimes it ends up happening
that way where like, Oh,

426
00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.040
you're doing all of those.
Okay, well we'll give you

427
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.720
this much per page. Wait,
that doesn't, that doesn't add

428
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.630
up to very much at
all. Okay. It's so interesting

429
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.020
though, that from the outside,
looking in that you keep

430
00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.390
saying per page per page
and that's that's so turn

431
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:27.920
the crank. You know what
I mean? It's almost like

432
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.520
me being paid per lines
of code, as opposed to

433
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.920
per program that I write,
you know, like there's the

434
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.710
end, the end product. It
may be 10 lines of

435
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.680
code, maybe a thousand, but
the end product is know,

436
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.200
like you might look at
someone else's art and that

437
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.270
might, you might find in
just chatting with them that,

438
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.880
Oh wow. It takes you
like 14 hours a page.

439
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.650
Oh, I bang out a
page in nine hours or

440
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.460
whatever. Right. You know, and
we have this myth within

441
00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.730
programming of the, the 10
X programmer. The idea of

442
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.130
like, you know, there are
certain kinds of programmers that

443
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:01.970
are 10 times more productive
than others. And we don't

444
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.230
know until, you know, it's
a myth, you know, I

445
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.360
assume that you might have
the same myth with a

446
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.060
comic artists where there's certain
people that produce at a

447
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.070
level that you can't even
understand how they're pulling it

448
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:15.620
off. Yeah. There's some people
who create a lot faster

449
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.240
than others. I want to
get faster just for my

450
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.560
own edification. So especially being
self-taught, there are a lot

451
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.970
of things I had to
kind of learn the hard

452
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:30.200
way. Oh yeah. It's like
I traditionally started off as

453
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.750
a cover artist because I'm
being a singer and a

454
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:39.380
voice actor. I would perform
at different places and I

455
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.320
would make my own flyers.
And then I started doing

456
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.740
album covers because out of
a circle of many musicians,

457
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.200
I would be the only
artist that they knew personally.

458
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.570
So they were like, Hey,
you know, I have 600

459
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.520
bucks. Can you just make
an album cover for me?

460
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.920
And I'm like, I can
do that. All right, sure.

461
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:06.410
But it's, you can't treat
individual panels of a page,

462
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.020
which are just showing moments,
but you're showing like the

463
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.530
apex of a moment, moving
the story along like a

464
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:17.900
cover. You can't, you can't
cram all that information into

465
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:22.850
a single frame. And if
you try to do so

466
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.560
you'll take home day because
the information doesn't translate quite

467
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.140
as well. It's smaller. There's,
there's less detailed if you

468
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.170
put too much detail into
it, the I's not going

469
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.910
to know where to go.
The, if you can, if

470
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:40.640
you think of detail like
information and it's information to

471
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.610
be read, the eye will
travel across the page in

472
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:51.520
the direction of dark and
like blacks, darks and detail.

473
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.540
So how you communicate that
on a print page, moves

474
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:01.620
the person along in the
story. Okay. So it's, It's

475
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.830
the, you know how, when
you're watching a movie and

476
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.440
they'll cut to someone and
they're looking in one direction

477
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.930
and then they'll cut to
the other person, they're looking

478
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.500
at their direction. Like that's
the kind of stuff that

479
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.040
director is thinking about. Whereas
if both people were looking

480
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.560
to the right, even though
they're supposed to be talking

481
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.120
to each other, because if
that's how they set the

482
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.490
cameras up, it would, you
wouldn't know what was wrong,

483
00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.650
but you would know something
was wrong. Your brain would

484
00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:26.580
say, what's going on, you'll
be incorrectly oriented in your

485
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.070
brain. So you're thinking about
that flow as you move

486
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:33.870
through the Absolutely. And also,
you know, you have to

487
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.660
kind of think of the,
not just the cinematography of

488
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.500
the individual panels as it
is relaying information, but the

489
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.890
flow of where things are
positioned and how it leads

490
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.970
people across the page. So
you're, you're thinking about you

491
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.580
kind of a director in
that sense, when you're a

492
00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:56.340
comic artist, you can set
up the information and each

493
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.250
panel tells a piece of
the story and moves it

494
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:04.080
along. And for individual core
indie creators, if you're putting

495
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.600
something in a story and
it doesn't either reveal something

496
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.750
about the character or give
more information, you might want

497
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.980
to consider cutting it. So
that's sort of the helpful

498
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.340
part, a, of an editor.
They will tell you when

499
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.120
you've got too much going
on, You mentioned that you

500
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.630
did voiceover work. You're also
a singer, you're a songwriter,

501
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:29.190
you're an accomplished flutist. You
know, there's only so many

502
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:34.470
hours in the day I
forfeited my social life. Should

503
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.020
you? I mean, I don't,
I don't, I don't imagine,

504
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.110
like after a day of
writing comics and drawing and

505
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.450
doing all this work and
then you're like, Oh, I

506
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:44.370
think I'll, I'll go to
the local club and then

507
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.680
I will join my band.
I mean, how do you

508
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.390
have the energy to do
all those kinds of things?

509
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.900
Do you ever feel the
need to pick? I do

510
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.220
sometimes. And when I do,
I get fundamentally sick, really?

511
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.920
I do, I do something
in me. Just kind of

512
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.150
goes a little sour if
I'm not doing one of

513
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.150
those things. Now, granted comics
takes a lot more time

514
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.310
and because I'm a self-taught
artist, I have to spend

515
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:15.300
more time to focus on
it. And as a musician,

516
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.830
you know, I've been playing
the flute since I was

517
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:20.970
nine, I performed on a
bunch of different stages. I

518
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:24.780
got to tour with some
amazing folks. And I sort

519
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.820
of taught myself how to
sing after doing a lot

520
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.280
of like reading a lot
of sheet music and things

521
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.680
like that. I beat boxed
for awhile. Just kind of

522
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.300
weird. I was with a
lot of like female underground

523
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.580
hip hop crews where they
were like, breakdancers beatbox, Oh,

524
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.160
I was the only beatbox
artist, but they were MCs

525
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.840
and so on. And so
I was their resident beatbox

526
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.990
artist for this group called
the anomalies. And I started

527
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.680
mimicking SIM singers as just
another sound. You know, I

528
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.080
do like animal noises and
beats and things like that.

529
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.480
And I would, you know,
like once upon a time,

530
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.260
there's a story out of
time, you know, like I,

531
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.410
I kind of mimic jazz
singers and mimic these different

532
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:16.130
things until I eventually became
one. And I think sometime

533
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.070
when I was 16 or
17, my, you know, my

534
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.780
folks were having a hard
time and they just kind

535
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.300
of went in two different
directions and I was sort

536
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.060
of on my own. And
so I had to take

537
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.530
on a lot of odd
jobs and I was performing

538
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.180
a couple of times a
week. So it was, it

539
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.460
was more out of necessity,
like, all right, I need

540
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.860
to know how to do
this. I would play my

541
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.030
flute and in different bands
and sing background and eventually

542
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:44.420
went on tour. But I
had office jobs that had

543
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.910
computers. So I taught myself
Photoshop. It seems like if

544
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.120
I may, that there's a
thematically through your, through your

545
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.850
career, through your work for
your life. You're putting on

546
00:33:54.850 --> 00:34:00.850
different masks. That's very true
All in the process of

547
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.550
not hiding, but to figure
out, figure out who you

548
00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:07.600
are, but it must be
both very frustrating. Cause you

549
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.880
have all these masks to
pick from while some people

550
00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.130
may just have one, but
also it must also be

551
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.390
very, very empowering to feel
that when you're tired of

552
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:21.220
one, you can switch to
another. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I'm

553
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.370
in a band called waking
astronomer and I'm the singer

554
00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.920
and flute player and I
beat box in the band

555
00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.650
and it's been really great
because, you know, they're weirdos

556
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:33.970
like me and I can
sort of be myself, you

557
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:36.880
know, as a, as a
singer, you know, I thought

558
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.910
I had to go through
the channels of, okay. Yeah.

559
00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:44.110
I, I write some songs
to get a record contract.

560
00:34:44.410 --> 00:34:46.930
I go on tour and
that's how you become a

561
00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:52.510
successful singer. But when I
started navigating through the industry,

562
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.840
you know, of course I
was immature and I wasn't

563
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.020
really ready. But what I
noticed was that it was

564
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.810
more of an assembly line
is a little bit more

565
00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.960
about, okay, can you, can
you make a hit song?

566
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.040
Okay. Pretend to be this
other person being an MC

567
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.580
I wanted, I was a
really big, I was really

568
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.790
big into rock. Like I
love stone, temple pilots. Like

569
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.340
that was, that was my
everything and red hot chili

570
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.350
peppers. And so I wanted
to do rock and I

571
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.450
came from a jazz and
classical background. So I could

572
00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:25.450
appreciate a lot of different
kinds of music and, you

573
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.300
know, excuse me, English when
I say this, but I

574
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.030
literally had someone telling me
like, yeah, well you could

575
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:35.350
do all the white devil
shit. You do. You got

576
00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.410
to like, get some street
cred first. And I was

577
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.070
like, what? Okay. I just
want to make some music

578
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:46.500
that I want to make.
Right. And I decided, well,

579
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.570
you know, if I am
going to do music, I'll

580
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.890
just do it on my
terms. And so I kind

581
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.600
of figured, well, you know,
maybe that just, maybe that

582
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.420
just won't happen with Arrieta.
I can tell the stories

583
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.000
that I want to tell,
and I can express myself

584
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.700
that way. When I was
a kid, I wasn't very

585
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:07.500
talkative. And I felt like
I almost couldn't trust my

586
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.880
own thoughts and my own
words, but playing the flute

587
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.370
so young, that was that
that enabled me to have

588
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:19.170
a voice that couldn't be
questioned other than the technique,

589
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.070
you know, it's like, okay,
you know, I can trust

590
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:25.830
this because this is in
tune. This is in tune.

591
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:30.960
And this is correct. You
know, the intonation is correct.

592
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.960
I'm expressing this the way
I want to, I think

593
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.080
hit the notes and I've
practiced this and no one

594
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.300
can take this from me.
No one can, you know

595
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.000
that you can critique it,
but you can come take

596
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.460
my technique. Not who I
am. Right. It's a true

597
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:50.010
meritocracy. Yeah, absolutely. And that
was really important for me.

598
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:52.260
That was really vital for
me because I didn't, I

599
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.630
did not have a very
healthy self esteem. It there's,

600
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.030
a lot of things happened
in my life and it

601
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.950
made me feel like, well,
why did this happen to

602
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.740
me? You know, maybe I
don't deserve to be happy.

603
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.960
And it just, all these
things that the person tells

604
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:12.810
themselves to try and rationalize
tragedy. And you w when

605
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.500
you can make art and
change your mind and inspire

606
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.990
someone else, you want to
make it to the best

607
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.710
of your ability. And so
I just, I just kept

608
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.890
pushing. And I, even though
people told me it was

609
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:32.220
a waste of time, you
know, don't do this, get

610
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.570
a real job. You're going
to be homeless maybe for

611
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:41.160
the rest of your life.
Or there's so many, so

612
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.790
many fears that people projected
onto me. Like, you know,

613
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.250
you're, you're never gonna make
it. You're too old to

614
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:52.590
do this. And even though
it's hard, life is hard.

615
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:55.620
Life is difficult. Surviving is
difficult. We might as well

616
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.840
do something that we enjoy
that at the end of

617
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.240
it, after it's finished, you
can look back and say,

618
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.360
you know what? I made
this, I made this and

619
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.210
it's there and it's not
perfect, but who cares? I

620
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:10.860
finished it. I accomplished it.
It's published. And maybe someone

621
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.350
else will appreciate it because
when I would listen to

622
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.170
music, sometimes my head would
be so cloudy. And then

623
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:20.040
when I would hear the
construction of the songs and

624
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.380
their cores and their progressions,
I was like, you know

625
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.150
what? This person they're going
through something they're struggling. They're

626
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.240
doing whatever they're doing in
their life, but they were

627
00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.440
able to make this. And
this is beautiful. So I

628
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.600
want this and I want
this for somebody else. And

629
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.780
I want them to know
that, you know, I'm not,

630
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.530
I'm not a superhero. I'm
not special, but I'm too

631
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:49.690
stubborn to quit. I'm too
stubborn to cave in because

632
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.240
we've got this one life
we might come back. We

633
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.200
don't know. We don't have
any memory of what we

634
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.830
were before. Be it dirt,
be it either another person,

635
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.950
but we have this experience
and we're always waiting, Rose,

636
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.860
waiting until we're ready. We're
waiting until the right moment.

637
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.870
And those moments pass. And
I, you know, I want

638
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.380
people to be able to
embrace the things that they

639
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.820
want to make with their
lives now, and to try

640
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.730
it. And you know, everybody's
not going to ever a

641
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.530
million people want to dress
vitamin. They're not going to

642
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.030
be able to trust vitamin.
They're not going to have

643
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.910
the opportunity to dress by
grant. I'm not saying that,

644
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.740
you know, if you think
it it's possible, but at

645
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:36.400
the same time it is,
you are. I never thought,

646
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.240
you know, sleeping on a
subway. I would have the

647
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.250
opportunity to draw for a
living. And I just thought

648
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:47.650
that just didn't happen for
someone like me. And that's

649
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.470
not necessarily to say, you
know, you know, as a

650
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.110
black woman, because I get,
I get that a lot.

651
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.970
It's like, how does it
feel to be a black

652
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:58.030
woman in a white male
dominated industry? And I was

653
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:02.320
like, it's fine. I don't
make it an issue. I

654
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.570
make my work speak for
me. If I want to

655
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.300
see something, if I feel
like there aren't enough people

656
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.870
of this particular type of
culture being represented, I'm not

657
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.300
going to look to someone
else to make it. That's

658
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.920
my job. That's, that's an
opportunity. And I think with

659
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.590
comics lately, there've been a
lot of people complaining, but

660
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.660
not enough people supporting or
people trying it themselves, or

661
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.820
doing the research to understand
what really goes into it.

662
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.740
And it takes a lot
of heart and a lot

663
00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.310
of effort. And I put
my everything into my artwork

664
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:39.630
and because it's me on
a page, Well, people can

665
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:44.220
check you out on aPage@afuorrichardson.info.

666
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.040
up there. You've got advanced
as you go to conventions,

667
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.800
there's the food store you
can check out and you

668
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.640
can also check out your
new album, correct? Yes. As

self-titled EAP eight songs, it's

670
00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:04.650
OK. Player right now it's

671
00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:07.860
you can visit a full
richardson.com or follow me on

672
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:12.120
Twitter. Tumblr. I have a
group on Facebook called dr.

673
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.300
Foos lab. I got that
nickname from Brandon Graham. Who's a

674
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:25.320
really, really great comics, creator.
He long story. But anyway,

675
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.250
yeah, it's sort of an
art community because that that's

676
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.340
something that I know I
wouldn't have survived without having

677
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.540
a community of people who
can give me feedback and

678
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.010
encourage me, but also let
me know when I'm lacking.

679
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.160
It's kind of like a
dojo and it's a really

680
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.010
great art family there. So
anyone who's an aspiring artist

681
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.780
or professional come on down.
Well, thanks so much for

682
00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:52.630
spending time with me today.
Yeah. Thanks for having me.

683
00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.620
Thanks for listening everybody. This
has been another episode of

684
00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.720
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
