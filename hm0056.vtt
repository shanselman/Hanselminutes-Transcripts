onto Raymond Chen. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman, and this is

13
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.570
another episode of Hansel minutes.
And I am sitting here

14
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.560
in the actual office of
the actual Raymond Chan, the author

15
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.770
of the old new thing.
He has just signed my

16
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.920
copy of the book and
I can die now, Raymond,

17
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.960
how are you, sir? I'm
I'm doing great. And I

18
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.690
hope that that copy fetches
a nice bounty on eBay.

19
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.480
You I've already put it
on eBay. Actually, I doubly

20
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.970
listed on Craigslist. I intend
to sell this for as

21
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.670
much money as possible. I
might get two, three bucks

22
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.530
over retail. I'm I'm impressed.
That's that's more than I

23
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.200
would've expected. I appreciate that.
So I'm a, I'm a

24
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.660
huge fan of your blog.
And I actually, I don't

25
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.370
know if you put two
and two together, but if

26
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.320
you open up your book
and you look on the

27
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.950
first page, Oh, heavens, I
should read that. That's that's

28
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.020
the praise for the old
new thing on the first

29
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.520
page, Raymond Chen is the original
wreck and tour of windows.

30
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.940
I went to the, the
Sharice at Merrill Merriam Webster,

31
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.820
find out what rec and
tournament and said, I thought

32
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.670
it was actually inappropriate, but
it actually did means exactly

33
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.080
what it is. So you
are the keeper of the

34
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.460
story storyteller. In fact, you
are, and I love the

35
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.230
book. And when they said,
Hey, put a quote in

36
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.400
the front. I said, I
gotta be a part of

37
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.620
that. I really appreciate you
taking the time to talk

38
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.480
to us here. I know
that you talked to Carl

39
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.430
and the guys over at,
at dotnet rocks for an

40
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.140
hour or so. And you
had Carl and stitches for

41
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.480
the better part of an
hour, but I want to

42
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.330
get down to, to brass
tacks here and find out

43
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
some of the kind of
fundamentals about what you work

44
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.980
on. You're doing, you're doing
winter to, to in the

45
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.060
shell, right? Yeah. So I've
been for, I don't even

46
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.880
remember when I came over
to the user interface group

47
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.010
and the shell team. So
this is, are the people

48
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.880
who do deal with Explorer
and, and common dialogues and

49
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.240
that sort of Thing. It's
kind of hard to describe

50
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.120
where the boundaries are to
non technical people, but you

51
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.680
have a technical audience. So
I, I do it with

52
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.190
technology. It's, it's, it's mostly
shell 32 and calm dialogue

53
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.370
and calm control and Ooh,
calm control things that hang

54
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.580
out in that world. I
remember the great 3d war

55
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.750
Of the late, mid to
late nineties when there was

56
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.290
15, 16 different versions of,
was it controlled? <inaudible> 32

57
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.960
And hadn't done subversions within
those. Why was that such

58
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.630
a problem? Cause if 3d
is good, more 3d muscles

59
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.810
Be better. Absolutely. I had
a lot of trouble with

60
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.580
that. That was DLL. Hell,
that was the beginning of

61
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.330
it. Wasn't it? I, I
don't know I was, I

62
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.230
was asleep for that part.
Is it really difficult to

63
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.880
do versioning like that? I
mean, you're just exporting a

64
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.500
function table. I mean, how
hard is it to keep

65
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.900
those functions to look in
the same? Why do we

66
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.600
get these big dragons that
we're gonna call GPS back

67
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.710
in the day they were
on handle application exceptions. Aue

68
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:02.370
eight UAE unrecoverable application error,
error. That's right. Wow. That,

69
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.590
that brings back horrible memories.
And you have to make

70
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.560
sure not to confuse it
with the United Arab Emirates. In fact,

71
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.230
yes. Did the people in
Dubai do not appreciate that

72
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.620
in any way? People don't
like UAE, for some reason,

73
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.530
it's like, we're just mining
our own beer. Why was

74
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.510
versioning so hard? Why were
there so many of her

75
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.220
copies of that DLL, there
were so many copies. Is

76
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.980
that DLL? I actually don't
know because I wasn't around

77
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.930
for that, but I assume
that the reason there are

78
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.670
so many copies of that
DLL is everybody thought it

79
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.880
was really awesome or everybody
wanted to have their own

80
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.130
version of it because, well,
you know, it's mine is

81
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.920
cooler than yours, but I
realized I wrote it. It

82
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.950
must necessarily be cooler than
yours. Yes. Invented here syndrome

83
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.280
specifically invented here. Now I
realized that I would definitely,

84
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.690
I'll probably ask you a
few questions where you weren't

85
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.510
here. And I know that
you're, you're known for volleying

86
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.020
back questions that are not,
I wasn't here. Sorry. I

87
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.270
was sick that day. I'm
very good at rejecting question.

88
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.040
And I appreciate that. So
most of this interview will

89
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.500
be rejected questions, but I'm
more interested in, you can

90
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.630
listen for them on the
deleted scenes. In fact, yes.

91
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.560
On the special features, I'm
interested in versioning cause you're

92
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.170
living in a non-managed world
and I haven't lived there

93
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.230
in a while. Right? I
think the last, last time

94
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.840
I thunked was, is at
least 10 years ago. And

95
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.290
I appreciate the occasional scars
are healed. In fact, I

96
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.230
appreciate the occasional, he referenced
pointer and that's, that's great

97
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.770
that you guys do that,
but is versioning really hard

98
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.520
and unmanaged world. I mean,
you've got methods inside of

99
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.500
shell 32 and the different
things that you maintain that

100
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.540
probably you wish you could
yank out, but you just

101
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.150
can't for compatibility. Oh, there's
stuff that we want to

102
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.330
yank out all the time.
But you know, we publish

103
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.180
the function, we document it.
Now we're stuck with it

104
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.600
Now from the, from the,
from a static dependency analysis

105
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.600
perspective, you can keep those
functions looking the same things

106
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.970
will line up. They take
the right parameters, but is

107
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.100
it really difficult to make
sure that the semantics of

108
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.610
those functions including bugs stays
the same? Yeah. Bug for

109
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.160
bug compatibility is, is one
of the, The things that

110
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.020
you sort of don't appreciate
until you have to do

111
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.790
it. In fact, you know,
looking at the changes between

112
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.370
windows XP in Vista, we
see people complaining about things

113
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.300
that saying that, Hey, if
I pass this invalid string

114
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.730
to half is, you know,
they're like path is network

115
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.580
path. It used to say
it was, and now it

116
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.250
says it isn't. And we
say that's right, because it

117
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.350
isn't. Well, I was sort
of hoping it would still

118
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.100
be one cause now it's
slowing down My program. I

119
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.900
remember when, when I remember
literally the day that I,

120
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.100
I double clicked on the
time date thing and saw

121
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.680
that the little time date
Apple, and I saw that

122
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.990
you had removed the time
zones because of that border

123
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.030
war or whatever with it
was at Peru or something,

124
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.200
there were, there were The
time zone. One was an

125
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.020
Ecuador Peru border war, as
I recall, And I was

126
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.420
sad and I said, a
feature has been removed and

127
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.700
I have seen it happen.
I noticed I'm sure a

128
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.140
lot of people didn't notice.
I know that you said

129
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.500
on Carl's talk that, that
they removed scraps and then

130
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.550
you remove scraps personally. I
noticed dammit and I, I,

131
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.020
I, I didn't really know.
Okay. I don't think anybody's

132
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.830
even noticed yet. I actually
notice when I make a

133
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.020
scrap, I go what's that,
That was that. And how

134
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.940
do I get rid of
this? My desktop I have

135
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.530
now I even opened one
up once. Look to the

136
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.060
M for the MC header
to see if it was

137
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.640
evil. Yeah. I, I suspect
that most people who created

138
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.710
scraps did it completely by
mistake and all of the

139
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.450
support calls or questions of
the form. How do I

140
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.710
get there? Fantastic. Is, is
that semantics? You said that

141
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.020
the semantics are very difficult
to maintain. I understand that

142
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.260
there's some kind of a,
and I may be misspeaking

143
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.200
here, but there's some kind
of a, A secret evil

144
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.770
Universe inside of a windows
box. That's like the application

145
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.560
compatibility here. We know everything
there is to know about

146
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.200
Arthur's teacher trouble. So we'll
patch up these six API

147
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.470
APIs. There's, there's a not
in substantial database of programs

148
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.210
and all the little things
that have to be done

149
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.890
to keep them happy. And,
and it, you know, it

150
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.310
doesn't even begin to cover
all of the applications out

151
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.640
there. The app compat team
have a rather large library,

152
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.160
but it's clearly not comprehensive.
How are they doing that?

153
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.770
I mean, you, they're literally
saying, you know, Arthur's teacher

154
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.430
trouble doesn't work anymore. And
it's because they're passing nonsense

155
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.100
to, I don't know, get
Pat Infowars. Those, those guys

156
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.080
are amazing. They have to
have a pretty good knowledge

157
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.170
of large chunks of the
system. When, when a program

158
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.230
stops working, they, they, they're
usually the ones who do

159
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.540
the initial debugging to figure
out what's going on. And

160
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.570
then once, once they narrow
it down, they can hand

161
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.690
it off to a particular
component team. If they determined

162
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.480
that there's a shell functionality
change, that's causing trouble, then

163
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.040
they can send it over
our way. But they have,

164
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.540
they have a pretty tough
job of having to figure

165
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.710
out even what, you know,
what area the problem even

166
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.870
lies in. So specific to
the shell when I go

167
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.900
properties compatibility, and I see
all that stuff, it seems

168
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.030
like I'm doing that a
lot now in Vista, I'm

169
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.820
saying no, no XP service
pack two. What exactly is

170
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.140
happening there? You're patching get
version. And when, when that

171
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.990
is when you pick like
one of those larger categories,

172
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.850
like if you run the
app, I've, I'm trying remember

173
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.370
what it's called application compatibility
toolkit. Now, where is that?

174
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.340
It's an app compat whiz.
It's, it's, it's essentially your

175
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.550
favorite search engine. And hopefully
it'll turn up the application.

176
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.960
Madly compatibility toolkit lets you
apply individual fixes and there

177
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.290
are hundreds upon hundreds of
them to specific applications. But

178
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.490
if you use the compatibility
page, then you're sort of

179
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.120
it's it's it's, it's sort
of like the, you know,

180
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.100
I got a combo meal
where we sort of have

181
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.230
the windows XP combo meal,
or if you pick this,

182
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.160
we'll apply these 25 fixes
that tend to cover most

183
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.800
of the problems applications that
had. And they can range

184
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.280
from just reporting that it's,
that it's windows XP, even

185
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.330
though it really is windows
Vista to, you know, checking

186
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.790
applications to see if they
try to access a file

187
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.890
by an old file name.
We turned it into the

188
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.330
new filing before sending it
through. So It's, it's, it's,

189
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:50.720
it's lying. It's various degrees
of slight of hand. So,

190
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.510
you know, back in the
day, back in the day,

191
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.880
back in the day, back
in the day, when, when

192
00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.670
men were men and a
program manager, reign Supreme, even

193
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.620
on windows 95, you came
in and windows 95 kind

194
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.870
of universe, right? Just to
check, was it Chicago Or

195
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.930
was it, it was, it
was, it was called what

196
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.060
was it called? It was
called Cougar back then. Oh

197
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.900
my, yeah, it was a
<inaudible> that was actually a

198
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:20.330
precursor project to what eventually
became windows 95. And there

199
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.360
were, you know, the icons
were prettier. There were less

200
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.310
back in the day before
when it's XP before winter

201
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.580
2000, there were fewer device
contexts, your brushes, there was

202
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.290
a minimal amount of stuff
that you could paint. And

203
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.120
I remember it every once
in a while when my

204
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.630
computer got really stressed out,
icons would start turning black.

205
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:41.330
I asked the black icons,
why? Because you ran out

206
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.770
of GDI resource and somebody,
but you guys, you had

207
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.770
Black brush though. I mean,
someone was able to, why

208
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.040
not paint them white? Why,
why, why black? Well, but

209
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.170
the, the, the way icons
are drawn, you have your

210
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.770
mask. And then, then you
have there's. If you recall

211
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.070
a bit map or an
icon back in the day

212
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.860
consisted of two, bitmaps a
monochrome mass bitmap and a

213
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.560
color bitmap. And the algorithm
was to, and with the,

214
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.380
to end with a mask
and an XR with the

215
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.890
color bitmap. And so the
mass contained black pixels everywhere

216
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.780
you wanted color to show
through. So if you ran

217
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.600
into a problem with the
color part, all you got

218
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.940
was the mass part, which
all it did was set

219
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.670
pixels. The black, this is
the job of the mask

220
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.140
was to set pixels to
black. And the job of

221
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.390
the color part was to
start coloring them in again.

222
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.250
And so if you ran
out of resources and the

223
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.440
color in part, all you
got was stuff, getting set

224
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.130
to black. And now the
icons now through the magic

225
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.740
of Boolean algebra, that whole
and thing it's really easy

226
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.420
to make too. Let's get
that at community college. I'm

227
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.700
going to look into this
bullying, everyone marked book, Boolean,

228
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.230
algebra, let's all Google for
that. Find out what they

229
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.910
think. Even the new math
it's just called true false

230
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.500
algebra. Oh, Like an if
statement, we're all smiling. It's

231
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.410
too judgmental. We just like
to call it whenever. Whenever

232
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.520
Raymond has a standup career
on the side, in his

233
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.500
mind, I kill him Poughkeepsie.
Absolutely. And I was at

234
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.010
Carl said, try the veal,
tip your waitress. You know,

235
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.720
a lot of people would
pick on Explorer. They pick

236
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.430
on it a lot and
I'm sure you must, you

237
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.560
must get that. Yeah. I
pick on it a lot.

238
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.200
Well, Some people call it
the exploders sometimes it crashes.

239
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.330
One of the things I
get frustrated with is when

240
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.480
someone, I always like to
anthropomorphize Back in the old

241
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.140
days, we also called it
file damager Oh, That's brutal,

242
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.450
dude. We're at Mike we're
on Microsoft campus and we're

243
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.550
talking like this it's bad.
We actually, Oh, you know,

244
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.190
over lunch or over beer
or over beer at lunch.

245
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.360
Often as many people do
spend our time trying to

246
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.820
come up with derogatory terms
for our products around the

247
00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.220
world. And it turns out
there are a lot of

248
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.230
Microsoft products that we're familiar
with. So we spend a

249
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.150
lot of time coming up
with derogatory names for them.

250
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.490
Part of it is just
to desensitize ourselves so that

251
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.930
when we hear it out
in the wild, we don't

252
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.100
feel so bad. Cool. So,
so tell me why Explorer

253
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.790
seems to lock up, particularly
when it's enumerating drives. I

254
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.280
open up the little plus
I, it goes off and

255
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.770
then suddenly up, sorry, your
CD is, I don't know,

256
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.150
what's wrong with a sheet
of your, your kid put

257
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.400
a sandwich in it and
I can't show the next

258
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.850
drive The sandwich and the
CD. You know, that was

259
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.390
me actually. I was, well,
I part, part of it

260
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:12.120
is, is that the, the
shell is heavily based on

261
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.350
comm and specifically apartment model
comm. And one of the

262
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.250
advantages of apartment model calm
is that everything happens on

263
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.640
a single thread in Commonweal.
We'll make sure that your

264
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.260
objects are in fact, you
have to observe the rule

265
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.820
that your objects are used
on the thread they were

266
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.500
created on, which makes it
very easy to implement your

267
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.320
objects. The downside of this
is that it's kind of

268
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.220
stuck to a threat and
we're kind of stuck with

269
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.060
this design because that's what
we've had since windows 95.

270
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.030
There are thousands upon thousands
of shell extensions out there

271
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:47.250
that are relying on department
threading and pull incredibly evil

272
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.490
tricks that breakdown if we
ever put them on some

273
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.070
other thread. So we're kind
of stuck with putting a

274
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.280
lot of things on the,
on the UI thread. We've

275
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.720
been working to move things
off, but, and I, and,

276
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.050
and in, in windows Vista,
in fact, in windows XP,

277
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.980
as I recall, at least
folder enumeration was done on

278
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.950
in the background. And I
believe tree expand. I can't

279
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.590
remember what the weather tree
expansion was in, in the

280
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.400
background or not. But I
definitely remember that back in

281
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.920
the old days when the
address bar was just a

282
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.820
DRS combo box, that when
you click that you, it,

283
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.400
it took time to spin
up all the drives to

284
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.180
get the icons and the
volume information, because that, that

285
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.590
is, that is clearly pending
upon a, an action. You

286
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.560
click the button, the dropdown
has to drop down and

287
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.420
if it drops down, it's
got to have stuff in

288
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.640
it. So you're, you're kind
of stuck on that one,

289
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.230
but yeah. Have to have
stuff in it. Can it

290
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.300
say I'm working on it?
For example, I know that

291
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.140
Mark Russinovich did a big
thing on his blog recently,

292
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.910
where, when he is a
user and he's not on

293
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.290
the domain, explore hangs for
11 seconds while someone tries

294
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.780
to figure out what his
real name is. So they

295
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.530
can go and say, see,
user's domain. You know, my

296
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.570
name Mark, <inaudible> his name
slash my documents. And when

297
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.500
he's off the domain, he's
not connected. He's not, he

298
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.420
has no network connection. It
hangs realizes he's not in

299
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.290
the network. 11 seconds later,
it goes C users. Mark

300
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.810
are the actual folder name.
The part of the problem

301
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.300
with that is sort of
goes back to the behavior

302
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.680
changes and, and, and the,
the function function design upfront

303
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.990
is that somebody calls the,
give me the name for

304
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.590
this, for this thing. And
you have to give them

305
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.440
an answer you can't say,
or, you know, you, you

306
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.660
could, but as it was
originally, as the function was

307
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.890
originally designed, the guy asks
you, what's the name for

308
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.800
this folder? And you give
him an answer. And there

309
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.930
is, if you decide to
add a new answer called,

310
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.350
I don't know, it would
take too long or it

311
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.550
later, yeah. Try it. Or
are, you know, this, this

312
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.920
might take a while you
should do this on a

313
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.850
background thread. Then all the
people who don't know about

314
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.670
this behavior will just start
getting. So, so if the

315
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.850
assumption is that I've got
a limited number of milliseconds

316
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.550
before I have to get
this dropdown back to the

317
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.090
user. And if UI responsiveness
is the number one priority,

318
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.830
forgetting for a moment about
the inconvenience of just procedure

319
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.240
calls in general, in the
sense that they have to

320
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.650
have a well known return
type. If someone's, if someone

321
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.330
could Institute a, if you
can't get this back to

322
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.880
me in 300 milliseconds and
just stop bail, and I'll

323
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.860
never talk to you again,
and I'll make something up,

324
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.160
like the default answer, Separate
cars should be able to

325
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.500
predict the future, will this
call to get username take

326
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.750
more than 300 mils. So
this is the Heisenberg uncertainty

327
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.870
principle of dropdown lists. No,
it's, it's, it's more like

328
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.220
life would be a lot
easier if we had time

329
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.730
machines. It would. I mean,
there are plenty of things

330
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.330
I would change. Like what,
I don't know, because on

331
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.960
the other hand I might
accidentally destroy myself. It's, it's,

332
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.650
it's kind of a, It's
a, it's a it's it

333
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.170
would probably kill your own
grandfather. I N yeah. I

334
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.460
accidentally accidentally I would sneeze
and, and create this horrific

335
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.760
epidemic or something Going back.
So thanks. Thinking about time

336
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.470
machines for a second, everyone
thought, and by everyone, within

337
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.100
the context of this room,
that would be me thought

338
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.970
that all the icons in
Vista would be vectors. And

339
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.250
when, when, and I think
I thought that either someone

340
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.760
said it, or they said,
there'll be scalable. And I

341
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.790
had a flashback to prodigy,
and I said, Oh, awesome,

342
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.250
vectors. Those are great. I
hear those are doing good

343
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.850
things. So I just assumed
that there would be some

344
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.700
slider bar somewhere, and I
would just gleefully slide it

345
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.100
back and forth with my
giant icons going bigger and

346
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.530
smaller and bigger and smaller.
And in fact, in Vista,

347
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.410
there's an icon formats got
to be quite quite a

348
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:50.460
package. The icon format, this
has actually changed, not too

349
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.770
much. And that's, and I
think we may have, we

350
00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.030
may have changed it too
much, even then the icon

351
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:05.730
format. It has been stable
since when, since the beginning

352
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.750
of windows. So I can
put 1,024 by thousand 24

353
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.260
icon in an icon format.
There's a format Up, up,

354
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.960
up until when is Vista,
when we added PNG icons

355
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.530
as the first incompatible change
of the icon format up

356
00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.720
through windows XP, you could
take your, you could take

357
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.970
those icons and whack them
on a, on a windows

358
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.000
1.0 machine, and you'll, you'll
be able to come up

359
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.550
with icon. So the icon
format, it's a bag or

360
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.040
icons. You can have as
many icons as you want.

361
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.800
Yeah. Yeah. It's an icon
directory. And then there's a

362
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.200
header that describes how many
images there are and what

363
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.220
their sizes are and their
color depth. And all of

364
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.300
that has remained the same
up through windows XP and

365
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:48.210
windows, 2003 windows Vista. We
took a chance on adding

366
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.530
in a new icon format.
And in fact, our first

367
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.070
attempt was to fit it
in with the, to sort

368
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:59.390
of follow how the original
icon format sort of was

369
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.510
meant to be with, with
the appropriate, with, with a

370
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.340
header and then a pointer
to bits and have a

371
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.130
different, could you just put
different bits in there? Well,

372
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.900
we were actually going to
set them because they're in

373
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.330
the bit of info header,
there's a compression type field.

374
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.630
So we put ping in
the compression type field. And

375
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.290
it turns out that created
a lot of compatibility problems

376
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.240
Will be the third party
vendors, bitmap libraries, Some very

377
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:31.100
important, there is a very
popular icon editing tools that

378
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.150
when faced with icons that
had a compression type of

379
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.800
ping, just exploded. And it
turns out that that's not

380
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.680
something we sort of enjoy
it. So you just change

381
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.710
the format. So we had
to go back and, and

382
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.430
rejigger the format a little.
So that way the, the

383
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:53.420
file format was, I guess,
the problem was that the

384
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.690
way we originally put pings
port in, it looked too

385
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.180
much like an old fashioned
icon and that trick to

386
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.790
these programs and to thinking
that, Oh, I know what

387
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.690
this is. I know what
I'm doing. And so in

388
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.330
in fact, the solution to
compatibility was ironically to make

389
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.080
things slightly less compatible and,
and get these programs to

390
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.510
sort of panic and back
out before, before they got

391
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.230
into too much trouble it's
So you designed the format

392
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.170
such that We actually designed
the format. So it wouldn't,

393
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.620
so it didn't follow the
intended expansion design of the

394
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:29.120
icon format, But also in
such a way that, well,

395
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.100
but also in such a
clever though, in the sense

396
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.990
of what's like, it's like
the gift format. And I

397
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.710
don't say, I don't say
Jif. I don't, I don't

398
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.080
believe that that's, I don't
think many people even say

399
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.170
it as much anymore. Well,
I just said it. Okay.

400
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.690
And I'll say it again.
So the gift format, I

401
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.100
remember back in the day,
they, they added a notations

402
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.610
at the end, they like
GIF 89, eight stuck a

403
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.200
bunch of stuff. We can
put notes on the end

404
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.240
of your gift. And it
wasn't part of the original

405
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.820
format or something. So basically
they, they figured out that

406
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.090
if we put it here,
nobody will know here, here

407
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.980
they'll hit it. Let me
know exactly they'll hit the

408
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.990
no, and they'll go, Oh,
that's cool. I would think

409
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.090
it's so fun to make
those kinds of, you know,

410
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.240
we made this backwards compatible
in that no one blows

411
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.980
up when we read it,
Because we put it in,

412
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.240
in a place that most
people consider to be junk.

413
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.810
Anyway. Exactly. There's, there's a
lot of hunting for junk

414
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.700
that goes on when you
need to expand a file

415
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.670
format, or, I mean, especially
one of these older file

416
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.180
formats that everybody knows in
quotation marks where you would

417
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.760
think that, Oh, well, we
can just use this bit

418
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.210
over here. And that indicates
a new format over there.

419
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.960
But no, because everybody knows
this file format Hard to

420
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.180
make a binary, to expand
a binary format. It's kind

421
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.130
of like, I, you know,
you don't know about this,

422
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.470
but cause, cause you don't
know about anything, that's not

423
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.230
in the shell, right? You
refused to answer all questions.

424
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.870
I was gonna mention office
of the office format. They

425
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.060
took structured storage and they
basically used the office format.

426
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.700
If you make a doc
doc X file, you go

427
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.990
to word type, hello, world,
save as food dot docx.

428
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.440
Right? It's a zip file.
You can rename it, dot

429
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.360
zip, open it up. There's
a whole directory structure and

430
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.040
there's stuff in there. What
a clever way to make

431
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.280
an expandable. That's really smart.
It is. But there's all

432
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.990
the overhead of the zipping
and the zip headers and

433
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.310
all that kind of stuff
from the point of view

434
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.650
of something. And then you're
also stuck with, you know,

435
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.630
you can't add any new
compression formats at this point.

436
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.150
Exactly. So at some point
the binary bits have to

437
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.040
be here. You're stuck with
it. Yeah. You're not going

438
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.320
to go and make the,
the orange or the RAR

439
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.700
or the, the, or You
know, those other fantastic acronyms.

440
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.090
That mean nothing to me
really don't mean anything to

441
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.220
you. You want a Dodge
TSR guy. He didn't want

442
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.370
a desk view back in
the day doing before you

443
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.170
just like appeared in at
Microsoft in 1990. I mean,

444
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.890
I can tell a story
about desk view. Let's hear

445
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:45.270
it. Desk view is the
sister request sheet. That's Russo,

446
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.950
you know, you've had this
keyboard and there's a button

447
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.680
called sister request. What is
that for? That's for desk

448
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.230
view the purpose of CIS
requests as it was originally

449
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.530
designed, as I understand it
was to be sort of

450
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.160
a way to get the
attention of the controlling operating

451
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.730
system. So it was sort
of like the old fashioned

452
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.790
idea of what the, what
we now call the Shakira

453
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.880
attention sequence. The, the thing
that, you know, only, only

454
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.270
the operating system listens to
and control delete. Yeah. So,

455
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.090
and as I understand it,
desk view is the only

456
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.930
program that actually used SIS
requests to mean, okay, I

457
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.750
want to, you know, call
up the desk view menu

458
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.260
thing and nobody else paid
this request any attention at

459
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.900
all, but there it is
on your keyboard sitting around,

460
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.120
waiting for somebody to press
it. And then of course

461
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.520
you press it. And nothing
happens because no program cares

462
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.800
about either. Can you, Can
you do something with it?

463
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.720
I mean, I've never seen
a high draw, a smiley

464
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.300
face on it. I've never
seen a hockey program say

465
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.190
that'd be great. They overload
the hell out of the

466
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.560
windows key, but I've got
a, I've got a brand

467
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.340
spanking new Lenovo laptop here
with a little blue function

468
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.470
key and just request it's
just there waiting for me.

469
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.800
I thought it was like
a well there's print screen

470
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.010
at all print screen. I
thought it had something to

471
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.670
do with that. No, no
print print screen used to

472
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.370
be on the asterisk key.
It was back in the

473
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.580
old back in the ancient
ancient days. This was, this

474
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.110
is why you always had
to have a printer hooked

475
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.010
up to your computer and
ready because I, if you

476
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.900
can go, you can go
search on the internet, find

477
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:12.460
pictures of those really, really
old keyboards and the right

478
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.130
hand shift key was not
a huge key. Like it

479
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.200
is today. It was the
size of a normal key.

480
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.990
And next to it to
the right was a key

481
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.350
that had an asterisk when
unshifted and was print screen

482
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:27.460
when shifted. So if you
are a sloppy typist, your

483
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.260
right pinky would reach with
the shift key. It would

484
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.330
slip too far and it
would hit the shift key

485
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.530
and the asterisk, which meant
print screen. That's good design.

486
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.620
Yeah. So you'd be sitting
there minding your own business,

487
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.980
typing away, and then your
machine would lock up because

488
00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.710
it's waiting for your printer
and no, it didn't make

489
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.680
any noise. It just sat
there sound okay. Under the

490
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.120
old dot matrix printers and
they go ne Oh, that

491
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.310
all of the dots. I
just remember they, they eat,

492
00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:00.160
eat. I don't, I don't
remember all the, the head

493
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.210
moving around, not doing anything.
That was That's good design.

494
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.740
If you read what's up,
did you read the design

495
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.540
of everyday things? I'm sure
you probably have that around

496
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.430
here somewhere. Yeah. The teapot
book, the TES it's it's,

497
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.730
it's a fantastic book That
kind of D I love

498
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.490
that kind of stuff. There's
this there's such legendary designed

499
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.850
applications that just really pushed
the limit like Microsoft bot.

500
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.800
Oh, Bob. Yeah. Bob, Bob
was, Bob was a product

501
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.870
ahead of its time. It
was clearly, it was, it

502
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.070
was, it was sort of
too revolutionary for its own

503
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:36.970
good <inaudible> was, was under
appreciated and, and has now

504
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.020
been supplanted by YouTube now,
but believe it or not,

505
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.500
Bob is not dead. Everybody.
If you have your windows

506
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.280
XP CD, there is a
copy of Bob on that

507
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.900
CD. What does a copy
of Bob doing on my

508
00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:01.240
Microsoft windows? SPCD so after
consulting with all the translators

509
00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.730
and you know, all the
other people who would need,

510
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.370
who would need to have
space on the CD, we

511
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.410
noticed that while there was
some empty space on the

512
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:14.440
CD. So look, we paid
for the CD. We may

513
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.700
as well put stuff on
it. And as a, as

514
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.400
a, as sort of one
of the sort of lame

515
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.310
attempts at slowing down, people
who like to, you know,

516
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.910
make it illegal copies, we
were going to, we, we

517
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.840
put some, you know, dummy
files or dummy data on

518
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.390
the CD and set up
with check that the dummy

519
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.450
data was still there to
make it. So that way,

520
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.150
if you were to make
a copy of the CD,

521
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.130
you still had to make
a copy, including all the

522
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.800
dummy data. And you know,
when people are transferring files

523
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.410
over 56 K modems, an
extra 30 Meg of dummy

524
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.890
data sort of slows you
down. Not that that slows

525
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.660
people down much anymore. And
the dummy data is Microsoft.

526
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.370
Bob, the person who had
to come up with a

527
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.710
dummy data was looking around
for about, you know, he's

528
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.080
like, I, I need, I
don't remember if it was

529
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.680
30 mag or something. It
was, but he said, I

530
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.670
need a Corpus of dummy
data. Where am I going

531
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.950
to find some dummy data?
And he could have called

532
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:18.420
Crip, gen random and generated
10 Meg of Crip, gen

533
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.900
random data. But there's no
fun in that. So instead

534
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.070
he went to the internal
release servers, went through the

535
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.640
archives and found a copy
of Microsoft Bob and took

536
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.340
all of the Microsoft Bob
floppies, which comes out to,

537
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.240
I don't know, whatever, whatever
size he needed, but of

538
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.010
course, Microsoft, Bob floppies, aren't
very random. So he encrypted

539
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:46.530
them using key by typing,
smashing his hand on the

540
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.540
keyboard and generating keys that
he will never be able

541
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.080
to reproduce again and out
came a, an encrypted copy

542
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.280
of Microsoft, Bob, which has
the nice property that the

543
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.400
contents are kind of are
closer to random. It's still

544
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.570
not cryptographically random, but it
was messed up enough. And

545
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.010
that's what went into the
unused spaces on the CD

546
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.130
as ballast data. So if
you go and find your

547
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.400
copy of windows XP that
you bought in the store

548
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.050
and you know where to
look and I myself don't

549
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:23.730
know where, cause I just
heard this story. And if

550
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.190
you can somehow mash your
hand on the keyboard and

551
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.880
exactly the right way out
will come a copy of

552
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:35.280
Microsoft, Bob. That's fantastic. So
Microsoft, Bob one might say

553
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.010
that windows XP has been
the most effective Microsoft Bob

554
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.740
delivery system. Bob has everywhere.
Bob is everywhere. It's stories,

555
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.050
it's stories like that, that
make the book so great.

556
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.280
You know, I've got the,
you know, your, your book,

557
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.460
the old new thing that
some people are calling the

558
00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.300
new old thing, You know,
I'm, I I'm, I'm sort

559
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.410
of learning to get used
to it. I've I've I

560
00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.570
haven't why is it called
the old new thing it's

561
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.020
called the, the title of
the blog was in fact

562
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:09.110
determined in about 35 seconds.
Brad Abrams said, Raymond, you

563
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.620
should start doing this blog
thing. And I said, Whoa,

564
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.690
you really think so. I'm
not sure he said, yeah,

565
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.050
just do it. And so
I started filling out the

566
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.980
paperwork to, to set up
the blog. And one of

567
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.330
the questions is so what's
its title. I said, I

568
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:31.250
didn't realize it needed a
title. And I just made

569
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.740
up the phrase, the old
new thing on the principle

570
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.860
that I was going to
be writing about old stuff,

571
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.760
but stuff that at one
time was new. And so

572
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:46.210
the old new thing is
talking about things that back

573
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.970
in the day were the
new thing. So that's, that's

574
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.530
sort of where the name
comes from. Well, it's, it's

575
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:54.120
huge. I know I was
just sitting here and we

576
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.890
were looking at your stats
and you're becoming more and

577
00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.860
more popular. People enjoy reading
it. The book has new

578
00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.470
content and you revise some
of the stories. It's very

579
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.560
well organized, I guess, Joel,
even Joel, Spolsky Joel on

580
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.960
software, you know, these, the
pundits are noticing you you're

581
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.180
becoming a power broker in
the blogosphere. Yeah. I can

582
00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.090
always tell whenever Joel makes
a reference to one of

583
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.220
my stories because all of
a sudden they start showing

584
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.450
up in, you know, all
these other data mining stuff.

585
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:24.450
And like recently he, he
retold the story of that,

586
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.330
that I, that I shared.
And it's, it's in the

587
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.120
book it's on the blog
about blowing the dust out

588
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.150
of the connector is a
way to get people to

589
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:39.480
double check things as sort
of the, the, the catchall

590
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.210
description for getting people to
check things that they would

591
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.370
normally resist checking on the
assumption that it would make

592
00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:48.090
them look stupid. No, you
would say, is it plugged

593
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.250
in? And of course, they're
gonna say, well, of course

594
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.490
it's plugged in. I'm not
that stupid and they're not

595
00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.380
going to check. And if
you're, you know, you have

596
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.850
a pretty good feeling that
it's not plugged in. So

597
00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.250
you, you tell them, well,
you know, sometimes the connector

598
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.390
gets kind of dusty. Could
you get down there, unplug

599
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.540
it, blow into the connector
to get the dust out

600
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.540
and then, and then plug
it back in and maybe

601
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.390
that'll clear it up and
they'll go down there. They'll

602
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.840
notice that it's not plugged
in or Vale. Or if

603
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.580
it was plugged into the
wrong port, they'll unplug it.

604
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.250
They blow it to the
connector. Then they plug it

605
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.170
back in. Now they're paying
attention. Now they're going to

606
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.610
plug it into the correct
part. They come back and

607
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:28.110
all works and they think
you're great and everybody's happy.

608
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:33.810
And nobody loses face. There
was. I remember there was

609
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.200
another story about a different
type of support calls somebody

610
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:43.860
had called in to the,
to report a geopolitical error

611
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.990
in the maps used in
flight simulator. And if you've

612
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.110
been following what I've been
writing, you know, the maps

613
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.590
and we hit upon it
earlier, maps are extremely sensitive

614
00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.180
data. And in general, if
you can get away without

615
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.150
using a map, that would,
that, that that's often the

616
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:05.070
safest bet. But if you're
a flight simulator and the

617
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.170
object of the game is
to fly around the world,

618
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.290
you kind of have to
have maps. And somebody had

619
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.740
called in to report that
there was some sort of

620
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:19.200
border problem on, on, on
the map. And they got

621
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.710
the, you know, the, the
report came in, it went

622
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:28.080
through the normal bug report
analysis thing and the response

623
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.480
and the person got the
response saying that, you know,

624
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.970
thank you for, thank you
for reporting the problem. We've

625
00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.090
taken a look at it.
And we believe that there

626
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.250
is that everything is just
fine, that the map is

627
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:42.200
correct. This person was sort
of unsatisfied with this answer.

628
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.650
And instead of going through
the normal escalation procedures sent

629
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.970
mail to bill Gates, bill
reads his email, or at

630
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.620
least enough of it gets
to him that when this

631
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.470
issue came up to bill
Gates, he went back to

632
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.810
the flight SIM team and
said, I want to know

633
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.690
what's going on here. And
the flight SIM team are

634
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:06.380
like, okay, we thought we
had taken care of this,

635
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.110
but apparently this person decided
to sort of, you know,

636
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.930
just take their case straight
to the Supreme court. And

637
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.410
they went back and looked
at it again and called

638
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.150
the guy back and tried
to get more information about

639
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.910
why he thinks the map
is wrong. You know, which

640
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.220
map there we do. Cause
we're using this map and

641
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.870
you know, where do you
think the border should be?

642
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.670
And at the end of
the day, it turned out

643
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:30.080
that this person was basing
his map information upon a

644
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.750
map of the world shower
curtain that he had in

645
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:37.130
his bathroom said shower curtain
was a couple of years

646
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.830
old and hadn't been kept
up to date with the

647
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:45.350
latest changes in borders in
Eastern Europe. So that's yeah.

648
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.980
So, you know, and bill
was involved and, and this

649
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.440
would normally not have been
a problem except you, you

650
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.600
bring in bill and everybody
goes on high alert and

651
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.450
you know, he's still doesn't
answer my emails. Yeah. Well

652
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.180
you need to stop opening
them with like, Hey loser.

653
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.370
Oh, that's my problem. Yeah.
Well, listen, Raymond, I really

654
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.170
appreciate you taking the time
out of your day. I

655
00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.420
know that you're busy, busy,
you've got all sorts of

656
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.740
stack dumps and stuff up
on your screen here. Yes.

657
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.200
I put it in lab
dumps up just to look

658
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.480
into it Does look impressive.
Yeah. There's highlights and stuff

659
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.460
with like, Oh yeah. That's
the offset into whatever. Yeah.

660
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.790
Yeah. I mentioned I can
read assembler with just with

661
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:25.420
my eyes closed, but listen,
the book is fantastic. And

662
00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.310
I don't just say that
because the author sitting right

663
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:32.560
here, I really enjoyed it.
And it's, it's honestly, I

664
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.600
probably shouldn't say this, but
it's, it's a great bathroom

665
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.350
book because it's got little
short stories that was actually

666
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:40.600
kind of the goal. It
was, It was not meant

667
00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.190
to be a book. You
sit down and plow through

668
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.950
all at one go. It's
meant to be a book

669
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:48.880
that you sort of read
as time permits. And that's

670
00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:50.590
exactly what it's allowing me
to do. And I really

671
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.720
enjoy the stories. I think
it's great. And I really

672
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.400
appreciate your time. Thanks a
lot. Thank you.
