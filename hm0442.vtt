00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.490
I wanted to take just
a moment to talk to

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.150
you about one of my
favorite conferences, angle brackets. It's

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.390
in Las Vegas this year,
November 10th, through the 13th, we've

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.280
got some amazing speakers. We've
got Scott Guthrie, Michelle Bustamante, Kathleen

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.300
dollar Douglas Crockford is joining
us again. This fall, Julie

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.050
Lurman, Elijah Manor, and many,
many more. It's also a

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.260
nice conference because it is
co located with dev intersections,

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.660
which means that if you
register for ankle brackets, that

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.860
angle brackets.org, you can go
back and forth seamlessly to

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.080
sessions with endeavor intersection. So
you get to go to

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.560
both conferences. If you register
by October 20th, you get the

12
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.530
early bird bonus. And if
you get the show package,

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.320
you'll get your choice of
a surface, a Dell venue,

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.190
pro eight or an Xbox
one. Lots of great reasons

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.710
to check out angle brackets.
We'll have lots of keynotes.

16
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.980
We'll have meetups and open
spaces, lots and lots of

17
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.830
sessions. You might even want
to check out a pre-conference

18
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.490
or post-conference workshop. Bring the
family, hang out by the

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.230
pool at the MGM grand.
We're going to have a

20
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.780
lot of fun. We're going
to talk about the open

21
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.430
web there'll be conference sessions
on angular JS on breeze

22
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.750
on jQuery on the next
version of asp.net. Lots of

23
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.130
open source, lots of fun
stuff. It's an angle brackets.org,

24
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.970
November 10th through the 13th. Now
is the time tell your

25
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:37.050
boss you want to go
to angle brackets. <inaudible> from

26
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.570
hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes, a
weekly discussion with web developer

27
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.950
and technologists. Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number

28
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
four 45. In this episode,
Scott talks with bow head

29
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.260
about CSS animation. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

30
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.000
another episode of Hansel minutes,
and I'm here at the

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.850
blend conference in Charlotte, North Carolina.
And I'm talking with Val

32
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.340
head. How are you? Good.
How are you doing Scott?

33
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.770
Fantastic. Fantastic. Having lots of
fun here at the conference.

34
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.890
Yeah, it's been a great
first day in event. It's

35
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.640
been fun. So you're a
user experience, expert or designer.

36
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.590
Do you CSS, you do
all of these kind of

37
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.440
things. What are you talking
about at blend? Well, I'm

38
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.780
talking tomorrow near the end
of the day, and I'm

39
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.650
talking about a UI animation
for the web. So animating

40
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.650
our interfaces that we design
and develop for our websites

41
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.410
and how we can do
that using web standards, which

42
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.740
is kind of basically my
favorite thing ever. It seems

43
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.680
like there was a time
when, anytime we can animate

44
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.150
something, we will try to
do it. So like, it

45
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.610
seems like flash was like
invented just so we could

46
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.220
fly things around the page.
And as soon as we

47
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.440
learned that we could, we
abused it. Yes. Yeah. Flash

48
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.120
sort of has a bad
rap for that. Right. You

49
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.360
know, all the flash intros
and everything, but, and I

50
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.360
mean, some, most, yeah, most
of those were completely terrible

51
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.820
and awful, but I think
in one, on one side

52
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.160
of it, we were trying
to do something. And then

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.020
when we made those intros,
you know, we were looking

54
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.760
for a creative way to,
you know, convey our message,

55
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.220
convey what the site was
about, what that company was

56
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.640
about to people visiting, perhaps
not the best choice in

57
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.760
hindsight, maybe a terrible choice.
But, you know, I think,

58
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.160
I think we learned a
lot from that, both in

59
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.070
the fact that like motion
is an expressive way to

60
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.960
convey design and you know
what, you're all about intros.

61
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.480
Maybe not really the way
to do it though. They're

62
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.100
kind of coming back Really.
Yeah. The big, like JavaScript

63
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.530
loading in trouble, Not quite
as bad. We've, we've definitely

64
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.260
learned some lessons. There's not
the big loading, like how,

65
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.450
and up to a hundred,
that takes five years. But

66
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.420
a lot of these, a
lot of like iOS apps

67
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.030
or, you know, just general
mobile apps who are their

68
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.910
sites basically are just to
promote their app. Right. So

69
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.860
they'll have a lot of
sites that really, what they're

70
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.530
trying to do is tell
the story of why their

71
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.610
product exists and what they're
creating are essentially like intros,

72
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.590
but better because they have
a lot of motion. They're

73
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.990
kind of telling this more
or less linear story of

74
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.240
like, here's my app. Here's
why you might want it

75
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.570
go download it. And I
think that's really interesting. It's

76
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.020
like intros 2.0, but like
actually using, It seems like

77
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.000
a lot of the, the
first time you've ever been

78
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.430
here or first time you've
run type controls. Are those,

79
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.170
those kind of interests, I
guess this is an iOS

80
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.350
app. Look how friendly I
am. Here's an arrow. Welcome.

81
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.730
You want to push here?
You want to do that

82
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.060
in case you weren't familiar
with the hamburger icon. That's

83
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.070
what this is. Yeah. There's
a lot of those too.

84
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.390
I mean, that's a whole
other use for it as

85
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.140
well as these kind of
instructional type things. And I

86
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.730
know I did a lot
of flash back in the

87
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.590
day and that was probably,
I did a ton of

88
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.260
those, of like how to
use this software and we're

89
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.470
kind of still doing it.
You know, we, I'm sure

90
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.090
some people would say, if
you need to do that,

91
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.310
there's a problem with your
UX. I don't know if

92
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.590
that's really a hard, fast
black and white rule, but

93
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.280
you know, it's, it's, there's
still tons of use for

94
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.910
these things like intros and
these kind of walkthroughs that

95
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.620
we ripped on flash for.
But it's like, you know

96
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.200
what? They weren't all bad.
We just need to pick

97
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.520
the good stuff. I remember
reading somewhere that motion and

98
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.360
quick cuts in children's cartoons.
Like the idea of like

99
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.570
camera one, camera, two camera,
two camera. One was that

100
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.510
the, when things happen in
the periphery of our vision,

101
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.970
it fires a certain part
of our brain that basically

102
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.600
says there could be a
predator. No, I think that's

103
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.240
true. I mean, I don't
know if I'm, I can't,

104
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.820
I can't think of the
exact studies, but I know

105
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.750
I've read stuff like that
too. And it's kind of

106
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.840
also why, you know, it's,
it's why those stupid banner

107
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.540
ads for like mortgages have
like the dancing dude or

108
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.470
why car dealerships how'd that
guy. Exactly. So it's like

109
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.470
motion is so powerful and
we've mostly used it for

110
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.780
evil on the web, if
you mean banner ad evil.

111
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.290
I don't know if that
counts as true evil, they're

112
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.220
generally pretty evil. So I
kind of like to convince

113
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.860
people, or, you know, just
tell people in my talks

114
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.500
about how we can use
that harness, that power for

115
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.320
good. And we can make
things that are really useful

116
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.830
and helpful and it doesn't
just have to banner ads

117
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.300
and intros and it just
really shouldn't be there. Actually,

118
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.550
There was a time when
post flash pre kind of

119
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.450
HTML five or pre-modern web
when jQuery was how people

120
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.820
did this, they would make
these tight loops and they

121
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.970
would animate CSS properties. And
then I'm hearing more and

122
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.670
more that that can cause
battery drain and power issues.

123
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.480
Then we now have CSS
animations. Is that the kind

124
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.540
of animations people should primarily
be looking at? Yeah, definitely.

125
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.760
I mean, it's, it's, it's,
it's a bit of a

126
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.040
confusing time. Cause like, you
know, like you said, we

127
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.140
had flash and that was
your only option for adding

128
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.260
animation. And then I got,
went away and like jQuery

129
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.290
was our only option for
animation. And now it's like,

130
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.420
you could use Java script,
you could use CSS, you

131
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.180
could use SVG. It's like,
there's so many things. And

132
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.910
then you can also animate
SVG with CSS or with

133
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.000
JavaScript. And then there's the
whole like canvas web GL

134
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.590
situation. So it's kind of
extremely overwhelming. It's extremely over.

135
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.830
And I'd like to understand,
like for what class of

136
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.080
animation you use, what technology,
and if I pick one

137
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.880
of these technologies, what if
I pick the wrong one?

138
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.280
Yeah. I think, I think
the good news is it's

139
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.030
pretty hard to pick the
wrong one entirely. And, and

140
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.100
also it's really hard. There's
not like one that's always

141
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.590
better. I mean, a lot
of the marketing stuff, especially

142
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.960
for some of these kind
of third party engines and

143
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.810
libraries are all like ours
is the best. It's faster

144
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.410
than CSS. And you're like,
but I mean, that kind

145
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.810
of doesn't matter, you know,
that's, it's just, we're always

146
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.620
using things like JavaScript and
CSS and HTML together on

147
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.190
the web. Cause that's how
the web is built and

148
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.350
you know, one being better
than the other isn't really

149
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.900
ever true. Cause no matter
what, you know, if you

150
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.570
make really poor decisions with
whatever tool you're using, you

151
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.370
can make it bad. Or
if you make really good

152
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.100
decisions, whatever tool you're using,
you can make it good.

153
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.430
So I don't know. I
like, I like to think

154
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.790
it's more about the person
making it. Well, I try

155
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.280
not to make my decisions
based on like micro benchmarks.

156
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.840
Like I can do this
a million times in a

157
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.630
loop way better than library
B. Yeah. But you're like

158
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.310
how many times are you
going to be doing a

159
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.080
million things? But part of
the reason why jQuery specifically

160
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.720
has kind of fallen out
of favor for that is

161
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.810
basically now browsers have gotten
a lot faster, like JavaScript

162
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.810
in general and this whole
request animation frame thing, which

163
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.560
jQuery animate doesn't use. So
it's kind of like, that's

164
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.270
part of the reason why
the battery drain and everything

165
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.790
happens. It's like, what is
that request? Animation frame it's

166
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.730
space. It's a little complicated,
but basically it's the browser

167
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.890
kind of keeping track of
a frame rate of when

168
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.550
things are updating and based
on, you know, various factors

169
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.250
of essentially how fast it
can update things and repaint

170
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.010
what needs to be repainted
or redraw paint might be

171
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.410
the wrong word there, but
whatever. And so if you

172
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.510
have something like jQuery animate,
that's just like trying to

173
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.150
do stuff a million times
a second, but maybe the

174
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.480
request animation frame can't stay.
Keep up to that rate.

175
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.900
You may be changing things
multiple times, like 50 times

176
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.500
and only be able to
see an update once. And

177
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.770
then you're doing all this
extra work and nobody can

178
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.600
see it. So let me
see if I can understand

179
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.860
that. So when I play
video games, some people say

180
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.020
you need to run at
a hundred frames a second,

181
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.170
but you know, it's going
to cause visual tearing. It's

182
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.060
not going to look right.
And it also is unnecessary

183
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.090
work. So I usually press
the it's called via line

184
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.180
sync. And it says, go
at the same speed that

185
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.610
my monitor can, can go.
My monitor can do 60

186
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.640
frames a second don't bother.
So you're saying that if

187
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.620
I write an animation in
a kind of a thoughtless

188
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.080
way, I could be trying
to animate something a thousand

189
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.660
times a second, but request
animation frame is going to

190
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.880
take 15 or 20 or
30 or whatever my computer

191
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.180
is capable of. Yeah. It's
really similar to that monitor

192
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.880
thing. It's like you can
ask the browser to change

193
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.150
things way faster than it
might be able to. So,

194
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.460
you know, when you're doing
things like actually you can

195
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.660
access the request, animation frame
information through JavaScript. I'm apparently

196
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.070
a lot of CSS animations
like internally in the browsers

197
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.370
are actually using that same
request, animation frame, I guess

198
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.010
engine, you might call it.
You can't reference it in

199
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.040
any way through CSS, but
many browsers take the CSS

200
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.820
animations. And while they are,
you know, interpreting or basically

201
00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.840
displaying your animation, they're using
that same internal mechanism. So

202
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.690
that's part of the reason
why CSS animations can also

203
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.450
be. So, you know, I'm
really efficient when it comes

204
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.060
to battery usage, all that
kind of stuff, right? The

205
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.430
browser do what the browser
is good at. Don't overthink

206
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.740
it. But it's like, and
I like to say that

207
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.530
the best thing about CSS
animations is it's all handled

208
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.440
in the browser. But the
worst thing about CSS animations

209
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.600
is that it's all handled
in the browser because you

210
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.970
know, you're handing that off.
You don't have that control.

211
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.660
The browser's taking care of
it. Sometimes it doesn't do

212
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.910
what you want to do.
And it's still completely possible

213
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.580
to create CSS animations that
will kill your battery. Like

214
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.120
there's no complete fail safe
way. If you try hard

215
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.900
enough, you can totally break
anything. I sometimes feel like

216
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:43.880
programmers who came from the
backend like myself, think procedurally,

217
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.160
I can write ifs and
fours and everything is from

218
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.010
top to bottom while designers
are more kind of big

219
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.700
picture and declarative CSS is
declarative and HTML is declarative.

220
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.160
So there's this mountain that
we're trying to drill a

221
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.560
hole through. I'm on one
side doing it. The procedural

222
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.080
way designers are trying to
do it. The declarative way.

223
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.110
CSS animation seemed like a
little of both. Like when

224
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.670
I run an animation though,
I want to write it

225
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.920
in code CSS is very
declarative, but CSS animations can

226
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.070
let you two key frames
and things. It's, it's still

227
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.920
a very declarative though. I
mean, when you're dealing with

228
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.560
CSS, animations and key frames
specifically, I mean, you write

229
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.840
out those key frames and
that key frame list is

230
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.570
there and you can be
like, Hey, assign the, this

231
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.370
list of key frames I
made. And key frames is

232
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.810
just like a list of
what you want to have

233
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.360
happen. Okay. Moment in time.
Right? Like at this point

234
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.920
it should look like that.
You may have a list

235
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.510
of three things you want
to have happen. You're like

236
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.520
the animation should do these
three things in this order.

237
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.620
And those are my key
frames. And you can take

238
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.780
those key frames and apply
them to, you know, any

239
00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.270
element on your page. That's
animatable, which is just about

240
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.360
anything these days, but you
can't change those key frames.

241
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.700
So they are, they are
declarative still. It's like, you're

242
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.530
like, here's, what's gonna happen.
You can assign it to

243
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.410
whatever you want. But those
that list you created is

244
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.670
never going to change. Yeah.
And you know, that's good

245
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.150
and that's bad sometimes that,
you know, sometimes that's perfect.

246
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.890
You're like, awesome. And that's
part of you, you can

247
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.680
rate this list of what
you want to have happen.

248
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.310
You're like, that's always what
I want to have happen.

249
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.350
But if you're in a
situation and you're like, well,

250
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.360
sometimes I want to do
this. And sometimes I want

251
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.080
to do that. Like then
CSS isn't maybe. So well-equipped,

252
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.810
you know, that's, that's where
the less declarative and more,

253
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.690
I'm not sure what the
opposite of declarative is. Yeah.

254
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.620
Or more flexible, more programmed
type thing. So that means

255
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.300
like if I'm going to
do really a data driven

256
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.920
animation, I might use SVG
and D three JS. Yeah.

257
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.930
And the kind of idea,
you know, with things like

258
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.570
JavaScript, you can create these,
I guess you might even

259
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.630
call them more like physic
physics based animations where like

260
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.240
here's your gravity and your
drag. And you know, it

261
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.720
kind of adapts more that
way, where CSS are just

262
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.960
like, here is your motion
and both, you know, both

263
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.670
are usable with when you're
in, when it comes to

264
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.630
animating UIs or creating any
animation, it's just two different

265
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.050
approaches. And there's many, there's
a big, huge gray area

266
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.700
where either one could go
and then there's kind of

267
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.920
outliers where you should probably
stick to one or the

268
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.320
other, Something I'm going to
want to use a tool

269
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.300
for like, like something that's
like an almost a mini

270
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.270
movie editor that's going to
then generate some crazy CSS.

271
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.720
Or do I write this
in a text editor? Unfortunately,

272
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.420
there isn't anything. There isn't
a good visual editor yet.

273
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.870
And that actually really annoys
me because I don't think

274
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.540
it should be, especially for,
you know, something where you're

275
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.700
writing declarative key frames and
making this list ahead of

276
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.400
time. Why should it be
a requirement that you have

277
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.260
to do that in code?
Like why can't someone who

278
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.200
thinks more visually, you know,
visually have a timeline in

279
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.470
front? No, the only editor
I've seen, that's even closer

280
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.800
to that. Isn't technically a
CSS editor. It's Google's editor

281
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.030
that you use to make
banner ads. Oh yeah. What,

282
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.390
what do they call that
web designers? It's cut some

283
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.700
strange name, The name that
makes you feel like it

284
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.570
cares about you Google web
designer, and then you download

285
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.600
it and it's like, make
banner ads. I'm like, Oh,

286
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.600
this is a thing to
make flashy Geico ads. Yeah.

287
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.150
That's not what I wanted.
There's a couple almost tools

288
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.900
there's that Adobe has edge
animate, which is also timeline

289
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.810
based. Interestingly, it just spits
out a bunch of Dwayne

290
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.810
jQuery animation. So it's still
browser based, but it doesn't

291
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.810
give you CSS animation right
now. It may in the

292
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.960
future, I kind of hope
it does. Apparently Mozilla is

293
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.680
working on an in-browser CSS,
animation editor of some kind.

294
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.630
Isn't not the way though.
It's all going to be

295
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.000
in browser. Even things like
some of the edge tools

296
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.180
are just, you know, the,
the browser in a frame.

297
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.940
And I guess Mozilla has
some kind of web audio

298
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.140
editing tool already. So I'm
interested to see what their

299
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.180
animation one looks like. Cause
that's a huge, that's a

300
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.360
huge gap in the tools
we have to create CSS

301
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.850
based animation right now is
like you got code it.

302
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.730
And I think that's kind
of unfair. Like why should

303
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.310
you have to? So the
kinds of things that I

304
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.740
might want to do are
really, you know, move things

305
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.400
around, make things, poles or
glow, but then also more

306
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.860
sophisticated, like maybe even a
character or a basic character

307
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.060
animation, how complicated can it
get? It can get pretty.

308
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.280
It kind Of, I feel
like the CSS animations are

309
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.650
the biggest limit is your
patients to write key frames

310
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.260
really? Because you can essentially,
you know, you, you can

311
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.420
go from zero to a
hundred percent and you can

312
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.670
have decimals. So you're effectively
can have nearly, I don't

313
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.860
know, basically infinite number of
key frames. There probably is

314
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.570
a limit, but I'm sure
you'd get tired of writing

315
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.880
them before you hit that.
So it can get pretty

316
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.490
complex and you can do
a lot of complex transforms

317
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.480
with 'em with CSS transforms.
It's it's actually pretty impressive.

318
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.450
It's it's really more your
patients to write it out

319
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.280
since you do have to
do it by hand and

320
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.340
it is declarative. So if
you want to edit things,

321
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.740
that can be kinda messy
too. So that's kind of

322
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.570
the big thing that's missing
is like a really handy

323
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.890
editor for changing this stuff
without driving yourself crazy. So

324
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.210
let me, let me see,
even though we're on a

325
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.850
podcast and people can't hear
us, they can go to

326
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.890
your website and they can
look at your screencast. If

327
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.270
you've got screencasts on how
to do this, of course

328
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.420
it is funny to be
doing animation, but let's try

329
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.780
kind of two thought experiments.
So if I have a

330
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.810
button on my page and
someone shows up on the

331
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.700
page and let's say that
they're shitting around for 10

332
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.920
seconds and they haven't moved
yet. And they're like, they

333
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.990
haven't made their decision. So
I'm detecting the users, not

334
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.350
made the decision and I
want to make the button

335
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.920
kind of pulse, like get
larger and get smaller. How

336
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.800
would I even start doing
that in CSS animation? Well,

337
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.560
you probably want to oversize
should mention my screencast is

338
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.600
called all the right moves
and it is listed on

339
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.120
my site. It's a, it's
a dorky Tom cruise movie

340
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.580
reference. It's really funny. Have
you heard of it? Okay.

341
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.950
Most people haven't. I will
put that in the show

342
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.410
notes as well as a
link to the Tom cruise

343
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.680
scenes. But to do that,
you would definitely need two

344
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.870
things because you want to
detect that your user has

345
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.540
been inactive. So you'd probably
do that with JavaScript, somehow

346
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.910
tracking your most movement or
lack thereof, some kind of

347
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.150
timer or whatever. And then
you could do the animation

348
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.030
itself by writing some key
frames in CSS to do,

349
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.260
you know, transform like scale,
scale up and down. However

350
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.910
you want to do that.
Maybe a little bit of

351
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.020
a, you know, translation as
well. However, however crazy. Yeah,

352
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.670
because I guess I could,
I could have it wiggle

353
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.490
or get bigger. So like
X, Y scale, You have

354
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.700
that depth, like you can
do 3d transforms really easily

355
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.070
in CSS. It's actually the
easiest 3d ever it's like

356
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.890
rotate something on the yeah.
Seriously done. So then the

357
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.710
key frame, like would one
key frame be it in

358
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.920
its normal state? Yeah. I
like to start. There's kind

359
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.570
of a debate about that
as to whether you should

360
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.700
actually have a first key
frame at its initial state.

361
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.250
I think you should, because
it makes for me in

362
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.570
the way I think about
stuff and makes things a

363
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.460
lot easier. Some people are
like, Oh my God, you

364
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.080
wrote an extra line of
code. The world is going

365
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.090
to end. So, you know,
if you're the, on that,

366
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.490
if you're on that, Well,
I want to return to

367
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.500
that state. I want to
reference that state. It makes

368
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.450
sense to have it be
a state Having it there.

369
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.370
So you can have a
first key frame, could be

370
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.370
your existing state. And then
you might have, you know,

371
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.730
maybe like 30% or something,
you make it bigger, you

372
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.710
know, scale it up to
one 50 year. Maybe probably

373
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.420
like one 20 or something.
One 50 is a pretty

374
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.030
big increase. And then maybe
like 60% you go down

375
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.160
to like one 10. So
it's not just a straight,

376
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.200
linear back and forth, you
know, key frames. You can

377
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.850
kind of have these little
stages in and out, like

378
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.720
make a pulse a little
bit bigger, a little smaller,

379
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.370
and then, you know, have
it go back at the

380
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.590
end to its original state.
That's how I would do

381
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.690
it. I like having the
beginning and end state there

382
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.720
in my key frames. Cause
I I'm terrible at remembering

383
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.540
what I wrote. Like 10
lines up W quick kind

384
00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.390
of sideways sidebar. You brought
up something that I think

385
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.160
that you would find intuitive,
but I don't think everyone

386
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.220
who's listening would, which is
the, your as a, as

387
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.280
a non-designer person, my first
reaction is like, make it

388
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.340
bigger, make it smaller. And
it would end up looking

389
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.550
like this, like 1980s Wolf
and Stein where it just

390
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:27.410
goes, but there's like easing
in and easing out. Can

391
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.820
you talk about that a
little bit and how that

392
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.240
affects why it looks right
to us more than Well,

393
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.480
there's a, there's lots of
easing is basically kind of

394
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.800
like the key to making
animations look good for better,

395
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.410
for worse. The default easing
and CSS is ease, which

396
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.690
actually starts out slow as
fast as in the middle

397
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.140
and end slow. And that's
kind of like the there's

398
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.330
the, if you've ever heard
of the Disney principles of

399
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.210
animation and the illusion of
life, one of their main

400
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:57.080
principles is like start slow
in and slow out. Basically

401
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.840
the idea of in real
life, nothing starts moving at

402
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.480
full speed and it stops
at full speed. Everyone needs

403
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.610
to like speed up, hit
their full speed. And then

404
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.850
when they're going to stop,
they generally slow down. So

405
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.790
by using that kind of,
you know, ease, ease, and

406
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.980
he's out situation where you
start slow fastest in the

407
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.310
middle, that feels much more
natural. And of course there

408
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.680
like 500 different ways to
do ease and ease out

409
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.170
because we have the keywords
of like ease the keyword

410
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.990
of ease and ease out.
And then CSS also has

411
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.100
cubic Bezier curves where you
can essentially define nearly any

412
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.170
type of motion curve you
want. As long as it

413
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.000
only has two control points,
but there's still a lot

414
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.460
of options. So you can
adjust how fast you speed

415
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.070
up, how quickly you reach
your top speed and how

416
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.920
quickly you drop off to
slow down. So, and that's

417
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.320
kind of like the whole
personality or the, yeah. And

418
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.300
as those curves just described
as like a series of

419
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.580
numbers, like this kind of
thing. Yeah. It's four numbers.

420
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.130
You can the easiest way
to look at them as,

421
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.890
as motion graphs. And there's
a site called cubic bezier.com

422
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.360
that gives you the numbers
and the graph that you

423
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.750
can play with. There's also
Cesar, which is a fun

424
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.460
tool. I like it. That
it's a pun cause it's

425
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.460
like CSS, easing Caesar. Oh,
that's great. So there's a

426
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.410
few tools out there to
give you that visual connection,

427
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.380
because essentially the four numbers
reference the position of the

428
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.440
two control points of your
curve. But normal humans don't

429
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.750
generally think like that. I
like to see the curve.

430
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.840
Do you think seals and
basically wherever the graph or

431
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.090
the other curve is steepest,
you're going faster and wherever

432
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.910
it's flattest, you're going slower
and you have, you know,

433
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.490
a lot of competition. So
I'm trying to visualize that,

434
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.590
like I might want to
really start slow really, really

435
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.370
keeping it kind of ease
up, but then I want

436
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.480
you to end really quickly.
So that's like a gradual

437
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.480
start at plateau and then
a dropoff. I can describe

438
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.430
that curve in a bit.
Yeah. I would actually just

439
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.990
be kind of like a
ramp up and then straight

440
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.930
across the top because flat
is like, it's still going

441
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.480
in time, but the speed
has been slowed down. So

442
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.590
yeah, there's so many it's,
it's, there's so options you

443
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.950
can create for yourself there.
So the button's one example,

444
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.410
but that's a basic example
of one element. Let's say,

445
00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.750
I want to make a
little person, he's got a

446
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.060
head, he's got a torso
and he's got two legs.

447
00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.440
So it's circle rectangle, rectangle,
rectangle. Do I name those

448
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.330
elements and group them in
some way? Do I make

449
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.090
them SVG? Do I like
have like the head div

450
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.150
and the torso div and
then, but now I'm starting

451
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.570
to get like, is CSS
and HTML meant to be

452
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.610
used in this way? Cause
you see people making like

453
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.570
Mario entirely in CSS. It's
like, well, should you be

454
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.120
doing that? How would I
make that little man walk?

455
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.180
Well kind of how you
described, like you'd want to

456
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.210
have them in pieces essentially
very similar to how you

457
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:28.650
would, if you were going
to animate him and after

458
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.570
effects or something as well,
you know, you'd need, he

459
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.340
need to have separate limbs
or you're not gonna be

460
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.220
able to make them move.
And I actually have a

461
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.110
little example I use in
my workshop, I call Bob

462
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.900
the robot where we do
essentially that it's a fun,

463
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.430
it's a fun way to,
to, to play around with

464
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.560
key frames. You know, you're
making, you're making a robot

465
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.810
move who wouldn't want to
do that. And so we

466
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.300
have his, like his head,
his robot body, his arms

467
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.180
and his legs are all
separate things. We position them

468
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.480
all with CSS and then
create separate animations for essentially

469
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.790
each of his limbs and
his head. And he can,

470
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.540
So he's not, he doesn't,
he and the code don't

471
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.000
know he's attached. Like it
looks like he's walking only

472
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.060
because the key frames that
move his leg are ending

473
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.640
up in the same location
that is torso. But ultimately

474
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.860
they're not attached. They don't
know that there are no

475
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.980
vertices or No, there's nothing.
There's nothing like that. I

476
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.080
mean, usually it's probably going
to save you a lot

477
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.640
of time. If you stick
him in like a containing

478
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.800
div, in some ways you
can move the entire robot

479
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.780
as well. But yeah, you
know, your, your, your, your

480
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.320
HTML document doesn't know his
leg from a paragraph essentially.

481
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.100
So I guess that's kind
of weird, but you know,

482
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.380
everything is just an object
and you're just manipulating it

483
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.590
with these styles and, you
know, essentially marking up and

484
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.560
then styling it with CSS.
Just you're actually having this

485
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.830
time dimension in motion as
well In your talk that

486
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.440
you give on this, you
do talk. So there's also

487
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.530
workshops. And of course your
screencasts, what are some like

488
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.720
some dues and do nots?
What are some like, you

489
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.430
can do this, never do
this in CSS animation At

490
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.010
my do's. And don'ts are
usually more about making like

491
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.430
useful animation and animation. That's
like good quality and the

492
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.050
stuff people would want to
see in that you'd want

493
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.050
to make. Cause I feel
like, you know, just like

494
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.210
type and color and all
these things, animation is an

495
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.790
aspect of design we can
use to differentiate our products

496
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.190
and, and convey our message.
And if we use it

497
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.010
well, people, you know, it's
like, that's what makes something

498
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.500
that might've been okay to
be like amazing is when

499
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.220
you make these good decisions.
So I like to talk

500
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.070
about the do's and don'ts
so just things like, he

501
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.950
would always make sure you're
responding to the user in

502
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.620
a way that feels right.
You know, like create lots

503
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.870
of prototypes and see what's
happening. Like for your button

504
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.510
example, you know, create that
really fast and something like

505
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.330
code pen or a JSPM
whatever, and try it out.

506
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.090
Like when you, when you
aren't, you know, click on

507
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.340
it or when you're not
active for awhile, does it

508
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.370
feel like it's responding to
you when you click on

509
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:50.090
it? Does it feel like
it's actually, you know, doing

510
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.760
what you want or, or
being aware of your interaction?

511
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.130
And then secondly, is it
doing it in a way

512
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.500
that conveys the message you
sort of want, you know,

513
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.450
we were talking about the
slow and out. If it's

514
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.720
going really, really fast and
you are like, I don't

515
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.960
know, like a site about
meditation and yoga, maybe that

516
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.550
doesn't fit so well Information
because it is a stressing

517
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.730
the personnel, but it seems
like restraint then is a

518
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.880
really important aspect to animation.
It is. I mean, it's

519
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.790
kind of like really good
design is the design that's

520
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.730
most amazing. You kind of
don't notice, I think animation

521
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.470
is sort of similar, but
it's very hard not to

522
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.320
notice because you were talking
about how we just don't

523
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.670
as these things in the
frightened flight sort of aspect,

524
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.430
but yeah. And that's where
prototyping really comes in handy

525
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.980
as well as like, you
want to find these interactions

526
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.310
and these times and whatever
this interface you're creating is

527
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.070
where, you know, maybe you
do need some extra information,

528
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.830
you know, to call attention
to something, to kind of

529
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.200
give the spatial awareness of
where things are. You know,

530
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.840
we use a lot of,
you know, kind of hiding

531
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.720
layers of sites and apps
behind other things, motions and

532
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.700
great way to indicate where
that stuff came from and

533
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.940
went to you, look for
those places where some additional

534
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.270
information would be helpful and
then basically your prototype, the

535
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.340
crap out of it to
make sure what you're building

536
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.910
feels right and is conveying
information. And that's kinda the

537
00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.250
key to it. I mean,
it's like wrapping up a

538
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.100
very complex thing to simple
rule, but you know, do

539
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.870
that as much as possible
and practice it and you'll

540
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.480
get better at it. And
you'll start making awesome animations

541
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.200
At the beginning of our
conversation. You, you said that

542
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.720
some people think that like
if you have to point

543
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.910
to something or make it
wiggle, then maybe you're doing

544
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.820
it wrong. I saw a
gentleman give a presentation and

545
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.740
he was talking about the
hamburger, which is the three

546
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.870
horizontal lines that all developers
designers and programmer types understand.

547
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.990
But none of our nontechnical
relatives have any idea what

548
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.750
it means. And he was
talking about some testing where

549
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.590
you put this hamburger grippy
thing and you know, X

550
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.080
percentage of people click it
and then you just change

551
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.350
the word to menu. And
then everyone starts to click

552
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.600
it. But it seems like
we really don't want to

553
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.130
just have the word menu.
We want to have something

554
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.590
visually interesting. So people will
make arrows. That will point

555
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.390
thing like your first run,
look at that. You really

556
00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.700
want to click that. Or
I, you know, iOS apps

557
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.700
will dim out the screen
and force you to click

558
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.800
on it. So they've proven
you've done it at least

559
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.370
once. So some developers and
designers think that that's a

560
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:13.210
crutch. Would you say that
those are examples where animation,

561
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.610
you know, easing between two
transitions is a way of

562
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.880
leading the person kind of
down the Primrose path? Possibly.

563
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.740
Yeah. I mean, if you
have an interaction that's a

564
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.260
little different and I've also
seen that a lot of

565
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.060
iOS apps, I kind of
have almost this little intro

566
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.530
to it that show you
with like little dots of

567
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:28.630
like where to swipe and
you know how to swipe,

568
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.020
even though that's like common,
even though that's a really

569
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.680
common mobile, like, you know,
handheld screen interaction. So I

570
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.530
think some help is good.
I mean the hamburger icon

571
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.320
one is an interesting argument
because it's kind of like

572
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.140
on one hand, you're like,
well, did anyone know what

573
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.780
the save icon meant? When
we first had it? People

574
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.850
have learned no disagree. It
was a picture of a

575
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.500
DOE. True. It was a
picture of a desk, but

576
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.380
there's definitely like, we w
we can learn what these

577
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.100
abstract things mean over time.
And maybe the hamburger icon

578
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.080
isn't going to last over
time. I don't know. But

579
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.240
it's like, it's pretty new.
We've been doing it maybe

580
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.100
a few years. So, Well,
like I showed my wife

581
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.100
how in the Facebook app,
you can swipe in the

582
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.020
middle of the Facebook app
site. And it opens this

583
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.470
like drawer. She freaked out
because she didn't know, she

584
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.600
had no idea it was
there. And I'm like, for

585
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.990
every one of me, there's
a Amelia, Amelia like a

586
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.300
hundred people who have never
seen that before. Like when

587
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.700
you show people like double
tapping on our phone, like,

588
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.990
But I think where that,
where it's tricky is like,

589
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.500
stuff like that. That's like
extra information. It's fine. If

590
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.360
you don't see it, but
things like your main menu.

591
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.400
I think that's why the
hamburger icon is so hotly

592
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.440
debated in a way, cause
it's this strange icon we've

593
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.170
introduced that doesn't make sense
to a lot of people.

594
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.600
And it's how we get
to our main navigation, which

595
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.120
is generally a place people
are trying to go and,

596
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.160
you know, really adding the
word menu next to it.

597
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.630
I don't, I mean, that
seems like a pretty good

598
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.150
compromise sometimes. I wonder why
we debate it so much.

599
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.300
One animation I saw that
was really cool to introduce

600
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.940
this idea of here's a
hamburger menu and there's something

601
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.780
behind it. Wasn't wiggling the
menu and it wasn't pointing

602
00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.720
an arrow to it. It
was just when you were

603
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.900
at an idle state, it
was just gently pulling out,

604
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.990
peeking behind giving you a
little hint, just kind of

605
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.200
going, Hey, look over here.
And then the person's like,

606
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.920
what's right. And then they
want to kind of pull

607
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.440
it in that's feels like
a good animation to me,

608
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.680
it's a little more subtle.
And so there's definitely things

609
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.140
where, you know, that's probably
way more effective than having

610
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.090
a weird flashing era of
just like, here's sort of

611
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.770
how it works. And just
a little hint at where

612
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.260
things are and where things
come from like that. And

613
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.430
I think it feel like
that's the kind of stuff

614
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.440
you get by trying things
out. Like maybe whoever came

615
00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.820
up with that tried on
arrow and was like, this

616
00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.310
is obnoxious, like tried flashing
stuff. And we're like, Oh,

617
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.870
that's a still of noxious.
Oh, what if I do

618
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.690
this? And I think that's
how you discover these really

619
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.570
great interactions When you find
a really good interaction or

620
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.060
a really good animation. I
know you probably had the

621
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.570
experience where it's like, Oh,
they thought about that. Exactly.

622
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.200
I remember the first time
that I had a list

623
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.420
with a little grippy and
I grabbed an item to

624
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.570
rearrange it in the list
in the other list, items

625
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.340
like run out of the
way, like getting out of

626
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.010
my way. I'm like someone
it's, this feels crafted it's

627
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.870
I think a really good
innovation is that moment where

628
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.110
it's like, they could have
just went like snap snap.

629
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.540
Like, remember when you would
have a sorting a manual

630
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.130
list, that'd be an arrow
up and an arrow down.

631
00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.720
Yeah. They're just kind of
jumping in. You weren't even

632
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.710
sure. Which one moved totally
weak sauce. Yeah. No, it's,

633
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.860
it's it definitely takes a
lot of thought and planning

634
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.600
to do it well, but
I mean, that's kind of

635
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.120
all designed, right. You know,
it's like, if you're going

636
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.770
to do it well, you
have to think things through

637
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.540
and try things out. And
that's how you'll get to

638
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.820
the really great combination that
works for what you need

639
00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.460
to say. You mentioned code
pen, where are some other

640
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.950
sites that people who maybe
aren't designers that are kind

641
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:35.960
of wishing that they were,
or they want to be

642
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.370
a developer designer can start
exploring other people's animations. And

643
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.680
the work that they're doing
is a really one, it

644
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.410
has a really, They probably
have the best kind of

645
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.630
like exploring feature that I've
seen at least visually be

646
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.570
able to explore stuff with
little thumbnails JS. Ben has

647
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.880
a lot of great stuff
too. And those are kind

648
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.740
of the main two that
I use as far as

649
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.860
like, just seeing other people's
little experience. And these are

650
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.890
galleries where you basically have
a CSS, pain, JavaScript pain,

651
00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.650
and an HTML, and you
just sign up and you

652
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.390
can start writing your code
there and then immediately share

653
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.460
it. Yeah. Yeah. It's really,
it's really handy that way.

654
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.950
I think I know I
use it a lot for

655
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.810
like workshops and stuff too,
cause I, no one has

656
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.850
to like have text editors
installed there. It doesn't even

657
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.080
matter what they have installed.
You just like go to

658
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.000
code pen, get an account.
We're all dealing with The

659
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
same stuff. Right. No install
on it. So it's, it's

660
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.710
pretty handy. It's fun to
just like pop in there

661
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.660
and try something out. And
if it sucks, just delete

662
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.670
it. But one has to
know, and if you like

663
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.210
it, Do you keep a
library of animations or like

664
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.430
of interactions or are you
always writing them completely from

665
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.710
scratch? Like, do you have
your own stash? I kind

666
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.720
of do it on a
per project basis. Cause I

667
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.050
feel like, you know, the,
the, you know, when we

668
00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.970
were talking about the easing
and the, the personality of

669
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.380
the animation, I feel like
you want to keep a

670
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.960
lot of that consistent across
a project because you pick

671
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.540
easing that fits your message,
like the whole yoga studio,

672
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.970
fast flashing button thing. So
I like to do it

673
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.260
on a per project thing.
And there's a lot of

674
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.300
ones like usually like fade
and scale that I pretty

675
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.490
much make for everything and
just use them in different

676
00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.720
combinations. I don't usually, if
I, if I share them

677
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.910
across projects, it's just like,
I start with them and

678
00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.500
then change it all the
time. Just kind of copy

679
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.200
paste as a jumpstart. I
kind of feel like the,

680
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.910
you know, if you're going
to bother them, animate anything

681
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.620
at all, it should really
fit with your design and

682
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.810
probably doesn't apply to the
law or, you know, pulling

683
00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:11.880
from the last project you
did probably isn't going to

684
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.050
help that much. But that's
just, When people do the,

685
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.810
the big picture design they
have, like, here's the visual

686
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.240
language of our site. Here's
the font that represents them.

687
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.980
Here's the buttons. And they
get all the way down.

688
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.580
How do you express though?
Like, here's our animation language,

689
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.330
because you could hand a
bunch of suits eight and

690
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.950
a half 11 sheets of
paper. You can paste them

691
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.140
up on the wall, but
how do you say here's

692
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.310
the active ness of our
site Generally do it in

693
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.960
two ways. We'll start a
lot of the time with

694
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.240
like, sort of like an
element closure type thing where

695
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.310
it's like just showing static
elements and you might share

696
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.710
like a mini storyboard of
like, here's how this button

697
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.710
might change. Just to get
people the idea, like here's

698
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.770
where motion might make sense.
And then once you start

699
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.500
doing things like a lot
of projects I've been working

700
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.600
on recently sort of have
a style guide or like

701
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.420
a pattern lab of sorts
where this living browser based

702
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.000
thing, show stuff like your
main colors, your main type

703
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.280
faces, then you can just
have, even if it's just

704
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.920
like little squares of like
showing here's how emotion should

705
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.600
happen. This is like the
easing curves we should. Right?

706
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.670
So like a, like a,
like almost like a bootstrap,

707
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.220
one pager where it's like,
here's all our buttons and

708
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.260
you can, you can actually
interact with it and see

709
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.440
those animations and decide upon
them Step below that, of

710
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.450
just being like, you know,
here's how things should move.

711
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.370
Like here's a square and
this is, you know, the

712
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.080
easing we want to use,
or this is maybe here's

713
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.630
the four different easings we
want to use and here's

714
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.460
how they work together or
which ones are best for

715
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.380
which, and you know, it's
a little, it kind of

716
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.090
fits in with all the
same type stuff of like

717
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.860
here's our tight face and
here's the 10 sizes we're

718
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.770
going to use. It's a
really similar, Very cool. So

719
00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.340
where can people find you
online, get your research and

720
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.600
you also sell an ebook?
Yep. All of my stuff

721
00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.630
is generally@valhead.com. That's my site.
You can find me on

722
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.810
Twitter at VL H and
yeah, I have a book

723
00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.200
on CSS animation. That's published
by five simple steps. That's

724
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.210
linked from my site as
well, and also on five

725
00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.550
simple steps because you know,
they do that to you

726
00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.490
since it's they published it.
Very cool. Well, thanks so

727
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.460
much for chatting with us
today. This has been another

728
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.860
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.
