In this episode, Scott talks
with James Andrew about Oculus

9
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.380
rift. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

10
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.840
of Hansel minutes, and I'm
talking with James Andrew, a

11
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.380
developer who works in unity
and is a huge, huge

12
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.000
fan of the Oculus rift.
How's it going? It's going

13
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.850
very well. Scott, You are
very excited about the Oculus

14
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.210
rift. Tell me what that
is, Scott. I am hugely

15
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.780
excited about it because it's
the first product that actually

16
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.680
delivers on the 20 year
old promise of virtual reality.

17
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.260
I remember when I was,
when I was younger, when

18
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.300
I was 10, 15 years
old, virtual reality was the

19
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.870
coolest thing and it, and
it was coming any day

20
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.490
and you're going to be
able to get inside of

21
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.580
these computer worlds and Andy
and Scott. I was so

22
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.710
into it at the time
that I went out and

23
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.590
I, I was playing strike
commander, a really, really great

24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.440
flight SIM at the time
on a big CRT monitor.

25
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.660
And I, I just really
wanted to get in to

26
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.810
that game more. So I
went out to a hardware

27
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.630
store and I got myself
a welding mask or a

28
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.360
safety mask. The kind of
has a plastic shield on

29
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.330
it. I went out and
I took the plastic shield

30
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.910
out and replaced it with
one of those flexible for

31
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.110
Nell magnifying sheets that elderly
people use to read with

32
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.350
and put it on there
and would sit in front

33
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.390
of my monitor and the
monitor would wrap around my

34
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.510
face and I'd be flying
in this flight game in

35
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.610
that game. And I thought
that was the coolest thing,

36
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.470
and it just wanted more
of that. And I wanted

37
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.330
to buy the real ones
so I could be fully

38
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.400
in there 20 years later,
nothing really happened. But now

39
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.700
with the Oculus rift, it's
happening really, really quickly. And

40
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.660
it's amazing. It really is
an amazing experience. I've used

41
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.640
the rift a couple of
times. I had one on

42
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.450
at, at the Xamarin evolve
conference and then at maker

43
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.790
fair, they had a bunch
of these things and I

44
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.490
had my dad with me
at maker fair and he

45
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.710
put a rift on and
found it. He found it

46
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.400
he's a 65. He found
it very disorienting. It, he,

47
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.930
he was like unsteady on
his feet. Yeah, I think

48
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.700
that that is something that
you definitely have to deal

49
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.040
with. And I think it
depends very much on the

50
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.460
particular experience. You give someone
in the rift, I'm thinking

51
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.960
that we might to start
labeling these experiences. Are they

52
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.240
the games with something like
you see in skiing and

53
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.970
snowboarding where got a green
circle, blue square, a black

54
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.480
diamond, because if you're, if
you're getting in a helicopter

55
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.610
and flying around fast and
you're feeling like you're in

56
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.730
there that might get you
a little queasy or disoriented.

57
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.740
So there are however, some
particular issues right now with

58
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.470
lower resolution. And sometimes with
games running at a lower

59
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.570
frame rate, there's a lot
of things that can happen

60
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.000
that can cause this, but
there are ways around it.

61
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.210
And these effects really get
less and less and disappear

62
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.990
altogether. Particularly when you get
up to higher resolutions, like

63
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.170
the kind that are going
to release soon. So this

64
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.860
is, it looks like it
looks familiar. You know what

65
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.870
I mean? It's, it's foreign
and it's crazy, but it

66
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.540
also looks very, it looks
familiar. Like we've seen it

67
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.570
before. It's, it's kind of
this trapezoid that sits in

68
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.400
front of your eyes. I
mean, I imagine it's almost

69
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.280
like an iPad mini that's
suspended some inches from your

70
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.390
eyes. And as you move,
of course, it's tracking you

71
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.440
in three, in three dimensional
space, six axis. Well, not

72
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.010
six axis actually yet, because
six it's six would involve

73
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.460
position tracking and it doesn't
actually position track had only

74
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.190
tracks your rotation. And that's
actually an important point. We

75
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.290
can talk more about in
a little bit. Okay. So

76
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.900
that's good to know. I
want to remember that, but

77
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.600
I remember, like you said,
20 years ago, 15, 20

78
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.030
years ago, maybe even a
little longer, I remember being

79
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.150
in the arcade where you
would get into like a

80
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.420
tank or like a mech
and you'd hold these two

81
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.470
handles and then move this
giant helmet kind of left

82
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.060
and right as if you
were the turret of the

83
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.070
tank. And that was the
closest thing that we had

84
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.020
to VR. Why, why did
that exist 20 years ago?

85
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.090
And that, and why did,
why wasn't that the beginning

86
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.700
of it, like nothing happened.
There was just nothing going

87
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.220
on for 20 years. Well,
there's a, there's a couple

88
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.770
of, there's a couple of
reasons. There've been a lot

89
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.030
of incremental improvements over the
years, little by little that

90
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.980
have gotten us to the
point where all of a

91
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.350
sudden, now you can get
a display that's light enough

92
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.750
to make this into a
consumer product, for example. And

93
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.030
those, those, the reason those
things were so big is

94
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.040
that huge displays. And then
that was one of the

95
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.950
main reasons, but also some
of them, most of those

96
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.850
systems were fundamentally flawed in
one major respect. And that

97
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.750
is, they had really high
latency or lag in their

98
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.910
head tracking. So when you'd
put one of these things

99
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.660
on and you'd look around
left or right, or anywhere

100
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.160
that you would look, there
would be a little bit

101
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.430
of a delay and it
just didn't feel fully, right?

102
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.770
If you walked away saying
that was cool, that was

103
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.320
like a cool ride at
Epcot or something, but it's

104
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.410
not something that's going to
change my life. But with

105
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.470
this, with the Oculus rift,
Palmer, Luckey, and the guys

106
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.340
working with him and John
Carmack to recognize they recognize

107
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.210
what's important for creating a
believable, immersive experience. And one

108
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.670
of the main things is
it really low delay. They

109
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.600
call it a, we call
it motion to photon latency.

110
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.180
When you move your head
a little bit, you want

111
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.260
that, that pixel on the
display to light up the

112
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.210
right way at just the
right time. And if it

113
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.600
takes too long, you can
feel queasy. You can feel

114
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.360
sick and use your brain
and therefore you just don't

115
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.760
buy it and you won't
buy it at the store.

116
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.950
You don't want it. But
if you get rid of

117
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.800
these problems, all of a
sudden, you just feel like

118
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.240
you're in there and it
works. And this, this, this

119
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.060
problem of latency even involves
things on the monitor and

120
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.180
your graphics card, there's settings
in your Nvidia control panel,

121
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.950
that if you set them
wrong, you can have a

122
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.290
bad experience. And so you
need to be aware of

123
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.650
all these things to get
that latency down. And, and

124
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.350
that's really one of the
main things that has, has

125
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.030
developed over these 20 years
is the ability to put

126
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.180
that low-latency tracking in a
little chip that can be,

127
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.850
can be driving this thing
that didn't exist 10 years

128
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.530
ago, That, that, that, that
concept of latency. And like,

129
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.890
it doesn't quite feel right
that rejection. It's, it's almost

130
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.110
like there's an uncanny Valley.
You know, the uncanny Valley

131
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.740
that refers to robots as
robots get more and more

132
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.960
like humans as a moment
where, where it's like, that's

133
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.870
just wrong. And I don't
know why, but it's wrong.

134
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.810
The quantification of that is
really interesting. I was talking

135
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.530
to folks about scrolling on
touch devices. And for the

136
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.880
longest time, Android had a
problem with scrolling and people

137
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.300
who are nontechnical. You know,
my parents, my wife would,

138
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.880
this doesn't feel right. I
don't know what it is.

139
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.670
And it was that that
sense of my touch doesn't

140
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.150
matter. There's a five or
10 pixels wrong before anything

141
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.840
actually occurs. You were saying
that applies to virtual reality

142
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.290
as well. The brain will
reject it as reality, Scott,

143
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.010
it applies immensely. I spent
a very productive evening. One

144
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.680
of the first evenings, I
had the rift with one

145
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.810
of the better games. That's
out there for it now

146
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.200
called lunar flight, where you're
actually sitting inside of a

147
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.960
lunar Lander and controlling all
of the jets that exist

148
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.810
on a real lunar Lander
in real lunar gravity. And

149
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.140
you look around and you're
there. However, I decided to

150
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.690
experiment with various things. I
said, let's turn the rest.

151
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.510
Let's turn my resolution down
on my, or my detail

152
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.420
settings, all to minimal. And
that was a little bit

153
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.410
better. But then when I
also disabled, there's something very

154
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.290
important to know about the,
the rift. There's something called

155
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.660
V sync that you have
to have either on or

156
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.310
off on your graphics card.
It has to do with

157
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.910
whether the screen is updated
exactly 60 times a second,

158
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.310
or whether it goes as
fast as it can with

159
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.850
this particular experience. Only when
I disabled that V sync.

160
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.720
And when I lowered all
the detail, my frame rate

161
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.140
shot up. My latency was
down there for, and looking

162
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.630
around that cockpit, I, all
of a sudden, just something

163
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.430
clicked. And I felt like
I was in a real

164
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.070
place. And just to make
sure that I wasn't imagining

165
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.170
it, I turned everything up
to high detail. So it

166
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.510
gave it a little more
lag and I looked around

167
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.730
and it was gone. It
was gone. It did not

168
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.960
feel real. So there's, it's
really a interesting phenomenon. It

169
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.960
has yet to be explored
fully. Are you, you think

170
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.910
that these guys who are
making the Oculus rift though,

171
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.630
they get that they, that
there's some quantification of this

172
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.000
at a mathematical level where
they can understand that this

173
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.700
is right and this is
wrong and they're gonna, they're

174
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.990
prepared to get it right.
They really, really get it.

175
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.690
Palmer gets it. And that's
what John CarMax saw when

176
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.970
he, when he started talking
with, with Palmer. And that's

177
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.570
why John is the CTO
of Oculus now, because these

178
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.380
guys are doing it right.
And explain physically how this

179
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.480
works. Is it a, is
it a monitor? Do I

180
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.060
plug it into my, my
DV, my DVI, or my

181
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.570
VGA Right now, there's a
little base station that you

182
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.980
plug your DVI or HTMI
into. And that base station

183
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.720
connects to your computer via
USB and a USB cord.

184
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.000
And it has its own
power supply from this little

185
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.480
base station is a wire
that the, the rift itself

186
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.710
is attached to. And in
the rift behind the lenses,

187
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.200
there's these, there's two lenses
in it, behind it is

188
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.240
a single screen that the
Facina's projected onto with half

189
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.710
of it, for the left
eye and half of the

190
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.450
right eye. And then the
lenses take that image and

191
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.700
project it onto the eyes
to give you a compelling

192
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.120
experience of being in that
place. And then there's also

193
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.060
the accelerometer and the Gravatar
in there to detect your

194
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.880
heads oriented. So is this
USB three? I mean, I

195
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.650
guess I expected, I would
plug this into the back

196
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.450
of a video card and
it would become a monitor,

197
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.700
but you're saying it's USB
to a box and then

198
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.820
DVI into the device for
the developer version of this,

199
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.640
For the developer version, there's
both a DVI connection and

200
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.160
a USB connection. And it's
just USB two. I believe

201
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.550
So I, so I do
plug it into one of

202
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.970
my video cards. It uses
the, the video comes from

203
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.110
the video card, but the
accelerometer data goes in via

204
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.660
USB. So it's just two
separate connections. Okay. So I

205
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.030
have three monitors here with
me. One of them I'm

206
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.850
going to lose while I
have the sun. Yeah. And

207
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.470
it gets a little bit,
it gets a little bit

208
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.630
tricky sometimes. It's not, that's
one of the things that's

209
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.480
not super smooth right now
as the multi-monitor experience with

210
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.600
this. But essentially yes, you
should be able to just

211
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.360
to set this to one
of your monitors. So presumably

212
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.820
when this is finally released
and there's a retail version,

213
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.820
it will be some reasonable
plugin for people who don't

214
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.370
have multiple monitors. Right. There'll
be some they'll solve that

215
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.400
problem in some way that
I'll be able to launch

216
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.920
the game on my computer
and then plug in the

217
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.530
rift. And it'll just work.
I imagine that will be

218
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.620
the case. Okay. And you
said it's stereoscopic, but it's

219
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.670
not stereoscopic like a 3d
movie where it's flipping lenses

220
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.770
back and forth and shutting
shutter. There's no shutters or

221
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.050
anything like that. It literally
has one complete image per

222
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.710
eye. Yes. And all stereoscopic
is, is not the same.

223
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.350
These guys are doing it
the right way. And you

224
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.200
can tell when you're dealing
with the flipping of shutters

225
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.660
or with an IMAX, there's,
there's a lot of there's

226
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.080
technical papers online, which you
can Google about stereoscopic projection

227
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.750
techniques that explain why a
lot of those techniques aren't

228
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.860
really that good and they're
not right. And yet this

229
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.200
technique, the technique where you
have a separate image for

230
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.030
each, I completely dedicated it.
It's the right technique. They're

231
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.400
doing it. Right. And it
looks really, really great. What

232
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.250
is the, there's a developer
version. There's like a $300

233
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.450
one it's for it's devs.
And then there's some theoretical

234
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.780
future retail version. Then I'll
presumably be able to go

235
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.700
to best buy or think
he can get at some

236
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.670
future point. We'll talk about
resolution. Yeah. Right now the

237
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.240
developer version is a 1,280
12, 80 by 800 screen.

238
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.620
And they have internally, they
have a 10 ADP version.

239
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.200
And the one that's going
to be released is going

240
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.630
to be at least 10
ADP and possibly higher than

241
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.990
that. And that would, you
would, you would presume. I

242
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.310
mean, I'm going get, I'm
just talking. I don't have

243
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.590
any inside knowledge here, but
I'm presuming that that's going

244
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.070
to be limited by whatever
your video card can drive.

245
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.380
So that presumably that the
better your video card is

246
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.810
the better your re your
rift experience is going to

247
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.360
be. That's probably, that is
correct. I mean, you can't

248
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.970
even, I think a four
K display requires two DVI

249
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.610
cables at this point. So
there's technical logical limitations at

250
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.190
that level right now. However,
I want to point out

251
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.880
that even at 1280, by
800, it's such a fundamentally

252
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.470
cool experience to get in
this thing that it's it's,

253
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.050
everyone should check this out.
Everyone that's a developer should

254
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.270
get on this right now.
Cause it's, it will change

255
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.490
everything in the realm of
gaming, at least in a

256
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.610
lot more too, That that's
a big statement. When someone

257
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.650
says it's going to change
everything. There's a lot of

258
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.200
people out there that are
passionate about different things. I'm

259
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.790
going to talk to someone
in a couple of weeks

260
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.280
about Bitcoin and that individual
is convinced. It's going to

261
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.170
change everything for everyone. You
are bullish to say the

262
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.630
least. It sounds like on
the rift, it's changing everything.

263
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.930
Yes. And I'm saying that
based upon a number of

264
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.490
things, one is just personal
experience of the response of,

265
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.370
of people that I've shown
this to particularly friends that

266
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.250
are not typically gamers, that,
that if I were working

267
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.830
on something for, let's say
Xbox live, but I was

268
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.720
gonna put out a game
out there. These aren't the

269
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.480
people that would, would really
get into playing whatever it

270
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.260
was I was making for
the Xbox console. But when

271
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.480
I show them this, they
love it. They, and they

272
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.210
feel like they're, they're actually
doing something and they're not

273
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.880
just playing a video game.
So all of a sudden

274
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.500
the appeal of virtual experiences
grows so much that the

275
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.110
audience grows so much. The
potential audience grows so much

276
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.980
beyond typical gamers to everyone.
Everyone is going to want

277
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.910
this. And you don't think
that it's going to be

278
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.350
as something that's gonna make
everyone like nauseous. Like we're

279
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.820
not going to find that
like, there's a whole class

280
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.610
of people just can't handle
it. I don't I'll, there

281
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.880
may be rare cases. I
don't think so. And apparently

282
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.970
at higher resolution and at
higher frame rates, the, the

283
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.180
effects generally go away. And
in my case, I did

284
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.940
feel a little nauseated the
first day I was playing

285
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.310
around with it, but I
really don't experience that anymore.

286
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.790
And do you think that
that's your brain trying to

287
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.850
deal with the fact that
you are lying to it?

288
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.300
Well, you're not lying to
it. I'm telling my brain

289
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.020
truthfully, Hey, here is a,
a great synthetic experience to

290
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.930
enjoy. I'm not trying to
tell my brain, okay. You're

291
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.980
actually in this helicopter flying
over this Toon shaded city

292
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.670
deal with it. It's, it's,
it's, it's not really like

293
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.230
that, but there is a
sense of acclimation to whatever

294
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.790
it is that you're doing.
I mean, if I'm going

295
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.100
to put someone in a
helicopter, if it's a real

296
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.560
helicopter, I expect most people
will feel a little bit

297
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.600
ill if they fly it
too hard right away. The,

298
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.270
I, speaking of lying to
your brain, I have a,

299
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.580
a treadmill desk that I've
been using a lot lately.

300
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.150
And when I walk on
it for some few hours,

301
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.370
you know, two or three
hours at a time, while,

302
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.790
while working, when I step
off, there's a moment of

303
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.850
like wrong where my feet,
aren't quite sure what's going

304
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.760
on. And there's confusion because
I've been walking, you know,

305
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.000
I've walked five miles and
gone nowhere. Do you find

306
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.580
that after some number of
hours in the rift that

307
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.980
you're like, gosh, that was
too much like, you know,

308
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.340
we'll got six hours. That's
my limit. I haven't really

309
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.610
pushed it that much so
far, but I haven't really

310
00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.530
felt like that. And if
I'm starting to feel like

311
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.480
that, I'm going to look
at tweaking my game or

312
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.490
tweaking what I'm working on.
So it doesn't feel like

313
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.860
that. And I have been
doing that a lot. This,

314
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.740
this week as I demoed
what I was working on

315
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.620
this riff chopper, it's a,
what I think is the

316
00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.700
world's most fun helicopter simulation
it's as I started to

317
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.610
make it, I made it
very fast and very responsive.

318
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.620
And I noticed that people
were getting a little bit

319
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.230
nauseated at first. So I
tuned it down and made

320
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.140
it fly like a more
like a heavier helicopter and

321
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.430
a little bit. It's made
it a little bit slower

322
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.670
and it's the experience went
away. The trouble went away.

323
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.990
So you have to take
into account people's experiences. Hmm.

324
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.730
I don't want to, I
don't want to harp on

325
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.580
the negative, but I do
think about that, that kind

326
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.860
of stuff. Cause I have
small kids and I think

327
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.990
about if it's going to
change everything, are we going

328
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.350
to see, like, if you,
if you've read the book,

329
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.190
snow crash, how they describe
virtual reality in that book.

330
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.680
And it does make one
wonder if we'll find a

331
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.620
class of people or even
the, what was the movie

332
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.540
surrogate, where they were plugged
into effectively Oculus rifts, and

333
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.610
then remoted into other other
bodies. And they neglected their

334
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.440
houses and their bodies. I
mean, do you think there

335
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.200
could be addicts that will
be onto this and there'll

336
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.600
be stuck in the, in
the rift for days at

337
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.440
a time? I think it's,
I think there's that possibility

338
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.640
with anything that's, that's this
entertaining or this enjoyable that

339
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.490
people might abuse it to,
to, I mean, there are

340
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.340
people princes I'd love snowboarding.
I love it a lot,

341
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.280
but there are people that
you call ski bums that

342
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.070
leave their families and get
rid of all of the

343
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.650
responsibilities and just ski all
the time. And, and there

344
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.630
are people that have ruined
lives because they ski or

345
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.950
snowboard all the time. Now
I love snowboarding and yes,

346
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.360
it's possible to abuse it.
So it's the same. Yeah.

347
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.820
I think that, you know,
there's like, there's like even

348
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.270
eight bit kind of super
Nintendo RPGs. And I think

349
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.510
every once in a while,
some very nice young Korean

350
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.080
man dies because he spent
29 straight hours in a

351
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.670
internet cafe playing Zelda, you
know, but there's no, there's

352
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.950
no TV shows about like,
you know, the, the dangers

353
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.610
of Zelda. It sounds like
if this does change everything,

354
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.620
we're going to have local
news reports on how the

355
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.060
rift is killing people. I
think it's exciting how the

356
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.960
rift opens up a lot
of possibilities of, of beneficial

357
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.320
experiences in the rift of
therapeutic experiences in the rift.

358
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.500
I mean, for example, one
of the, one of the

359
00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.630
presenters, one of the people
that went up to this

360
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.900
Boston show that I went
to this weekend, that inspired

361
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.520
me to, to call you
to tell you about it.

362
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.560
Cause I went up to
this, this Oculus event in

363
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.050
Cambridge on Saturday, I just
threw an event at the

364
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.440
Microsoft nerd center up there.
And some somewhere between maybe

365
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.900
700 and a thousand people
signed up and just came

366
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.080
to check out the various,
the various, the rifts and

367
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.450
to, to hear Palmer and
the guys talk and et

368
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.580
cetera, et cetera. And I
just kind of showed up

369
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.120
there with my computer and
my own rift. And one

370
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.850
other guy did too. And
this guy, he came up

371
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.770
there, one other pair of
guys, they, they brought their

372
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:42.440
rift and they had made,
I was really impressed with,

373
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.950
they made a, something that
used Kuda to do the,

374
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:52.080
the kudos, the NVIDIA's facility
for general purpose GPU programming.

375
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.630
And you can do some
really powerful stuff with it.

376
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.900
They integrated that with a
rift to make a really

377
00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.320
beautiful simulation of falling leaves.
And you could lie down

378
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.880
on a couch and put
this thing on. And it

379
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.830
was like, you're lying in
a forest and leaves were

380
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.590
just floating back and forth
and coming down toward you.

381
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.670
And it was entirely relaxing,
tightly relaxing. I can totally

382
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.160
picture putting something like that
on with a little box

383
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.980
in the background, spending 15
minutes and waking up from

384
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.950
that or getting up from
that way, way refreshed in

385
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.630
a way that I don't
really try to look at

386
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.750
my computer screen to get
that kind of effect. So

387
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.500
there's that kind of, that
kind of thing that, that

388
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.500
it can be used for.
And then also there was

389
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.800
this, this video going around
of this elderly woman who

390
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.830
has cancer and she can't
leave her house very much.

391
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.880
She can't even leave her
chair very much. So her,

392
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.220
her kids got her an
Oculus rift actually Oculus sent

393
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.500
them one based upon a
letter that she sent telling

394
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.050
you about the situation. And
it was so cool to

395
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.760
see her put this on
and just be able to

396
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.670
walk around in Italy as
it were, would the Tuscany

397
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.220
demo that comes with it.
And she was just so

398
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.370
happy to be able to
see butterflies flying around, have

399
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.290
one, try to land on
her hand and just seeing

400
00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.860
her smile was, I mean,
it was a profound experience

401
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.380
that I've not seen the
like of when you're dealing

402
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.570
with anything, that's a will
be called a computer game

403
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.000
or a video game. So
I think that's a really

404
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.370
promising, I've just reached over
on my desk here and

405
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:15.500
picked up a stack of
X-Box games. And when you've

406
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.720
got me thinking about the
kinds of experiences that you

407
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.940
could have, if there were
a rift fully kind of

408
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.550
immersive kind of situation, you've
got the obvious, the halos

409
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.770
and the crisis and the
stuff like that. But I've

410
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.770
got one here called LA
noir, which is almost like

411
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.190
playing a 1940s version of
law and order where you

412
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.120
could, you would literally be
playing your, a movie. You

413
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.340
could be an app. You
could be the character, the

414
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.380
main character in a movie.
It seems like the rift

415
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.870
could add a whole lot
to these kind of larger

416
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.710
narrative. Like whether it be
yelling or things like that.

417
00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.750
Yeah, absolutely. One of my
favorite X-Box titles, I haven't

418
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.160
played in a long time,
but I think it's one

419
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.770
of the most, well done
is red dead redemption, where

420
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.140
you play a cowboy, who's
out roaming the Prairie, doing

421
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.560
different things. And as real
as it is, you're still

422
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.700
doing puppetry. It's like, it's
like, it's a marionette show

423
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.000
and I'm controlling someone else.
And that's what I feel.

424
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.850
Even with the cinematic nature
of it. It's, it's, I'm

425
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.680
imparting, I'm imparting something to
another character, but this is,

426
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.680
what's so impressive about rift
experiences that are first person,

427
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.980
is that you are stepping
into that character in a

428
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.350
way that you never really
have, even with all of

429
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.510
the best games that have
appeared on a two dimensional

430
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.530
screen. So you're thinking that
these guys are going to

431
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.970
succeed because screen technology and
resolution is reached there because

432
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.670
head tracking has reached there,
but I said six access.

433
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.970
And you said, no, what
is the missing access that

434
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.810
we're not capturing today? To
be clear, we're talking about

435
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.840
the actual six access, not
the brand sucks access, which

436
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.850
also makes some controllers. All
right. When I say six

437
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.250
hours, I just mean, so
I turned my head. Yeah,

438
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.710
exactly. I turn my head
left to right. It recognizes

439
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.620
that I look up and
down. What if I strafe?

440
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.750
What if I just kind
of move my head sideways?

441
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.170
Rift is not currently the
development kit does not currently

442
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.070
pick that up. However, they
are working on this very,

443
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.590
very much. And I do
anticipate that that will be

444
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.050
out. I believe that they've
even said that, that it

445
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.030
will be out in the
next developer kit, that it

446
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.890
will be part of it.
I'm not a hundred percent

447
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.920
sure of that, but it
is coming and it will

448
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.020
add another dimension actually, that
that will be, will make

449
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.900
it even better than is
now. Cause right now it

450
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.810
only detects the rotation of
your head and neck, but

451
00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.210
you, you don't normally sit
there and just rotate your

452
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.800
head and neck without moving
your body, you move your

453
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.170
body around. And so right
now, if you just rock

454
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.510
your body back and forth
in the rift, nothing happens.

455
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.280
The world kind of comes
with you instead of you

456
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.160
moving through the world. So
moving around a lot is

457
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.140
a sure way to kind
of break your sense of

458
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.740
immersion. And so that's just
one, that's one example of

459
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.230
the things that have the
limitations of it right now.

460
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.150
But it's the limitations of,
I mean, this is a

461
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.660
development kit. This is like
not even diversion 1.0 product,

462
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:59.190
and it's just going to
accelerate so fast starting now.

463
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.620
And it's even with these
limitations, like not being able

464
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.770
to move back and forth,
it's just, it's, it's really

465
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:09.030
amazing. Yeah. It seems like
that, that, that would add

466
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.010
another dimension for lack of,
you know, for lack of

467
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.800
another word, two games where
you're kind of trying to

468
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.490
sneak around or Dodge or
look around a corner that

469
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.820
would add a real level
of realism that we didn't

470
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.830
haven't seen before. Yes, there
are, there are YouTube videos

471
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.590
of people doing experiments where
they're using something called out

472
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.320
the Razer Hydra, which actually
they don't even make anymore.

473
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.050
It's these controllers you're holding
your hands and they detect

474
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.480
your position. So there are
people online that figured out

475
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.370
that they can strap one
of these to their chest

476
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.890
and plug it into certain
games. And now they conduct

477
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:42.030
behind cover. And it's really
cool. Yeah. You made a

478
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.880
comment about the woman who
was in the Tuscany demo.

479
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:50.390
She's an older lady wandering
around Italy and a butterfly

480
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.500
lands on her hand in
the rift though, the rift

481
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.910
can't see your hands or
know where your hands are.

482
00:23:55.910 --> 00:24:00.350
So I've seen Kickstarters coming
around that are kind of

483
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.750
augmenting, no pun intended the
rift with, you know, well,

484
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.490
how is it going to
see your hands? How's it

485
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.720
going to know that your
hands are there? Well, maybe

486
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.240
you wear gloves or maybe
you wear a sensors or

487
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.640
maybe you have something on
your fingertips. What about those

488
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.230
things? Cause if I put
my hands in front of

489
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.210
my face in a rift,
I don't see my hands.

490
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.110
Correct. Yes. And it's a
really kind of an eerie

491
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:23.350
sensation cause your brain is
expecting to see your hand

492
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.930
and doesn't see it. And
it's, it's definitely an interesting

493
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.560
sensation. So yeah, there are,
there are various people working

494
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.080
on various solutions to this.
I think one of the

495
00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.870
most exciting that I've seen
and there's a Kickstarter for

496
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.960
it is called the STEM
S T E M. And

497
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.750
it's also using the, a,
what they call the it's

498
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.270
called the, Oh, before I
said it was six axis.

499
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.130
The one I'm thinking of
it, they're actually, it's called

500
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:51.520
<inaudible>. And that I think
is very, very promising. They're

501
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.080
going to do it or
someone else is going to

502
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.150
do it and then someone's
going to do it better.

503
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.010
And so it's only a
matter of time. I think

504
00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.010
a year from now, there
will be a workable solution

505
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.670
to the hands issue, at
least for most things, for

506
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.240
most gaming Who are deeply
into the VR world, it

507
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.490
seems to me, and I'm
not deeply, but I'm a

508
00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.810
fan that today there's three
things that you need to

509
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.120
get the closest you can
to snow crash and into

510
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.600
a virtual world, you need
the rift developer kit. You

511
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.230
need the six sense STEM,
which is like a we

512
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.960
on steroids. You know what
I mean? It's this super

513
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.600
powerful two handed controller. And
then you need a thing

514
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.660
called an Omni treadmill from
Virtuix, which is also a

515
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.930
Kickstarter. What, what is the
idea of a three-dimensional treadmill

516
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.480
and why would that add
something? Well, this is, this

517
00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.070
is really cool and I've
not seen one of these

518
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.800
in person, so I'm not
sure exactly how well it

519
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.680
delivers on what it says
it does, but apparently it

520
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.310
works. Basically. It's a little
thing that you set in

521
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.200
set in your set in
your room, in front of

522
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.370
your, well, you don't even
have to put in front

523
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.650
of your screen. There's no
screen anymore next to your

524
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.230
rift. And it's a little
circular enclosure that you stand

525
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.510
in. And at the bottom
of it is something that

526
00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.960
kind of reminds me of
one of those saucer sleds.

527
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.430
If you go sledding and
you go in one of

528
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.500
those round saucers, it's kind
of like that, that you,

529
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.890
you step in that you
step in something that looks

530
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.900
sort of like a saucer
and it has some sort

531
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.120
of grooves on it and
it can rotate around. And

532
00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.690
then you wear special shoes
that have little slots on

533
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.790
them, or little pegs on
them that fit and fit

534
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.150
in these grooves. And somehow
this, this whole system makes

535
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.210
it so that you can
reliably with the rift on

536
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.170
walk forward and also walk
in any direction. So you

537
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.960
could turn left and turn,
right. And as far as

538
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.570
you can tell from your
feeling, it feels like you're

539
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.480
walking around an infinitely large
space and I don't know

540
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.250
how it handles running. And
I don't know how easy

541
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.070
it is to get tripped
up, but even if it

542
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.580
just sorta works, that's a
pretty cool idea. And I

543
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.390
think this is more than
sort of work. I think

544
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.770
it really does. Yeah. Yeah.
And to your point, they're

545
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.570
going to keep doing this
over and over. We're so

546
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.540
close. We're like we, I
think we've solved the 80%

547
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.760
problem and they're going to
spend the next 10 years

548
00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.840
running towards the last 20%.
Yeah. And I'm also really

549
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.510
excited about the whole Kickstarter
phenomenon and all of this.

550
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:06.290
I mean, Kickstarter was huge
in launching Oculus and now

551
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.840
every, every other day I
find out about a new

552
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.350
Kickstarter that some small group
of guys putting their efforts

553
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.740
together to make something that
adds to the overall picture

554
00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.530
of what's possible in immersive
VR. So we're not waiting

555
00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.600
just for Sony to see
what they're going to do.

556
00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.690
We're waiting to see what,
what this next group of

557
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.160
guys in the garage is
going to do to add

558
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.990
to it. And there's more
of these things every day

559
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.270
and it's accelerating. So it's,
it's a really exciting time

560
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.210
like that. So you're writing
a helicopter simulator. What are

561
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.750
you writing it in? I
am using unity three D

562
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.380
which just briefly as a,
as a authoring environment for

563
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.710
making games. It's, it's main
claim to fame. And before

564
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.690
the rift is that you
can make your game once

565
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.060
in unity and then publish
it to all the many

566
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:52.160
platforms, Mac, PC, iOS, Android,
et cetera. But the reason

567
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.880
I'm using unity right now
is because the rift comes

568
00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:00.350
with an amazing and amazing
integration piece so that you

569
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.320
can literally drag and drop
one thing into your scene.

570
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.150
And you'll all of a
sudden, you're looking around in

571
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.710
that scene. And I want
to give a shout out

572
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.780
to Peter at Oculus he's,
he's the guy that's doing

573
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.450
this there. And he's in
charge of the, the programming,

574
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.840
the unity integration. And he's
done such an amazing job

575
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.590
in taking all the details
away, such that normally you

576
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.480
would have to with something
like the rift, you'd have

577
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.940
to program to an SDK
and write some C plus

578
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.060
plus code to handle all
the head tracking with this.

579
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.180
I can, I can make
a compelling Oculus rift experience

580
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.260
in unity, three D and
under five minutes, five minutes.

581
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.880
I did it the other
day at work. I did

582
00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.920
buy a new project in
unity. And then I just

583
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.730
dragged in a terrain object,
which I had downloaded. And

584
00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.900
I mean, I will have
said I have some content.

585
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.910
You know, I have a
terrain that I downloaded it

586
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.370
from the unity asset store,
and I just dragged it

587
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.160
into my field. And that
that terrain has basic collision

588
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.940
detection on it. Cause these
unity assets come nicely rigged

589
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.250
like that. And then I
just dragged the Oculus player

590
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.370
controller onto the middle of
the field. Let it go.

591
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.990
It drops to the ground.
I hit play, put the

592
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:03.110
rift on, give someone the
controller and they're walking around

593
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.510
a voxel terrain with a
sky and everything in the

594
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:11.750
rift, five minutes, maybe three
minutes. Well, so It's pushing

595
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.000
back a little bit. You
were saying that hello world

596
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:18.560
is trivial now. Hell yes.
What they give you, what

597
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.050
you can drag and drop
into the world is the,

598
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.480
is the whole structure, which
allows you to put the

599
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.480
rift on and look around
in any direction. And also

600
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.060
they've attached to a basic
player that you can control

601
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.400
with the next box controller
for a first person type

602
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.930
experience. So literally any bright
12 year old could have

603
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:40.100
something working in unity with
the rift within several hours

604
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.420
of, of having the rift
and unity. Assuming he's maybe

605
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.210
done a few unity tutorials
in the week, week ahead

606
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.830
of that, just to get
kind of acclimated with what

607
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.040
unity is, but it's easy.
It's, it's literally child's play

608
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.410
now. So, so I'm making
a helicopter game in it.

609
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.730
So if the, if the
hello world child's play, you

610
00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.970
know, like walking around an
Island, a demo is, is

611
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.850
that easy. Now you said
that you worked on your

612
00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.220
helicopter and you had an
initial version of that working

613
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.950
in basically a day, But
less than a day, it

614
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.130
was a Saturday afternoon. I
started a new project and

615
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.500
I started it around 2:00 PM
and I had a demo,

616
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.150
which you can not, which
is actually still up on

617
00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.400
my YouTube page. The first
video I posted this a

618
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.120
week ago, that was the
result of about five, four

619
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.760
or five hours of, of,
of work in unity. And

620
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.560
I can tell you exactly
what I did if you

621
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.720
want to know or whatever
Mine, I mean, we've only

622
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.790
got a few more minutes
here, but give me hour

623
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.700
by hour, what you did.
Okay. Basically I had to

624
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.490
first get a, a set.
So I went out and

625
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.500
got a, found a really
good city. And you can

626
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.660
find all these things on
the unity asset store. There's

627
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.620
a great store there to
buy things, relatively inexpensively. So

628
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.080
I pulled a city in
and now I wanted to

629
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.480
fly around that city. So
I go out to the

630
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.590
unity store and buy the
helicopter physics controller kit, which

631
00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.320
you literally drag and drop
into the, into the city

632
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.260
that I just made. And
now you've got a helicopter

633
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.450
in there that has basic
controls, sort of like you'd

634
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.850
find in a battlefield game.
So then I'll have to

635
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.540
do is drag the Oculus
integration piece into the world

636
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.520
and basically put it in
the front seat of the

637
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.690
helicopter. And that was about
it. Then the rest of

638
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.290
the time was spent doing
things like put putting image

639
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.080
effects. So the unity store
just has assets that are

640
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.520
just there to be bought.
Yes. And yes, But who,

641
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.950
who, who, who did the
work like? You're saying that

642
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.600
you can make a game
in five hours, but someone

643
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.100
must have put a huge
amount of work in making

644
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.040
a city. Someone did. But
that's what I mean when

645
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.860
I say I made a
game in five hours would

646
00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.820
be the way to make
games. Now I'm telling the

647
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.300
average indie developer is not
specializing every little thing, but

648
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.660
rather to synthesize from whatever
you can find that other

649
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.420
people have made as your
starting points. There's so much

650
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.720
out there that particularly with
the rift now is ripe

651
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.780
for being turned into a
really compelling experience. And you

652
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.290
can just take it like
this helicopter thing. I just

653
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.630
took the helicopter, but I
was, I was the first

654
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.310
one to put a rift
in the front seat of

655
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.490
it. So now it's first
person game. And now that

656
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.310
now that city is something
I'm flying over and first

657
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.890
person perspective. And then I
start putting image effects and

658
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.340
cloud layers in and a
different sort of fish, eye

659
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.620
effects, and then line drawing
effects to make it look

660
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.920
like borderlands two or mirror's
edge and all these things

661
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.230
didn't none of them took
too much effort on their

662
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.830
own, but there were together.
You end up with an

663
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.740
experience that Scott I'm telling
you. I, when I, when

664
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.860
I said that I've never
seen so much happiness on

665
00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.380
people's faces as when I
took this game up to

666
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:37.020
Cambridge, Massachusetts in the Oculus
event and set it up

667
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.160
and I've never seen such
expressions of happiness when someone

668
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.440
was playing a video game,
as I did, when for

669
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.740
five hours, I let one
person after another, try this

670
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.720
thing, just say here, try
this thing I'm working on.

671
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.690
And people just loved it.
And I'm seeing them look

672
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.540
all over, look down, look,
left, look right. And they

673
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:57.590
are flying a helicopter over
a city. They're doing that.

674
00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.310
And it's their response was,
it was tremendous. It's really

675
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.230
inspiring and makes me want
to just go further with

676
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:07.490
it so we can see
you basically are uploading every

677
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.770
few days, the work that
you're doing on, on rift

678
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.380
chopper up at your YouTube
channel. And I'll put that

679
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.410
in the, in the show
notes. Yeah. Can we play

680
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.600
this now? I mean, if
you have any downloads. Yeah,

681
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.630
absolutely. I've been downloaded. I've
been submitting it to YouTube

682
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.940
and posting it to Reddit
every time I'm done with

683
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.210
a, a particular, a particular
point. So that first day

684
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.790
I put 0.1 up, and
then I got feedback from

685
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.360
people and I put 0.2
and 0.3 and I fully

686
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.300
intend on making this into
something that has gameplay associated

687
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.880
with it. And it has
something actually to do other

688
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.970
than just fly around. But
for right now, it's just

689
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.040
a lot of fun just
to fly around in this

690
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.500
world. And you'll give me
the links to that. So

691
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.930
people who are fortunate enough
to have a rift can

692
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.750
check this out. Absolutely. Very
cool. Well, thank you so

693
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.540
much, James Andrew, for sharing
your excitement around the Oculus

694
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.690
rift and unity. All right,
Scott. Thanks. This has been

695
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.360
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

696
00:33:59.360 --> 00:33:59.540
week.
