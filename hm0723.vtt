Today's episode is sponsored by
Datadog a modern full stack

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.000
monitoring platform for cloud infrastructure,
applications, and logs metrics, all

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.240
in one place from their
recent report on serverless adoption

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.660
and trends. Datadog found half
their customer base using ECC

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.980
twos have now adopted AWS
Lambda. They've examined real world

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
serverless usage by thousands of
companies running on millions of

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
distinct serverless functions. And they
found that half of the

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.000
Lambda invocations run for less
than 800 milliseconds, you can

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.180
easily monitor all your serverless
functions in one place and

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.140
generate serverless metrics straight from

14
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.360
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

15
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.480
today. I'm chatting with Jason Phillips.
Who's a director of engineering

16
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.200
online bootcamps to you and
an instructor full stack dev

17
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.570
bootcamp. How are you sir?
Doing good. Scott. How about

18
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.530
stuff very well. I am
still remote still here in

19
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.100
Portland, working remotely now for
13 years. And you actually

20
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.110
have worked remote for a
number of years, but also

21
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.350
managing teams and projects. Yes,
I've been working remote for

22
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.800
about three years. Now, started
off with a web dev

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.330
team at trilogy education services,
which we got rolled into

24
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.470
two. You have the acquisition.
And from there I helped

25
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.940
pilot our first online offering
where we were teaching live

26
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.300
via zoom. So have definitely
had to enjoy the advantages

27
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.920
of remote, but also figure
out how to make it

28
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.250
work best for me. And
I saw a really great

29
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.410
thread that you started and
gave it a little kick.

30
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.300
And it's kind of a
little viral thread where you

31
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.400
said I've been working remote
and it was one of

32
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.130
those, one of an where
you just kinda like dumped

33
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.800
onto Twitter until you ran
out of steam and you

34
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.330
had a lot of great
tips and a lot of

35
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.520
great interaction with folks because
you were giving us all

36
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.850
the tips to be effective
as a remote worker. And

37
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.580
I I've always talked about
this kind of dystopian joy

38
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.370
of being a remote worker.
Cause it's amazing because you're

39
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.040
like 10 feet from your
office, but totally sucks because

40
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.380
you're like 10 feet from
your office. Yeah. The, one

41
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.110
of the biggest challenges I
think, you know, as you

42
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.330
just mentioned is knowing when
to turn it on and

43
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.510
when to turn it off,
right of the convenience of

44
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.910
quote unquote, rolling over in
bed and starting your day

45
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.650
is great. But when you,
you know, go at a

46
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.430
remote working for awhile, you
start to realize that you

47
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.440
can end up in a
place where you just don't

48
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.870
know how to set that
boundary of my day's over

49
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.510
or my day has started.
And for me that was

50
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.480
particularly challenging. And so when
I saw someone else tweet

51
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.190
about remote workers, for instance,
taking sick days that strongly

52
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.530
Resonated and kind of was
the impetus for starting that

53
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.640
kind of thread on Twitter
of, you know, that's one

54
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.550
big example, right? We work
from home, we are convenient.

55
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.820
So since we can't get
anyone sick, why don't we

56
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.640
just work while we're sick?
And that's really not the

57
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.160
best way to think about
that. You said that it

58
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.470
was important to have an
activity that signals the start

59
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.080
of your work day. You're
almost basically training yourself like,

60
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.450
you know how they say,
you know, don't watch iPad

61
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.490
in bed or don't read
in bed because then your

62
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.350
brain will say, Oh, this
is where we watch movies.

63
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.840
I will stay awake. You
are trying to keep your,

64
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.710
I am working and I
am at home Separate. Yeah.

65
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.660
So I try to really
recreate the structure, especially after

66
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.360
I moved back into working
remote, after a brief stint

67
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.510
in an office of now
I know I'm on it,

68
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.960
I'm starting my day of
mimicking the commute. If you

69
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.990
will, even if it's 10
steps. And for me, it

70
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.110
was really important to kind
of establish to my brain

71
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.560
and to myself that, okay,
as of right now, I

72
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.260
am available to be booked
for meetings. I am available

73
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.690
to be on and have
a team across different time

74
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.350
zones that I need to
consistently have a start time

75
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.570
to be available for. And
so over time, that kind

76
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.700
of routine really more for
me into all right, when

77
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.100
I wake up, take my
shower, take my medicine, but

78
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.070
also take a five minute
walk around the block, take

79
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.190
a walk in the neighborhood.
Kind of giving me that,

80
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.130
that rush a fresh air
as if I was commuting.

81
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.710
So then when I walked
back through the door, my

82
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.840
brain's all woken and I'm
like, okay, now it start

83
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.730
this time. Just kind of
start plugging in and get

84
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.870
ready Is really clever. It's
I mean, you're basically commuting.

85
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.330
You go out, you do
a loop, like, you know,

86
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.270
grandpa Simpson, you go in
and go out and you

87
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.670
just go outside and then
come back in and then

88
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.670
enter your workspace with a
fresh perspective as if you

89
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.460
have arrived at work. Yeah.
And it also, for me

90
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.730
was a good way at
first it was, Hey, I'm

91
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.510
noticing I don't get nowhere
near a thousand steps in

92
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.050
a day until noon. And
it was like, okay, I've

93
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.050
got to break that up.
But also it's like, I'm

94
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.560
starting work earlier in earlier.
And I'm at different levels

95
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.580
of energized depending on the
day. So for me, that

96
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.660
loop was really important. So
yeah, by going out, getting

97
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.000
into neighborhoods, seeing the same
dogs on their dog walks

98
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.660
every morning, it just gave
me a routine and just

99
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.020
gave me enough of a
shift to really feel like

100
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.630
that was the commute. I
liked that. I talked, I've

101
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.730
talked a lot before on
the show with other people

102
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.600
about this idea of living
your life by design, rather

103
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.540
than living it by default,
some people might be listening

104
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.340
and say, well, you know,
I like being at home

105
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.320
or I'm a, I'm an
introvert or I'm a whatever.

106
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.510
And I want to be
at home, but it's worth

107
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.360
trying things. If you simply
accept the defaults, you might

108
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.340
just roll over and pick
up your laptop and then

109
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.410
your online. And if that
works for you and feed

110
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.800
your spirit, do it. But
why not try a morning

111
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.460
walk or try out whatever
your go to your local

112
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.010
breakfast place or your local
small business, support them, turn

113
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.110
around, come back with your
fresh coffee and your fresh

114
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.610
perspective. Yeah, I think a
big, I'll see, you said

115
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.660
a couple of times too.
And I think for me,

116
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.450
the way I thought about
that is instead of accepting

117
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.100
the default being handed to
me, it's creating your own

118
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.160
default, right? Like you just
mentioned, it's exactly. It's not

119
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.760
bad that you have a
default it's that you've said,

120
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.190
okay, this is work for
me. Right? Like it's not

121
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.040
given to me it's this
is what works best for

122
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.350
me. Cause I think in
the beginning I did a,

123
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.510
that the fault of, Hey,
I can just roll over,

124
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.090
keep my camera off and
take my first four meetings

125
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.550
of the day from bed.
And then it was all

126
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.340
right, well, I'm not eating
breakfast and don't have any

127
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.530
energy and I'm not getting
out of bed. And now

128
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.010
it's noon. And instead of
me feeling like I had

129
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.760
the convenience and the relaxation
of working from bed, I

130
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.550
have this dread of all
right. I feel like I've

131
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.440
got to start the day,
but I haven't gotten up

132
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.070
yet. And now, although I've
had four meetings, I feel

133
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.350
like I've had a ton
more work, just pile up.

134
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.990
Like I've not actually gotten
into active mode. And then

135
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.490
by the end of the
day, it's like, all right,

136
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.510
it's 5:00 PM. Let me start
my day when I've already

137
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.960
had a full day. I
like that. It, you say

138
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.110
that it's not about defaults.
It's about making them yours.

139
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.340
You decided you, you intentionalize,
you intentionally made those defaults

140
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.620
accepted them. It's always a
good idea to look at

141
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.710
things that you do assert
your assumptions as we are

142
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.440
taught as software engineers, like,
right, is this, is this

143
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.180
really what I need to
be doing? And if it

144
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.030
is cool, keep doing it.
But like, if you catch

145
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.580
yourself going, wow, I don't
know how that happened. But

146
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.710
for three days in a
row, I took meetings in

147
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.310
bed and that doesn't work
for me. Therefore I am

148
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.310
going to consciously decide not
to do. Yeah. Then some

149
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.410
of it too was, you
know, having others point that

150
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.350
out to me as well.
Like, you know, my therapist

151
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.540
would say at a certain
point, Hey, have you tried

152
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.750
like at lunchtime, just taking
a 30 minute walk, you

153
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.060
know, you love taking hikes.
You can't get out for

154
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.040
a full hike, but there's
a park nearby walk to

155
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.440
the park and then walk
back. So, you know, just

156
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.800
even a stepping that input
again, allows you to not

157
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.930
accept that the fault, like
you said, it, it allows

158
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.600
you to say, okay, I
can take the suggestion, but

159
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.940
then I can make it
my own. You know, one

160
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.620
of the things that I
get teased about on Twitter,

161
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.020
but it has, has become
one of my defaults is

162
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.700
the idea of wearing dress
shoes. I wear dress shoes

163
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.540
In my house to my
office because it is those

164
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.540
shoes that represent work to
me. And then if I'm

165
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.730
out in the world, I
might wear trainers or sneakers

166
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.220
or whatever, you know, but
I will not wear kicks

167
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.320
in my office. It is
my office. And that is

168
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.800
just my little weird thing,
but it helps me keep

169
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.130
things separate. Yeah. For me,
it's two things in particular.

170
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.180
One is a big bottle
full of water as like

171
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.490
my default at the desk
of I'm starting my day.

172
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.370
And the second is wearing
a hoodie. I mean, it's

173
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:54.100
very, very barrier, right? So
like Oakland in San Francisco.

174
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.350
But I, that just even
that notion of walking out

175
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.930
the house, then walking back
in and keeping the hoodie

176
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.600
on it again gives me
that feel of like, I

177
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.590
just walked into the office.
It's it is my, for

178
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.550
like a better phrase. My
mr. Rogers moment, It's your

179
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.370
suit though? It's your blazer?
It's the thing that represents

180
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.930
work to you and you
put it on. Yeah. And

181
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.480
Richard Rogers, he would take a
sweater off and put a

182
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.810
different sweater on, but it
was, it was Separate sweater

183
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.720
always made me wonder about
that as a kid, but

184
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.600
it made sense. Red sweater
is one thing and the

185
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.650
blue is another man. I
mean, it's so obvious. Yeah.

186
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.330
And it's that, you know,
I, you know, that the

187
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.540
thread that we're talking about
of signaling the start of

188
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.120
an episode in the end,
right. It's signaling to him

189
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.000
talking to us versus him
going off and going back

190
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.850
into the world. And you
mentioned in that thread, that

191
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.880
working remote doesn't mean you
don't have boundaries. And I

192
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.220
think we, as the remote
workers are so easy, so

193
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.730
eager to please that we
tend to think that there

194
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.220
are no boundaries when we
take meetings at times when

195
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.130
non remotes would just say,
well, no, I'm not working

196
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.700
right there. I'm not in
the office. Yeah. It's I

197
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.200
think one big thing that's
that can become that, that

198
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.470
block or, or bring that
tension is this idea that

199
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.760
you have this privilege and
convenience just from working from

200
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.220
home. And while you do
in a lot of ways,

201
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.220
in terms of your choice
of environment, it doesn't mean

202
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.070
you haven't earned your boundaries,
right. Or that you don't

203
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.330
have the right to have
the same structure that your,

204
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.990
maybe your colleagues in the
office do have. And so,

205
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.390
you know, if you say
from eight to 10:00 AM, you

206
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.700
don't take any meetings because
that's the best time for

207
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.760
you to do your administrative
work. You don't have to

208
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.890
feel bad about that just
because you work from home.

209
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.800
It's, you know, those boundaries
are not about where you

210
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.510
do the work. It's about
how you do the work.

211
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.240
And that's really, I know
for me, that was really

212
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.300
tough to wrap my head
around the first year that

213
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.870
I worked remote. I just,
I almost felt bad that

214
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.390
I didn't make myself available
for a 9:00 AM meeting because

215
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.360
well, I'm at home. I
didn't have to commute. But

216
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.660
again, that that's, I think
that's the wrong way. At

217
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.940
least for me to think
about it in terms of

218
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.490
how I set that boundary.
And just knowing that, Hey,

219
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.390
9:00 AM is my best email
time. Like I don't need

220
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.290
no other interruptions until my
first team meeting at nine

221
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.500
30. Yeah. Yeah. I, I
think that, that I have

222
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.420
low, I have remote worker,
low self esteem where I

223
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.940
feel guilty because I can
pick my kids up at

224
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.420
school at three. And I
feel guilty that my coworkers

225
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.670
that live in Seattle drive
an hour to get to

226
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.000
work or whatever they do.
So then I overcompensate by

227
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.280
working hours that are not
reasonable hours. And I have

228
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.640
found that to be pretty
consistent of remote workers. That,

229
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.320
that also, I don't know
if the right phrase is

230
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.410
remote workers, low self esteem,
but there's a little paranoia

231
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.120
that I think we have.
Yeah. It's and it's understandable,

232
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.380
right? It's again, it's like,
well, I have this unfound

233
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.790
freedom that most people don't,
but in the same token,

234
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.550
it's, you know, when we
do commute to an office,

235
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.150
we have a choice at
times of, or relatively speaking,

236
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.400
we can have a choice
of going earlier of going

237
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.430
later, depending on the environment.
And so, you know, I

238
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.970
think for me, it was
helpful to also think about,

239
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.310
well, if someone has an
hour commute to get to

240
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.380
the office, then I should
take an hour before I

241
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.620
start my day, excuse me,
to do the same personal

242
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.730
things, get my coffee, make
my breakfast, you know, and

243
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.580
also promote habits that I
know I wouldn't do any

244
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.680
office, like, you know, in
the office, I don't eat

245
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.130
during most meetings. Right. That,
that wouldn't be a thing

246
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.170
that I personally would do.
And so I don't want

247
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.780
to carry that at home.
Like I want my lunchtime

248
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.600
and my breakfast time to
be my time. And so

249
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.820
if I know my teammates
are commuting from eight to

250
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.800
9:00 AM, then I will, my
burden quote unquote, will be

251
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.540
to do my personal stuff
from eight to 9:00 AM. That

252
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.750
is smart. That is smart.
It's about being conscious and

253
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.670
being thoughtful and thinking about
how you feel about a

254
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.790
situation, how others might feel
about that situation, applying empathy

255
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.130
to it, and then deciding
that, okay, this is a

256
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.110
decision I made. This is
a decision that they made,

257
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.410
but I am going to
set boundaries because otherwise, if

258
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.180
there are no boundaries that
the work is going to

259
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.300
consume me. Yeah. And then
you don't, you know, you

260
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.510
don't take those steps back
those steps back to, you

261
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.310
know, take the space to
think through problems. If you're

262
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.830
in engineering or in any
field really right. You don't,

263
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.440
you don't really get to
do the things that you

264
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.920
would normally do. Right. Which
I think brings me to

265
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.960
another point that I was
talking about in that thread

266
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.820
that's related is taking frequent
small breaks. Right. I know

267
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.190
in a lot of office
settings, there's always the challenge

268
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.710
of, Oh, you know, there's
folks who take smoke breaks.

269
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.840
And I used to tell
everyone whether you smoke or

270
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.000
not, or no matter what
your voice is or what

271
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.580
you do always take a
smoke break or take a

272
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.690
break, right? Walk, stretch your
legs, go meet somebody in

273
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.080
a different department. You can
do the same thing remotely.

274
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.150
You can, you know, if
you still want to be

275
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.090
connected, you can take stuff
away from the desk. If

276
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.670
you have a work device
where you have, you know,

277
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.370
you're connected to your teammates,
whether it's Slack or Microsoft

278
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.580
teams or another product, you
can still kind of have

279
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.760
water cooler chat with your
teammates while walking around the

280
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.720
block. But getting away from
the screen that much like

281
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.060
you would in an office
is really important to me,

282
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.180
for me, it was to
mimic. So that again, I

283
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.270
don't fall into that trap
of feeling guilty for taking

284
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.820
time away, just because I
work from home and then

285
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.980
just getting stuck at the
desk for hours on it.

286
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.420
And then you continue by
saying, protect your home spaces

287
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.670
for, you know, for rest
and recovery. One of the

288
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.350
things that I've done that
I think is a best

289
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.690
practice is that if you
have the space and not

290
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.600
everybody has an extra room,
I realize that some people

291
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.300
have studios or some people
have a one bedroom, but

292
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.150
I do have an extra
room, a den I'm I

293
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.040
designed it. I made it
with just a coat of

294
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.070
paint and different furniture. It
looks like a totally different

295
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.150
house. You see what I'm
saying? Like the walls are

296
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.240
painted different. The furniture is
weird. Like the, even the,

297
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.970
the, what would he call
these? The a, the blinds

298
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.060
do not match anything. Like,
it looks like you're in

299
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.570
a different place. So if
you can make your, your

300
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.700
corner of the kitchen or
your area, or wherever you

301
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.140
sit, look dramatically different than
your home, that's a way

302
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.540
of protecting your home space
that I've found works for

303
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.590
me at least. Yeah. That's
a great point. And you

304
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.540
know, when I was in
an apartment where I had

305
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.150
a one bedroom, but I
had a built in desk,

306
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.390
I made sure that I
didn't do anything but work

307
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.180
at that desk. So even
if I was, you know,

308
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.180
browsing the web in my
off time or anything like

309
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.120
that, anything that I'm doing
personal for comfort, I do

310
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.780
from places of comfort, the
sofa. Right. But when I

311
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.930
was in work mode and
it was time to be

312
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.730
on at the office, I
had to do it at

313
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.720
that desk. I had to
not bring work into my

314
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.580
other spaces. And that is
hard to do when everything's

315
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.680
at home. Right. But that
is key because you start

316
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.590
to remember that, Hey, when
I walk out of that

317
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.570
area or when I walk
out of that room, if

318
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.210
I have a spare room
that's signals, the day is

319
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.710
over. Unless I'm on call.
If something's on fire, no,

320
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.250
there's no more email. There's
nothing getting pushed to our

321
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:17.710
repositories. There's nothing getting deployed.
We're done for today. Exactly,

322
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.310
exactly. Do you find that
this is, this can't be

323
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.560
just us. I mean, we're
here to people talking about

324
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.200
what it's like as remote
engineers. I mean, this is

325
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.660
a thing, right? Like there
are, there are other of

326
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.180
us that behave the same
way and that the blur,

327
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.450
these lines between personal and
work, we are, isn't there

328
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.240
a thing about the remote
worker being a workaholic of

329
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.690
sorts. Yeah. It's, you know,
I have a couple of

330
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.440
friends who work remote for
some companies that are back

331
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.870
East that are not in
engineering. And they've kind of

332
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.740
had similar friction points to,
you know, you fall into

333
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.470
that trap of, you know,
well, I don't have a

334
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.300
commute so I can take
an extra hour of work.

335
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.970
And so I can take
a meeting until 6:00 PM. And

336
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.420
that's not fair to you
if you know that you

337
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.820
would have a hard stop
at 5:00 PM to leave the

338
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.080
office to be home by
6:00 PM. Right. And just the

339
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.720
ease of being able to
turn the laptop on and

340
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.200
off without the friction of
commute or of, you know,

341
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.660
an elevator, even in a
building taking five minutes to

342
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.320
come downstairs, it's you have
to put some other friction

343
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.320
in place to protect your
space and to not fall

344
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.800
into that trap of overwork.
I know I was notoriously

345
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.470
bad at this the first
year and a half, maybe

346
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:34.510
even two years teaching and
doing that at night, kind

347
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.200
of helped me get that
because I'm teaching a course

348
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.090
from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM after
having works from nine to

349
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.480
five. And so I had
to maximize that hour from

350
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.580
five to six before office
hours so that I could

351
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.240
eat dinner, or I could
like step away and drink

352
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.130
water or take a walk
or get some fresh air

353
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:58.350
or, you know, interact with
people. And just while it

354
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.770
would seem that doing two
remote jobs would, could make

355
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.310
that worse fatigue and having
to listen to my own

356
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.950
needs. I actually made that
a forcing function for me

357
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:14.930
to maximize the times in
between each opportunity. Interesting. How

358
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.330
do you deal with, with,
with sick days and with

359
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.880
illness? Because I have found
as my entire team is

360
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.240
remote, I've got a team
of six all remote, and

361
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.400
I hopefully I'm not calling
them out in public, but

362
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.090
they're all pretty lousy about
when they're sick, they're still

363
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.930
in bed answering email. It
seems like since you're already

364
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.870
in bed answering emails or
remote or wherever you are,

365
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.670
you know, you think yourself,
well, I can't be sick

366
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.040
in my house. My hands
still work. I should be

367
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.210
working. Yeah. I, I will
say that my team has

368
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.470
been great at one, forcing
me to, to practice what

369
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.850
I preach whenever someone's sick,
I just look shut the

370
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:58.010
laptop off, go to bed.
If there's anything we need,

371
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.740
there's another tech lead somewhere.
There's another engineer somewhere. And

372
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.620
there's another designer somewhere. There's
always someone on your team

373
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.440
who can back you up.
And so our team has

374
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.720
really had a, I've been
fortunate with this team to

375
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.110
really have a culture that
we've built together to say,

376
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.780
as soon as someone even
mentions that they even have

377
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.810
so much as a migraine
it's, Hey, don't tough out

378
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.080
the migraine. If you have
medication for it, take it

379
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.870
go. I mean, at the
end of the day, we're

380
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.600
not on the front lines,
like an EMT. We're not

381
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.440
you taking a sick day
is not going to result

382
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.240
in people losing lives. And
I think that's a really

383
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.110
important thing for us to
kind of, at times, keep

384
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.570
in mind is like the,
what are the ramifications of

385
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:42.380
taking care of myself versus
the flip side, which is

386
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.410
you overworking and extending your
sickness could actually make your,

387
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.830
whatever it is you're going
through worse, which is more

388
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.200
time away for you, but
also more time away for

389
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.280
you in that same sickness.
So now forget the fact

390
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.170
that you're away from the
office for an extended period,

391
00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.680
because you've been working while
you're sick. You yourself are

392
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.720
now going to, could potentially
be in a worst place

393
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.170
because you haven't let your
body rest because you haven't

394
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.840
given yourself a time, time
to recover. And at the

395
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.580
end of the day, that
matters more. That's more important,

396
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.310
right? That we come back
refreshed that we come back

397
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.210
healthy. And then we can
kind of jump in and

398
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.930
pick up where we left
off. I did a, a

399
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.780
blog post. It was called
software and saving babies. And

400
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.380
you know, your, your website
that sells, you know, widgets

401
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.560
is very likely not saving
babies. So unless you work

402
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.980
on like fulltime, baby, save
baby saving software, then you

403
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.420
can probably take a break.
You know what I mean?

404
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.460
Like there are, there are
mission critical things. I get

405
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.510
that. But at the same
time, you know, though, the

406
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.170
sicker you get the tireder,
you get the, we know

407
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.970
the quality goes down. So
you got to take care

408
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.040
of yourself, even if you're
a remote. Okay. Totally agree.

409
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.360
Yeah. Think about it this
way. When someone in, ER,

410
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.310
who's the best, who could
be the best surgeon on

411
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.970
their floor is sick. They're
not going to go operate

412
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.430
on someone. They're going to
go home because they're not

413
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.380
going to do their best
work while they themselves are

414
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:04.050
feeling sick. Exactly. Exactly. I'd
like to welcome our new

415
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:08.910
sponsor. Couchbase Couchbase is an
open source, no SQL document

416
00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.110
and key value store database
requires no external cash support

417
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.790
CQL and analytical queries for
Jason data. Couchbase supports technologies

418
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:23.310
like Kubernetes, java.net, Java script,
go and Python. Download it,

419
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:31.650
give it a try at
couchbase.com/hansel minutes. That's couchbased.com/hansel minutes.

420
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.170
And I'll remind you that
when you support our sponsors,

421
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.530
you support this show. Another
weird thing that at least

422
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.420
people tell me, it's weird
that I do is I

423
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.150
will go to the mall
and sit in the food

424
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.600
court, just to have people
around just to hear the

425
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.240
din and the, the electrical
energy of people in the

426
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:54.810
room. Do you get cabin
fever? Yes. So everyone's running

427
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.960
joke, which is also very
true is that I spend

428
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:03.390
all of my free time
at target, but ironically, it's

429
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.700
one of the places where,
you know, there's a Starbucks

430
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.140
in there. So I run
in there and I, I

431
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.200
grab an iced coffee, but
there's the people there's always

432
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.330
something new to buy at
target, which I have to

433
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.300
get away from. That's a
whole separate other episode, the

434
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.280
whole show Right there, how
to not buy things at

435
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.680
target is an entirely separate
episode. But yet for those

436
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.380
of you who are not
Americans target is the everything

437
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.690
store. And there's always something
at target. It's very hard

438
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.400
to go into target with
a dollar and not leave

439
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.890
minus 10. Exactly. But yeah,
that, that just the energy

440
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.050
of having other people around
is very important. So a

441
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.590
lot of times, you know,
what I would do is

442
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.200
I would always drive. If,
if I knew I wanted

443
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.410
a particular cup of coffee,
maybe I didn't feel like

444
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.020
making it, I would drive
and make sure I'd go

445
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.710
somewhere that was busy, which
would be probably anti what

446
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.940
most people would do. They'd
be like, Oh, let me

447
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.010
go to the coffee shop.
That's the least busy so

448
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.720
I can get in and
get out. And for me,

449
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.310
it's, if I'm going to
take the 15 minutes and

450
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.770
I'm going to actually burn
the gas, then let me

451
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.290
actually kind of feel what
it's like to be out.

452
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.320
And amongst the people for
the day. Another thing I've

453
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.630
done is start to prioritize
meetups. One advantage of being

454
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.990
a remote worker and working
from home is that because

455
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.400
I don't have a commute,
I can make it to

456
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.310
a few more things. So
why not go out in,

457
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.650
and not even just for
the networking aspect and, you

458
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.170
know, trying to go super
far in a career, but

459
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.570
just being around a sharing
ideas with others and being

460
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.690
creative with others and learning
from others, just that you

461
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:29.610
get that sense of connection
that you don't get. If

462
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.640
you just stay in the
house the entire time. I

463
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.630
mean, my doctor also prescribed
me a weekly outdoor meetup

464
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.460
and he said, you need
more fresh air and you

465
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.530
need more vitamin D your
vitamin D is low. So

466
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:42.600
then that's the other aspect
too, is that also being

467
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.010
out in connecting with other
people, even if it's being

468
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.460
in their company is also
good for your health. You

469
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.220
know, This is kind of,
kind of related and kind

470
00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.380
of unrelated, but I I've
always talked about how important

471
00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.820
it is to go to
small businesses. So I will

472
00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.800
always pick a small business
over a large business. I'll

473
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.930
pick a small coffee shop.
That's owned by a human

474
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.410
rather than Starbucks with all
due respect to our corporate

475
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.440
overlords. And in doing that
as a remote worker, it

476
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.110
has allowed me to build
relationships with small business owners

477
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.750
where, you know, it's like,
when you, if you remember

478
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.600
the show, cheers, when norm
would come in and form,

479
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.910
you know, like you get,
you can, you can support

480
00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.460
a small business, a local
business, your local bodega, or

481
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.250
your local coffee shop. And
you will feel there that

482
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.450
friendship, that genuine friendship when
you enter their space. And

483
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.190
then of course they won't
give you the Sinai when

484
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:30.100
you use their wifi for
an hour. Yeah. That's a

485
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.790
very great point. You know,
whether you choose the super

486
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.850
big box spot or the
small one, you know, something

487
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.520
as small as someone knowing
your order when you first

488
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.410
walk in is, is such
a, it's a, for me,

489
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.990
especially being remote worker. Now
it's such a reaffirming thing

490
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.600
of like, Oh, I have
some sort of connection with

491
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.360
this person. Yes. You know,
we have this business transaction,

492
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.610
right. I hand them money.
They hand me food and

493
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.640
or coffee, but there's also
the, Hey, Jason, you're back

494
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.610
again. I know who you
are, how you been. And,

495
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.730
or I walk in, Hey,
you know, barista, how's your

496
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.880
life, how's it going? How's
class. Like you build those

497
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.340
connections. And you know, we're
not all going to be

498
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.160
super close friends, but that's
not even the point of

499
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.530
it. It's just that just
for that few minutes, you

500
00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.500
have that connection spark that
you otherwise won't have. If

501
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.600
you stay holed up in
your office, Right. And that

502
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.330
becomes your, your water cooler
and you make a point

503
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.220
that, yes, you're not going
to be best friends with

504
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.830
the barista at the, at
the coffee shop, just as

505
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.370
you're not necessarily going to
be BFFs with your coworkers,

506
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.660
but you do need that,
That virtual water Cooler, my

507
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.260
remote team, we try not
to do work all the

508
00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.360
time on teams or on
Slack. We actually have a

509
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.350
WhatsApp that is the non-work
WhatsApp. That's where the memes

510
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.590
and the goofiness happens. Work
doesn't happen in WhatsApp, but

511
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.620
that is our, our back
channel of silliness so that

512
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.600
we can at least build
some culture and some camaraderie.

513
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.680
Yeah. We we've even brought
some of that into our

514
00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.400
like ritual meetings. So every
Friday, standup for a while,

515
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.620
it was called treat yourself
Fridays where someone had to

516
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.500
be on camera, showing whatever
treat they were going to

517
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.930
treat themselves for that Friday,
whether it was ice cream

518
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.070
or frozen yogurt or a
cake or a new, you

519
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.590
know, something new that they
wanted to buy. Just kind

520
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.970
of creating that non-work connection
aspect. We've shifted it this

521
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.480
year. So this year we're
going to start with trips

522
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.300
we're taking. Cause we talk
a lot about travel in

523
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.150
our chats and talks before
we get down to business.

524
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.430
So now it's like, Hey,
every Friday. So I want

525
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.020
to just spend a minute
or two and just talk

526
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.360
about somewhere. Cool. They want
to go somewhere. They've been,

527
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.540
or somewhere they are planning
to go. Just creating again,

528
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.880
like you said, those, those
back channels and those non-work

529
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.320
connection points and streams for
us to still relate each

530
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.510
other as people, much like
you would in an office,

531
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.140
especially since, you know, when
you have meetings in an

532
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.570
office, you usually have, you
know, Oh, I've got to

533
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.370
walk to the eighth floor
or I've got to go

534
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.770
down to 12 or, you
know, you have all these

535
00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.060
different points where you're in
close proximity to, but also

536
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.570
in so many different connection
points with other people. And

537
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.820
you know, the, even just
the small talk that happens

538
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.440
before the person who organized
the meeting walks in, you

539
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.140
want to not necessarily recreate
that, but have that same

540
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.490
effect in different ways. And
it seems like a small

541
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.500
thing. Some people might be
listening and thinking that these

542
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.870
are silly advices and things
like that. But as remotes,

543
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.210
I don't think people who
are not remote realize how

544
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.910
isolating, how much of a
hermit, how easy it is

545
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.620
to not leave the house
for a week at a

546
00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.850
time with all the video
conferencing and zoom and let's

547
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.620
lack and whatnot. We can
do. I might not see

548
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.170
a human for a week
or two. And honestly, I,

549
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.210
you know, introverts are not,
I don't think that's healthy.

550
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.050
So doing these small things
in these camaraderie building activities

551
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.420
has a lot of value.
Yeah. And it also builds

552
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:50.420
trust. A trust that you
build. I won't say easier,

553
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.250
but perhaps not as visibly
when you're literally yeah. When

554
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.760
you're in, in actual space
with each other in person,

555
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.430
right. Cause I'll see you
all the time and you'll

556
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.130
be in the same meetings
as myself. Or we will

557
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.850
always talk together when X
has been completed. So over

558
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.030
time you can make the,
the visual and the physical

559
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:15.380
association with these colleagues equals
things we're doing and we've

560
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.870
done it together. And so
we have that trust. We

561
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:21.170
have that at least work
bond. And when everyone is

562
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.470
sometimes just words on a
screen, you do need those

563
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.700
other ways to build that
same comradery. Definitely. You've also

564
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.710
made yourself a kind of
a snack bar or a

565
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.630
coffee bar. Like we always
have that place where you

566
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.910
can get a kitchen, you
know, there's a kitchen at

567
00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.620
the office, but you should
have a space of your

568
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.850
own. You shouldn't just have
people deliver you food. Yeah.

569
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.920
So, and this was a
challenge for me as well.

570
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.890
Now, one thing is I
love to cook. I will,

571
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.710
you know, try out new
cookbooks. I, you know, I've,

572
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.000
I've still got fancy dreams
one day of like, all

573
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.040
right, when I'm done with
my career in tech, I'll

574
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.700
open a chicken and waffle
food truck, which is about,

575
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.660
maybe about 65% on a
real idea at this point.

576
00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:07.100
Right. But it was important
for me to kind of

577
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.040
make sure that I had
some of the same conveniences

578
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.340
that I would in an
office. Granted, yes, you are

579
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.110
paying for it yourself, but
you're also at home, which

580
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.210
means you have your own
choice. You can have your

581
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.970
own snacks where sometimes you
don't have, you know, you're

582
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:21.740
in an office you're, you
don't have the snacks that

583
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.060
you would prefer to have.
And it also gives you

584
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.210
a point to get up,
walk to the kitchen. I'll

585
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.840
walk to wherever you keep
your snacks and still get

586
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.280
a few steps in. They
all add up. And you

587
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.370
also don't fall into this
feeling of everyone in the

588
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.600
office has more than what
I have. Right. If we're

589
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.030
going to have this convenience
of being in our own

590
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.240
space, then let's actually enjoy
that space. Now, when it

591
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.080
comes to the delivery apps,
especially now with the, you

592
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.410
know, the door dashes and
the Uber eats and the

593
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.170
grub hub, most of the
world, it's so easy to

594
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.020
never talk to another person
except for, Hey, thanks for

595
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.730
my bag of food. That
is so true. And so

596
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.440
for me, it was like,
all right, I've got to

597
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.750
not be on the delivery
apps. I will walk to

598
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.870
the store and buy a
sandwich or I'll walk to

599
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.400
the tea shop or, or
cook for yourself more importantly.

600
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.630
Yeah. Or I'll cook. Right.
I get full control. And

601
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.480
you know, a lot of
times, even when we're in

602
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.030
spaces, where if we're fortunate
enough that the companies will

603
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.760
provide lunch and or dinner,
you're going to buy the

604
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.770
same groceries that you buy
for the most part. Anyway,

605
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.740
because you know where, you
know, depending on who you're

606
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.740
with, where it's roommates, family,
friends, whatever you have to

607
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.070
eat outside of the office
every day, why not have

608
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.980
that same freedom and have
the, you know, a wider

609
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.950
range of food to enjoy.
And also just that action

610
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.110
of cooking for yourself. Even
if it's just sitting in

611
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.670
a kitchen for two minutes
to heat it up in

612
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.280
an oven or microwave, it
still gets you away from

613
00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:02.260
the screen. All of this
is on your Twitter. I'm

614
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.020
going to include a link
to this, this tweet. This

615
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.620
is currently your pinned tweet
at underscore JJ Phillips. And

616
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.150
we'll make sure that there's
links to this in the

617
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.970
show notes. And hopefully we'll
see a followup on this

618
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.850
with more detail on a,
on your blog. Yeah. That's

619
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.080
the plan just recently relaunched,
as we talked about off

620
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:24.880
air it's right before some
new content. So definitely want

621
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.370
to continue this conversation further
because the other thing is,

622
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.800
even though I've shared a
lot of these tips and

623
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.060
you know, you and I,
and a lot of others

624
00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.240
have resonated with it, it
doesn't mean that we've stopped.

625
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:37.750
Right. There is always more
things I can learn, especially

626
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.290
you haven't been remote for
like 13 years of even

627
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.300
some tweaks and more things
I could adapt to my

628
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.670
own way and make my
own new defaults with absolutely

629
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.340
lot of great tips here.
And lots more to come.

630
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.520
You can check out Jason Phillips
at underscore JJ Phillips on

631
00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.400
Twitter. Again, all that's in
the show notes. This has

632
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.010
been another episode of Hansel
minutes and we'll see you

633
00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:09.480
again. <inaudible>.
