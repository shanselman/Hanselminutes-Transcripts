10
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.550
focus is Victoria. Hi, this
is Carl Franklin, and you're listening

11
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.680
to Hansel minutes. Here we
are again for another great

12
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.020
show, Scott. Hi, how are
you? How are you, sir?

13
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.020
I'm doing great. Happy holidays.
Happy holidays to you too.

14
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.510
It was a good weekend
twice. So we're talking about

15
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.950
BitTorrent today. BitTorrent video, squishing
things you can do with

16
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.880
BitTorrent, optimizing, but torn how
it works and various legalities

17
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.250
And now would be a
good time for a disclaimer.

18
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.850
Would it not? It would
indeed. Yeah, we cannot. We

19
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.820
are not lawyers. We are
not legal nor illegal people.

20
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.550
We are just guys talking
to you on your iPods,

21
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.500
hopefully in double speed. If
you're not wasting your time

22
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.170
and we have no way
to know whether this is

23
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.050
legal or not legal. Carl,
what have you found in

24
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.960
your research? Well, I've found
that certain things are illegal

25
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.870
to share and certain things
are not. And the list

26
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.010
of legal things is small.
Indeed. However, there are some

27
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.640
major television studios that are
now coming out with and

28
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.010
media companies that are now
coming out with BitTorrent feeds,

29
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.400
but you know, they have
their own terms and conditions

30
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.310
there. Isn't just blanket stuff.
I've heard people say that,

31
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.060
you know, fair use means
if I can watch something

32
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.670
on my TV, then I
don't feel bad going to

33
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.160
download it if I missed
it. And while that may

34
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.980
be true, it still may
be illegal. So you really

35
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.530
need to check your laws
for the particular media that

36
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.780
you're trying to download. And
it's fair to say that

37
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.220
using BitTorrent and the BitTorrent
protocol is certainly a legal

38
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.380
thing. Yes. It really gets
into the gray area when

39
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.690
you download something odd. Yeah.
It's all a matter of

40
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.660
what you're downloading. Yeah. Don't
think poorly of the protocol,

41
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.790
but like you said, Warner
brothers is going to allow

42
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.870
downloads of their shows. There's
information about that at shrink

43
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.830
stir slash F H, Z.
Yeah. On Warner brothers agreement

44
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.220
with BitTorrent. Okay. So, so
what is BitTorrent? What is

45
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.400
it BitTorrent is I call
it kind of the equivalent

46
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.360
of a protocol. If a
protocol could shout, right? Victorian

47
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.710
is a bunch of people
getting into a room and

48
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.800
going, Hey, I've got this
version of this file. And

49
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.210
ah, and then just screaming
and yelling. You ever seen

50
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.310
the stock market guys on
wall street and they're just

51
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.530
screaming and yelling at each
other. Yeah, It's exactly. It's

52
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.610
the stock market protocol. It's
basically, there's a hundred gig

53
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.890
file. Some giant file I
want to get and you

54
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.910
know, downloading it classically from
Carl Franklin studios means that I

55
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.670
tie up one of your
connections. And if you want

56
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.040
to distribute that to a
million people, let's say it's

57
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.610
a really popular file. The
more people that want to

58
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.480
get that file, the fewer
can you get squeezed. So

59
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.600
BitTorrent tries to solve that
problem of the more people

60
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.510
who want it, the fewer
due to the more people

61
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.480
who want it, the more
people who can BitTorrent BitTorrent

62
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.140
works better with popular files
Also works really, really well

63
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.330
with podcast clients because a
podcast client will typically wake

64
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.910
up when there's new stuff,
right? And when there's new

65
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.610
stuff, you have thousands, possibly
tens of thousands of clients

66
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.680
trying to download the same
file at the same time.

67
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.740
And if those files are
big, why BitTorrent is just

68
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.440
perfect for that? Because the
rule a bit torn is

69
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.490
the more people are downloading
simultaneously, the faster everybody gets

70
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.820
the file. That's a simple
rule. You can remember Exactly

71
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.480
the protocol says, Hey, I've
got, you know, parts two,

72
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.030
six, and eight of this
file and you've got parts

73
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.280
three, four, and two or
300, three, four, and five,

74
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.210
right. Let's exchange them. So
you may, for a very

75
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.220
long period of time have
just chunks of a file.

76
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.100
And another guy may have
chunks and no one in

77
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.420
the swarm has the entire
file yet. But perhaps amongst

78
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.010
the group of us, the
union of us, we have

79
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.260
the whole file. If we
stay online long enough, we'll

80
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.100
all get the, the complete,
the complete file. Right. And

81
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.050
after you've got the complete
file, you've got to stay

82
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.400
online though, because, and there's
an unspoken moral code within

83
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.280
BitTorrent. So I've seen it,
not unspoken. It's baked into

84
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.770
the protocol. That's totally. But
if you leech, if you

85
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.200
leach, then you'll be less
likely to get a good

86
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.860
bandwidth downloads later. So once
you're done downloading something with

87
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.680
a BitTorrent client, stay online
for at least as long

88
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.580
as you were on before,
right. To seed, to seed

89
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.340
the swarm. The swarm is
the group of computers that

90
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.160
are all kind of simultaneously
sending and receiving that file

91
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.940
and seeding is when you've
got the complete copy. And

92
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.360
in order for BitTorrent to
work, you have to have

93
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.150
at least one person in
the swarm have a complete

94
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.060
copy of the, of the
file and be a Cedar.

95
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.850
So actually we're super Cedars
for you. Yeah, that's right

96
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.810
at <inaudible>. We distribute all
of our content with BitTorrent

97
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.960
as an option, and we've
put together a bunch of

98
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.440
pop ambassadors of which Scott
is one. And these guys

99
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.190
basically have some decent bandwidth.
Doesn't have to be huge

100
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.940
bandwidth, but you know, cable
modem, bandwidth, and they've put

101
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.460
together a bit torrent client.
That's looking at all of

102
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.820
the feeds that we offer.
And so basically whenever ever

103
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.910
we publish any new show,
these guys have agreed to,

104
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.170
you know, download it and
seed it. And so what

105
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.270
we end up with is
for every show we have

106
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.690
at least 25 30 seeds,
you know, and then on

107
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.150
top of that, we've got,
you know, more people that

108
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.610
aren't plop ambassadors that are
just using BitTorrent and using

109
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.950
it correctly. And we also
stagger the RSS so that

110
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.850
when we first publish a
show, all of the only,

111
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.420
only the ambassadors get access
to it. And when they're

112
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.180
seated about a half an
hour later, then we actually

113
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.750
publish the main feed and
everybody else who's looking at,

114
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.560
it gets really, really fast,
Right? So the fastest way

115
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.540
to get any of the
shows including this one is

116
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.970
with BitTorrent. One of the
problems of course, is that

117
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.690
BitTorrent uses a lot of
ports and oftentimes most corporate

118
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.440
offices won't allow BitTorrent BitTorrent
for you as a personal

119
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.260
protocol, as something that you'll
use at home is really

120
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.710
great, but because you're connecting
to a lot of other

121
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.620
computers, a lot of other
peers you'll have a number

122
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.630
of problems, or you may
have a number of problems

123
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.060
you won't want to deal
with. The first one is

124
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.090
that your router, whatever router
you may be using may

125
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.900
not be prepared for such
an aggressive protocol opening. So

126
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.460
many outgoing and incoming ports.
So there's some optimizations that

127
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.830
you can do on various
firmwares. And if you just

128
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.570
search for the name of
your firmware or the name

129
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.380
of your router and BitTorrent
optimization, you'll find it. I've

130
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.760
got an article about LyncSys
firmware optimization using the DDRT

131
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.440
firmware at shrink stir slash
F I too. And this

132
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.940
just as a matter of
changing, some of the, how

133
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.450
many connections are allowed open,
how many do I expect

134
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.930
to be allowed open on
my, on my router? And

135
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.240
now some people have said,
and I have not found

136
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.560
this to be the case,
but some people have said

137
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.740
that when windows XP service
pack two came out that

138
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.260
they were having some problems.
One gentlemen, blogged about this

139
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.100
shit shrink to slash F
H G saying that, you

140
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.800
know, they had locked down
the TCP stack when service

141
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.440
pack two came out and
it was connection attempts that

142
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.020
they would lock down to.
I think 10, and this

143
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.500
was to avoid worms. So
BitTorrent can look like a

144
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.850
worm to you, your TCP
IP stack, or your firewall,

145
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.090
because it's so aggressively opening
at ports, but I haven't

146
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.130
had it go to any
of the links that these

147
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.550
other folks have done trying
to raise the number of

148
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.360
connections that the limit for
connections used to be 65,000

149
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.300
plus and windows XP. And
now apparently it's 10. Have

150
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.890
you had to deal with
any of this? No, I

151
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.610
haven't. We're, we're running a
micro torrent on a server

152
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.050
and that server doesn't have
hasn't complained yet of any

153
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.830
such connection problems. And it's
been, You're running windows 2000

154
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.320
or two windows, 2003. I
would assume not windows XP.

155
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.440
We're running it on 2003.
That's right. We're not running

156
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.730
it on the next page.
I don't know if there's

157
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.670
a difference between the two,
but I have not seen

158
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.590
that to be a problem.
But if you search for

159
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.950
XP service pack two and
BitTorrent limits, there's a lot

160
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.540
of people out there who
insist that you need to

161
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.300
actually go in and patch
your TCP, IP dot SIS.

162
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.000
I've gotten BitTorrent downloads in
of 600, 700 K a

163
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.600
second over Comcast cable modem.
So I have not found

164
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.150
that to be the case
same here. Yeah. Yeah. But

165
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.160
be aware that that might
be one thing. The more

166
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.750
common thing is to just
go in and tweak the

167
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.610
number of connections also supporting
UPNP universal plug and play,

168
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.880
which is a protocol by
which an application can request

169
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.550
a port from your firewall
is a useful thing. Here's,

170
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.440
here's what I know about
this. And I think you

171
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.900
were about to say it
too, which is that a

172
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.660
lot of people consider UPNP
to be a security hole.

173
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.380
They do. Yeah. UPNP means
an application can open a

174
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.830
port. And if you allow
applications to open ports, if

175
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.770
some rogue application wedges itself
in there by some other,

176
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.180
you know, means yeah. By
using UPNP right. We're gonna

177
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.460
have a very polite virus
that requests the port. Yeah.

178
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.300
Right. There you go. So,
you know, if that happens,

179
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.280
then you could be opening
yourself up for a lot

180
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.430
of problems. Yeah. So what
I've done with, with micro

181
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.700
torrent, which is the utility
that you've mentioned, that's at

182
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.410
U torrent.com or shrinks or
slash F zero, a micro

183
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.140
torrent, which I cannot say
enough, nice things about what

184
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.400
a fantastic lease. Just it's
small X copy, deploy, no

185
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.360
install, NEC doesn't crash runs
in the background. It's just

186
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.290
fantastic. It is. This little
tool will tell you whether

187
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.920
or not you have the
appropriate ports forwarded. And I

188
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.830
just picked a high level
port and opened it up

189
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.940
and forwarded it to my,
to my system. Typically, before

190
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.170
version 3.2 BitTorrent used to
use port 68, 81 through

191
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.380
68, 89. And now they've
extended that all the way

192
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.000
up through 69 99, these
are all TCP IP ports

193
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.840
cause bit torn. Isn't using
UDP, but I've just opened

194
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.670
the one port and had
no trouble. Well, you can

195
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.890
open it. You can use
any ports you want. That's

196
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.810
kind of the cool thing
about bit torn is when,

197
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.640
and we're going to get
into what a tracker is,

198
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.980
but when you connect to
a tracker, you tell it

199
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.460
what ports you have open.
And so as long as

200
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.970
your, your, you know, firewall
has those ports open. The

201
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.360
problem there of course, is
that by using nonstandard ports,

202
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.180
you know, other clients may
be attempting to connect when

203
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.540
those outgoing ports are not
allowed on their firewalls. So

204
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.480
That is true. You do
want to have outbound outbound

205
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.630
access, no matter what on
port 69 69, which is

206
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.990
what BitTorrent uses to talk
to a tracker, right? This

207
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.070
is the server that manages
that kind of process. Typically

208
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.320
those are almost always on
69, 69, but you just

209
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.800
need outbound access, right? Nine
times out of 10 though,

210
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.050
a bit torn to work
just fine in your home.

211
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.570
As long as you allow
it on your software firewall

212
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.620
and open at least one
port on your, on your

213
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.170
hardware firewall. Now, an interesting
thing, I don't know whether

214
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.990
you've had this trouble, but
I've, I've been shut down

215
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.740
in three different hotels for,
for running torrents. No, I

216
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.890
don't usually run torrents in
hotels, but maybe that's why.

217
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.410
So this gets to the,
kind of the, the original

218
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.890
point of this whole conversation,
which was this thing called

219
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.770
TV RSS, which I had
mentioned to you before. And

220
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.150
I said, well, we gotta
do a show on this.

221
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.220
Yeah. I have a tendency
to be on the road.

222
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.640
I'll miss a show. And
we've talked about oerb.com and

223
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.340
different ways that I could
connect and stream a show

224
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.920
to myself. But TV, rss.net
shrink, stir slash FHV is

225
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.330
a place where you can
get RSS feeds containing torrents

226
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.720
with copies of the most
recent TV shows popular shows

227
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.930
the West wing, right. You
know, things like that. So

228
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.990
I wanted to download the
daily show and watch it

229
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.980
in high quality video, not
streamed, but just download it

230
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.810
and watch it on the
plane later. Right? So I

231
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.070
started up this torrent and
within 10 minutes, I lost

232
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.380
all connectivity with that network
and they wouldn't give me

233
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.710
DHCP. When I called the
hotel support. They said that

234
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.500
if you open more than
20 ports going out, that

235
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.560
they'll shut you down and
ban your Mac address. Wow.

236
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.750
I convinced the nice lady
to knock that off, stopped

237
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.240
running the torrent. But check
this out. Did a couple

238
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.780
of downloads loaded up my
regular feed reader, VPN into

239
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.300
work and tried to check
my email and got banned

240
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.350
again. So it's not BitTorrent,
it's simply opening 20 ports.

241
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.160
If you are, are a
multitasker, as I am known

242
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.070
to be, you'll get nailed.
So even doing something as

243
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.600
simple as multitasking at this
particular Marriott hotel got me

244
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.450
banned. And that was a
real disappointment. So do be

245
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.340
aware of what you're doing.
This is probably not a

246
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.850
hotel specific thing, more and
more people don't want folks

247
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.830
monopolizing bandwidth with, with torrents.
Yeah. And it may not

248
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.950
be a, a Marriott thing
either. May just be that

249
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.040
the it department and that
particular hotel has that policy.

250
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.530
In this case, they said
that it was the, I

251
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.320
forget the name of the
provider, but it is one

252
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.390
of those providers that you
recognize the name of when

253
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.940
you go to the hotel.
Right. When I dialed the

254
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.380
Marriott extension, they forwarded me
off to it for transport

255
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.410
or whatever the name of
the, the provider was. But

256
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.970
I think that that, that
kind of thing is gonna

257
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.920
happen more and more as
people build that into their

258
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.020
firmware. Like, I don't think
Starbucks wants me to run

259
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.280
a torrent inside of Starbucks.
Yeah. But interestingly, I was

260
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.410
able to get it working
the next day, by going

261
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.260
into the micro torrent and
setting the maximum connections to

262
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.160
10. Right. And just told
micro torrent, don't even try

263
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.900
to talk to more than
10. Now the download was

264
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.320
really slow, but it did
actually happen. And you can

265
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.750
see these ports that you've
got opened by using, you

266
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.960
know, sysinternals great TCP view
utility that we've talked about

267
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.540
before show@shrinksor.com slash F H
H fantastic stuff. They totally

268
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.770
rock. So if you go
to TV, rss.net and download

269
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.980
micro torrent, you just run
it, no install. And you

270
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.010
would set up the RSS
feeds from the RSS PR

271
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.590
preferences section of micro torrent.
And you can set up

272
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.110
a filter, just put the
name of the show you

273
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.600
want. You can put in
like lost or West for

274
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.150
West wing, and it'll do
a wild card search and

275
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.610
it'll download these files. And
these are usually high Def

276
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.050
files. These aren't crappy rips
off of some guys, you

277
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.460
know, cable. This is a
high quality HDTV rip with

278
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.460
commercials removed. And that's where
we start getting into legality.

279
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.060
Right? And then those were
about 300 to 400 megs.

280
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.000
I downloaded the whole series
of a great show. I

281
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.660
watched called how I met
your mother on ABC. And

282
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.580
we discovered it halfway through
the season. We wanted to

283
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.650
catch up, but it wasn't
on DVD. So we went

284
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.620
back to TV, RSS and
grabbed it. And here's the

285
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.510
cool part. And we talked
a little bit about this

286
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.820
in our second or third
show, but once you get

287
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.880
those giant files and you
want to squish them, right,

288
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.610
you want to get them
onto your portable devices. And

289
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.800
I just can't say enough,
nice things about video or

290
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.600
a video or a.com strengthener
slash F H I, this

291
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.390
is a converter of squishy
and there's lots of them

292
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.490
out there, but this has
the friendliest interface and it's

293
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.560
very inexpensive and they have
hardware specific free versions for

294
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.360
the PSP, for the Xbox,
for your TiVo. So I

295
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.510
use this to download these
shows. I squished them using

296
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.690
the Xbox three, three 60
converter, and then I just

297
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.520
copied them over to my
media center. And then watch

298
00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.130
them later on the, on
the Xbox with the media

299
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.150
center extender, you can also
squish these for your iPod

300
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:10.220
or squish them onto your,
onto your PSP. Wow. Using

301
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.470
PSP video nine shrinks.com/v H
N seems complicated. But if

302
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.170
you, if you just kind
of get that workflow, you

303
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.790
set up your feeds at
TV RSS, you get utorrent.com.

304
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.950
You pick the shows you
want. And then when they

305
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.560
come down, you squish them
overnight with video, or it's

306
00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.130
a, it's much more intuitive
thing than you would think.

307
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.180
And it makes long plane
rides, really a joy. You

308
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:39.010
know, there's a great audio
encoder, Rayanne coder out there

309
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.070
called virtual dub. Have you
used virtual Deb? I haven't

310
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.090
virtual dub allows you to
open any ABI file. And

311
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.100
then you can use a
separate wave file you can

312
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.790
use for audio. And it's
great. You know, it's great

313
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.490
for, we use it for
replacing the audio track and

314
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.450
a video. So we, we,
when we do DNR TV,

315
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.840
you know, we have a
somewhat crappy sounding audio track.

316
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.780
And then we go into
Adobe audition and extract the

317
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.750
wave file from the ABI,
you know, extract the audio

318
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.270
into a wave. Then we
do the processing on the

319
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.640
audio and cut out any
coughs and blurps and stuff

320
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.580
like that and make it
louder and noise free. And

321
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.280
then what we do is
we use virtual dub to,

322
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.940
to just use a direct
stream copy mode from the

323
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.740
wave file into the video
and save it as a

324
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.260
new API. And it works
every time, but it can

325
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.700
also take any video and
Kodak and in turn out

326
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.310
any other kind of video
with any other kind of

327
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.130
Kodak in any kind of
size. So, you know, it's,

328
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.980
it's good, it's a free
tool. That's cool. You know,

329
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.950
and, and awareness of, of
these audio formats, these multiple

330
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.520
tracks that you've just brought
up actually fits right into.

331
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.010
If you ever do ripping
of DVDs, you want to

332
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.970
take a DVD that you
on the road with you.

333
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.830
There's an interesting guy to
trickster.com/f H J that talks

334
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.100
about in the ripping process.
You know, DVDs have multiple

335
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.340
layers of audio. You've got
Spanish and French and English

336
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.030
and English 2.0 and English
6.1. You can save a

337
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.160
lot of space by making
sure that you only rip

338
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.590
the audio that you're going
to care about something. A

339
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.680
lot of people forget, and
they wonder why they're their

340
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.170
rips are so huge. And
while they squish poorly, now

341
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.450
speaking, they'll get back to
free content. So if you're,

342
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.060
if you're not feeling that
TV, RSS is for you,

343
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.280
if you are concerned about
the legality of it, there

344
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.120
is a free high definition
TV show that you can

345
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.590
get at Mary Posa, hd.tv.
It's at shrink stir slash

346
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.500
F H L. And this
is a bunch of Americans

347
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.010
who moved to Argentina and
have decided to put on

348
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.720
the Internet's first high definition,
10 ADI, a TV show.

349
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.870
If you've never seen HD
before, maybe you've seen it

350
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.290
at best buy or at
the store. And you want

351
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.450
to see what HD really
looks like. You're probably running

352
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.540
a monitor. That's at least
10 24. You can get

353
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.900
information about the different high
definition video resolutions at shrink

354
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.950
store slash FHQ. But 10
ADI is one of the

355
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.180
highest quality standard definitions that
you would get from hi-def

356
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.790
there's seven 20 P, which
is the one that most

357
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.070
people think of. There's 10
IDI. And then one day

358
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.300
there'll be 10 ADP, The
actual pixel widths and Heights

359
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.970
of those 10 ADI is
what Well, I don't, I

360
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.360
think it's 1980. I think
if you go to shrinks.com/f

361
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.920
1920 or 1980, yeah. 90
and 1920, I think it

362
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.330
is. And if you want
to see this for yourself,

363
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.970
see a high definition TV
show, you can go to

364
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.710
shrinks.com/fhl just download this Mary
Posa TV show. It's mostly

365
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.340
pretty girls and nice scenery
and whatnot around Argentina, it's

366
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.950
modeling and fashion and stuff
like that. They've got a

367
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.290
pretty slick site. They've got
three episodes of this little

368
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.630
TV show. It's kind of
like a travel channel, kind

369
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.100
of a thing, and download
it with micro torrent and

370
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.830
run it using windows media
player, version nine or above.

371
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.380
These are the versions of
windows, media player that support

372
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:02.570
that high definition, codec compressor.
Decompressors what codex stands for.

373
00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.080
And you can experience that
for yourself. It's pretty amazing

374
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.090
to see high Def, especially
on a computer monitor it's

375
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.900
so Chris Micro Torian has
RSS support, but from what

376
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.000
I understood, it was, it
was a little sketchy. Last

377
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.020
time I checked, what, what's
the situation with that? With

378
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.500
the 1.5 that I've been
using? It has been absolutely

379
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:25.520
the number one best. I
cannot say enough. Nice things

380
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.160
about how awesome this tool
About the RSS support is

381
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.530
what I'm talking about. The
RSS support is fantastic. I

382
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:34.190
run nine different feeds. It
updates every 15 minutes. I

383
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.620
can say on a per
feed basis or a per

384
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.610
filter basis where I want
stuff saved for the Westwind

385
00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.900
goes in that folder. And
DNR TV goes in this

386
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.280
folder. That's great. It's really
very nice support. Especially with

387
00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.530
the 1.5 version is the
one you want to look

388
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.470
at. I think it came
out in April. Yeah. We

389
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.720
actually use that in pop
catcher and pop catchers, you

390
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.470
know, as an RSS aggregator
for enclosures, it'll prob pop

391
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:59.910
catcher, we'll use both HTTP
downloading and micro torrent internally.

392
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.180
So a, the current version
that's out there at <inaudible>

393
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.360
dot com right now, will
you, we'll ask you to

394
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.610
download micro Torian. We have
permission to do this. I've

395
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.890
talked about this before a
little bit, but the version

396
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.320
that's coming up next, we'll
have torn embedded as a

397
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.740
DLL. So goods, There's lots
of great tools out there

398
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.230
to do debt BitTorrent downloads.
You may already be using

399
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.320
some, like, for example, if
you're using get right, get

400
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.970
right.com and say, download a
multiple part downloader, it's a

401
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.000
file downloader, lets you do
pausing and re resuming and

402
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.200
a parallel downloads of large
files there. Six O beta

403
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.590
is adding really good bit
torrent support, including support for

404
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.680
uploads. So if you're already
using a tool like that,

405
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.400
you may see just like
Carlos mentioned that more and

406
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.460
more people are embedding bit
torn into their, into their

407
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.190
programs, just embedding it, using
a library. And I think

408
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.770
that the fact that get
right is getting on board

409
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.470
with that is, is a
fantastic thing. What happened? What's

410
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.930
a, what's up with Warner
brothers. We mentioned them before

411
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.500
and they're they're coming out
with a feed. Are they

412
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.860
not? That's what they say,
but I haven't seen anything

413
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.250
other than the press release.
The idea is that the

414
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.440
day after their shows come
out, they're going to have

415
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.350
them up on the net
to be downloaded. I think

416
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.950
the idea is that someone's
finally explained to the suits

417
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:21.120
that when you send information
out via TV, it's shouting,

418
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.660
right? It's standing on the
top of the tallest mountain

419
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.390
around your neighborhood and shouting
it out and bit torn

420
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.460
is the same exact thing.
And whether people pick it

421
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.780
up over the air or
they pick it up over

422
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.760
the BitTorrent, they're going to
get it. And you know

423
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.310
what? It actually ends up
saving them money because the,

424
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.310
you know, the they're using
the internet infrastructure that's already

425
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.650
there and they have to
spend less money on their,

426
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.010
on their existing infrastructure. I
think that in the next

427
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.800
year or two, we will
probably see a major TV

428
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.630
show or studio release a
show exclusively on the web

429
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.020
or release it a day
or two before on the

430
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.440
web in order to build
up some buzz like, you

431
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.170
know, release a new version
of some TV show on

432
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.350
Tuesday in order to get
people stoked from us CTV

433
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.610
on Thursday, I think you'll
even see a Microsoft eventually.

434
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.110
I don't know if they're
gonna use BitTorrent, but they

435
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.530
may use their, they've got
a research project called avalanche

436
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.800
that they're working on that
is essentially BitTorrent plus plus.

437
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.400
And I, I, I can't
imagine that they won't be

438
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.520
taking advantage of this for
things like operating system releases

439
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.940
on MSDN and, and other
releases down MSDN. I mean,

440
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.130
have you ever tried downloading
a new version of an

441
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.620
operating system or anything when
it gets released on MSDN?

442
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.680
Forget it. And these guys
have more bandwidth than God.

443
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.200
So yeah. Yeah. I just
downloaded Vista yesterday and I

444
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.900
was, I was single connection
using the Microsoft file transfer

445
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.810
manager. It was like nine
hours to download this DVD.

446
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.490
It was ridiculous. Yeah. So
that's just screaming For a

447
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:50.230
BitTorrent protocol. Interestingly though, I've
read and I don't know

448
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.640
if this is true or
not, but I've read that

449
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.940
upwards of 30% of the
Internet's traffic now is BitTorrent

450
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.480
traffic. It is a very
chatty protocol. I read it

451
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.760
was more than that. In
fact it wasn't, it was

452
00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.790
last year that it made
up the majority of internet,

453
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.690
traffic, surpassing, email and web.
Unfortunately, A lot of that

454
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.790
is stuff people don't own.
And I think that's where

455
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.300
people get worried. I mean,
I personally I'll download a

456
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.220
TV show if I was
going to tape it and

457
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.970
I missed it. You know,
I won't, I won't rip

458
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.860
movies that I don't own.
I'm not going to go

459
00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.800
and download a movie off
of the net. Cause you

460
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.080
can go to blockbuster for
a buck, you know? Right.

461
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.630
Also it doesn't, it makes,
it doesn't mean that the

462
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.950
majority of internet users are
BitTorrent users because look at

463
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.020
the sizes of the files
that they're downloading. I mean,

464
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.320
one DVD transferred is how
many emails saying, you know,

465
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.280
even how many spam emails,
you know, thousands, hundreds of

466
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.340
thousands. No, that's a very
good point. My entire year's

467
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.180
email might be a single
DVD. Exactly. So, you know,

468
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.130
you got to put it
into perspective. In fact, my

469
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.970
entire outlook PST compressed is
probably less than a single

470
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.640
DVD. All right. All the
email you've ever you've ever

471
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.430
sent. Right. But unfortunately I
think that the reason that

472
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.090
people download these DVDs illegally
interesting things illegally is, is

473
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.460
more of the, the sense
of they're beating the system

474
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.910
and less that they really
need it. I agree. I

475
00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.220
will happily pay for content.
I think the world will

476
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.470
happily pay for content and
that's why I tuned succeeds.

477
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.770
And why iTunes insists that
99 cents is the price of

478
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:21.100
their stuff. Right. And that
that's a perfectly reasonable price

479
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.860
to sell something for two
bucks for a TV show

480
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.080
or what is it? Two
99 for TV show, fuck

481
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.180
nine, nine. I'm not sure
I haven't got our video

482
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.950
iPod yet. The wife won't
let me do it, but

483
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.210
Hey, one day, you know,
it begs the question. We

484
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.220
talked about this on Mondays
too. It, do you really

485
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.890
want to be watching TV
shows on a postage stamp

486
00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.070
size screen? Yeah. The only
times that I can see

487
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.320
that happening as on a
plane or on a commute,

488
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.440
but if I would, I
would say this though, and

489
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.100
I'm on the West coast
and you're on the East.

490
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.240
So you might know more
about this, but if you

491
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.360
were coming into the long
Island railroad, it get pretty

492
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.050
dull coming into Manhattan. You
might want to watch something.

493
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.470
Watch last night's daily show.
That's true. That's very true.

494
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.740
I've taken up to reading
books on planes. Yeah, I

495
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.610
have, I have a commute.
That's one exit. So there's

496
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.590
little that I can do.
Just going up one exit.

497
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.420
I can ride my bike
to work. So, but if

498
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.030
I were taking the train,
taking the, the max train

499
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.850
here, our electric train downtown,
I think I'd probably watch

500
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.480
a half hour show Coming
back from Amsterdam, from the

501
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.300
Netherlands to on the, on
the flight, back in the

502
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.600
airport in Amsterdam, I picked
up the DaVinci code and

503
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.310
I started reading it as
I was waiting for my

504
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.280
plane and I finished it,
you know, right after we

505
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.920
touched on it, I was
literally like 10 pages left

506
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.770
when I was getting walking
off the plane. And I,

507
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.470
you know, I, I didn't
start reading for fun until

508
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.740
I met my wife, you
know, and she's a voracious

509
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.480
reader, but that was a
fun experience. It was especially

510
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.270
cool. Not to have to
worry about gadgets and stuff.

511
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.700
And you know, it's the
simple thing sometimes that we

512
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.560
forget about. See, for me,
the simple things are flying

513
00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.610
back from Pittsburgh a couple
of weeks ago, watching a

514
00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.980
what the heck movie was
I watching? I forget what

515
00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.540
it was, but I was
watching a movie that I

516
00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.360
squished on at the PSP
in my, my battery on

517
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.080
my laptop had long died
my two hour battery life

518
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.230
on my big heat sink
of an IBM laptop. And

519
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.050
I watched that, that, that
movie. And I watched actually,

520
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.540
I think I watched two
back-to-back movies and a TV

521
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.940
show. I didn't even think
about the battery life on

522
00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.030
my PSP, like my PlayStation
portable. And for me, that's

523
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.130
the simple things, not having
to worry about battery life.

524
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.130
So there are some other
sites that are, that are

525
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.710
out there to support the
PSP for this kind of

526
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:35.150
stuff. Yeah. PSP video nine
at shrink stir slash F

527
00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.700
H N gives you a
video or a squishier that

528
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.580
will put a video into
a format that the PSP

529
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.340
can understand. And if you're
going to be downloading video

530
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.670
via BitTorrent onto a, your
system, you might want to

531
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.740
tweak some of the speeds.
And there's a number of

532
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.870
sites that give you tips
on how to get the

533
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.510
most out of your bandwidth.
One of them is at

534
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:59.360
tweaking bit torn speeds. It's
shrink, stir.com/f four. And of

535
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.350
course my optimizations page at
<inaudible>. Okay. The number one

536
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.630
mistake that people make when
they're setting up BitTorrent is

537
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:10.010
not forwarding that at least
one port to allow someone

538
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.470
to connect to your system
from the, from the inside,

539
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.110
as soon as the swarm
notices, you're not contributing, they

540
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.320
will lower your speed Then.
Yeah, the, the, the leaching

541
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.900
is the biggest problem in,
and I see that now.

542
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.270
I mean, we have how
many thousands of people that

543
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.570
download our shows, including this
one with BitTorrent. And yet

544
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.970
we still never have more
than 50 or 60 Cedars

545
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.340
at a time. The rule
of thumb is to keep

546
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.670
the torrent open, at least
as long as you had

547
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.230
it open before. So if
it took you an hour

548
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.390
to download, keep it open
for an hour, even twice

549
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.000
as long just to give
back. And that makes sure

550
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.640
that everyone will get a
piece of the show. Yeah.

551
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.280
Isn't there a setting in
micro Tarrant where you can

552
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.040
tell it how long to
keep the, to keep seeding

553
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.980
after downloading. Yeah. There's the
notion of a ratio. So

554
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.080
if you've downloaded a hundred
percent, maybe you want to

555
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.500
upload a hundred percent or
150%. So you can set

556
00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.690
that in the preferences of
micro torrent and say that

557
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.100
my seating goal is 150%
of what I downloaded. And

558
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.140
then you can set it
to either limit the speed

559
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.890
by throttling or by actually
stopping the torrent after it's

560
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.500
reached its seating goal. Nice.
So if you had a

561
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.360
lot of stuff you wanted
to download, you could just

562
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.150
set the ratio that you
want and it'll automatically throttle

563
00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.130
them back or stop them
as they go. And that's

564
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.320
a nice way to stagger
your downloads, making sure that

565
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.050
you're giving back as well
as receiving the files that

566
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.330
you want to go. And
let's, let's end with a

567
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:30.740
concise synopsis of how BitTorrent
works at how stuff works.

568
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.420
Dot com a bit torn
HTM. It shrinks to.com/f H

569
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.550
S a good overview of
how BitTorrent works. And thank

570
00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.590
you very much for sharing
Your knowledge with us and

571
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.370
experience. And as for you,
dear listener, we will talk

572
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.620
to you next week on
Hansel minutes.
