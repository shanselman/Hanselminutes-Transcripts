00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.610
of basic with Jeff Webb. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman and

10
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.690
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

11
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.270
sitting down with Jeff Webb, the
guy who lowercased basic. Jeff,

12
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.980
thanks for sitting down with
me today. I appreciate it.

13
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.430
Hey Scott, no problem. So
what do you mean you

14
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.340
lowercased basic? What is this?
Well, I don't, if you

15
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.290
think that I don't know
how many people are old

16
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.020
enough to remember a basic
EI and GW basic and

17
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.740
all those other great acronym
based basics that we worked

18
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.980
on at Microsoft. Those were
floating around for a long

19
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.140
time. And finally, they decided
to create a windows basic,

20
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.230
which would wound up being
visual basic. And at that

21
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.750
point they had a problem
with w what do you

22
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.000
do with all those letters?
You make them all uppercase

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
or what, and it was
kind of a funny little

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.040
argument. They have all over
the company, everybody was doing

25
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.220
it differently before we shipped.
And I pointed out this

26
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.580
problem and bill agreed with
us that it should be

27
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.950
mixed case. And so I
sent them a memo, you

28
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.100
know, the global memo and
ever since then, basic is

29
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.020
initial cap, lower case. Now,
bill that's bill, bill, bill.

30
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.300
Yeah. Yeah. Guilty. So where,
when was this? What time

31
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.460
was this? And what was
the state of Microsoft at

32
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.160
this time? Actually, when I
got hired back in the

33
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.430
late eighties, we had about
3000 employees. I actually came

34
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.410
in with a bunch of
people that wound up becoming

35
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.900
my fishing buddies, but I
still fish with today. We

36
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.030
remember the good old days,
you know, and bill was

37
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.730
just down the hall and,
you know, you could go

38
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.830
to him for a decision
on things. Of course that's

39
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.190
changed a lot since then,
but by the time we

40
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.760
were working on visual basic,
we were up to 6,000

41
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.400
employees. I'm going to find,
remember that wrong. There was

42
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.730
a couple of years into
my career, but it was

43
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.520
things were happening. I mean,
windows three was just about

44
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.560
to come out and it
was pretty exciting time Right

45
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.180
now. What was your, what
was your role and how

46
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.590
many people were on the
team that you were on?

47
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.850
Well, I got hired as
an editor for what became

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.080
later, but, but if I'm,
I got off the plane

49
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.740
coming out out from new
England, that project had slipped

50
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.370
out about five years. So
I got, I landed on

51
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.480
a base, the basic team
back then it was professional,

52
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.480
basic and Q basic and
a quick basic and all

53
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.890
that stuff. And that was
a dos product. And I

54
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.040
stayed there in that team
the whole time we grew

55
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.230
over the years, probably, I
don't know, 10, 15 developers,

56
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.740
probably another 10 to 15
direct support people. And I

57
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.080
became a writer and a
programming writer and wound up

58
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.980
working on just about everything
that came through that part

59
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.560
of the team here. And
we're, we're a division of

60
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.680
applications. A lot of people
don't understand that there were

61
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.480
two big, big divisions of
languages and application. We were

62
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.270
the only language and applications
and that's the way bill

63
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.340
wanted it. And it was
an interesting place to be

64
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.240
that way, because we weren't
as focused on maybe the

65
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.090
super technical audience. So we
weren't, we're looking at the

66
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.960
seat developers. We were much
more focused on people creating

67
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.770
a business applications. And that's
still the way VB is

68
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.090
kind of today. So C
plus plus was in a

69
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.110
languages division and you were
over with like word and

70
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.180
Excel and those guys, right.
Great. Yeah. That's all been

71
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.430
reorg now, I think a
couple of months ago, six

72
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.890
months ago, now that there's
there's languages and everyone's all

73
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.170
mushed together now. So the
C-sharp team and the VB

74
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.150
team are much, much closer
together these days. That's a

75
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.920
recent, recent thing. Yeah. Well,
it's, it's been strange because

76
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.290
the last couple versions of
the dotnet languages, VB and

77
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.220
C sharp were identical, essentially.
It was just a syntactic

78
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.670
difference. Now with this new
one was 2008 there's significant

79
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.480
differences. VB proponents would probably
disagree with you. Everyone is

80
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.600
trying to distinguish themselves. I
mean, there's some pretty, pretty

81
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.320
cool syntactic sugar that you
can do in both languages.

82
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.810
Yeah. I I'd say now
there is. I don't know

83
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.080
if you're talking the new,
I mean, it depends on

84
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.840
where you draw the line,
but the first two, the

85
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.070
1.01 point, where are we
at now? We have three

86
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.270
hours. Well, there's VB nine
and VB 10. What is

87
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.980
it now? Maybe? I mean,
I think we're on BB

88
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.590
nine and C-sharp three, but
we call them to 2008

89
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.070
In 2008, 2008. I agree
with that. That's different, but,

90
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.530
Okay. So you're talking about
when dotnet first came out

91
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.070
and it was like, welcome
1.0, here's two languages go.

92
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.380
Yup. Yup. In fact, I
did the asp.net training course

93
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.110
for Microsoft, for the certification.
I did the first one

94
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.500
and then a 1.1 for
them. And they insisted that

95
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.590
we do both languages in
parallel. Right. And since I'm

96
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.740
a BD guy, I made
the mistake of doing the

97
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.950
VB first and then trying
to transliterate it into C-sharp

98
00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:02.330
and I discovered very quickly.
Yeah, You wrote the legendary

99
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.970
and it's legendary. Cause I
still have it, the visual

100
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.490
basic six Oh, developers workshop
with a couple of guys.

101
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.360
Didn't you With John Craig? Yeah,
that was his, that was

102
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.030
his original idea. And I
came on at five <inaudible>

103
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.460
and wound up doing it.
The six O did about

104
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.230
half of it at that
point. So we're the coauthors

105
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.210
on it. John's still around,
you know, I never met

106
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.500
that guy, but I still
talk with them. You wrote

107
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.880
an entire book without meeting
him. Yeah. I wrote, wrote

108
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.650
I've written several. Wow. That
seems like an obvious thing.

109
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.690
Now I know lots of
people who will work on

110
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.340
things collaboratively, but it just
seems like even even five

111
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.120
to eight years ago, that
that was less feasible to

112
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.670
do something so complicated as
collaborate that far away on

113
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.690
something so complicated. Yeah. John
is a really great guy

114
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.450
and I like the format
of the AFT John thing.

115
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.760
We, we kept that when,
when I joined the team,

116
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.740
we kept it. Even though
it could be ask John

117
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.000
or Jeff or something like
that, or you just keep

118
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.780
it simple. But, but I,
you know, it's funny that

119
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.520
you mentioned that book, but
a lot of people really

120
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.810
liked it. I think that's
a credit to John. He's

121
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.860
just a really great guy.
Yeah. That was a great

122
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.900
book. I actually wrote items,
question items for the visual,

123
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.570
for the, the MCSD test,
the certification. So I wrote

124
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.590
the visual basic six desktop
and web questions. And I

125
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.980
remember there was a bunch
of us writing pools and

126
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.980
pools of questions with distractors.
And it was at that

127
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.150
point when I finally resolved
that I did not find

128
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.810
certifications to be a valuable,
a valuable thing. It was

129
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.650
the exercise of actually, I
don't know if I had

130
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.910
mixed feelings about it. It
was the, it was the

131
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.230
writing of that test. Cause
the, the questions were fine,

132
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.570
but I, I felt like
I was like, I felt

133
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.120
like I was on jeopardy.
You know, it was just,

134
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.750
it just, you know, what
is ad referenced? It just,

135
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.410
the whole thing was a
ridiculous experience. I like the,

136
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.970
the more real world certifications.
They've got the art architect

137
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.220
certification now where you go
in front of a panel

138
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.460
and explain the solution. They've
got virtual machine ones and

139
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.680
simulation ones where you actually
have to do some work.

140
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.820
But I never thought that
is based entirely on a

141
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.290
radio buttons was the way
to go. One of my

142
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.550
coworkers, Tony Arnowitz recently was
he's always wanted to teach

143
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.280
a programming class and I
was talking to them about

144
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.470
it. And he says, nah,
it's not gonna be an

145
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.660
ordinary programming class. He said,
here's what I'm going to

146
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.230
do first week. I'm going
to give the people assigned.

147
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.680
If I could give them
the requirements, I'm going to

148
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.900
have him start programming. They're
going to go for about

149
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.880
a week. And then I'm
going to walk into the

150
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.850
class on Monday and say,
okay, everybody's shift with the

151
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.810
person to the right. And
they're all going to have

152
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.350
to change code and work
on their other, their, your

153
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.840
neighbors stuff. And they're not
going to wait till about

154
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.970
halfway through the class, what
I'm going to say. Okay.

155
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.190
I'm changing the require. That
is a really good idea

156
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.770
for a class. Yeah. He
was the only thing that

157
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.290
he was sticking on was
how do you grade, how

158
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.240
do you grade them? And
I told him, well, you

159
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.800
probably can just grade them
on how much of the

160
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.990
class they complete if they
get halfway through it and

161
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.330
get it Exactly. If they
quit and leave. I taught,

162
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.360
I taught C-sharp at the
local university and tried to

163
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.220
do a similar kind of
a real world thing, but

164
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.200
I never had the idea
of actually switching people in

165
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.730
their chairs, having them inherit
legacy code and, and then

166
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.920
try to continue forward and
still succeed and then change

167
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.020
the requirement in the middle
too. What a great idea.

168
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.020
It's just evil. It's evil.
He could tell he's kind

169
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.870
of an evil guy, But,
but reality has a bit

170
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:47.180
of an evil bias. So,
so back to the history

171
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.370
stuff. So Bill's down the
hall. You can just stick

172
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.230
your head over the cubicle
and just wander down the

173
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.810
hall and say, Hey, Hey,
you say, Hey, sir, or

174
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.840
do you say, Hey, bill,
check this out. We have

175
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.770
nice offices, man. We didn't
have cubicles, No cubes. Okay.

176
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.560
So everyone's got a door
Probably, probably about four doors

177
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.290
down from where I was
sitting in building four. And

178
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.210
I was on the second
floor at the time. And

179
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.370
I just walked by. I
just in awe. You know,

180
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.470
I was just amazed. I
don't think I said two

181
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.570
words to him the whole
time. Oh really? So even

182
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.790
then, even then there was
a sense of, this is

183
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.110
this is going fast. Yeah.
It's but you know, it's

184
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.100
like, I still, I still
think he's one of the

185
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.380
coolest guys in the world.
I mean, you know, for

186
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.600
a while, you know, I
idolized a few people. I

187
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.820
idolized George Washington. So I had
to delegate and Bill's been

188
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.650
very big to me and
made me a lot of

189
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:38.600
money. So, so, so that's
a cool thing. But this

190
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.780
guy who, who came in
when I was working on

191
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:47.510
BB three, drew Fletcher, he
wasn't, he wasn't as a

192
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.910
retirement. He would, he would
go talk to bill. And

193
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.770
we were up at a
shift party once and he

194
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.690
wasn't, he wasn't really watching
what he was doing. And

195
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.520
he cut in line in
front of bill and in

196
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.860
the food line, you know,
and then he turned around

197
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.690
and saw him standing there
and he was like, Oh,

198
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.410
sorry. You know, and that
was pretty cool about it.

199
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.330
But he started, you know,
tried to strike up conversation.

200
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.560
And of course we were
working at VB. So we

201
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.500
had something to talk about
and you just looked at

202
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.390
him and says, you know,
I don't understand, like we

203
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.790
don't put pointers in TB.
I mean, what was the

204
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.070
wrong or that people really
want pointers, you know? And

205
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.130
it's like, see, Bill's face
turning red. It was something

206
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:32.360
you really cared about. And
I wonder what the, what

207
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.970
the rules are. I'm still
learning my way around Microsoft.

208
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.380
And I've only been there
a year. How long were

209
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.340
you there other five years?
Either five years, but five

210
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.550
pretty good years trying to
figure out what the rules

211
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.470
are. As far as talking
to the bosses like that,

212
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.040
you know, like I, my,
my boss is kind of

213
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.380
Simon and his boss has
Scott goo and his boss

214
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.960
is a VP named Soma.
So I'm, I just wandered

215
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.820
into someone's office one day
and said, hi and introduced

216
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.980
myself. And he was very
kind and he shook my

217
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.560
hand and stuff, but no
idea who I am really

218
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.530
not clear why this guy
has come here to shake

219
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.260
my hand and say hello.
So I kind of wandered

220
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.350
off saying, gosh, that was
the right thing to do.

221
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.980
If the company had 500
people, but you know, the

222
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.500
company has 80,000 and the
division has two or 3000

223
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.410
or whatever. Probably not the
best idea for me to

224
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.180
have just wanted up to
a random VP and said,

225
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.650
hi, I'm new, nice to
meet you. Well, I, you

226
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.430
know, I, I don't know
about that. Cause when right

227
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.930
before I left, I knew
Mike Maples a little bit

228
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.450
because he was, he was
the vice president, I think

229
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.730
at the time or number
of the office of the

230
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.070
president or something like that.
He was an ex IBM

231
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:47.400
guy and there was a
crisis at Microsoft. And what

232
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.250
happened was bill had written
a memo about direct from

233
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.480
IBM. I have to remember
that, but he basically wrote

234
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.400
after the whole <inaudible> thing,
you know, finished up, he

235
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.320
wrote that they're down now,
but you know, we really

236
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.360
got to keep an eye
on him because, you know,

237
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.130
they may be an elephant
that they can turn around

238
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.430
and move very quickly when
they want to. And so

239
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.000
it sort of, you know,
keep yourself sharp kind of

240
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.320
Nemo. And a friend of
mine actually shared it with

241
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.880
the, the, one of the
newspapers and it came out

242
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.510
and the stock crashed, you
know, and I think bill

243
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.900
actually lost like $5 billion that
day or something like that.

244
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.840
It was, it was one
of those monumental, you know,

245
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.090
shifts in the stock, which
we've seen over the years.

246
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.510
And, and it was, you
know, it wasn't that bad

247
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.770
of a memo, but it
was just, it was not

248
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.020
for public consumption. And so
I was sitting in the

249
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.650
lobby of building nine ones
like Naples is talking some

250
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.200
other exact, and they were
really kind of, you know,

251
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.930
the other guy was kind
of pissed about it because

252
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.760
you, they probably seen a
lot of the stock drop

253
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.550
and, and Mike said, you
know, you and I both

254
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.470
worked for companies that, you
know, and used to keep

255
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.860
tabs on demos like that
and have your, for your

256
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.120
eyes only and stuff like
that. And he says, I

257
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.610
think this is better. I
thought that was a pretty

258
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:12.060
cool comment. You know, the
little stuff, The little stuff,

259
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.400
the little $5 million. Yeah. I
thought that was a very

260
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.720
cool, I really, that really
impressed me about Mike Naples.

261
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.470
I thought that was, you
know, that was something that

262
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.110
people don't know about them.
I think it's pretty cool.

263
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.070
Do you know how to
make the possible out of

264
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.400
the impossible? Well, the dotnet
ninjas at Telerik do they

265
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.860
just released a huge pack
of web controls, all built

266
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.040
on top of ESPN at
Ajax, that'll help you build

267
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.890
impossibly fast and interactive applications
in no time at all.

268
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.810
They've made the impossible possible
and desktop development. If you

269
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.210
think you can't have a
carousel component and wind forms,

270
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.530
well, you can. They're windows
forms, suite features a super

271
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.740
powerful grid view control on
32 other crazy desktop components

272
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.340
that will give you a
dazzling WPF like features, but

273
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.920
in wind farms, they do
the same thing in reporting

274
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.350
solutions with a new design
service, like nothing else looks

275
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:07.370
just like graph paper gives
you advanced page layout capabilities

276
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.010
makes it feel more like
a graphic design software than

277
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.520
a reporting solution. Go check
them out@telerik.com and be at

278
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.150
dotnet Ninja. And thanks for
listening. There's a lot of

279
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.000
people at Microsoft that are
cool with transparency. I mean,

280
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.070
it doesn't mean that it
doesn't mean that every rank

281
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.910
and file should be blogging
about what are secret super

282
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:32.120
secret plans for 20, 25
are, but it definitely erring

283
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.640
on the side of transparency
is almost always a good

284
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.700
thing in any, any situation.
I mean, your parents tell

285
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.500
you this, you don't tell
the truth and I won't

286
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.960
be mad. Yeah. I think
I agree with that. And

287
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.260
I like working for companies
like that. I just finished

288
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.440
a gig with a defense
contractor and they definitely weren't

289
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.580
that way. Well, yeah, that's,
that's the government. So when

290
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.940
you're, when you're working in
a pretty small group like

291
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.870
this, you said, you know,
10 developers, you know, a

292
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.580
group where you can know
everyone's name and, and you

293
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.280
got, you got bill, you
know, down the street at

294
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.420
reasonably accessible. Our, our people
are our people from on

295
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.270
high, like bill reaching in
and changing things. Are they

296
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.470
having arguments with people in
any kind of public sense?

297
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.220
Are they, I think they
do still kind of do

298
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.980
the same thing with the
project reviews, but I understand

299
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.580
they're a lot more formal
now, but they would do

300
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:33.130
periodic presentations to bill or
to whoever the manager, the

301
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.970
next level manager was. And
they would have to get

302
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.160
by basically they had to
get, get by bill at

303
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.210
that point and they would
present their product and stuff

304
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.520
like that. And I was
just actually thinking about that

305
00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.830
a lot. You know, that
that's probably the main thing

306
00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:53.470
that's changed at Microsoft because
bill was really a big

307
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.300
enforcer on integration. And if
you think back, one of

308
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.490
the reasons why windows succeeded
was really simple cut and

309
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.120
paste work, you know, you
think about that now. I

310
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.600
mean, we take that for
granted, but That worked everywhere.

311
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.010
It worked, it was ubiquitous.
Yeah. And it, you know,

312
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.060
you can cut and paste
from word to Excel and

313
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.210
it'll work. And, and that's,
that was just cool. So

314
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.370
he was really good about
concepts like that, that he

315
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:29.230
thought were important. And I
see that now that Microsoft

316
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.200
isn't doing so great on
the, the product integration and

317
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.450
they wind up with products
that actually compete with each

318
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.260
other. And that's sort of
the two big company disease,

319
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.630
I think a little bit.
And it worries me just

320
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.630
to look at, I had
a similar situation when I

321
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.730
was at a company that
went from 30 people to

322
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.890
300 and then suddenly that
kind of scrappy we're in

323
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.420
it together became a coopertition.
Yeah. Are we cooperating? Are

324
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.150
we competing? And then I
think at Microsoft and at

325
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.750
most big companies, there's always
at least two groups. You

326
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.660
know, there's always, there's always
like Scott. And then there's

327
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.970
evil Scott with a goatee
and another group. Who's doing

328
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.630
the exact same thing, but
with a different spin. And

329
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.520
then you don't even know
you exist until at one

330
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.550
point, some hole gets punched
into the fabric of space

331
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.830
time between your little company
and you go, wait a

332
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:21.840
second, you're working on a
fizz bin, also shoot. And

333
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.150
then suddenly it becomes a
fizz been smacked down and

334
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.770
we both have to find
out, you know, and it

335
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.900
gets escalated up to a
boss and the boss says,

336
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.150
all right, it can't be
two visual basics or there

337
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.210
can't be two FAS bins
or whatever. So, you know,

338
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.260
fight, fight it out. Yeah.
That's a cool thing. But

339
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.830
I mean, really the great
thing about being at Microsoft

340
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:45.680
at that time was that
there weren't those, those barriers

341
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.610
to doing things like, I
don't know if you've read

342
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.130
any Bryan Overlands books, but
he was part of the

343
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:57.740
VB team. And one of
the main things that he

344
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.280
did early on was he
wrote the custom control development

345
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.530
guide and the original instructions
on how to write custom

346
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.520
controls for visual basis. The
X's. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.550
And that was a huge
success. I mean, that was,

348
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:18.020
it was that one book
and it was a simple,

349
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.170
I think it was a
clock, a little digital, a

350
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:26.000
little Oh, analog clock that
you could drag into windows

351
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.740
app, you know, that was
his sample that launched a

352
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.730
thousand added, you know, and
one guy can do something

353
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.800
like that. And it's really,
really neat. You know, it's

354
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.470
just, you know, I, I
know that he's living in

355
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.090
Hawaii right now. I think
he has a very good

356
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.790
life, you know? So, you
know, when you're at the

357
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.100
right place at the right
time, you can do some,

358
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.510
some neat things. Yeah. That
launched the whole ad in,

359
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.210
I mean the whole VBX
OCX world, the whole idea

360
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.940
of, of a third party
ecosystem, you know, they always

361
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.900
use that term around Microsoft.
And I talk about the

362
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:04.970
larger community ecosystem. People are
worried about backward compatibility, not

363
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.000
just for the devs, but
they think, well, you know,

364
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.200
if we change this interface,
is that going to mess

365
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.680
up that grid and then
crush the entire grid industry?

366
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.460
Yeah. Well, yeah, you got
to worry today for sure.

367
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.580
But the cool thing about
that for the VB product,

368
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.480
which, which was really unique
was that we didn't really

369
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.940
advertise visual basic all that
much. It was the third

370
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.970
parties did all the advertising
and they had a vested

371
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.420
interest in promoting this. And
VB was actually an integration

372
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.280
tool for them. So it
was a way they could

373
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.330
bring together their components and
sell their components and develop

374
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.580
business apps. And so if
you picked up any of

375
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.120
those VB magazines back then,
there were always tons and

376
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.550
tons of little, you know,
quarter page ads for some

377
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.800
custom or something. And it
was a great, I mean,

378
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.840
it's a great environment. And
now we're seeing that develop

379
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.920
with SharePoint and web parts.
And that may even propagate

380
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.370
out to asp.net applications, you
know, with bed parts and

381
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:06.040
stuff. So the component, a
third party marketplace, it's pretty

382
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.980
interesting right now. And it's
just kind of challenging. I'm

383
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.980
just, I'm just entering it
now. I'm working on my

384
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.270
essential SharePoint web parts and
working with bamboo solutions on

385
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.720
since things now. So it's
kind of an interesting, interesting

386
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.490
world now that we have
to worry about security. Of

387
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.690
course, that wasn't an issue
back then. Was that how

388
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.000
it would do, did we
literally just not sweat it

389
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:34.230
or were we just completely
Pretty much, I mean, you

390
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.300
know, Lord knows. I mean,
I wonder if anyone ever

391
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.240
went back into windows three,
extra three, one and threat

392
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:45.180
modeled it, what they would
find. Yeah, that would be

393
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.330
bad. It was really fun.
I mean, it is, the

394
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.330
virus could spread by, you
know, sneaker net was about

395
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:56.940
the fastest, like get around.
It was pretty loose. I

396
00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:03.390
remember I worked on a
Olay to calm and I

397
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:08.460
wrote the a programmer's guide
for what became Ole automation,

398
00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:14.370
which is the way that
Excel integrated programming programmability. And

399
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.840
actually it's funny that there
are, there's a huge tension.

400
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.660
I don't know if it
still exists between the Excel

401
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:27.030
people and the VB people
because VBA got a bad

402
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:30.390
reputation as being a vector
for viruses because there was

403
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:35.190
no, there was absolutely no
security, Right. That'll just open

404
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.750
up. And in the old
days, you'd open up a

405
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.330
file and people would just
send you a word file

406
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.180
or an Excel file and
say, check this out. Absolutely,

407
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.180
absolutely. I mean, that shows
the level of night of

408
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.480
a day, you know, that
was going on. And a

409
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.970
lot of people, I think
in the office team would,

410
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.420
would have rather just rip
that, all that out, then

411
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.870
go through the, the abuse
they got from corporate managers.

412
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.310
I mean, really, I know
that Boeing actually blocked all

413
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.320
macros at one point. I
don't know if they still

414
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.580
do, but you could not,
you know, run any macros

415
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.700
at all there because they
were so worried about that.

416
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.300
And of course it's a
huge problem. Right. And so

417
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.970
what did Microsoft do? Well,
they instituted the trust model

418
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.400
for security, which I think
is wonderful. You know, it's,

419
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.010
it's great. Basically you display
a dialog box to that

420
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.340
user who of course everything
in the world about security.

421
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:32.370
And you say, do you
trust? Yeah. The, the, the

422
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.010
last person you want to
ask is the, is my

423
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.680
mom. Absolutely. Which, you know,
it bothers me about all

424
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.810
these models, whether it be
the Mac that pumps you

425
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.820
for your password or whether
it's the kind of the

426
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.780
curtain doom and Vista that
drops down and says, stop,

427
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.960
make a decision. Here's insufficient
information, you know, decide, you

428
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.990
know, it's almost like, do
you remember what was it,

429
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.630
Sunday mornings? And it was
the, the, there was an,

430
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.440
a crazy old man on
the news shoot. The, the

431
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.050
none, the McClaire report, the
who was that old man

432
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.760
who would point and go
Jeff Webb, what's the answer? You

433
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.720
know, what was that guy's
name? I have no idea.

434
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.090
Come on. Maybe it was
Dan Dana Carvey did this

435
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.560
on Saturday night live. It
was the McGlaughlin McLaughlin. Okay.

436
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.920
Yeah. Right. And yeah, and
he would be Chibi chatting

437
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.440
about something and it became
pretty clear that he knew

438
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.760
what he was talking about
and the rest of the

439
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.920
group did not. And then
at some point he would

440
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.030
call on you and, and
they, they, and he would

441
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.070
ask these obscure questions. And
if you hadn't done your

442
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:43.030
research, you'd be in trouble.
So Dana Carvey on Saturday

443
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.500
night live, did it take
off on that? And he

444
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.540
would start asking just really
out of the questions, you'd

445
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.550
have no way to answer.
And he would say something

446
00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.320
like he would be, he'd
have a panel and he'd

447
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.290
go, what did I have
for breakfast? And he immediately,

448
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.090
the spotlight is on you.
The camera's on you, the

449
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.540
microphones on you decide. That's
how I feel when, when

450
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.480
like when, when Mac or
windows pops up a dialogue

451
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.270
and says something horrible is
about to happen. Decide quick.

452
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.440
This is, imagine what that
must feel like to my

453
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:17.980
mom. I mean, seriously. Anyway.
Yeah. That's a, that's one

454
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.520
of those things. I just,
I been dealing with code

455
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.550
access security this, this week,
and it's a challenge. It's,

456
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.610
it's really interesting trying to
figure out what permissions you

457
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:34.990
do need to make the
code run because they're not

458
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.910
documented anywhere. And I mean,
I, I worked for Microsoft

459
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.570
as a programmer, as a
writer, you know, as a

460
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.350
editor and those positions don't
exist anymore. They're all filled

461
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:52.420
by contractors at some level.
And I think they're missing

462
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.710
the boat. Is this something
that, what can we, is

463
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.980
it really about documentation? Is
it about teaching? They don't,

464
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.390
they don't really teach people
defensive, secure programming in, in

465
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.450
school. It's usually a class,
you know, I mean, there

466
00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.870
are fields, there are fields
like test driven development or

467
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.790
security, or a little kind
of verticals within programming where

468
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.610
the people who are the
most fervent in that vertical

469
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.130
believe that it is not
a vertical. That it's the

470
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:23.620
whole freaking point secure code
from the start. Well, it's,

471
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:28.630
it's just very difficult to
figure out definitively what permissions

472
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.300
it's, it's trial and error
right now. And that's an

473
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.390
issue and you could document,
and you could actually write

474
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:41.200
in the, the reference material,
but permissions call requires, you

475
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.310
know, actually be kind of
nice, you know, just a

476
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:50.450
gentle suggestion in the handy.
So you've moved from VB

477
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:55.700
into the, into the SharePoint
world, but still a componentized

478
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:58.370
place, a componentized world. Do
you think that there's going

479
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.280
to be a huge web
parts ecosystem or is there

480
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.380
already? Yeah. And I just
put together a directory, SharePoint

481
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.120
workshop.com there about actually can
count them from there. There's,

482
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:18.110
there's, there's over two dozen
vendors right now. And SharePoint

483
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.540
right now is about, I
think it's from Microsoft. I

484
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.650
think it's a $1 billion a
year business, but I would

485
00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.760
guess that probably devil this
year, just a ballpark guess.

486
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:37.220
Wow. So the, the third
party spaces, very interesting. And

487
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.890
it's been around for a
while now, WSS too, you

488
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:44.660
know, pre previous version 2003,
it started with like courseworks

489
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.590
and some other vendors. And
now there's like courseworks and

490
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:53.870
bamboo solutions and there were
we're working on it and

491
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:58.550
where it could potentially be,
be reasonably profitable for people.

492
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.620
I think right now they're
still kind of in startup

493
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:04.580
mode, but it's an interesting,
it's interesting. I like it.

494
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.890
The way I got there
though, is, you know, by

495
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:11.480
way of asp.net, I, when
I was working with John

496
00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.290
and that VD book, I
got the web stuff, you

497
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.000
know, it was my last
name is Webb. It was

498
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.540
kind of convenient. And I
just took off from there.

499
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.500
And so then when it
became clear that asp.net or

500
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.650
ASP at the time, but
later it was asp.net was

501
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.560
coming out. Then Microsoft hired
me to do that, that

502
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.620
training guide and stuff like
that. So it kind of

503
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.480
morphed into ASB and then
that morphed into SharePoint. So,

504
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.160
so it's kind of, for
me, it's kind of the

505
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.180
same track for a long
time. This is a silly

506
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.920
question to end on, but
I think it's an interesting

507
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.400
one. Why, why keep working?
I mean, if you were

508
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.980
a good, you were at
a good place and you're

509
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.530
a good place at Microsoft.
You, you know, you did

510
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.570
make a little bit of
money and you were part

511
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.060
of the, that first wave.
Why not just hang out

512
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.720
and drink a fruity, fruity
drinks with little umbrellas in

513
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.660
them? Well, my wife says
George Bush still half my money.

514
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:10.010
I mean, that's that's, Is
it just as a knee?

515
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:15.890
Is it it's just a
need to create, I have

516
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.810
to work, but I just
don't have to work today.

517
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.930
That's that's my level of,
of finance. I think I

518
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.350
mentioned that to you at
the party, you know, we're

519
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.630
okay. We're comfortable. We had
a nice house paid off

520
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:31.880
and stuff, but my daughter's
going to arts. Cool. Okay.

521
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.730
Ice marches forward. Huh? I'm
just wondering that's life, life

522
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.340
marches forward expenses come up.
Just seemed to me like

523
00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.210
a, you know, an in
office space, the guy talks

524
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.950
about what if, what could
he do if he didn't

525
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.320
have a job? He said,
I'd do nothing. And when

526
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.320
he says nothing, he was
being sincere. I wonder if,

527
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.280
if anyone ever did that,
if anyone ever truly did

528
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.970
nothing Well, there's, it's a
good, it's a good thing

529
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.190
to study with ex Microsoft
people, because a lot of

530
00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.470
us really had that option.
I mean, for awhile, I

531
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:05.070
did. And I wound up
down in Sanibel doing a

532
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.100
lot of Tarpon fishing, but
I was still writing books.

533
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.590
So I would write a
book a year. It takes

534
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:14.250
about three to six months
to write a book. And

535
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.450
so I kept, you know,
doing stuff, but my job

536
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.610
was Tarpon fishing. So I
caught a lot of Tarpon.

537
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.780
It's something I'm still very
good at. And if anybody

538
00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.060
wants to hire me to
go Tarpon fishing, I'm available,

539
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.110
But you didn't, you didn't
go and open up a

540
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:35.140
new, you know, a Tarpon
fishing company. You still need

541
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.170
technology. You didn't say screw
computers. No, no, I didn't

542
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.480
do that. I got a
friend who started a tie

543
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.470
flies that were part of
the original Microsoft fly fishing.

544
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.200
Three, three of us, Tim,
Tim Harris is still at

545
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.970
Microsoft, Jay Paulson, who has
amazing flies.com. And of course,

546
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:57.330
myself, and we just came
back from the trip out

547
00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:01.050
your way. We're fishing in
the shoots for steelhead. It's

548
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.050
really nice, a nice summer
steelhead and out there, beautiful

549
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:09.780
river I'm in forest Grove.
I'm a little farther West.

550
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.580
I'm halfway between Portland and
the beach. Okay. But I

551
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.590
know exactly that my dad's
on the Deschutes. I think

552
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.480
he just got back from
the Deschutes last, last a

553
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.270
couple of weeks ago. How
do you do you know,

554
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:26.760
I don't care anything about
fishing or hunting. I would

555
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.230
have to ask him he's
in the other room right

556
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.200
now, having lunch with my
son, I will ask him

557
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.870
how he did it. The
tissues they came over, they

558
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.160
came over to have lunch
with my son. And I

559
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.260
said, I've got to record
a show, but I will

560
00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.840
make sure that the, the,
the, the, the Deschutes is

561
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.480
the place to, to go
fishing. It is true. It's

562
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.570
beautiful. It was really deep.
Well, Jeff Webb, thank you so

563
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.280
much for sitting down and
taking time to talk to

564
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.370
me today on Hansel minutes.
Well, thanks, Scott. Have you

565
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.640
got some good stuff? I
hope so. And this has

566
00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.920
been another episode. We'll see
you again next week.
