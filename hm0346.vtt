talks with herb Sutter about

9
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.870
souplesse blocks. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

10
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.150
episode of Hansel minutes and
I'm here bill we're in

11
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.900
building 92 in Redmond, the
bill conference, and I'm in

12
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690
a room here called the
brain box and you can

13
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.330
probably hear people milling around
in the background. We'll call

14
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.030
that ambient noise and I'm
sitting with herb Sutter. How

15
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.670
are you, sir? Hey Scott.
Doing well. Thanks for chatting

16
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.890
with me today. I really
appreciate it. I wanted to

17
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.270
come and talk to you
because I know that you're

18
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.480
totally excited about C plus
plus I've known debate. You

19
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.690
have been known to be
totally jazzed about, and I

20
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.950
learned equals plus in school
and I grew up on

21
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.980
C plus plus, and then
she sharp happened and then

22
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.560
I became a managed developer
without even knowing it. You

23
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.430
kind of transitioned silently over
to C sharp, and now

24
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.150
I'm worried that I've become
completely like a I'm only

25
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.580
sharp. And I look at
C plus plus, and I

26
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.180
find it scary, you know,
and I think that there's

27
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.730
a L there's a generation
of managed developers that are

28
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.490
kind of spoiled and they
may look at C plus

29
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.430
plus, and they say, why,
why is she plus plus,

30
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.810
so before I even answer
that, you mentioned you had

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.120
UC POS in the past.
Now you've been away from

32
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.460
it for I'm assuming say
more than two years. Oh

33
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.430
yeah. The reason I mentioned
that is because we still

34
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.890
call it C plus plus,
but it's a very different

35
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.680
language now, really. We just
had the new C puzzles,

36
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.930
11 standard, which was the
second standard for C plus

37
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.660
plus. And if you're familiar
with C plus plus before

38
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.850
you're thinking C plus plus
98, is that what I'm

39
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.420
thinking? That's a really good
question because that's in 1998

40
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.930
means in 1998, exactly the
last century last millennium, depending

41
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.380
on how you count and
be honest, true steps has

42
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.330
it. Well, I think when
he says C plus plus

43
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.830
11 feels like a new
language on my website, <inaudible>

44
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.290
dot com. There's a top
level link to elements of

45
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.150
modern seat puzzle style, which
is like a five minute

46
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.490
read tells you the top
six or seven features that

47
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.520
will affect almost every five
line program fragment. You're right.

48
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.550
You'll still notice that C
plus plus, but you'd be

49
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.220
forgiven if at first you
didn't realize it was because

50
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.700
there are so many convenience
features that and power features

51
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.000
there now. And there's much
more Than what's just at

52
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.880
that page, but that gives
you the quick overview of

53
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.950
what's new and different and
why it really does feel

54
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.010
like a new language. I
think the last time that

55
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.470
I did C plus plus
was just in that transitional

56
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.730
point when people started using
template libraries and I think

57
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.250
for ATL and STL, and
you got a whole host

58
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.950
of maps and sequences and
cues and things that you

59
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.140
could potentially bring in, and
that made sequel supposed to

60
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.160
feel like a different language.
So the STL was adopted.

61
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.010
The standard template library was
adopted in the mid to

62
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.280
late nineties and it came
in the standard 95, 96,

63
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.080
and then people started adopting
it after the standard was

64
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.080
published. And that took a
while. Some were faster to

65
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.120
adopt it than others. It
was really nice. And you

66
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.540
could combine algorithms and containers
very nicely through iterators. It

67
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.210
was very extensible. So basically
you had end plus Emmons

68
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.760
that of end times them
very much better than some

69
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.510
of the, the very hardwired
baked together, Oh, style containers

70
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.180
that people had done in
the past. That was a

71
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.870
big deal 15 years ago,
but that really was 15

72
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.270
years ago. We've come a
long way since then, if

73
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.760
you have not seen modern
C plus plus using auto

74
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.700
Lexi sharp far using range
based for loops using Lambdas

75
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.670
everywhere, you'd be forgiven for
not thinking it was sequel

76
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.490
salsa anymore, but it very
much is. And we've added

77
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.580
those features and much more
including move semantics and other

78
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.080
things that are very performance
related to enable people to

79
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.520
have a lot of the
same productivity, but without sacrificing

80
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.400
the efficiency, I mean, see
puzzles is cornerstone has always

81
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.130
been, it's a systems programming
language, you get full access

82
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.770
to the hardware and iOS,
if you need it, but

83
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.070
have efficient abstraction. So you're
not talking at the functional

84
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.160
of you're talking about classes
type generosity and those things,

85
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.440
but that you don't pay
for what you don't use,

86
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.590
that it all optimizes a
way very nicely. And so

87
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.600
that's been the hallmark of
it. So you're getting those

88
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.650
features, not instead of efficiency,
but in an efficient way.

89
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.080
Also, I like, I like
that, that that phrase you

90
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.870
don't pay or what you
don't use. And that's mostly

91
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.220
true. I want to spend
the caveat. If you want

92
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.300
to say strictly, that's not
true yet virtual functions, there

93
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.900
is overhead for V tables
if you'd, if you don't

94
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.790
use them. Right. So there
are a couple, or especially

95
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.920
for the dynamic type info
stuff. It's very rare in

96
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.350
all of C plus plus
that you get exceptions to

97
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.900
don't pay for what you
don't use. And almost all

98
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.090
of them were already there
and see Postal's 98. But

99
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.710
you know, when I I'm
thinking about this and you're

100
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.580
kind of bringing back all
these terms in my mind

101
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.360
that you know, how long
ago was that, you know,

102
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.440
15 years ago, we were
literally concerned about V table

103
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.420
performance. Like, you know, you
used the virtual here and

104
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.430
I think I don't want
to do that and you

105
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.890
can get more out of
it, but now we're taking

106
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.100
things for granted. I mean,
we've got interpreted languages running

107
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.380
major, top 10 websites. Do
I care at all about

108
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.590
performance though anymore, right? Why
I've been abstracted away for

109
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.440
so long? You know, even
memory management I've forgotten about

110
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.340
All the time. You may
not, certainly we don't worry

111
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.410
about V table calls nearly
as much anymore as we

112
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.170
used to. However, performance is
still important. And the two

113
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.160
places where it's most important
is mobile performance per watt

114
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.790
matters. And also in the
data center were performance per

115
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.240
users. Matter. Like for example,
I'm talking with Andre, Alexandra

116
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.270
sq, who's a well known
CPL sales personality. And he

117
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.940
wrote modern SQL plus design.
And around the year 2000,

118
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.290
which really influenced a lot
of the, the generosity type

119
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.860
generosity that people use. He
now works at Facebook. And

120
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.660
as a research scientist there,
one of the things he's

121
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.660
noticed is that Facebook which
had been programmed in PHP

122
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.990
and other languages has more
and more gone to C

123
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.990
plus plus for performance. And
one of the things that

124
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.610
he pointed out in a,
in a panel we were

125
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.770
on not long ago, it
was very interesting because he

126
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.110
pointed out just in passing
and then I called him

127
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.940
on it. And I really
emphasize this to the audience.

128
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.720
Did you notice that Andre
just said the primary measurement

129
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.920
is Watts per user Watts
power like Watts per user,

130
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.850
Like I'm writing some code
and I'm thinking about it

131
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.330
Electricity. Yes. Because that's one
of your major costs in

132
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.790
a data center. If you
turn a, I've got a

133
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.280
channel nine, a, a YC
plus boss talk, you can

134
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.440
find it on channel nine.
And I just realized, let's

135
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.900
see, it's got another round
of views on Twitter in

136
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.060
the last couple of weeks.
It goes into it in

137
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.810
more detail. But I point
out there some research and

138
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.420
data showing why. And if
you look at a data

139
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.790
center costs power, isn't actually
the major cost. That's a

140
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.150
common misconception, but it's the
second biggest one, delivering power

141
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.160
using it. And then getting
rid of the heat is

142
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.770
the second biggest cost after
the hardware and those two

143
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.450
things together, hardware and the
power account for roughly 88%

144
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.910
of data center costs today.
This is something that a

145
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.630
programmer can fundamentally change the
business. Exactly. Because if you

146
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.120
make a program that is
twice as efficient means it

147
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.050
uses half the resources you
need half the size of

148
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.970
a data center. You need
half the size of an

149
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.540
elastic cloud for that application.
You need half the cost

150
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.080
roughly because you immediately save
out of that 88% and

151
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.600
some of the rest, you
also get savings on. So

152
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.750
efficiency does matter. And it's
interesting because as soon as

153
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.550
you, and of course, that's
kind of obvious on mobile

154
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.370
devices too, because twice as
efficient means runs twice as

155
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.090
long around battery. As soon
as you say the data

156
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.850
center and mobile, that's what
a pincer movement looks like.

157
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.210
And because many of those
same techniques now matter in

158
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.550
the mainstream. And we see
that here at build with

159
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.340
all of those mobile techniques,
mattering on tablets, because what

160
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.950
is a mobile device anymore
today? I really confused by

161
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.830
when people talk about a
mobile device because PCs laptops

162
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.890
have been for a long
time. And that is clearly

163
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.920
the direction that we're going
with that kind of convergence.

164
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.380
So all of these things
matter more than ever. Now.

165
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.470
Having said that if your
biggest program are costs to

166
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.680
the cost of your application
is developer time, which it

167
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.230
really was in late nineties.
And through the early two

168
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.810
thousands, a lot with enterprise
apps and in house ops

169
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.630
optimize for that, that's what
language is that optimized developer

170
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.350
timer for. And that will
continue to be true Microsoft.

171
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.130
And that my team, we
love C sharp and.net. It's

172
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.110
a great tool. That's good
at things to SQL. So

173
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:55.320
it's not good at, we
love JavaScript and HTML. We

174
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.590
are built on C plus.
Plus if you take a

175
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.020
dependency diagram of all the
teams at Microsoft and what

176
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.290
team depends on what, there's
only one team at Microsoft

177
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.610
that everybody transitively depends on.
And that's our team. It's

178
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.640
not even windows because say,
X-Box, doesn't currently run on

179
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.410
windows who knows what'll happen
in the future. I don't

180
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.960
know if those plans, so
I'm not being coy, but

181
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.260
it currently doesn't. And if
you even look at.net, a

182
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.200
lot of good stuff runs
on.net, but not everything. For

183
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.680
instance, not the core ROS,
there's only one team that

184
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.350
transitively builds everything. And that
also means we just had

185
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.380
a really, really busy release
cycle because the visual SQL

186
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.480
sales team had to support
everything windows was doing, bringing

187
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.600
up a new arm, target
arm, targeting for windows eight,

188
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.540
bringing up a winter. Our
all the winter tee stuff

189
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.640
has been built in C
plus plus and using the

190
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.640
windows runtime time library, and
now more SQL CX, now

191
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.620
that that's available. So we're
sort of at the center

192
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.080
of things, nevermind that while
the whole tablet thing was

193
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.050
happening, GPTP was also happening.
And so we did C

194
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.540
plus plus app. It was
a busy release cycle for

195
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.720
us. I want to, I
want to slow you down

196
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.530
a little bit because the
audience may not understand everything

197
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.330
that you just said. I
think you said a couple

198
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.820
of interesting things, though. You
said that you've got SQL

199
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.950
plus running on arm. So
arm is a target. So

200
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:12.170
non-Intel, Nanex 86 on X
64 targets. You also, Our

201
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.540
competitor has to enable that
for windows and apps to

202
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.430
build, to run on ours.
Exactly. But then there's also

203
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.460
kind of an oblique reference
there to running a C

204
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.530
plus plus code on a
GPU on a, on a,

205
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.050
on a graphics processing unit.
Right. Talk a little bit

206
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.020
about that. Cause that kind
of flew by. Sure. Oh,

207
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.270
that's and you know, maybe
not, everybody's familiar with that.

208
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.230
So the idea of that
you have a coprocessor, remember

209
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.760
the days we had a
three 86 and a three

210
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.920
87, right. And then you
wouldn't want the SX, right?

211
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.150
Yeah. Even you couldn't run
Excel. And then even 46

212
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.860
is a lot of the
46, four 87, but now

213
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.900
we take it for granted
that the floating point unit

214
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.970
is integrated in your processor.
Why would you ever have

215
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.160
one? Did we ever did,
was that in fact, a

216
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.900
reality ever, was that just
a bad dream that we

217
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.830
didn't always have a floating
point processor today? If you

218
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.540
look at today's hardware target
in the marketplace, virtually something

219
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.610
like half on the order
on the close order of

220
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.460
half of the installed base
from grandma's PC used to

221
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.140
corporate desktops of pieces of
hardware have not just a

222
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.820
good CPU, but also a
compute class GPU already in

223
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.100
the box. It's mostly being
used for graphics to run

224
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.660
the monitor. It turns out
that that GPU isn't as

225
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.020
general purpose as a CPU,
although it's gradually getting there,

226
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.840
but people have figured out
ways over the past 10

227
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.060
years to trick it into
doing computation for you. And

228
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.090
that's become its own boutique
industry where now the graphics

229
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.180
cards actually support that. And
there's standards like open cl

230
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.170
industry consortium standards. I mean
like open cl and a

231
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.340
Nvidia has their Kuta software.
And what we try to

232
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.080
do is bring that to
C plus plus. So SQL

233
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.430
has amp accelerated massive parallelism.
A few masks is all

234
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.840
about how I run a
parallel for loop on a

235
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.300
GPU. And we try to
make that as seamless as

236
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.490
possible. And I've got to
talk on that also available

237
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.580
on channel nine, if you,
if people can easily find

238
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.730
that C plus plus amp.
And we announced that last

239
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.850
year at the AMD fusion
conference, because fusion is an

240
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.580
example of an architecture where
the GPU compute class GPU

241
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.370
is right there on the
same Silicon on the same

242
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.360
die in the same package
as your CPU. Now think

243
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.940
about what C plus plus
is all about. It's all

244
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.060
about leaving no room for
a language lower giving you

245
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.790
full control to express everything
you need to express, give

246
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.510
you full access to the
hardware. It was unthinkable for

247
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.880
us. It went right to
the core of our being

248
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.250
that half the installed base
has hardware available that can

249
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.620
run certain parts of your
application, 10 X and more

250
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.830
faster. And you couldn't touch
that from a C plus

251
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:50.830
I was program that spoke
directly to the key value

252
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.340
proposition and the key mission
of C plus Boston. So

253
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.900
we felt we had to
do something about that as

254
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.160
well. Of course, the transition
to taking advantage of GPS

255
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.050
for computation came at the
same time as the whole

256
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.570
tablet revolution. So our industry
has been in convulsions right

257
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.670
now, and it's been a
busy couple of years, but

258
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.350
those are some of the
highlights of what we've put

259
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.470
together. And we think people's
most developers and more will

260
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.890
enjoy it. And SQL source
11 makes sequels feel very

261
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.090
modern and sleek and it's
fast and it's clean and

262
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.300
it's safe as clean and
safe as many languages and

263
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.180
just, and still always pedal
to the metal fast. That's

264
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.280
a really nice place to
be in a nice offering

265
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.980
to have that more and
more. We see industry moving

266
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.350
toward again. I hate to
put, bring this quote in,

267
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.760
but it's one of my
favorite quotes of all time,

268
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.070
which is, you know, don't
call it a comeback. I've

269
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.100
been here for years. That's
actually a good quote. I

270
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.890
haven't heard that So well,
you probably don't listen to

271
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.980
the same music I listened
to, but there have been

272
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.960
a number of people who
have said, well, you know,

273
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.510
SQL plus has been sleeping,
but really it has been

274
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.430
here for years. It isn't,
this isn't a comeback or

275
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.000
a resurgence C plus plus,
and its popularity has remained.

276
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.430
It's just not amongst kind
of the, what I call

277
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.030
the text boxes over data
crowd, right? The business developer

278
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.880
is a web developer. You
know, hasn't been doing that

279
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:11.040
work that the, the ups
surgeons have a asp.net and

280
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.520
node and PHP, and these
kind of, you know, virtualized

281
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.700
languages interpreted languages has been
happening. Where has sequels plus

282
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.530
been for the last 10
years while we have been

283
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.710
writing webpages and doing text
boxes over data, what industries

284
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.070
has it been embedded itself?
Well, I mentioned before that

285
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.530
Microsoft runs on C plus
plus we're built on C

286
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.500
plus plus that is true
of every major company is

287
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.960
true of every major industry.
So I, it would be

288
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.180
a mistake to point to,
you know, the people would

289
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.640
often point to, Oh, look,
scientific and engineering, as soon

290
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.770
as you've done that. Yes,
it's very applicable, but it's

291
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.330
a pigeonhole there's Mars Doing
that. People like taking people's

292
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.410
plus and saying only smart
PhDs can, Well, people like

293
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.940
to pigeon hole everything it's,
but it's a very horizontal

294
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.220
language. In fact, if you
think of the role C

295
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.470
has played, the world is
really built if you want,

296
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.540
I want to be crisply
correct about it on C

297
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.200
and C plus plus everything
runs on those. There is

298
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.070
nothing in the world if
software in the mainstream, anywhere

299
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.310
that does not transitively depend
on CNC plus plus because

300
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.790
C was very important as
a portable assembler. So Dennis

301
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.880
did a great job, Dennis
Richie at making that possible.

302
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.860
When people said it couldn't
be done, you couldn't write

303
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.480
at a high level. What
was then a high level

304
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.790
functional function, programming, structured programming,
and still target efficiently a

305
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.370
wide array of architectures. What
C plus plus has done

306
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.430
is taken that heritage, that
ability to be efficient on

307
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.400
a lot of different kinds
of hardware and add a

308
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.120
deficient abstraction. So really there's
very little reason and lots

309
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.120
of, of to not use
that and lots of good

310
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.420
reasons to adopt it. Talk
about classes, type generosity without

311
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.990
sacrificing that portability and efficiency,
and that ability to say

312
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.360
what you really want to
say without a language that

313
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.910
gives you some guardrails to
make simple things simple, more

314
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.920
than ever now in C
plus plus 11, that you

315
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.500
can always open the hood.
You can always go and

316
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.170
change your own oil and,
and rewire the carburetor if

317
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.680
you need to. Because that's
the place that we, that

318
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.590
we live in, where you
don't leave room for a

319
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.230
language lower, other than assembler.
And very few people actually

320
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.900
drop to assemble or ever
these days, Hey, this is

321
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.480
Scott and I am really
excited about these guys. This

322
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.880
is a special offer from
our friends at DN simple,

323
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:23.140
true story. Carl reached out
to Dan simple to ask

324
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.720
them if they wanted to
advertise with Hanselman it's because

325
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.000
we like them that much.
I was a kind of

326
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.770
a funny thing. They didn't
come to us. We went

327
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.440
to them because we think
DNSimple is great. It's a

328
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.990
hosted DNS service that you
use to manage your domain

329
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.110
names. Prices started about $3
a month for up to

330
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:42.130
10 managed domains. You can
also use DNSimple to register

331
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.910
domain names, purchase SSL certificates.
All of my domains have

332
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.440
been moved off of GoDaddy
and are now at DNS

333
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.520
simple. I like it because
there's an application on my

334
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.860
iPhone. I can manage my
DNS from there. There's an

335
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.040
API that you can use.
The best part actually is

336
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.800
these one click services. So
you can register a domain,

337
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.810
get it up and running
in a couple of minutes

338
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.840
and then go in and
apply services to it. So

339
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.300
you can say this domain
is for Google apps and

340
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.460
this domain is forget. Hub
pages in this domain is

341
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.540
preposterous and they know the
DNS records and set them

342
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.120
up for you. Even for
something as complicated as Google

343
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.820
apps, there's like 11 different
settings. You need to create,

344
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.490
they handle it all for
you. So here's the deal.

345
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.210
They've got a special 30
day trial. You can cancel

346
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.110
at any time, but Hansel
minutes listeners get three months

347
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:35.020
of free DNS service. So
you've got a DN, simple.com/h

348
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.310
M special deal for Hansel
minutes. Listeners just visit DN

349
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.840
simple.com/h M Hanselman. His listeners
get three months of free

350
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.850
DNS service love these guys.
They're so nice. DN, simple

351
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.810
hosted DNS, check them out.
Some people will point to,

352
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.340
to Google and their choice
of like kind of three

353
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.310
favorite language. But now that
is kind of breaking away.

354
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.040
People are introducing things like
go and Google. So the

355
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.020
idea that there are only
three languages you're allowed to

356
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.110
write a Google is changing,
but they'll point to Apple

357
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.900
that really loves objective C,
which is kind of the

358
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.150
C has a C plus,
plus he feel to it,

359
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.150
but it's their flavor. It's
their language. But then they'll

360
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.150
look at Microsoft and say,
well, Microsoft supports all these

361
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.150
languages and that side, you've
got John, not just C

362
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.140
sharp, but also F sharp
and now iron Python and

363
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.560
things like that. Why don't
we pick one language and

364
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.020
make that the language and
all other languages be darned?

365
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.190
Yeah. Some people have said,
well, why don't you, why

366
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.440
don't you just pick one
the same reason? Why would

367
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.340
you pick a hammer or
a screwdriver? Isn't one going

368
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.870
to do all the work?
Well, it depends what the

369
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.550
job is you're trying to
do. And by the way,

370
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.700
I'd also like a saw
and a drill. And that

371
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.280
toolbox that idea, that a
systems today, and this has

372
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.860
been true of sequences developers
for a long time. You

373
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.290
don't use just one tool.
If you use just one

374
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.140
tool that limits what you
can do. Now, having said

375
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.820
that, remember I said, portable
efficiency, portable efficiency, and flexibility

376
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.040
is where C plus plus
plays. If you want to

377
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.400
write an application, you're going
to write the UI differently

378
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.980
on each platform, obviously, because
the UI is going to

379
00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.050
be different on Android iOS
and say windows phone. But

380
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.340
if you want to write
the core guts of that

381
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.310
application and portable code, that
you can do it in

382
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.100
exactly C or C plus
plus, and it's target Android,

383
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.100
iOS and windows phone, you
have no other choices. And

384
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.350
in fact, the C doesn't
work so well. Well see,

385
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.530
now I have to see
sharp though. I just talked

386
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.210
to a guy a couple
of weeks ago that wrote

387
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.200
a game called stick man,
using mano, which is doing

388
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.640
an amazing job of allowing
on Android, on iPhone, on

389
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.350
windows, phone, on windows, all
platforms, all tablets, all platforms,

390
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.250
95% code reuse because they
have an abstraction layer called

391
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.010
mano came. This is X
and a. So they wrote

392
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.960
to the, you said the
writing the UI, they actually

393
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.790
didn't have to port the
UI. They did it all

394
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.980
in X and X. And
so similarly we have some,

395
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.860
some nice wins lately with
the unity engine or where

396
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.860
people are able to write
portable code. What I'm getting

397
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.170
at is if you're looking
at the list of competitors

398
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.920
that Apple, for instance, supports
the languages, they officially support

399
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.110
that. Thou shalt not use
anything else for iOS development.

400
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.290
They're getting a little there.
They're listening a little bit,

401
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.080
but it's been, look, see,
see fossils, objective. See, we

402
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.730
don't want to see nothing
else running on there. And

403
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.920
then you're getting a little
bit looser, but that's what

404
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.680
Apple supports. If you want
to use third party tools,

405
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.450
that's great. But when you
look at what the actual

406
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.200
OSTP vendor supports, Google has
a nice experiment and go,

407
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.340
but they support Java and
CNC, crosswalks, we and windows,

408
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:36.440
phone support C sharp.net and
CNC. Plus, plus, if you

409
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.730
take now, look at, if
you want to write a

410
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:44.270
portable application on windows eight
and Mac and Linux, again,

411
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.140
you can have some portable
frameworks, but if you to

412
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.170
use the language is directly
supported in those environments, CNC

413
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.690
puzzles, again are your go
to languages. So if you

414
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.570
care about portability and care
about efficiency and support on

415
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.760
all sorts of platforms, whether
it's the data center or

416
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.040
mobile, the desktop, wherever you
have code, you want to

417
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.040
run. Portability has always been
a big name of the

418
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.700
game. And you can have
that efficient abstraction, not have

419
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.160
to drop down to naked,
starts and pointers like C,

420
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.090
but have modern code that
is widely portable and will

421
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.070
run fast. And that's a
pretty good place to be.

422
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.990
It's not the only place
to be. If you only

423
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.180
care about one or two
platforms, you have an engine

424
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.690
that will run on those
platforms, doughnuts and use it.

425
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.020
You'd be a fool not
to, but then think about

426
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.110
what the tool offers you
and what your needs are

427
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.510
and pick the right tool
or more often the right

428
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.810
set of tools for that
job. Not just because it's

429
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.030
something that you used on
your last piece of code.

430
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.720
I want to bring this
full circle because I want

431
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.910
to talk back to the
idea of users and Watts

432
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.550
and the thought that as
a, you know, it's always

433
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.890
a good reminder as a
developer that you're not there

434
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.690
just to write cool software,
you're there to support a

435
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.510
business. And then the idea
of Facebook where they've got

436
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.710
a billion users, literally they
could tell you crazy. Yeah.

437
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.600
I think they're working on
their second billion now. Yeah.

438
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.750
So they're working on 2 billion
users and there that you

439
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.740
could probably ask somebody how
many Watts, you know, like

440
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.260
the lights in this data
center are on and it's

441
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.210
costing us this many Watts.
It brings up a really

442
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.350
interesting question that then you
take the pundits and the

443
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.890
pundits are out there saying,
please take the place. Yeah,

444
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.440
I really take my pundits,
please. These pundits are saying

445
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.800
it was a rap reference.
And then there's also a,

446
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.490
yeah, we're quite, we're getting
record our references span, collect

447
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:31.470
dates. So these, these pundits
are writing these articles and

448
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.020
they're useless. And they'll say,
well, the iPad three has

449
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:40.140
41.2 kilowatts hours and their
battery and the surface has

450
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.020
this many, but the idea
of like, well, here's a,

451
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.480
here's an arbitrary number in
time that describes how many

452
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.560
kilowatt hours that this battery
supports. But without any real

453
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.770
discussion about the language efficiency
and efficiency of it, Does

454
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.980
your mom care? How long,
how many kilowatt hours you're

455
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.350
saying She wants to know
whether it lasts six or

456
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:03.720
10 hours, 10 kilowatt hours.
If it lasts the entire

457
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.290
transatlantic flight, we did a
good job. And it depends

458
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.620
on the iOS. So windows
has got smart. The iOS

459
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.190
Android have got smart about
power sipping and efficiency, the

460
00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.160
whole stack down to the
hardware. Intel's got smart. Andy,

461
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.770
you've got smart arm has
been smart a while. And

462
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.140
now we've learned from them
and about power sipping efficiency.

463
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.450
You need those pieces in
place. But on top of

464
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.630
that, once you have those
pieces in place, your app

465
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.910
can still do crazy stuff
or it can be efficient.

466
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.380
And the, if your competitor's
app last 10 hours on

467
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.950
that flight and yours last
five hours that's matters. I

468
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.370
was on a transatlantic flight
recently and I was watching,

469
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.620
I think be like a
grandmotherly type on an and

470
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.630
you know, what she was
doing. She was double tapping

471
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.110
home and she was shutting
down the quote unquote background

472
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.390
programs. And every time I
see that, it just kills

473
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.100
me because I want to,
you know, maybe, you know,

474
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.830
you don't know me, but
can I sit down and

475
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.190
talk to you about what
the true multitasking operating system

476
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.380
versus a cooperative operating student,
we kind of solve this

477
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.560
problem, but there's this person.
And now I'm seeing people

478
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.160
here at bill trying to
shut down what they perceive

479
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.600
as background processes with their
windows store applications. And I

480
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.630
don't think that that myth
of the background process is

481
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.030
going to go away until
we really have 10 hour

482
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.860
full day battery life. I
mean, really, that's what it

483
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.310
is. And we've been trained
one way and we need

484
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.470
to retrain. I mean, when
I first got my iPad,

485
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.580
the first thing I thought
was I was going to

486
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.130
download some video or something
from the iTunes store a

487
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.040
couple of years ago. And
the first thing I did

488
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.780
was I thought, Oh, I
better plug it in and

489
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.060
keep tapping the screen to
make sure it doesn't go

490
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.110
to sleep. Duh. I figured
it out after a day.

491
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.210
Okay. That doesn't matter. It'll
just work in the background.

492
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.810
Same thing with any modern
kind of device. A funny

493
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.540
thing about the iPad, by
the way, I love my

494
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.470
iPad. I have to say
the D love because I

495
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.080
love it. It was great.
I love my iPhone. I

496
00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.010
even The politically incorrect things
in Microsoft executive meetings saying,

497
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.990
holding up my iPhone and
saying, you will take this

498
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.990
out of my cold dead
hand, which fortunately didn't get

499
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:06.460
me fired, but it was
how I felt. And I

500
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.930
always will say how I
feel. I've been running here.

501
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.790
You can see this, your
audience can't, I've been running

502
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.680
last year's hardware, a slight
seven. This is not a

503
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.960
surface. This is last year
slate, seven hardware that came

504
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.120
with windows seven. I got
from a Microsoft store, just

505
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.030
flattened it and installed when
a consumer preview. And then

506
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.210
when at RTM haven't looked
back, that was in April

507
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.980
and it became my, I
was going to do it

508
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.810
as an experiment. And within
a week it was my

509
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.850
main machine. Cause I used
all the time. And I

510
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.390
just sit at my desk
at home where it worked

511
00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.890
with three big screens and
it's docked or at a

512
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.320
keyboard and mouse, or I'm
sitting here just like I

513
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.680
was before we started talking,
doing email on it's my

514
00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.730
favorite machine. It is my
favorite notebook PC I've ever

515
00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.760
had. It's not a notebook.
It is my favorite tablet

516
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.490
I've ever had. And as
we were doing the site,

517
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.560
we're going to launch this
coming Friday. I'll talk about

518
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.930
that more in my talk
at build on Friday. Well,

519
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.520
maybe you can point people
to it because they will.

520
00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.950
This is now, Oh, we're,
we're now in the future.

521
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.890
We're in the future. You
can go to ISO cpp.org,

522
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.690
ISO cpp.org, brand new site
with lots of sponsors and

523
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.990
a new industry foundation showing
the increasing at another data

524
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.570
point, the increasing investment in
C plus plus across the

525
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.680
whole industry. It's a really
big tidal wave resurgence. And

526
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.850
I think resurgence is a
proper word, at least in

527
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.850
awareness, but also in investment.
But as I did that,

528
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:23.380
I wanted to test the
site and make sure it

529
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.690
looks great on all form
factors. From my phone to

530
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.570
my big desktop monitor. And
two, I wanted to make

531
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.130
sure the iPad worked. There's
a few of those out

532
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.530
there. So I went to
get my iPad, to try

533
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.570
it out in portrait and
landscape mode, make sure that

534
00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.820
the rotation worked and everything.
And as I reached for

535
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.710
my iPad, the first thing
I realized this was around

536
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:43.560
July. I'd had my tablet,
my Samsung for three months

537
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.630
by then, Then I had
to do was Wipe the

538
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.450
dust off my iPad because
then I realized I haven't

539
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.970
touched it since I've had
this tablet. And I never

540
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.000
noticed I never missed it,
which is, which is something

541
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.100
interesting. I think at least
that's been my experience. Okay.

542
00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.930
There is the thing though
that some listeners might say

543
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.170
that, well, you know, you've
just drank the Microsoft Koolaid.

544
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.010
Hey, I'm the guy who
said politically incorrect things about

545
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.560
my iPhone and executive editor.
I will tell what I

546
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.080
will tell you. And I
will tell anybody exactly what

547
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.210
I think this is my
favorite tablet. And one of

548
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.070
the things that I like
about this when I tablet

549
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.010
is I find myself using
it as a tablet, way

550
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.200
more than I ever used
my iPad first, because it's

551
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.880
one device. I don't have
to carry a second device

552
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.100
around all the time to
do my, to my desk.

553
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:26.900
My clamshell work at my,
yeah, I've been saying that

554
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.780
since, before it was popular
to say, I'm holding up

555
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.970
my ultra book. This is
the one I've been Pollyanna.

556
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.470
This is a three pound
<inaudible> ultra book touch screen,

557
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.060
but I can also run
a hyper V on it.

558
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.380
Yes, I've got my official
studio, but it's not really

559
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.800
the best, you know, for
running movies and stuff. So

560
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.800
I've got my iPad here
with me, but I've been

561
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.230
looking at like the, the
new Lenovo, I think it's

562
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.200
called a yoga and it's
an ultra book, but it

563
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.830
flips backwards 180 degrees. And
then turns into a tablet.

564
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.800
This one here with the,
that has the cover. You

565
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.930
just fold it like a
tent. Very similar to that,

566
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.580
except it doesn't have a
keyboard built in like the

567
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.650
surface does. So I'm definitely
getting a surface pro as

568
00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.300
soon as those are available
in a couple of months

569
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.210
Type pad, I'm going to
need a real keyboard for

570
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.550
myself. But the key thing
about it is it's my

571
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.710
favorite tablet ever use and
I'm using it more than

572
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.390
I ever used my iPad.
This is just my own

573
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.480
experience. A cause it's always
with me and B because

574
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.400
I can be docked and
using it, using all my

575
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.620
applications and a big screen,
and then just pick up

576
00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.420
where I was and sit
in the corner and read

577
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.480
and just without losing my
place and constantly be in

578
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.630
the same experience. So that
you're a producer and not

579
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.480
the consumer. When I sit
and read news, when I

580
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.940
redo my news reader, when
I do email, a lot

581
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.950
of it's reading, I take,
I just undock this and

582
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:41.570
put it in my lap
because it's more easy, it's

583
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.480
easier, but I can easily
seamlessly switch back and forth.

584
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.520
And that is a really
big deal. We're in an

585
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.830
election season here and I'm
not sure probably by the

586
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.610
time that this is aired,
we will have a new,

587
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.250
a new president. We've got
the pundits out there that

588
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:58.520
are talking about, you know,
all the different statistics and

589
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.030
things and, you know, statistics
be darned, but we're kind

590
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.340
of also in another election
season that you've alluded to

591
00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.260
a little bit. Yeah, We
were talking about this just

592
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.810
before we went on there.
And I was saying, you

593
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.400
know, it seems like it
just struck me yesterday. I

594
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.680
think we're in two election
seasons because we have the

595
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.890
one election season where you're
being wallpapered with ads and

596
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.920
analysts and reviewers, and some
of the ads are positive

597
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.710
and a lot is mudslinging,
negative ads. And everybody wants

598
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.510
to see who the winners
going to be as we

599
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.120
record this six days from
now. And so that's one

600
00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.010
kind of thing, personally. I
just, I wait for it

601
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.050
to be over cause I'm
very apolitical, but you know,

602
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.000
this is whole election season.
And I realized, you know,

603
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.190
we have another one going
on because if you look

604
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.310
at the iPad mini announcement,
the Kindle fire and the

605
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.280
new Kindle announcements, you look
at surface out, you look

606
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.610
at at what all these
different people are doing. And

607
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.170
especially Google coming out with
nexus. And a lot of

608
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.600
it, I'm glad to say
the Microsoft ones I've seen

609
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.030
are not negative ads. Cause
I, I look at Stevenson

610
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.890
offscreen and he talks about
how great the iPad is,

611
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.350
what it does, which is
exactly right. But I'm seeing

612
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.360
some of the negative ads
now on the Amazon side

613
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.910
about the iPad mini and
the sniping back and forth.

614
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.520
And I think we're, I
think it's, you know, it's

615
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.980
like, Hey man, we're in
an election season. This holiday,

616
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.780
according to at least as
far as these four companies

617
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.000
are concerned because everyone wants
to see how the popular

618
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.160
vote for tablets is going
to go to seven inch

619
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.620
tablets, bigger tablets, what's the
vote going to be for

620
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.350
operating systems. So it's kind
of an election season in

621
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.260
that way, mirroring this other
one that we've got, it's

622
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.600
going to be fun to
see what consumers pick. And

623
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.880
I think this, all of
this is good because it's

624
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.790
not one winner or another
it's choice and people can

625
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.940
use what's right. For them
that applies to tablets and

626
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.020
portable devices just like it
applies to programming. Right? Exactly.

627
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.270
And I always use my
wife as the example, and

628
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.390
everyone uses the kind of
nontechnical spouse. I I've used

629
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:49.050
the term wife, wife, acceptance
factor. Describe any particular piece

630
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.810
of technology. Like my harmony
remote control is like the

631
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.720
greatest remote control. My logic
tech harmony remote control has

632
00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.200
finally solved that, that first
world problem, which was the,

633
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.260
I had six remote controls.
Now I have one. I

634
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.060
was thinking of using one
of those afterwards. You're gonna

635
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.320
have to tell me how
it works. It is a

636
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.870
joy because I hate my
three remote control. My wife

637
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.380
hates me Go to my
blog, harmony, remote control, review

638
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.490
it, you program it on
the web, just dragging buttons

639
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.110
around and you put you
say, Oh, I have a

640
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.150
TiVo and I want to
click. So there's literally a

641
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:22.710
touchscreen and I say, watch
TV. And it goes, and

642
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.590
it automates everything. It needs
to happen. So hi wife

643
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.840
there. Now I've said before,
and I've had a number

644
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.260
of people say, well, that's,
it's not, it's not gender

645
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.130
neutral. What about the husband?
Acceptance factor, hack factor or

646
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:38.670
the nontechnical spouse. So it
has been suggested to me

647
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.420
that I say nontechnical spouse
upset, except it's factor. But

648
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.230
somehow doesn't quite roll off
the spouse acceptance factor. Yeah.

649
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.920
So we use Family acceptance
factor. Cause your kids matter

650
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.720
too. Right? That's the set
of all people who aren't

651
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.230
me and I really am
interested in seeing like, what

652
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.860
do they want? Like, what
does grandma, Your posse you

653
00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.750
give technical support to. Yeah,
well I'm technical support for

654
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.870
the entire entire family. I
run the domain. I run

655
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.390
the email when email's down,
I'm going to hear about

656
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.370
it. And I told my
wife, I was going to

657
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:13.440
install windows eight on the
kitchen PC. And she said,

658
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.230
no way. She said no
way, I'm going to wait

659
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.690
for the next version. She
says, I don't know what

660
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.580
it's going to do. And
I don't, I just want

661
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.420
it works now. So there's
an interesting, kind of interesting

662
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.960
statement there, which is the,
it works now. But then

663
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.960
she starting to see these
ads on the TV and

664
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.550
she's like, well, wait, hang
on a second. I kind

665
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.280
of like the calendar app.
Can you just give me

666
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.340
that one app Election season
we're being papered with ads.

667
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.410
So it's funny. My wife
Is the last person who's

668
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:45.770
going to let me put
a beta of anything then

669
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.360
I've totally it's out. It
really is out good. Well,

670
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.280
you know, I like it.
You know, I've got it.

671
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.690
I mean, I'm not trying
to sell her on the

672
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.720
thing. All I know is
I want to calendar on

673
00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.180
the kitchen PC and that,
you know, recipes and the

674
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.420
stuff that she she wants
to deal with. So I'm

675
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.430
slowly kind of feeding it
to her, showing her my

676
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.530
tablets and then saying, well,
I can put this on

677
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.380
the machine. Cause it's actually,
the shame is it's a

678
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:13.820
touchscreen kitchen PC. It's one
of the old original HP

679
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.570
touch smarts with two, two
points. But that's enough because

680
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:22.370
basically the kitchen PC has
recipes, calendaring, email, occasional browsing,

681
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.540
and then maps. She used
touch on it. Now, you

682
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.210
know, she only uses touch
to pinch, to zoom when

683
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.540
she's looking at the maps,
but intuitively for her touch,

684
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.060
isn't the thing. But then
again, you know, I don't

685
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.730
know where the mouse keyboard
generation it's going to take

686
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:42.190
awhile, but the kids, they
use it for solitary. My

687
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.560
four year old he's learning
solitaire. And he, a amount

688
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.890
of mouse makes no sense.
A mouse is a useless

689
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.130
appendage. It's like, why would
I poke at things with

690
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.250
a stick? If I can
tell Exactly that's exactly what's

691
00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.220
happening. So I think that
I may be one of

692
00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.920
these kind of get off
my lawn, old men at

693
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.990
some point where, you know,
I want my mouth, my

694
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.960
hotkeys for me, it's hotkeys
for my kids. It's touch.

695
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.630
It's going to be interesting
to see how they accomplish

696
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.520
tasks in the future. And
it depends what you're doing

697
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.240
because touch can't do everything
that a mouse can do

698
00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.430
or track pad. You want
accurate pointing. You want a

699
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:17.770
stylist or track patent out.
So that's perfectly fine. You

700
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.630
want to write with ink,
you want a stylist. You

701
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.810
don't want to be using
one of those, those pens

702
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.090
that really are like a
crayon cause they simulate a

703
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.930
finger, but it's what you're
trying to achieve. And in

704
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:31.810
the usage experiences that are
nicely touch enabled, man. It's

705
00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:33.760
so great to use that.
In fact, one of the

706
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.350
big things I see coming
out of this wave of

707
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:39.940
products, I don't know how
Companies, I don't mean anyone,

708
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.270
but the entire year Ecosystem
of companies that make laptops

709
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.880
and desktops, how they're going
to cope with the coming

710
00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.490
change and user expectations of
being able to touch anything.

711
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.130
Because I've heard more stories
in the last month about

712
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.160
people who have touched a
surface who have touched a

713
00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.770
windows eight device, including their
notes Books. Yeah. I've been

714
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.500
pulling at my non touch
enabled notebook for awhile And

715
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.900
then leave fingerprints on their
Chromebook or something like that.

716
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.650
People are really seeing how
great it is because after

717
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.510
all I love that star
power. Even in windows seven,

718
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.150
I had a touch enabled
notebook before this. Yeah. There's

719
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.500
my start bar. I always
pin my frequent absolute star

720
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.140
part. And I just got
used to just clicking them.

721
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.750
And yes, you can say
mechanically, it doesn't make sense

722
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.550
to hold your arm out
like this all day, but

723
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.140
you don't, you just reach
and touch. You do this

724
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.200
all day long. We're designed
for it. And once you

725
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.760
do that, you say, well,
why should I have to

726
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.800
reach for something else? Take
my eyes away. Or my

727
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.990
finger to reach for a
mouse. It look, there it

728
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:35.440
is. I just want that.
And Funny story that I'll

729
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.820
end on is that my
year old, they, they watch

730
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.790
Netflix on the Xbox. So
the four year old deals

731
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.910
X-Box pause and then he
runs, but there was a

732
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.530
movie I couldn't get on
the Xbox. And I was

733
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.730
instead I hooked it up
to the iPad and I

734
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.040
hooked up the HTMI cable
rights with the HD mic

735
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.600
plugged into the thing. And
then I've also been doing

736
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.510
airplay, throwing the video up
there. So the four year

737
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.960
olds like Xbox, I got
a P X box X

738
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.150
box. What is your problem?
I have to pay to

739
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.760
be sitting here screaming at
the television because he doesn't

740
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.650
understand why it's going to
pause. And it's like, where's

741
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:09.840
the remote? Where's the remote.
He sounds like a little

742
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.330
old man. He's like, where's
that remote? It's interesting because

743
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:15.000
we are now seeing, especially
with this wave of devices

744
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.100
and it's not just Microsoft,
but right now Microsoft is

745
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.450
kind of alone and the
others are going to have

746
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.280
to catch up. It's I
think this is good for

747
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.840
everybody. We're seeing the second
wave of the new, new

748
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.290
user interface, the new ease
and especially the new wave

749
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.830
of mobile devices, because the
first generation was all about

750
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.140
having a mobile device, that
power sips and having icons

751
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.350
and apps. This is now
very much a second wave

752
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.960
that we're leading the industry
and it'll be cool to

753
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.120
see what all kinds of
companies come out with products.

754
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.670
I'm looking forward to consuming
them all. Yeah, absolutely. I

755
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.440
want to wave my hands
in front of my monitor

756
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.150
and move things from side
to side. I just want

757
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.740
to be Tom cruise. I
do want to be Tom

758
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.740
cruise. Thanks so much for
chatting with me today. This

759
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.380
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and see you

760
00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:00.350
again. Next <inaudible>.
