In this episode of Hansel
minutiae, Scott talks with Richard Campbell

10
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.990
about all things automateable <inaudible>.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

11
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.510
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. In fact, another

12
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.840
episode of Hansel minutia with
our very own Richard Campbell. How

13
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.570
are you, sir? I'm well,
how are you? I'm lovely.

14
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.800
Thank you for hanging out.
Always demand the 11th one

15
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.350
or 12th one. It's crazy.
Something like people demand the

16
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.780
minutia. It, the joke of
course is it's just the

17
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.360
conversation we would have anyway.
Right? This is, this is

18
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.000
just basically us hanging out
in a hotel lobby. Yep.

19
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.300
Except we record it. Yeah.
That's all. I mean, this

20
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.910
is the part maybe a
little bit of organization. That's

21
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.370
all. Yeah, exactly. There's a
little bit of structure, but

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.060
I have heard both the
incredibly positive about these shows

23
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.760
and also the, these are
the shows that I avoid.

24
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.210
Right? So the, the feedback
is never in the middle.

25
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.270
No, it's never. It's always
like, Oh man. Richard click.

26
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.910
Yeah. But it's like the
two of us together or

27
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.040
a polarizing agent. Cause independently,
apparently we're not where some

28
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.050
kind of weird chemical reaction.
I don't know what that

29
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.420
means. Some kind of an
alkaline acid thing going on.

30
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.970
So I, whenever I you're
like, you know, this is

31
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.220
funny, cause we're not too
much of the different, different

32
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.540
ages. I was just going
to say at you like

33
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.520
a father figure to me,
that's weird. You're like two

34
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.710
years older. Yeah. So I
don't know if that counts,

35
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.100
but whenever I do something
very gadgety or very automated

36
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.040
or any kind of home
automation, I always like, want

37
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.700
your approval. You know what
I mean? And I'm like,

38
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.030
you know, like I hooked
up the nest thermostat and

39
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.350
like, Oh, and I wrote
it up on the blog.

40
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.880
Oh my God. Richard would
be very proud of me.

41
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.640
Yeah. Because you're the only
person I know who, when

42
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.480
you call your house, the
phone system actually says, press

43
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.780
one for Richard. I got
rid of the one, two,

44
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.490
three. You have to say
the name now. And I

45
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.980
don't give you the names
in advance. That's the end

46
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.110
of telephone solicitors. If you
do not know who you're

47
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.930
calling my house and you
can't say their name by,

48
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.050
by really. So now it
says, say the name of

49
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.640
the person you want to
see. Exactly. Who would you

50
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.880
like to speak to? Oh,
that's awesome. So no one

51
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.250
bad calls you anymore. Oh
yeah. I didn't know. There

52
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.380
was telephone solicitors till I
got a regular, you know,

53
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.070
some other house with telephone
phone line. Cause the automated

54
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.650
Systems that just barf at
us, they don't know what

55
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.250
to do. That's it? Because
you know, frankly, I didn't

56
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.560
like the press. One thing.
Yeah, no, it was a

57
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.740
little impersonal. You just say
the name. Yeah. Yeah. That's

58
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.420
amazing. I actually hooked up
another thing recently. I finally

59
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.060
got my backup game after
10 years of trying to

60
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.210
get my backup game straight.
Yeah. I think I'm pretty

61
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.400
much got a system that
works now. I've got the

62
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.310
NAS, the Synology a NAS
network attached storage box and

63
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.560
I've got it hooked up
with crash plan. If you,

64
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.210
do you ever use crash
plan? I've not heard of

65
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.210
crash plan. What do you
use for your cloud storage?

66
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.660
I'm pushing, I, I've got
a couple of different segments

67
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.400
of data because I have
a bunch of different roles

68
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.860
that I'm working in, but
I'm mostly just pushing this

69
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.370
stuff like a sky drive
and box and so forth.

70
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.490
And I've got, you know,
tools that, that push up

71
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.640
to that. So personal stuff
like photos and things as

72
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.640
being pushed over to Dropbox
and a work related ones

73
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.180
are pushed on to work
related services. It's a mix.

74
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.010
My, I I'm, I honest
to goodness Scott getting back

75
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.140
from the road trip and
I just opened up the

76
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.750
rack and I'm looking at
it and I'm going, how

77
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.610
much longer am I going
to put up with this?

78
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.550
I'm just about at the
end of the road and

79
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.100
just go, it's all cloud
all the time. You know,

80
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.930
I, I use the line
and I'm still running my

81
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.100
own exchange server cause I
like to be afraid. But

82
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.140
I think I've just about
had enough. It is No

83
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.090
reason for you to run
your own exchange server. That's

84
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.260
just, And we finally got
all of the plop properties,

85
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.180
Don at rocks and so
forth are all in Azure

86
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.070
now. So I think it
is true if we're up

87
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.010
there, goodness knows I should
be up there. Yeah. It's

88
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.230
funny. I've, I've had a
bunch of computer crashes and

89
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.340
stuff lately and installing windows
and getting back up and

90
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.930
going just isn't as hard
anymore. No, really basically I'd

91
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.970
saw windows installed. SkyDrive installed
Dropbox and saw Google drive

92
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.160
and then I'm pretty much
back going. Yeah. Bap, bap,

93
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.770
bap, bap. So which of
the Synology devices do you

94
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.470
have? Cause there's a bunch.
Yeah, there's a bunch. And

95
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.720
the thing was Synology is
that there is an, there

96
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.050
are armed devices and there
are Intel devices and the

97
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.070
arm devices are cheap and
backs stuff up. The Intel

98
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.910
devices are effectively the home
server that Trevor was, it

99
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.270
used to be home servers.
You're serious. You got to

100
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.390
get the Intel. So I
have the Synology 15, 11

101
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.400
plus, and it is a
little black box with five

102
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.620
bays and you know, I've
been very, very happy with

103
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.910
it. So I've got four,
two terabyte drives in the

104
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.620
Synology. So that's eight terabytes.
And then using their raid

105
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.490
thing, it gives me about
five terabytes, 5.2. And it

106
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.470
looks like the 1511 has
been upgraded now to the

107
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.870
15, 12 plus. Right. Right.
And I think that I've

108
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.970
got three gigs in mind,
so I've upgraded the Ram

109
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.240
myself, but I believe that
the processor in the 15,

110
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.530
12 is better now. Right.
So when I first this,

111
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.120
I figured that it was
just a, you know, a

112
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.550
nice, solid NAZ and it'd
be fine. And you know,

113
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.980
I'm not a Linux guy,
but I can, you know,

114
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.350
I can run top. That's
basically all I need to

115
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.080
be able to do. And
I kind of forgot about

116
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.380
it. And my Synology has
run in my house happily,

117
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.060
just basically being backslash backslash
server for a number of

118
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.090
years. Then I said, you
know, I don't have a

119
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.500
good cloud backup strategy for
the family. I have Dropbox

120
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.980
and I have, I have
paid for Dropbox and I

121
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.680
also have done a lot
of referral codes with Dropbox.

122
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.990
So I have 135 gigs
available in Dropbox, but only

123
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.210
about 60 used. So just
not a lot, basically every

124
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.600
presentation I've ever given, all
my presentations folders and stuff

125
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.380
like that. So if I'm,
you know, I find myself

126
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.630
in a foreign country with
a laptop and a decent

127
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.600
connection, I can basically talk
to you about anything because

128
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.170
all my PowerPoints are there.
Right. But the family photos,

129
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.270
and I've actually got a
blog post about this, I'll

130
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.520
put in the show notes
that have gotten bigger and

131
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.240
bigger and bigger each year
are, you know, probably 110

132
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.440
hundred and 20 gigabytes. Yeah.
And they're only there. That's

133
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.160
the one piece I fear
for the most. Exactly. Because

134
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.970
I don't want them anywhere
else. This psychic weight was

135
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.050
pressing on me and I've
tried mosey and I find,

136
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.120
you know, it's, I know
it's, you're not supposed to

137
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.900
judge a book by its
cover, but mozy.com Moz why

138
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.970
their, their website is just
like frozen in time, like

139
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.790
an amp, like a bug
in Amber. And it makes

140
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.820
me feel like no one
cares about their product and

141
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.720
they're not interested in their
product being successful. So I've

142
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.840
just stopped using Mozy and
stop caring. So I looked

143
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.240
around and there's Backblaze and
his crash plan and there's

144
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.930
S3, yada yada yada I
picked crash plan. Crash plan

145
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.330
is really clever. So it's
cloud backup, which is fine,

146
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.670
but it's also distributed friend
backup. So if you and

147
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.370
I are good friends and
we don't want to pay

148
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.190
for crash plan in the
sky, or we don't trust

149
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.260
them, right. I can back
up your stuff and you

150
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.930
can back up my stuff.
Interesting. So it's peer to

151
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.410
peer, but it's also got
this strange client server thing.

152
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.350
You, you run the client
and the server on the

153
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.770
same machine. So it doesn't
feel like client server, but

154
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.800
the trick with running it
on a NAZ is you

155
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.790
install the server on the
NAS and it's headless totally

156
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.360
headless. There's no UI. Then
you install the client on

157
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.680
any machine you have available,
go into the config files

158
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.050
and then point it over
to that server. So then

159
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.780
you're looking at the settings
on that remote. So I'm

160
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.430
sitting here in my windows
machine, I'm looking at the

161
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.760
crash plan app. And then
when I hit add files,

162
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.580
I am looking at the
file system on that remote

163
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.990
machine. All right. Makes sense.
Yeah, totally headless. And I

164
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.090
wrote it all up on
how to do this. There's

165
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.750
a guy who made a
package and this got me

166
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:04.230
into the, the Synology packaging
community. There are packages for

167
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.560
everything. You know, like if
you want an app that

168
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.950
will go off and find
album artwork for your iTunes

169
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.030
music and make sure it's
in your Synology, they've got

170
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.170
those packages. And so far
I've backed up 180 gigs

171
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.210
to crash plan. Been absolutely
thrilled with them. It took

172
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.750
about two weeks, but now
it's just doing its thing.

173
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.150
And I, it's just nice
to just look at that

174
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.820
and see, well, look at
the photos are backed up.

175
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.140
So now I add that
with my, my iPhone. You

176
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.450
know what the, I find
that the little wifi SD

177
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.020
card. Yup. Oh, it's a
glorious, amazing thing. My wife

178
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.880
would take photographs and then
they would never get put

179
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.270
anywhere right now. She just
comes home and turns the

180
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:54.210
camera on it automatically uploads
into backslash backslash servers slash

181
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.010
photos slash 2012 shows up
automatically on her pictures. Cause

182
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.830
I've added that to the
library and windows. So from

183
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.960
her perspective, she sits down
and turns the camera on

184
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.200
photos start flying in. Right.
It's automatically showing up on

185
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.410
the server, which by the
way, I've redirected her, my

186
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:15.180
documents folder too. She doesn't
know that that's the best

187
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.450
part. Right. You know, and
that's all backed up to

188
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.300
the, to the crash plan.
So I've got kind of

189
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.910
working directory is Dropbox, longterm
trust, trusted storage is crash

190
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.820
plan. And then I have
it offsite backup where I

191
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.700
basically rotate to a physical
spinning rust discs back and

192
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.530
forth between the bank and,
and in the house backup

193
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.790
and backup. I'm one of
these people that always dumps

194
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.630
my camera, but Oh yeah.
I know people literally with

195
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.760
several years of photos on
their cameras. Oh, okay. That's

196
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.810
just, it's terrifying. You're asking
for trouble. Well, and I

197
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.630
don't know about you, but
I fry an SD or

198
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.230
a CF, I don't know,
twice a year. It's mostly

199
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.980
from flying. Right? Most of
the time I CA you

200
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.490
know, I also kill a
phone a year, but when

201
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.160
you're flying in the quarter
million mile a year range,

202
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.570
you come off airplanes routinely.
We stuffed not working anymore.

203
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.180
Right? Oh yeah. The STS
just gone. And I just

204
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.730
kind imagine it, you got
three years with a photos

205
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.930
on a CF in your,
your, your subcu, your SLR,

206
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.470
and you get off an
airplane and it's gone. It's

207
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.630
funny that you mentioned that
because I I've got like

208
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.510
a S a use a
user's full folder. So there's

209
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.160
user Scott and users Mo
and I noticed so much

210
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.940
that relatives were doing this.
My sister-in-law like every photo

211
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.800
she's ever had has been
on the same card on

212
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.980
the same camera. Right. She
bought it. So I just

213
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.290
got in the habit of
making folders for anyone who

214
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.030
visited the house, any relative
who visits the house, I'm

215
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.700
just like, Hey, can I
just take your computer for

216
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.250
a second back it up?
Yep. And I back it

217
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.470
up for him. And then,
you know, I have to

218
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.540
do it with their permission.
Of course. Yeah. But I

219
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.820
just feel better. Like, I
don't know whether they feel

220
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.730
better, but, you know, I
just feel better knowing that

221
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.320
when, when the computer inevitably
does Yes. And they phone

222
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.690
you, which is also notable.
Okay. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

223
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.090
I have a backup from
2008. It's better than nothing.

224
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.550
It's not ideal, but I
got your stuff. I got

225
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.520
something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now
I have a, I put

226
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.660
together a streaming peer-to-peer backup
with my mother who continues

227
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.440
to write novels and he's
exactly that. And one day

228
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.440
her machine just punted and
I was, I don't know,

229
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:38.880
two hours behind. So, you
know, that just assembling something

230
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.340
like that for the folks
who just really don't think

231
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.620
about it, never are going
to think about it. Yeah.

232
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.820
Ooh. Speaking of, of being
just a few hours behind,

233
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.170
so I recently discovered a
new feature of windows eight.

234
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.500
Are you on windows eight?
Okay. You know, about storage

235
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.790
spaces. Yeah. Oh dude, you
should have told me I

236
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.610
it's on my list for
Christmas. What I do for

237
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.580
Christmas is build new hardware
and I'm building out a

238
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.180
new dedicated storage spacious machine.
Yeah. Well, I just had

239
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.490
these two, three terabyte, external
USB, three M C Gates.

240
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.850
They were on sale and
I bought a cheap, but

241
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.660
reliable USB three, a hub.
And I'm all about USB

242
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.680
three notes, glorious, glorious thing,
and then a hooked up

243
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.760
the storage space. It's, it's
basically what they gave you

244
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.850
in windows home server. Right.
Right. It's a sparse rate.

245
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.300
Yep. And also about a
natural growing one too. It's

246
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.150
not all that tightly fitted,
you know, the fact that

247
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.250
you can, you take an
existing reiterate rate and say,

248
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.410
I want to make this
bigger. That is not easy

249
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.160
to do in traditional raid,
but exactly this model, the

250
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.680
storage base models, just like,
yeah, sure. Why not add

251
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.200
some more? Okay. And I,
I, so I, yeah, I

252
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.810
hooked up a, what do
I have? I have a

253
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.490
five terabyte, two way mirror,
but I think I have

254
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.040
10 terabytes is the size
of it. Right. So, so

255
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.190
it is, is bigger than
I have storage for That's

256
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:12.570
that work. I love those
physics Thinly provisioned. They call

257
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.120
it basically. It's like, I
know that one day you

258
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.300
wish that you were 10
terabytes. Yeah. So I'll just

259
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.490
pretend that you are until
you are. I'll let you

260
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.350
know when you need some
more to make it closer

261
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.620
to true. My, I have
a true 10 terabyte array

262
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.620
and it is almost full.
It's a 700 gigs to

263
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.320
go. And so that's why
this Christmas I'm provisioning the

264
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.510
new machine and going to,
well now Western digitals make

265
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.500
it for tear drives. So,
you know, I buy a,

266
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.090
buy a six pack of
those and let's go. Yeah,

267
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.870
exactly. Okay. I have found
that the UI has some

268
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.090
limitations of storage spaces so
that if you are a

269
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.570
power user, you will find
yourself using PowerShell occasionally. Yep.

270
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.690
I found that I wanted
to a drive and upgrade

271
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.960
to another drive and it
turns out that it does

272
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.860
not automatically rebalance. No, but
there are PowerShell commands you

273
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.840
can use to read that.
Yeah. And it is, it

274
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.390
is clearly a V one
product, like the SP one

275
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.560
of server 2012 expect good
things. Cause it's just stuff

276
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.590
that didn't make the cut,
Check this out. I took

277
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.110
support storage space. Right. And
that's my F drive. So

278
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.650
I have basically, you know,
these two big drives and

279
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.410
they're mirrored and they're on
USB three. And I did

280
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.050
two things with them that
I'm rather proud of. First

281
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.650
I hooked up GM volt,
which is a Gmail backup.

282
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.550
Yep. So I am backing
up my Gmail now reliably,

283
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.060
locally to locally. And they're
just.email files. So you can

284
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.950
double click on them and
open them. They're just love

285
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.750
that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and
it gets back to this

286
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.210
whole, Hey, Gmails got my
mail. And if I ever

287
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.020
get away for any reason,
I'm hooped. So I like

288
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.540
to own a copy of
my stuff. Well, I have

289
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.930
300,000 emails for the last
many, many, many years there.

290
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.440
Then I hooked up file
history and file history as

291
00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.220
the is like time machine
for windows eight. But one

292
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.050
of the things that I
didn't realize about file history

293
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.280
until recently, and actually surprisingly,
if you're on storage spaces

294
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.650
and windows eight, you just
hit hit window w type

295
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.780
in storage, go to storage
spaces in the lower left

296
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.410
hand corner. It says, see,
also file history. This is

297
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.750
basically taking a snapshot of
all of this stuff that

298
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.530
I'm doing every hour. But
if you go to advanced

299
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.600
settings, you can say, recommend
this drive. You know about

300
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.340
this, come on, tell me
there's something that I, Oh

301
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:32.530
finally, What is that? Nah,
something drive. This is nutty.

302
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.320
You go and say advanced
settings. And this is where

303
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.050
you say, save copies every
hour, take up this much

304
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.770
space, keep versions forever. If
the PC is part of

305
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.940
a home group, just recommend
the drive. So now when

306
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.370
I go into file history
for the first time on

307
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.730
any machine in the house,
right, it says, Oh, Use

308
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.420
this one. Well, my big
machine in the office is

309
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.720
recommending the home, the file
history to all the other

310
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.630
machines. So now when I
go into file history, I

311
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.880
can see Scott and mow
and all the machines in

312
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.850
the house. And when I
brought in a new windows,

313
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.330
eight touchscreen laptop yesterday, I
just added it to the

314
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.470
home group, which is just
instant. I didn't even need

315
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.230
a password for some reason.
And then I said, Oh,

316
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.840
file history, click boom. And
they all go to the

317
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.400
same central location. So you
know what, you know what

318
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.080
it strikes me, you realize
many years ago, like literally

319
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:32.140
a 1998, I set up
in T four domains in

320
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.810
the house anticipating that I
was going to need to

321
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.630
use group policy, to manage
my kids, access to the

322
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.240
machines and so forth. And
I've maintained that ever since.

323
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.280
And we are finally in
a place where I feel

324
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.560
like I could tear all
that out. I don't need

325
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.550
to run a domain in
my house anymore. Yeah. Home

326
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:54.030
groups definitely useful. They're smart
enough. My parents recently moved

327
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.670
and hooked up into a
rental for a little while

328
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.120
and I wanted to make
it so, you know, dad

329
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.000
could print a mom's printer.
Right. So the obvious thing

330
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.710
is go to the printer
and hit sharing and then

331
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.420
share it and then figure
out the name of mom's

332
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.180
machine, yada, yada, yada. But
I wanted to see what

333
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.120
it was like in the
home group world. Yeah. So

334
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.710
I went to home group,
I said, make a home

335
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.460
group, joined it. And then
without even asking the printer

336
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.010
showed up on dad's machine,
like it became his default

337
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.260
printer because that was the
obvious, first thing to do.

338
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.570
Right. And I thought, I
said, okay, here we go.

339
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.920
Now I've now we've achieved
something. Yeah. You don't need

340
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.230
to go out and specifically
buy a network printer and

341
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.560
deal with all of that
either. It's just every device

342
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.910
on every machine is effectively
a shareable device. Exactly, exactly.

343
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.810
And I'm kind of surprised
that while the, the local

344
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.450
storage with the file file
history and storage spaces is

345
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.180
great. The one thing that
I have been very happy

346
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.840
with and been very reliant
on is this the Synology

347
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.860
this, this Linux NAS, because
like I say, it all

348
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.810
I want is a NAZ
that is headless that I

349
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.540
don't have to think about.
That has a great ecosystem

350
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.630
behind it. And that's what
windows home server was. Yeah.

351
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.900
And you know, it still
exists, but the removal of

352
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.870
their raid solution just yeah.
The storage thing was the

353
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.080
big thing. Yeah. And you
realize they did that. Cause

354
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.870
storage spaces was coming and
they just, you know, really,

355
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.260
I don't think they've gotten
back to reorganizing what home

356
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.270
server should be. But the
meantime, I think the market's

357
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.400
been picked up by folks.
Who've just like, Hey, let's

358
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.280
focus on the main thing
here, which is something you

359
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.920
can run at your home.
It just works. Yeah. The,

360
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.740
the UI for the Synology
is really interesting. It's all

361
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.980
web based and it's all
HTML, but you, you would

362
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.860
swear you're running an operating
system. Like it has window

363
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.030
management and you know, I
just go HTTP whack server.

364
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.030
I log in, I'm actually
doing it right now. And

365
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.570
I have windows and I
have Explorer type things. And

366
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.330
I have package managers. It's
all in the browser. It's

367
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.680
just nuts. It is like
you have V and seed

368
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.460
in, but it's all done
in, in HTML. Interesting. And

369
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.410
when I go to the
package center here, I'm clicking

370
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.690
a package center and I
can say, what are some

371
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:07.790
available packages? You've got music
server, an iTunes server. And

372
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.850
I downloaded a thing called
Plex. A familiar with Plex.

373
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.930
Yeah. Yes. And I'm not
using internally, but I have

374
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:19.010
friends who are huge fans.
Like, that's the thing I

375
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.320
got to meet these people
because I am blown away

376
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.160
by, by Plex. It is
a, a, you know, it's

377
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.800
a D it's, what's it
called? D and LA. No,

378
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.820
it's a, it's a UPNP
media server. It's universal plug

379
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.040
and play dynamic, blah, blah,
blah, blah. I don't know

380
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.670
what DNA stands for Out
to your phones out to

381
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.340
all your device. It's just
amazing how it's just, it's

382
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.800
getting closer to what we
actually wanted. Right? Exactly. In

383
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.930
a nutshell, I put a,
I put a file in

384
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:49.120
a folder and suddenly it,
if it's a movie, it'll

385
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.180
get album art, you know,
we'll get movie art, it'll

386
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.150
become available, but it's the
transcoding. And this is why

387
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.820
I said earlier, you need
to have an Intel machine.

388
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.150
I can sit in bed
with my iPad, run the

389
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.180
Plex application and it will
say, Oh, you're on wifi.

390
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:09.520
You're on an iPad. I
will trans code dynamically, change

391
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.670
the compression and re and
ratio of this file so

392
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.830
that you can watch this
effectively on your phone or

393
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.920
on your iPad When it's
one of those things where

394
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.550
you never think about that
until it doesn't work. Oh

395
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.800
yeah. Right. The fact that
you have all these shows

396
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.100
in all these formats and
your devices, don't all speak

397
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.370
to that. Right. Exactly. So,
but so you're saying the

398
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.970
transcode is happening on the
Synology device. Exactly. So it's

399
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.100
got the, or it needs
some horsepower. It has the

400
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.720
horsepower, right? Exactly. That's why
you got to get the

401
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.450
into one, but they've also
got mano running on the

402
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.920
Synology. People can run, you
know, get or subversion on

403
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.280
it. A number of people,
because the Synology really likes

404
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.370
to be exposed to the
outside world. You can run

405
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.700
asterix, which would be like
a VoIP server Phone system.

406
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.980
It's one of the ones
I seriously considered before. Yeah.

407
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.210
Yeah. And what also, you
know, cloud servers, PHP, BB,

408
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.000
you know, Drupal, things like
that. So one could not

409
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.860
only just have a, have
it be a business server,

410
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.930
but it could run their
website if they want it

411
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.020
to. But the best part
was what I just discovered

412
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.870
that it comes a Synology
comes with a full featured

413
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:17.040
surveillance station. Hmm. And this,
this is actually a separate

414
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.610
product name, this solar surveillance
station, but any of the

415
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:21.990
devices seem to be able
to run it, although it

416
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.600
seems like it's licensed differently.
Right? Yeah. So that is

417
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.610
the, that is the one
thing that sucks that you

418
00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.430
have to basically pay for
a license to run a

419
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.130
camera. And it's like the
cameras that you see at

420
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.200
like a seven 11 or
plaid pantry, one of these

421
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.690
little 24 hour shops where
you get like a split

422
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:42.840
screen, but it works with
any IP-based camera. So I

423
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.750
went and bought a bunch
of FAUS cam F O

424
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:50.310
S C a M cameras.
They're all these wireless $60

425
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.580
wifi cameras. And you know,
I've got a couple in

426
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.490
the house and a couple
outside, they're known for their

427
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.460
IRR support. So you've got
like this bright, you know,

428
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.210
infrared led array, right. So
you could see the whole

429
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.110
backyard and pitch black, but
what's nice is that the

430
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:11.280
sun, the sand has the
power to, to run this

431
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.880
24 hours a day and
it will do motion detection.

432
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.590
So right now I'm looking
at it, it's using about

433
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.160
three to 4% of the
CPU. I know it's 7%,

434
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.790
5%. And it is recording
from all four of these

435
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.630
cameras. And then I can
go and TiVo them. So

436
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.660
if, for example, there is
motion detection in the front

437
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.940
I can find out, Oh,
these kids are trying to

438
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.540
egg my car or whatever.
For me, it's primarily bears

439
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.570
in the backyard. Yeah. It's
funny how we have know

440
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.480
the whole kind of Canadian
U S thing. I'm worried

441
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.370
about kids destroying my vehicle.
You are worried about bears.

442
00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.050
Yeah. Well, there, it turns
out bears fairly destructive. And

443
00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.510
I have great videos of
a pair of raccoons stealing.

444
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.090
I think somebody put a
pumpkin pie on the back

445
00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.240
deck to cool. So I
have the video clip of

446
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.990
the raccoons coming up, very
cautiously looking around and then

447
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.940
hearing a noise and running
away and then sneaky back

448
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.100
up again, and then grabbing
the pie and take it

449
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.380
off with it. That is,
that is a uniquely Canadian

450
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.570
thing pie on the back
on the back porch to

451
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.970
cool. Like, I don't think
that's happened in the U

452
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.430
S for 50 years. Yeah.
Well we, we, we still

453
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:23.740
cool stuff. Guys are living
the dream up there. It's

454
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.800
it? It, well, you should
come up, but you know,

455
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.440
my camera system, which is
hardwired into the house, I

456
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.780
did not use IP cams,
but when we were building

457
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.040
the house, we had a
chance to put the wiring

458
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.260
in for, it has a
dedicated piece of hardware that

459
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.720
does all those things. So,
I mean, I appreciate, I

460
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.960
put that together a few
years ago, but now it's

461
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.630
just an integrated. What I
love is you're buying good

462
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.510
cameras from a good camera
maker and you're using great

463
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:51.970
software from a completely different
supplier for these capabilities. That's

464
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.210
a fairly profound thing. That's
the pan tilt, zoom stuff

465
00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.840
work. Yeah. That's actually great
that you mentioned that. So

466
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.180
what's the other thing that
the Synology has is a

467
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.400
lot of little, little apps.
So I can look at

468
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.760
this from basically it it's
a, it's a clearing house.

469
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.190
Right? Right. So like, I've
got, I've got a FOSS

470
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.130
cam brand camera, but I've
also got a Panasonic and

471
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.470
a couple of other cameras
I've had lying around. They

472
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.800
all have different interfaces. Some
are MPEG four, some summer

473
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.760
M JPEG. They all do
pan tilt, zoom differently. I

474
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.280
think that what they're charging
you for is the, the

475
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.950
effort that it takes, took
them to come up with

476
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.980
a centralized API for all
of this. So it makes

477
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.540
them all look like they
are equal. Yeah. They built

478
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.380
an ODBC for IP cams.
Yes. Well said very well

479
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.250
said. So that's allowing me
to do pan tilt, zoom

480
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.760
with the exact same UI.
I just click and, and

481
00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.730
start moving around and then
you can make patrol structures.

482
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.840
So I could go and
say, I want the, you

483
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.330
know, the one in the
front to move itself around

484
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.200
and patrol the area at
3:00 AM, which is super cool.

485
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.940
And I've yeah, I've the
have had the motion, says

486
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.520
the experience with the coyotes
credit cross the yard chasing

487
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.820
after some poor critter. And
you know, it's mostly wildlife

488
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.730
tracking Ellen and seeing when
the mailman arrives and what

489
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.050
the dog's barking at and
The mailman arriving actually is

490
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.390
a, these are all first
world problems. Of course. Yeah.

491
00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:23.830
But a super, super useful,
yeah. Especially, you know, if

492
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.020
you're arguing about like, well,
yeah, I've dropped it off.

493
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.760
I've actually had the guy
drop it off at the

494
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.950
neighbor's and square that it
was at my house. Yes.

495
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.990
No. And I've had the
ups guy, you know, I've

496
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.260
had the ups email saying,
could not deliver today and

497
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.720
I've just run back the
camera and said, never came

498
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.610
to my house Today. Yeah.
Right. It's like, Yeah, he

499
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.200
got, he got tired. So
he just marked it as

500
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.260
it could not deliver and,
and went home. Let's go

501
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.960
to the tape. Yeah. Let's
just run that back. Well,

502
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.090
actually I had an argument,
there was an argument with

503
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.170
a neighbor involving, you know,
left, left a car in

504
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.000
front of my house for
four hours. And I'm like,

505
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.250
he turns out I have
a camera right there that

506
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.530
could see in front of
your house. Let's just see

507
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.970
how long that was actually.
Really. And you feel kind

508
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.760
of jerky by a no,
you know, Or used to

509
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.550
my geekiness. It wasn't my
car. It was somebody else.

510
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.790
It was just, you know,
trying to descale cut down

511
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.860
the hyperbole on an, on
an isolation. They were, you

512
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.470
were like, it's been in
the house for four hours

513
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.490
and like, no sentence. It's
20 minutes. Yeah. Let's just

514
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.720
try to run it back.
It was less than an

515
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.320
hour. I see about that.
Not that big a deal,

516
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.940
but it's all, you know,
there's also this, when you

517
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.040
get this, you know, it's,
you know, it's me, it's

518
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.740
easy. It's like, well, I
have actual empirical data. Shall

519
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.690
we go look at it?
Oh, wait, let's just resolve

520
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.080
this. I can do that.
Yeah. Yeah. It is funny.

521
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.110
It'll be interesting to see
how much of a difference

522
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.050
it makes just to have
cameras up. Yep. Whether they're

523
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:46.910
on or not. I guess
that's why people sell fake

524
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.090
cameras. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and
I've also done stuff like,

525
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.530
did I take the garbage
out? I can't remember. Well,

526
00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.300
this camera inside the garage
and I can look, Oh,

527
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.760
the cans are all up.
That's good. Yes. You know

528
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:04.430
that just one less reason
to go upstairs. Yeah, exactly.

529
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.610
I told you about the,
the twine that I hooked

530
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.860
up on the garage. Yeah.
And what a great gizmo

531
00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.460
that is. Yeah. Too expensive,
but super fun. Yeah. It

532
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.310
actually just texted me just
a few minutes ago that

533
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.830
the, the garage is open.
My wife knew that we

534
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.860
were recording. Right. And did
not close the garage thoughtfully.

535
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.750
Oh. Cause she wanted to
make the sound. Right. And

536
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.100
so now I need to
go and close that actually.

537
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.830
What did it take to
detect that your garage was

538
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.250
open with twine? So it
turns out that it knows

539
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.550
about orientation. So all you
need to do is say,

540
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.610
if it's on its back
for more than five minutes,

541
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.270
then it's Cause it's mounted
on the, the, the door

542
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:47.120
itself. So when the door
is up, Is gaffer taped

543
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.420
right now. So the door
is up. Yeah. And that's

544
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.890
all it is. I mean,
it could be whatever I

545
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:53.630
wanted to use it. I
could use it for a

546
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.390
number of things. I have
a roller door would work

547
00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:00.170
for me that way anyway.
Oh, you're saying that the

548
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:03.590
whole, The door rolls up.
You can't swing back because

549
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.450
there's a lift in the
garage. It goes up. There's

550
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.310
no room for the door
to go back. Oh, that's

551
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.840
a tough one. Yeah. Just
have to do it a

552
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.210
different way. I do it
by having a camera in

553
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.680
the back of the room.
And if I look and

554
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.410
it could see into the,
into the driveway, I know

555
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.320
the doors open. Yeah. That
makes sense. That makes sense.

556
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.830
Okay. Yeah. I think when
the twine is like $20

557
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.740
or 15 bucks and you
can buy a six pack

558
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.750
of them. Well, we were
getting back to this whole

559
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.900
internet of things, mindset that
we just want to be

560
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.810
able to instrument everything. Well,
yeah, there was a time

561
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.970
there when everyone said that
there would be an internet

562
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.320
of things and there, there
wasn't a, we were running

563
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.040
out of IP addresses and
then now, you know, internal

564
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.810
IP addresses are easy and
IPV six has happened. I

565
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.070
don't think we were worried
about running out of, No,

566
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.840
I think we have all
the ingredients. It's just, like

567
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.170
I said, it's stuff like
twine actually getting the price

568
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.260
into the right place to
do that. Anything that isn't

569
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.370
already got an IP address
can have an address added

570
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.860
to it, which is essentially
what we're doing. Exactly. And

571
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.200
then instrumenting the device. I
do think we're at an

572
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.250
interesting place where between Ardwino
and the twine and all

573
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.700
these different kinds of devices,
general purpose devices are now

574
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.900
getting cheaper than the custom
built hardware in most appliances.

575
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:22.290
Like for the price of
an Arduino, you've got so

576
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.960
much horsepower there. You could
run a dishwasher off of

577
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.880
that. And I think the
Arduino chips that it's actually

578
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.360
cheaper than the custom built
gear that the dishwasher manufacturer

579
00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.880
has to deal with to
try and program it. Yeah.

580
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.770
That's funny that you mentioned
that. I wonder why so

581
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:39.600
many of these companies insist
on making custom hardware when

582
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.750
they really just could throw
something like a raspberry PI

583
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.850
or something like that in
there. Exactly. Yeah. And I

584
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.100
think we're getting there like
that. I think it feel

585
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.980
like it's imminent that that
trends we've made enough of

586
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.630
these things. Now we've got
the price to a point

587
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:55.410
and there's so many more
features that you're talking about

588
00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:00.350
every appliance being hackable and
every appliance being instrumentable and

589
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.190
that's how it should be.
Yeah. And now when that's,

590
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:04.410
now we start getting into,
if we're going to really

591
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.320
talk about that again, that
internet of things, the being

592
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.960
able to do power monitoring
down to the individual device,

593
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.410
being able to remotely control
everything, you know, it basically

594
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.140
having this truly smart house
by house is not that

595
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.350
smart. It's reasonably bright. It's
brighter than most, but it's

596
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:24.060
nowhere near where it could
be. Yeah. Yeah. I just

597
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.730
like, I liked that feeling
of being empowered to do

598
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.540
this kind of stuff. I
realize it's totally wacky and

599
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.510
fun that we're doing this,
but you know, and again,

600
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.400
you know, I keep using
the term first world problems

601
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.320
in the sense of, you
know, it is not on

602
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.630
the high, on my list
of things. Do I need

603
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:44.310
to set up an alert
that a, that the garage

604
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.870
door is open, but it's
just so fun that I

605
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.200
can Well, and it's also,
for me, the big gauge

606
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.770
is will the wife use
it? Is it reliable enough?

607
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.200
Is it important enough? Will
she complain when it doesn't

608
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.860
work? Yes. The spouse acceptance
factor. Absolutely. And yet not

609
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.620
just to tolerate it being
present, but that she actually

610
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.650
uses it. Like the camera
system. She uses that she's,

611
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:10.260
she's aware of that. The,
the, the media PC now

612
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.400
accepted. If it isn't working,
I hear complaints that Xbox

613
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:19.230
still know. Right. I got
the, the connect working with

614
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.440
Netflix and showed her how
to use it. She watched

615
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.170
a couple of shows. Never
been back to it. Yeah,

616
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.810
yeah. Right. You know that
one hasn't stuck yet, but

617
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.150
that's my, you know, effective
gauge for me is, you

618
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:33.240
know, has this stuff really
matured enough that someone who

619
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.310
doesn't like its geekiness does
sees still as useful and

620
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.380
cares what it doesn't, you
know? That's my message. Yeah.

621
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:46.390
I think that I'm working
on the, getting the Plex

622
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:50.530
thing in my wife's mind.
Like, like if I can

623
00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.140
put something on Plex, give
her the iPad, she can

624
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.690
go upstairs and then just
find it with two clicks.

625
00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.150
Yeah. She will start using
it. She's not quite there

626
00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:00.010
yet. Cause it's not intuitive
to have to run an

627
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.100
app at all. Yeah. I
think I may have to

628
00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.350
go to the Plex plastic
cause she, who must be

629
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.220
obeyed has an iPad also
originally for curling because it

630
00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.620
was a great curling app
on it, but she's always

631
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.260
complained about wanting to, there's
only, we pretty much narrowed

632
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.480
ourselves down to one big
TV in the house, down

633
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.610
in the rec room. And
there's one in the kitchen.

634
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.320
She doesn't want to just
watch shows there, but you

635
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.450
can certainly watch them in
bed on the iPad. Yeah,

636
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.790
exactly. Yeah. I think so.
We need to get to

637
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.450
Cool. Well, thanks for chatting
with me today, Richard. Right?

638
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.430
It sounds like it was
the home automation show. It

639
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.710
is the home automation show.
It's always fun to talk

640
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.560
about this stuff. You bet.
Very cool. Well, this has

641
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.620
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

642
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.010
next week.
