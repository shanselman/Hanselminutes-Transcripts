From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
a weekly discussion with web

2
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.040
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing your

3
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.200
show number 563. In this
episode, Scott talks with Kimberly Hansen

4
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.860
about her startup signal FM
and the current state of

5
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.670
speech to text. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

6
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.000
another episode of Hansel minutes
today. I'm talking with Kimberly Hansen,

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.940
a computer scientist, and a
co founder of signal FM.

8
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
How's it going? Hey, very
good yourself. I am thrilled

9
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.880
to be talking to you
because I am interested in

10
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.480
all things, automated speech recognition
and speech to text, and

11
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.930
you've got to start up.
That does just that Do,

12
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.880
and we've been practicing on
you. We've got a few

13
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.750
hundred transcripts now. It's very
lovely. Am I hard to

14
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.990
turn from speech into text?
Well, we actually cheated a

15
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.750
little bit. We did a
few automated ones and then

16
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.240
we, we went and ripped
back through your archives. Thanks

17
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.410
to Carl at plop. Thanks
Carl. But no, you're, you're

18
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.280
good in, in general. Good
sound production equals good automated

19
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.590
transcripts, right? So Yeah, there
was a time that I

20
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.310
would pay transcriptionist to make,
you know, like a, like

21
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.770
a court reporter to make
them, and it's like a

22
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.660
buck a minute, you know,
like, I mean, I respect

23
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.640
the job and what they're
doing, but when you've got

24
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.720
300 hours of, of stuff
it's going to add up

25
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.840
and I'm afraid that while
I really want our non-English

26
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.290
non native English speakers and
our hard of hearing listeners

27
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.990
to have transcripts, I've had
to do them just onesy

28
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.070
twosy at this point. Yeah.
It's basically in feasible for,

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.440
even at your level, when
you start getting to, you

30
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.020
know, a thousand listeners, 2000
listeners, you just can't do

31
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.570
it. Right. And then I
just think about this automated

32
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.880
speech to stick stuff that's
coming in. Is that, yeah,

33
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.760
it's totally feasible for pretty
much anyone to have a

34
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.060
hundred percent transcription. Now, when
you start to tuck over

35
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.340
the quality, that's a bit
of a different story. Of

36
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.350
course, Is this different from
like my first foray into

37
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.810
speech to text, I think,
and everyone's would be dragon

38
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.960
naturally speaking 10, 15 years
ago. And it always felt

39
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.740
like it was like an
awkward 80%. Yes. Yeah. And

40
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.870
I had the same experience
and I actually went back

41
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.470
and did some research in
preparation for this Ray Kurtzweil

42
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.380
started in speech to text.
Yeah. Yeah. That's where he,

43
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.350
that's his whole passion initial
passion. Yeah. And I, I

44
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.780
mean, I kind of learned
that I, you know, I

45
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.420
look over the last 30
years here and I'm like,

46
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.060
wow, I can see why
someone in speech to text

47
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.050
would be a futurist. I
get that mindset. But yeah,

48
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.320
the dragon stuff, you know,
if you go listen for

49
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.750
a bit and try some
stuff and you get disappointed

50
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.250
and go back to writing,
and then Siri kind of

51
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.000
hits in 2011, Siri, please,
you know, direct me to

52
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.270
a corner store or whatever.
And that doesn't really work

53
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.760
either. So what we're seeing
right now, this IBM kind

54
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.030
of gotten into the game
early with Watson and that

55
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.890
hit in a big way.
And then, you know, Google,

56
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.770
obviously it's got its stuff
and Microsoft is really starting

57
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.650
to get into the swing
of things. This stuff has

58
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.340
really only started hit the
cloud in the last couple

59
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.450
of years. And we're starting
to see an arms race

60
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.510
come up. Right. Amazon's getting
in there, there's some open

61
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.770
stores sources. So when you
say hitting the cloud, you

62
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.220
mean that the processing work
that is happening when you

63
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.530
turn the speech into text,
happens in the cloud, not

64
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.430
on the local machine. Right.
And actually the language models

65
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.760
are humongous. We're talking about
gigabytes and gigabytes of information

66
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.640
and it's just not feasible
to have it locally for

67
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.810
the most part. Now, of
course, you know, hardware changes.

68
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.240
So that could change in
the next couple of years,

69
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.970
but for right now you
gotta, you gotta process up

70
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.610
in the cloud for sure.
Okay. So when I talk

71
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.390
to Siri or to Alexa,
that Alexa is sending everything

72
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.060
I said into the cloud,
the little box on my

73
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.740
desk, isn't doing the work
Actually. You know what I

74
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.740
don't know for sure. I
believe Siri does have some

75
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.310
local stuff. Don't quote me
on this guy. Someone's gonna

76
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.120
yell me. I know for
sure. That Watson, for instance,

77
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.820
yeah. That's, that's going back
up to the servers, Right.

78
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.100
And I know that Alexa
listens for the word Alexa

79
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.410
or the word echo, and
then it just sends the

80
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.050
file up. And whenever it's
blue, it's talking to the

81
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.140
clown, which is interesting because
there's the power of the

82
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.030
cloud, but there's also the
idea that you can upgrade

83
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.660
the cloud and not upgrade
the device. So, you know,

84
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.470
today's Alexa device is going
to work like amazingly well

85
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.650
in five years, if they
keep that model going. Yeah.

86
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.070
Right. And there's two interesting
things about that. So one

87
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.180
stuff has progressing at a
phenomenal rate. I've been working

88
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.710
really closely with this stuff
since March, April of last

89
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.940
year. And just since then,
I've seen a humongous increase

90
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.760
in quality. Like we've seen
stuff go from like a

91
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.470
85 kind of percent ish
to, to getting up into

92
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.770
like 92 93 in 95,
you know, kind of a

93
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.430
hundred. So this stuff is
moving very quickly. If you're,

94
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.010
if you're talking about assumptions,
you made six months ago,

95
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.300
they're they're out of date.
If the others, that's a

96
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.730
big statement though. It's, it's,
it's one of these things

97
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.780
where it's now at the
point where we've got this

98
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.390
sort of like pretty complex
process. And if you spot

99
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.520
a problem, you can sort
of start to tackle it.

100
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.600
And yeah, it's, I mean,
I, if you, if you

101
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.660
look at what the work
that IBM Watson for instance

102
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.730
is doing, that's the one
with which I'm most familiar.

103
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:05.030
They just introduced speaker diarization
three months ago, memorization. And

104
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.050
what that is is speaker
one, speaker two, Kim's talking,

105
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.960
Scott's talking, if you talk
about a conversation without labeling

106
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.680
speakers, it's just a hot
mess of garbage. It's completely

107
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.570
unreadable. You can't do anything
with it as a human

108
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.560
being. Once you've, once you've
broken that up by speaker

109
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.870
one, speaker two, then suddenly
it becomes this sort of

110
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.740
much more approachable thing. Now
that's just since September, right?

111
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.710
That's the kind of progress
we've made. And we went

112
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.870
from wall of text to,
okay, this looks kind of

113
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.780
like a transcript now. It's
not good. If we were

114
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.350
to peel this back right
now, you'd be like, ah,

115
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.880
that's not me. That's not
cam, but that's that's happening

116
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.420
right now. The other thing
that's happening right now is

117
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.570
that we're now actually able
to feed stuff back into

118
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:59.300
the cloud against specific corpuses.
So for instance, we're taking

119
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.570
all those lovely corrected transcripts
that we have for you.

120
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.700
And we can take those,
put them back into the

121
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.700
cloud and say like, look,
Hanselman's going to use these

122
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.450
words. He sounds like this.
And so stuff's going to

123
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.650
get better for you specifically,
once we pointed at that

124
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.300
Corpus again, not something that
most, anyone outside of the

125
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.880
big hitters would have been
capable of three months ago.

126
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.660
So for people who aren't
maybe not be familiar with

127
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.290
that word, Corpus is typically
a collection of, of written

128
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.560
texts. Like it's the, it's
the main body of some

129
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.800
structure. So the Corpus of
Hanselminutes is the sum total

130
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.380
of my work. And it
sounds like you can modify

131
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.570
your algorithm. Like you said,
you can train it and

132
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.460
then run it again and
it gets better and better.

133
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.120
Yeah, that's right. Yep. And
it's mostly against keywords. Now.

134
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.420
This is actually, we've actually
just been experimenting with this

135
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.080
in the last week or
so. And I was, I,

136
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.290
I had my hopes pretty
high. I think I was

137
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.300
hoping that it would, it
would start to pick up,

138
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.200
okay, well, Scott Hanselman, we'll,
we'll pause in this, in

139
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.500
this way, for instance. Or
we'll, you know, like he

140
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.560
uses ellipses rather than periods.
So, but it, yeah, it's,

141
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.420
it's just looking for, for
keywords right now. I see.

142
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.100
Okay. So you can tell
it, I'm going to say

143
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:23.380
XML or.net, right. Or, or
web web MD, what's it

144
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.650
called? Web or web RTC.
You can fill in all

145
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.180
of those little words, like,
like if I were a

146
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.930
doctor and we were talking
about medical stuff. Yeah, exactly.

147
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.190
Yeah. And I mean, that's,
that's good. It that's, you

148
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.650
know, very, very useful. But
when, when it comes to

149
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.950
speech to text, we're now
at the point where the

150
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.210
words themselves are pretty much
okay. Like I say, you

151
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.300
know, I need to use
93, 95%. It looks pretty

152
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.790
good. You're as long as
you're not getting into really

153
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.450
esoteric stuff, for the most
part, it's, you know, it's

154
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.210
pretty spot on the place
where we need to do

155
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.110
work now is that, is
that punctuation is that speaker

156
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:13.080
identification is the stuff that
turns it from, from just

157
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.920
a line of words, to
something that looks like written

158
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:23.310
text, because you can, you
can speech to text the,

159
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.080
the, the thing that I
just said, I went and

160
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.370
I spent half a second
doing that, that you wouldn't

161
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.920
be upset not to see
that in a transcript. But

162
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.790
when you start to read
it and try to get

163
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.430
the flow of the words,
it's a very different story.

164
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:47.000
It's a very different feeling.
Right. Interesting. I used Siri

165
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.450
extensively, like a ton. And
the number one thing I

166
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.030
tell people when they're not
happy with Siri is to

167
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.390
speak the punctuation, which of
course isn't reasonable for us

168
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.570
in a podcast, but it's
actually changed my brain a

169
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.060
little bit so that I
could be talking to you

170
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.820
right now, comma. And then
I would just continue period.

171
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.190
And then I would start
a new sentence, comma, and

172
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.080
even say things like semi-colon
and then say, what do

173
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.540
you think? Question Mark. So
I can, you know, if

174
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.460
I was going to say
something, I would say, Hey,

175
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.910
Siri, text my wife. How's
it going? Question Mark. Yep,

176
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.550
yep. And ed And it
reads it and it knows

177
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.680
exactly what I said and
it's perfect. And I've always

178
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.990
felt that was a strength
of Siri, but it's also

179
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.810
a complete user interface fail.
Did I just hear Siri

180
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.730
in the background? You did.
I just said it to

181
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.820
Siri jumped up. Perfect. Yeah.
And it totally does change

182
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.450
the way that you communicate.
I enunciate more, I changed

183
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:44.210
my tone. More little known
fact women actually have a

184
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.940
much smaller, natural range, a
natural natural range between peak

185
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.540
highs and lows and their
voices, which is yes. Yeah.

186
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.470
So we're at a, we're
at a distinct disadvantage with

187
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.380
this stuff. Siri has a
hard time with that disadvantage,

188
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.880
disadvantage, but that's which leads
to women actually varying their

189
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.360
tone artificially more Interesting. So
enunciation of course, you know,

190
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.630
enunciation, I did a lot
of high school theater. So

191
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.170
speaking like a news in
a very clear voice, making

192
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.130
it on ambiguous, like I'm
annunciating right now is that

193
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.040
is different from varying your
tone. It's different. Right. So

194
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.240
if you, Kim will try
to talk like this and

195
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.280
to bring her listeners in
like this, I'm doing that

196
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.740
artificially it's. I mean, I've
been doing it since I

197
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.190
could talk. Right. So it's
natural for me, but, but

198
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.490
it's actually not the way
that I would normally communicate

199
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.620
that our way to normally
communicate is quite a bit

200
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.060
flatter. So yeah. I mean,
and this gets into psychology

201
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.680
and all sorts of crazy
stuff in like yeah. But

202
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.260
from a computer Science perspective,
you're saying that that makes

203
00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.700
the transcripts, that the speech
to text work better. The,

204
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.240
the variation in tone. Yeah.
Actually. Sorry. No, it doesn't.

205
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.390
It makes it easier to
listen to, but it actually

206
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:13.200
has no effect on the
speech today. I see. But

207
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.650
enunciation does. Yeah, for sure.
Yeah. Like I was explaining

208
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:22.170
to some relatives, the difference
between English and American and

209
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.980
one of the examples I
gave was, you know, you

210
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.170
can learn all kinds of
English, but then also someone

211
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.770
will say, no, what I'm
saying? And they're like, no,

212
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.160
I'm saying no, no I'm
saying like, no, no. What

213
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.920
I am saying. Yeah. Like,
yeah, like, no I'm saying,

214
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.800
you know, I was in
Alabama and I asked for

215
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.980
some coffee and she says,
you scream. I'm like, did

216
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.340
I scream? No, no. She's
asking if you use cream.

217
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.580
Right. So, you know, Noam
saying is, do you know

218
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.950
what I am saying? That's
going to put that in

219
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.190
the Corpus now. Yeah, Yeah.
Yeah. Well, and it's exactly

220
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.890
that kind of stuff. Right.
And you get into dialectical

221
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.850
language and these things start
to have a problem, but

222
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.050
you train them up and
everything's fine. What about accents?

223
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.750
I am in the North
Pacific Northwest. And when I

224
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.800
speak like this, this is
my newsreader, my Peter Jennings voice.

225
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.020
And you know, people say
that this is what they

226
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.160
wouldn't say it is ex
scentless. They've said it before,

227
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.290
but it is more of
an unaffected speech. Well, now

228
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.750
that's interesting. So I went
and visited a friend in

229
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:32.820
Australia he's he was originally
from England and he insisted

230
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.890
that he could speak with
no accent. And so he

231
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.840
reproduced received pronunciation for me
to which I replied, no,

232
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:45.300
that's an accent. That's an
English accent, but yeah, accents

233
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.770
again, it's all a matter
of where you originate from.

234
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.170
You get into some of
the more esoteric stuff. You're

235
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.770
going to have a problem.
Interestingly, what I've actually found.

236
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.350
And this is totally anecdotal.
Someone can, you know, don't

237
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.130
yell at me, but it
seems like these things are

238
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.830
actually really good at Boston
accents. And I put that

239
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.820
down to MIT, Nice MIT
out of Boston. So they've

240
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.310
trained themselves to listen themselves.
So if you're from Southie,

241
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.340
it probably understands you. Exactly.
Yeah. Martin Shane, if you're

242
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.000
out there, this thing is
perfect for you. Interesting. You

243
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.460
need to go and do
all the West wing Corpus

244
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.930
now, You know what? Oh,
more on that later. Yeah.

245
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.850
Some of those, I'm just
saying some of those speeches

246
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.460
are pretty Epic, that big,
long walls of text, to

247
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.680
be interesting, to get a
hundred percent on that. I

248
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.280
am sure that Rishi would
think the stars because the

249
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.410
amount of cutting that Forman
must have to do for

250
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.540
the WestWingWeekly, I'd just, I
don't know. I'd like to

251
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.390
take just a quick moment

to Ottawa for supporting this

267
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:46.220
podcast. Now I've got a,
I just got switched from

268
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.860
at and T to Verizon.
And I did not know

269
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.670
when I got this phone,
it's an iPhone that they

270
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:57.140
were going to text me
my voicemails as text. So

271
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.720
when I, when I, I
got a phone call from

272
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.910
my brother and then suddenly
I get this weird text

273
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.110
and it basically has, you
know, someone called into work

274
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.710
dot, dot, dot, dot.in the
day later because.dot, dot, dot,

275
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:13.130
dot, it's crazy out there.
Why are they doing that

276
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.000
to me? What are they
trying to say? Well, I

277
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.040
mean, it, it is easier
to check and see them.

278
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.280
And at a glance, you
can tell whether that content

279
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.980
is interesting to you. And
that's actually historically been the

280
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.370
problem with audio someone, Hey,
I just listened to this

281
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.770
amazing Hansel minutes show. You
got to listen to it.

282
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.990
I'm going to send you
this half hour of audio

283
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.970
and I'm going to hit
you over the face with

284
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.800
it. And it's just not
an appetizing proposition. I mean,

285
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.150
you know, no offense as,
as a non-friendly, you don't

286
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.360
know it's in there. It's
a big, dumb MP3. You're

287
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.330
not gonna, it's hard to
access. Once you turn that

288
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.090
thing into text, suddenly you
can, you can kind of

289
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.820
look at the top and
okay, this, Oh, wow. They're

290
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.890
talking about this speech to
text thing. I like that

291
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.900
great click, those text messages
that you're getting may not

292
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.080
be perfect, but when they're
going to improve and two,

293
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.870
they do make it so
that you can screen, you

294
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.630
know, your neighbor that you're
not so fond over whatever

295
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.790
That.dot.is that saying. They had
no idea. And it's just

296
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.990
not transcribed Probably, or, I
mean, so with any of

297
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.370
this stuff, you'll, you'll get
a confidence score normally. And

298
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.300
so we're very confident that
Scott said, cow here, we're

299
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.820
not so confident that you
said door over here. And

300
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.250
so there probably a slopping
off the bottom and calling

301
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.350
it good. And again, it's,
it's enough that you can

302
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:41.740
kind of tell the general
flavor of this. Right. It's

303
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.460
interesting, actually. So, so we
talk about Alexa, we talk

304
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.680
about speech to text and,
and what you're starting to

305
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:53.130
see is these sort of
two broad areas of, of

306
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.270
this work. What, you know,
one is, Hey, we need

307
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.000
you to speak commands into
a thing. Then we're going

308
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.260
to go off and do
stuff, which obviously punctuation, not

309
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.530
very important. You're just looking
for keywords. Right? Right. And

310
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.680
the other is, yeah. The
speech detect stuff that the,

311
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.310
the command stuff, obviously like
if you were at CES

312
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.530
this year, toothbrushes had microphones
on them. This is just

313
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:24.090
everywhere. And that stuff has
developed pretty far, but that,

314
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.680
you know, the speech detects
community and is a little

315
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.440
self conscious still, it knows
that it's not, it's not

316
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.560
perfect. And so it's, yeah,
they hide it. They hide

317
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.950
behind the ellipsis and that'll
last, you know, for, for

318
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.000
a little while here, Doesn't
that imply that we're going

319
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.390
to be stuck at 95%
recognition forever. It's like, we're

320
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.670
going to, it's going to
be asymptotically approaching a hundred

321
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:52.850
percent Sort of, but probably
not for a few reasons.

322
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.340
One just the natural language
model stuff is increasing edit

323
00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.470
at a tremendous rate. And
there's still tons of just

324
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:07.940
really low hanging fruit here
too. It's not necessarily all

325
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:13.220
about the machines. So one
thing is that let's take

326
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.610
podcasts as an example, right?
You've got a there approximately

327
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:22.670
75,000 active podcasts today and,
you know, hundreds of thousands,

328
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:29.210
millions of minutes of audio
out, podcasters skew, young, rich

329
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.850
educated, and extremely loyal. So
if you know what I

330
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.700
mean, you know, you you've,
your audience is listening to

331
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.710
this and they've got you
in their ear once a

332
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.700
week. Yeah. Apparently my young,
rich, extremely attractive audience that

333
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:49.070
you just listed all the
characters, But you know, you

334
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.920
give them the opportunity to
say, okay, look, I want

335
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.500
to, I want to, for
instance, tweet this thing out.

336
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.950
And Scott just said, how,
Hey, but period, you know,

337
00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.970
there's a little punctuation, the
place, Hey, I'll go ahead

338
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.770
and correct that up a
little bit so that I

339
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.230
can tweet it and I
can share your thoughts stuff.

340
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.560
Right. Well, look at that.
Now we've got this nice

341
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.620
corrected transcript. Hey, we can
feed that back up to

342
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.560
the machines and build up
our Corpus. No problem. Right.

343
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.150
So we're looking at a
power function here, right? The

344
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.810
second, the stuff gets to
the point where it's kind

345
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.930
of mostly good enough. Like
it works. It's, it's, it's

346
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.960
something that your phone doesn't
mind showing you. For instance,

347
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:36.200
then suddenly we, we can
make available more and more

348
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.500
and more and more training
data. And that just, you

349
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.690
know, the, the AI is
we'll take that and run

350
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.490
with it. And now you're
cooking with fire sort of

351
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:49.240
thing. Right? Interesting. So that
mean that like right now

352
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.610
we will hire a transcriptionist
to make a PDF and

353
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.130
I'll get an email that
a sentence is wrong or

354
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.930
that something, or, you know,
even as misspelling on my

355
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.140
blog, right. You know, tight
typos and speechos, there's a,

356
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.200
there's a small change. Are
you saying you could potentially

357
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.440
open up the interface, like
not quite Wikipedia style where

358
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.840
they could write mean things
about you, but they could

359
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.170
change a percentage of the,
like an anonymous user could

360
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.830
change the percentage of the
text. And then you, a

361
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.410
number of those people do
it, you vote on it,

362
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.430
you pick the right one.
And then that's now training

363
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.210
data. And I, I think
that's a way a place

364
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.860
where you could go, like,
my, my background is in

365
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.210
games. I made video games
for a long time. And

366
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.560
you know, people, people like
to do this stuff, never

367
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.130
played the game catamari to
mushy. Yeah. The spinning ball,

368
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.650
it picks up stuff and
keeps going. The F the

369
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.110
first one was, was fantastic.
I play it once a

370
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.980
week. At least it's, it's
basically a vacuum cleaner, you

371
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.090
know, assimilation, like you're going
around your living room essentially.

372
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.520
And you're picking up all
the bits and, you know,

373
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.620
once you're finished is all
clean and it feels good.

374
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:57.960
Right. You can keep people
like doing this stuff it's

375
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.080
and especially if there's a
lot in it for them,

376
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.720
for instance, Hey, get to
tweet out this thing. It

377
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.200
gets shared on Facebook. No
problem. You know, just, just

378
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.490
put that system in place
and sort of see what

379
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.950
happens. Kind of. I see
you're saying, well, people like

380
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.600
to tidy up people like
to straighten crooked pictures, enabling

381
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.820
them to do that. Maybe
even while they're listening to

382
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.970
my show makes it better
for everyone. And you could

383
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.210
gamify that and they could
become, you know, official Hanselman

384
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:31.140
it's transcribers. Yeah. Well, and
you know, hopefully we can,

385
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.420
we can give them that
opportunity someday That gets there,

386
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.260
that let's get into more
to your, to your product,

387
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.830
because I've had transcriptions where
it's like, here's a PDF

388
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.210
on my other podcast, this
developer's life. We crowdsourced the

389
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.120
transcription. So we put it
up on get hub and

390
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.550
we asked everyone to use
markdown and they all did.

391
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.280
Oh, you just, you made
a friend for life just

392
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.380
now, man. I'm going to
talk to yourself about this.

393
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.840
Yeah, Yeah, yeah. You can
have the, all that it's

394
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.810
all on GitHub. It's all
ready for you. But signal

395
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.740
FM has animated transcriptions and
I just can't stop staring

396
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.270
at it. Maybe you could
share with us what that

397
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.840
looks like. Oh, that's so
interesting. Yeah. So if you,

398
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.120
you have your PDF sort
of over to the side

399
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.330
and Hey, I want to,
I want to look something

400
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.520
up. When, when did Scott
say this thing they were

401
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.660
talking about, you know, whatever
it was, and it's kind

402
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.420
of over there outside of
your environment, by the time

403
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.070
you get back to the
audio, you're kind of out

404
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:30.510
of, out of the loop.
Like, it just doesn't really

405
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.260
work that well, right at
once you, once you animate

406
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.290
this stuff, once you, once
the words that are coming

407
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.560
out of my mouth are
displaying on screen while I

408
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.120
am saying them right. Suddenly,
Hey, what were they talking

409
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.780
30 seconds ago? Oh, look,
there it is. It's right

410
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.530
in sync. Right. I actually,
I had this interesting experience

411
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:57.080
the other day where the
transcript had actually broken halfway

412
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.510
through. And so I was
sitting there and like you

413
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:03.650
were saying, I was following
along and suddenly there's audio,

414
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.190
but no words. And it
was like they were leaving

415
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:11.180
the room. It was, it
was this horrible, lonely, bereft

416
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.420
feeling like these people that,
that I had been, you

417
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:19.580
know, talking with were now
gone. There's this, there's this

418
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:26.000
physicality to having, having this
sort of like running transcript

419
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.840
going. And that's just one
small piece, but there's so

420
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.290
much there. There's so much
interesting stuff to sort of

421
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.350
dig in to. And that's,
that's kind of where we're

422
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.070
headed. Have you seen, you
know, how it went on,

423
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.360
whether there's shows where they'll
do Trent subtitles, right? Like

424
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:48.790
how to speak Spanish to
put in the subtitle. It's

425
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.850
a different feeling. If they
do the subtitle up near

426
00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.730
the person's mouth, or if
they are like this, person's

427
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.620
sending a text message. And
then they'll put a little

428
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.270
thing at the bottom that
says, you know, the name,

429
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.000
whatever the text messages, that's
a different feeling than if

430
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.750
they kinetically put an animated
text message attached to the

431
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.520
person's phone. So basically I'm
saying that I'm hearing you

432
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.940
describe that the kineticness the
motion, the animation of that

433
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.640
connects you more to the
speaker and to the source

434
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.760
of the audio. And when
it's gone, it feels like

435
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.020
the gap. Yeah. Yeah. And
that's exactly it. It's, it's

436
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.830
funny how we spend our
lives rating right now. And

437
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.860
that's actually how we consume
so much of our social.

438
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.100
You, you text people and
you Facebook message to them

439
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:38.830
and stuff, and that does
feel like speech. And so,

440
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.250
yeah, there's exactly put the
words near the mouth. And

441
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.790
so Emily has a very
different experience there. I think

442
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:50.530
that your, your friend Mark Miller,
actually, we were kind of

443
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.340
chatting through various needs. And
he was saying like, look,

444
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.120
this stuff by the way
is great for comprehension because

445
00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.590
you're listening and you're reading
at the same time and

446
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:05.380
it's, it's triggering those two
centers of the brain. Right.

447
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.310
So my, my thing is
we don't really understand, like

448
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.370
the thing you just said
about putting, putting the transcript

449
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:16.660
near the mouth. No, no
scientists, no, no sort of

450
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.870
researcher would have said, well,
that's really interesting, but it

451
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.860
is really interesting. And there's
tons of just, what is

452
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.990
the Stu, what does this
do? How does this feel

453
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.330
work to do? It's, it's
just UX. Right. But it's,

454
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.160
it's fascinating because it is
it's, it's, it's almost a

455
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.760
new medium, it's a new
way of looking at podcasts.

456
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.120
It's an, it's a new
way of consumption. Have you

457
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.570
noticed the proliferation of little
news on Facebook that you

458
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.330
can watch and watch them
on mute because they have

459
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.330
animated text flying in that
tells you everything. So you

460
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.610
get one experience. If the
sound is muted and one,

461
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:58.370
if it's not. Yeah, yeah,
exactly. Yup. And even maybe

462
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.650
like four or five years
ago, now there is a

463
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.520
Stephen Fry video where he's talking
about language as well, kinetic

464
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.270
typography. And you know that
it was it's this, even

465
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:13.940
now it's a jaw-dropping experience.
That's fantastic. And yeah, this,

466
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.710
this will happen more and
more and more and more

467
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:21.890
as, as we erase the
line between audio and text

468
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.440
and, and start to blend
it and meld it together.

469
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.340
You know, you, you go
to that place where you

470
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.970
can easily parse something without
having your speakers on. And

471
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.250
then you dial up the
experience a little bit. You

472
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.070
can dial it up a
little bit more And you

473
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:39.710
believe you said this to
me, that we're going to

474
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.740
reach the point where we'll
be able to record everything

475
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.220
and then transcribe everything. Oh
gosh, how much time you

476
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:52.940
got? Yeah. I, I do
think that because there are

477
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.140
so many reasons. I mean,
we use Alexa in our

478
00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.830
homes right now and it's,
we use it for a

479
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.780
lot of stuff. There are
so many reasons why in

480
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.130
your day to day life,
you might wish to have

481
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.460
that, have that recording. And
it sounds a little creepy

482
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.150
and you know, maybe not
for everyone, but for myself,

483
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.810
the idea of not having
to take notes in meetings

484
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.840
is a stupid example of
like, it's, it's simple, but

485
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.080
that that's an attractive use
case for me. I take

486
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.680
a lot of meetings, right.
You're also making me worry

487
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.180
though, that that means I'm
going to have to then

488
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.600
search my entire life. Like
imagine there is a future

489
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.460
person who will have every
bit of text that they've

490
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:43.670
ever spoken available to them.
And I realized that I

491
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:47.810
can't effectively search my email
and find what I want.

492
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.400
You know what I mean?
So search is going to

493
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.220
need to improve as well.
Skin need to improve. Yeah.

494
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.260
I mean, there's a, there's
a black mirror episode of

495
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.170
it. I was just going
to say that it's always

496
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.630
a black mirror episode about
anything that's creepy or futurey

497
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.500
That's, that's why we, we
gotta be conscientious and, and

498
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.690
good-hearted about this stuff, Right?
And there's going to be

499
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:10.430
people that are gonna choose
to not, you know, not

500
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.760
want that, that, that new
technology and not their privacy.

501
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.470
We're going to have, we're
going to have opt out

502
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.540
buttons. So when people walk
up to me with their

503
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.800
always recording microphone, that it
won't always record. I don't

504
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.590
know. I don't know when
that happens, but I, I

505
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.430
do know that the world
that we're stepping into is

506
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:33.590
not one that people are
probably aware of right now

507
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.830
that the, when the, when
the internet came around, we

508
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:41.390
had this fantastic information, exploded
explosion, right? We're doubling information

509
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.570
every six weeks or something
now, and what it takes

510
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.930
it to take you. And
I bout an hour to

511
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:56.380
lay down 10,000 words as
transcribed. Okay. And so what

512
00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.160
I'm saying is that the
difference between the amount of

513
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.900
information available and searchable and
usable before the internet, the

514
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.720
difference between that and after
the internet is the same

515
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.130
as the difference between when
the internet was text and

516
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:17.130
when the internet was sound,
It's, it's, it's an order

517
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:21.360
of magnitude orders of magnitude
explosion in the amount of

518
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.920
information available. And people don't
probably get that right now,

519
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:31.590
but they'll, they'll, they'll see
it happening though. So when

520
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.200
do you feel that your
startup will be ready for

521
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.450
us to play with? Well,
you can, you can play

522
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.730
with it a little bit.
Now. Our good friend, Richard Campbell,

523
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.880

codes episodes. You can go

525
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:48.390
