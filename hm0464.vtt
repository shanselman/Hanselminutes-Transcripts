00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.020
Our weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.340
This is Lawrence Ryan mountain show
number four 68. In this

10
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.320
episode, Scott talks with Andrew
Dupree about electrical engineering. Hi,

11
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.630
This is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

12
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.160
minutes. And today on our
March is for makers series

13
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.880
in cooperation with code newbies.
We have Andrew Dupree, he's

14
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.270
a hardware design engineer, and
he's got a masters from

15
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.850
Stanford and which is fantastic
because I went to community

16
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.500
college and I am thrilled
to be talking to you,

17
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.810
sir. All right, well, thanks
for having me on the

18
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.050
show, Scott, you a work
at mind tribe, is that

19
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.380
correct? I do. And that's
a, it's a creative consultancy

20
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.710
that focuses on making products.
So I've got an idea

21
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.270
and I go to my
tribe and they will make

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.050
it a reality, right? We're
a product development consultancy, which

23
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.870
is a real mouthful for
saying that we help people

24
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.130
build hardware products. And you,
your whole focus has been

25
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.070
hardware since, since the beginning.
You're not a software person.

26
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.100
Well, I do kind of
toe the line a little

27
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.300
bit. My undergraduate degree was
in computer engineering, which means

28
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.130
something a little different wherever
you go. But at the

29
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.650
university of Maryland, it basically
meant that I got a

30
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.950
foundation in software. I actually
did a lot of Java

31
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.530
and C for awhile. And
then after about the first

32
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.380
two years, you focus mostly
on hardware and really specialized

33
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.080
in that. And then you
came out of Stanford with

34
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.380
a master's in computer hardware
engineering. Yeah, pretty much it

35
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.660
technically says electrical on paper,
but I did a very

36
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.480
similar thing as my first
degree. Right. And customize the

37
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.820
masters that it was kind
of mostly hardware, but with

38
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.970
little software thrown in there
as well, it seems like

39
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.330
hardware versus software is like
a fork in the road.

40
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.800
You know, I know that
there are, there are Jack

41
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.810
of all trades or Jill's
of all trades who can

42
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.520
do all of those things.
But it seems to me

43
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.180
that I hung a left,
you know, early on in

44
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.280
my career. And I just,
you know, I took E

45
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.200
one Oh one, I took
E two Oh one, I

46
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.030
built an LCD clock and
that was it. And you

47
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.860
know, you kind of have
a little bit more of

48
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.750
a well balanced kind of
a thing. I assume that

49
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.940
you can take a piece
of hardware apart. If you

50
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.950
were at Goodwill and you
found a clock radio, you

51
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.000
can open it up and
study it. You could have

52
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.340
like a, what do you
guys have at your, at

53
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.450
mind tribe? Reckitt Wednesdays when
you take apart devices? We

54
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.890
do, yes. We ripped down
all sorts of things and

55
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.040
really understand it. Sometimes we
actually took a part in

56
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.860
LCD monitor the last time.
And you would be shocked

57
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.060
how complex those are. So
we actually spent about an

58
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.730
hour reading documentation, trying to
figure out what it is

59
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.680
we were looking at, even
though we're all, you know,

60
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.680
pretty good engineers. Okay. Well
that, that makes me feel

61
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.080
a little bit better because
basically as far as I've

62
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.360
gotten is I can take
apart like a clock radio

63
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720
or something and say, that's
a capacitor that's as far

64
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.730
as it goes. Well, I
know, I think that's why

65
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.530
we ended up taking forks
in the road. Like we

66
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.070
do. Scott is because these
hardware products are so complicated.

67
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.910
It takes years and years
of work, just to understand

68
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.540
how your remote control where,
But it's all based on

69
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.870
those, those core things though,
like, you know, objects are

70
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.040
molecules, which are Adams, what
powers, what powers technology, like

71
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.410
if you get right down
to it, electrons are flowing

72
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.400
around aren't they? Exactly. So
these, these electrons that are

73
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.980
going from one place to
another, whether it be in

74
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.030
like, like I read about
Intel processors going to 30

75
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.360
nanometers or some number of
nanometers, they're talking about quantum

76
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.130
physics and all sorts of
things that happen at the

77
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.450
smallest, the smallest sizes, the
things that power everyday objects,

78
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.010
whether it be the mouse
that I've got, or the

79
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.940
microphones that we're talking on,
this is kind of standard

80
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.940
electronics. What is the term
for this is this solid

81
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.140
state equipment. You know, I
pretty much just all call

82
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.950
it computer hardware. And maybe
that's kind of a function

83
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.650
of my background and what
my degrees are called, but

84
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.540
that's how I think of
it all is the hardware.

85
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.020
And there's electricity in everything.
Even though I've got a

86
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.150
mouse here or what, I
haven't changed the batteries on

87
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.040
this mouse in a year,
someone designed that to take

88
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.350
that much power and, and
last for a year on

89
00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.870
batteries. Okay. And there's electrons
in all of this stuff,

90
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.250
electric, current happening in everything
from the 75. I think

91
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.720
I need 75 volts for
this, this microphone. I'm not

92
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.230
sure you've got me wondering,
I'm going to get shocked

93
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.090
with all the different stuff
that I've got on my

94
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.580
table here. That's serious business,
but yeah, that's how it

95
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.010
really works. At the end
of the day, Scott, everything

96
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.370
that we use runs on
electrons, moving from point a

97
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.270
to point B through your
hardware products at whether that

98
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.370
be a light bulb where
you're heating up a filament

99
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.990
and that's generating photons in
a motor, you actually have

100
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.320
electrons running through a coil,
which is making a magnetic

101
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.980
field, which makes the motor
spin. It's all current current,

102
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.050
which is what we call
a flow of electrons going

103
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.400
from a to B. Okay.
So break down current and

104
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.120
voltage, this idea of amps
and volts, and then how

105
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.310
wattage comes in. Cause I
hear all of those terms

106
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.910
and I know that current
is amps and vias revolts,

107
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.480
break it down for me.
Yeah, absolutely. You hear these

108
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.770
terms thrown around all the
time volts, amps, power Watts

109
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.850
was really mean. Honestly, it's
something that I really grappled

110
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.700
with trying to understand for
a long time myself. But

111
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.840
now I think I've come
to a point where I

112
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.420
have a good, simple understanding,
which I use every day

113
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.390
on the job. Let's hear
it. So basically how it

114
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:26.350
works is you have this,
you have electrons and electrons

115
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.080
are really what powers these
devices like we've just said,

116
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.410
but in order to get
that flow of electrons from

117
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.600
a to B, we have
a voltage source. Okay. So

118
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.650
simply puts, we've got a
voltage source and a path

119
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.520
and a voltage source is
basically creating an imbalance of

120
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.850
electrons because what you want
is an imbalance of electrons.

121
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.530
That's going to, Ah, okay.
So the Voltron's around w

122
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.670
the Voltron's, the voltage was
on one side and it

123
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.860
really desperately wants to get
to the other side. Yeah.

124
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.130
Interesting thing about a voltage.
It's not, it doesn't exist

125
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.160
in any one place. A
voltage is specifically defined as

126
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.790
a difference between two places.
And that difference is how

127
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.250
many electrons are at one
place versus the other place.

128
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.940
And those electrons being bunched
up in one place, it's

129
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.160
kind of like the flow
of gravity. They just want

130
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.430
to balance out. So when
you have a voltage source,

131
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.530
you're just talking about putting
a lot of electrons at

132
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.950
one place and very few
electrons at another place. And

133
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.800
because of exactly how the
laws of physics works, those

134
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.700
electrons want to even out,
Okay. So voltage has potential.

135
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.080
There you go. Potential for
electrons to flow from a

136
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.220
to B. Okay. So then
voltage, that's the uppercase V

137
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.650
a and then current is
what they call amps, right?

138
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.350
What is, how does that
relate to Volt? So you

139
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.540
have your voltage, which is
just bunch of electrons at

140
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.910
one place and very few
of the other place. And

141
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.130
if you give them a
way to balance out those

142
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.970
elect, those current vessel, electrons
are going to move. And

143
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.370
that motion of electrons may
to me, is what we

144
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.260
call an electric. Current Is
this like current and water,

145
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.350
Very similar concept. And a
lot of people use kind

146
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.220
of a water analogy to
talk about voltage, current, et

147
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.640
cetera. So you can think
of actually a faucet as

148
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.810
your voltage source, you turn
on your faucet and that

149
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.690
water wants to run out
of there. And actually I'd

150
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.040
like to take it a
step further and really think

151
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.470
about it like a hose
on the outside of your

152
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.740
house. For example, you turn
on that, you turn like

153
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.370
the lever there and the
water wants to rush out

154
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.520
through your hose, right. And
how much water is rushing

155
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.660
out, that's your electric current,
but there's another, there's a

156
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.420
third concept, which I think
is really important, understand, and

157
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.050
that's called resistance. So there's
going to be something trying

158
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.390
to stop that flow from
getting from a to B.

159
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.950
And that determines exactly how
much current is going to

160
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.900
get through. And that's your
resistance. So for example, you

161
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.180
think about your hose analogy.
You turn on the faucet,

162
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.550
the water wants to run,
but if you have your,

163
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.610
all these like kinks in
your hose, the water ends

164
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.160
up coming out very slowly.
And that's the same thing

165
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.680
as having resistance in your
path from a to B,

166
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.870
it reduces the amount of
current which can flow. Okay.

167
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.950
Now I see common numbers,
a lot using things like

168
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.120
USB. Like I hear that
this USB port can do

169
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.140
500 Mila amps, but then
sometimes I'll get an iPad.

170
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.720
And I'll think that I
can charge the iPad with

171
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.730
500 mil amps. And it
says, no, no, you need

172
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:40.340
2.1 amps, which is 2,100
amps. But the voltage seems

173
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.060
to be five volts everywhere.
Why can't my little iPad

174
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.810
be, be powered by a
five volt, 500 milliamp USB

175
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.910
port. That's just a characteristic
of your power supply, basically

176
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.610
like your faucet. You know,
you can turn off your

177
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.010
faucet in your bathroom as
much as you want, but

178
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.290
it will never put out
enough water to fill up

179
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.560
a swimming pool at any
reasonable amount of time. Anyway,

180
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.280
and that's the same thing
with the way you're maybe

181
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.950
a really a small power
supplies zoned to put out

182
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.070
500 mil amps, maybe what
you've got charging your USB

183
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.550
mouse, for example, that's just
not designed to put out

184
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.430
enough current to charge a
much bigger device like an

185
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.270
iPad. Okay. So the using
the water analogy, continuing that

186
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.190
the size of the pipe
is just never going to

187
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.690
be big enough. It's just,
you know, like you said,

188
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.660
filling up a pool with
a hose it's never going

189
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.490
to happen. Okay. So that's
why my iPad will charge

190
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.950
really fast when I have
the right power supply or

191
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.030
it'll trickle charge, or even
just stay safe, stay at

192
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.580
a status point. I was
using an iPad earlier today

193
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.190
with my son and it
was at 3%. So I

194
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.840
rushed off and I grabbed
a power supply, but I

195
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.180
got the wrong one. And
he worked on the thing

196
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.220
for an hour and it
was still at 3% at

197
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.750
the end of the hour.
So that means that the

198
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.720
current going in just about
matched what was being used

199
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.630
by the device and it
kept it without being without

200
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.910
actually, you know, charging it.
Yeah, Yeah. That's exactly the

201
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.220
case. And I had a
very similar situation with the

202
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.620
car charger the other day.
I was trying to keep

203
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.350
my phone from dying while
using it as a GPS,

204
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.260
but actually my car charger
wasn't even putting out enough

205
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.780
to sustain it. So it
was just like slowly dropping

206
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.330
down because I was putting
in not as many, much

207
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.990
current as it was drawn.
Now, is there a poll

208
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.090
for, and forgive my ignorance.
I will be using incorrect

209
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.360
terms here, Missouri pull versus
push relationship here, because I

210
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.290
understand that I can use
a two amp power supply

211
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.510
on a device that doesn't
need two amps. Right. And

212
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.820
it won't burn it out,
right. If they have the

213
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.910
right amount of voltage, but
if I get the voltage

214
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.770
wrong, I'm going to like,
something's going to blow up.

215
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.220
Right. And really to answer
that question, it's helpful to

216
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.120
really break down. What is
the relationship between your voltage,

217
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.420
your current, and this concept
of resistance I was describing.

218
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.000
And that's pretty simple. It's
a, that goes V equals

219
00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.010
I times R which means
volts equals your current times

220
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.080
the resistance. So you and
I actually really, I generally

221
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.960
think of that as like
take your volts divided by

222
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.970
the resistance in your path.
And then you're going to

223
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.630
get the amount of current
you can put out. So

224
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.170
that's why you can use
basically any power supply that

225
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.170
says, you know, it can
put out two amps, but

226
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.590
it's at five volts because
it's the resistance of what

227
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.230
you're plugging into it, which
determines how much current is

228
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.630
actually going to flow. Ah,
interesting. So it's not that

229
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.830
the devices necessarily sucking up
a certain amount of power

230
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.170
it's resistant to set that
it will, it will enter

231
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.170
in only so much, only
so much water quote unquote

232
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.210
is going to get into
this device by virtue of

233
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.240
its characteristics. Right? It means
that when you plug in

234
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.180
that power supply, it's not
going to automatically push that

235
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.170
to amps through there, you
know, potentially destroying your device,

236
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.450
if your devices and made
to have that many electrons

237
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.750
running through it. It just
means that that's the maximum

238
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.270
size of that pipe. It's
amount of water that can

239
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.300
go through that. But how
much current is actually going

240
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.240
to go through is determined
by the device that you're

241
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.040
trying to power. It's internal
resistance, It's internal resistance. Okay.

242
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.220
But if I took my,
and we're talking, you know,

243
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.790
DC here, of course not
AC power. If I took

244
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.420
my iPad and somehow plugged
it into my car battery,

245
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.840
you know, car batteries gonna
be a 12 volt car

246
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.850
battery, but it might have
a thousand amps for a

247
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.090
larger vehicle. What's gonna go
wrong. And, and, and in

248
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.730
how many ways did it
go wrong? Well, then we

249
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.420
gotta think that formula again,
V equals I R what

250
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.180
you've done now is you've
taken a device that's meant

251
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.480
to be used with five
volts, and you've instead given

252
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.360
it to 12 volts. And
remember that the resistance of

253
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.020
that device is not changing.
That's based on everything in

254
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.340
its internal circuitry. So when
you increase the V, but

255
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.950
you keep the, are the
same, the I, and the,

256
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.790
I stands for current is
going to increase. So even

257
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.010
though that device only wants
to have a certain amount

258
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.440
of current go through, you've
now doubled, or more than

259
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.480
double the amount of voltage
there. So more than doubling

260
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.570
amount of current is going
to flow through it. And

261
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.590
that's probably going to destroy
it because the current flow

262
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.880
through wires, it generates a
byproduct that is heat and

263
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.890
other effects too. But heat
is the first one. You'll

264
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.770
notice. It actually means that
everything in your device is

265
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.210
going to heat up a
lot more than it was

266
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.730
meant to when you have
too much current and things

267
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.910
are going to start to
fry. Ah, okay. So then

268
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.030
all of this is going
to start flowing and it

269
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.570
has nowhere to go. And
that's where things overheat blow

270
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.710
up capacitors inside, blow up,
potentially the, even the wires

271
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.540
that are delivering that, that
power could potentially not having

272
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.670
to have a problem with
that. Yeah, Yeah, absolutely. It's

273
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.530
we can go back to
our water analogy. And if,

274
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.300
you know, if you connect
something, a hose, that's only

275
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.970
meant to sustain a certain
amount of water flow, but

276
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.340
you put it to a
really, really powerful source of

277
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.260
water. It's going to push
as much through the can.

278
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.740
Eventually things are just going
to start to pop. Okay.

279
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.490
So if I stay with,
you know, stay in my

280
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.610
lane with my five volts
and my less than an

281
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.430
amp or so of power,
can I put together basic

282
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.970
circuits? You know, with just
the knowledge of V equals

283
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.120
IRR, You really can't Scott
that is going to do

284
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.120
90% of what you want
to do is a very

285
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.260
entry level hardware enthusiast. You
want to use an Arduino.

286
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.200
If you want to use
sensors of equals IRR will

287
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.000
get you very far. Okay.
So the thing that I

288
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.900
get a little confused about
though, then is inputs versus

289
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.500
outputs. Like I could take
a battery and plug it

290
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.740
into a motor and the
motor will spin. But if

291
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.010
I wanted to have a
sensor go into the, you

292
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.170
know, bring some input in,
I don't know really what

293
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.070
the voltage, how that works,
the relationship between the voltage

294
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.010
in which might be why
very low versus out for

295
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.170
a motor, which might be
quite high. You know what

296
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.870
I'm saying? How would I
combine that? Like, for example,

297
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.910
someone says, you need to
drive this 12 volts, A

298
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:08.320
robot, But I've got sensors
that are from all different

299
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.900
places. I might have a
potentially auditors that are turning

300
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.300
things. I might have buttons.
I might have IRR sensors.

301
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.050
There's going to be different
voltages coming into the system.

302
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.290
I might have 3.3 powering
the CPU and five powering

303
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.740
this. Right? So there's a
couple of different ways you're

304
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.530
gonna approach that. Scott, the
simplest thing to do is

305
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.470
try to find all of
your components that run on

306
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.490
the same voltage. Oh, really?
It's like, that's sorry. It

307
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.530
was a dumb question, but,
but like yeah. Try to

308
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.120
stay with five holes. Yeah,
no, that's a thing you

309
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.800
can do. And it's not
a dumb question at all,

310
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.290
mostly because of my next
point, which is that, that

311
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:45.940
doesn't always happen. Sometimes you
might try to find everything

312
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.460
that can work with five
volts, but that one sensor

313
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.480
that you really need, oftentimes
just doesn't work with five

314
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.230
volts. It needs 3.3. So
you might often find yourself

315
00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.160
with multiple voltage sources being
used for your one circuit,

316
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.710
your one project. And let
me get, let me see

317
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.270
if I understand, then I
would get, I would add

318
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.840
a resistor in that relationship
to step the voltage down

319
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.370
to 3.3. That's absolutely one
thing you can do. We

320
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.850
have that relationship V equals
IRR, right? And so you

321
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.330
can actually add a bunch
of several different resistors in

322
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.200
steps through your circuits. And
then as your current flows

323
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.350
that voltage will drop across.
There'll be a drop across

324
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.470
every resistance element in your
circuit. So it'll drop a

325
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.740
little bit across the first
resistor. It'll drop more across

326
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.010
second resistor. And the final
resistor that you have connected

327
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.400
to the low side of
your power supply, which we

328
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.120
call ground. That won't be
a zero. So you can

329
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.640
kind of make these resistance
ladders, which bring your voltage

330
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:51.090
down slowly. Okay. So I
get the basics of plug

331
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.980
the battery into a light
or plug the battery into

332
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.250
a motor. What are, how
do sensors deal with voltage

333
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.910
and where do sensors come
in? Yeah, that's a great

334
00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.860
point. The first thing you're
probably going to be thinking

335
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.830
about as you start to
do some basic projects are

336
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.200
going to be, you probably
have an Arduino and you

337
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.870
probably have sensors and you
want to make that work

338
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.060
with maybe the software knowledge
you have as software guy,

339
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.780
Scott. So what's going to
happen. There is that sensors

340
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.650
are basically devices that put
out a voltage and response

341
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.220
to some kind of stimulus.
So you might have a,

342
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.090
a thermal sensor, which puts
out a voltage, one voltage

343
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.950
when it's really hot and
a different voltage when it's

344
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:32.240
really cold. Okay. So they're
getting this voltage from me

345
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.490
cause I'm, you know, I've
set up a rail of

346
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.040
some kind and I'm passing
power to them and then

347
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.790
they can choose to on
their output side, give me

348
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.030
high voltage or low voltage.
Right. And I think you

349
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.460
broke that down really well.
And is that there's generally

350
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.490
like three pins in a
sensor. You'll give it the

351
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.160
amount it needs to function.
Maybe you'll connect it directly

352
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.700
to your five volt source,
but there'll be another output,

353
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.760
which is going to be
somewhere in between that zero

354
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.120
and five volts, for example.
And that output is a

355
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.810
function of whatever that sensor
is measuring. Okay. So let

356
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.710
me imagine a temperature sensor.
It's got ground, it's got

357
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.770
five volts in and then
the third pin is something

358
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.790
from zero to maybe five
volts again. Right? And then

359
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.490
they've got some specification paper
that I can look at.

360
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:24.020
That'll say this voltage equals
this, this temperature. Right. And

361
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.910
I would have to map
those things. They go and

362
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.150
for every component and you
might use that where that

363
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:33.890
specification lives, isn't something called
a data sheet. Every device

364
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.020
you have will have a
data sheet. This is like

365
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.490
a real thing. Like you're
not just, I thought you

366
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.380
were being, you're trying to
make like really make it

367
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.360
easy for me. Like this
is true. Like even you,

368
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.220
as a professional engineer, you
have to like, Oh, we

369
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.780
gotta to get the data
sheet on the sensor Every

370
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.060
day. That's what I do.
I'm looking for components to

371
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.680
use in my project. I'm
like, let me look up

372
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.720
the data sheet for that.
I don't see how it

373
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.920
works. Okay. So this is
like prescription bottles have prescriptions

374
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.020
period. They all do. And
it's standard. And once you

375
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.940
learn how to read this,
I can go in and

376
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.060
look at these data sheets
and it'll make sense. The

377
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.880
only tricky part is that
sometimes you might be looking

378
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.090
at a poorly documented part,
maybe coming from a directly

379
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.700
from a fabric factory in
China, and you might not

380
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.320
have a fart. You might
have a hard time finding

381
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.900
the data sheet, or it
might be in Chinese. I

382
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.270
had that happen to me
once or twice. I've also

383
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.890
had a couple of things
I've been trying to buy

384
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:24.320
an H M dash 10
Bluetooth, low energy device. And

385
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.650
I'm getting a counterfeit ones.
Yeah. That is, I can't

386
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.230
make it happen. And like
it says H M 10,

387
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.820
but it doesn't act like
one. And then you go

388
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.260
to the forums and it's
like, yeah, we got a

389
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.450
bad batch out of, you
know, out of China or

390
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.400
whatever last, you know, and
make sure that you get

391
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.140
the one and they have
pictures of like, here's the

392
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.670
fake one and here's the
real one. I'm like, wow,

393
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.190
I didn't ever thought that
was going to happen. Yeah.

394
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.100
That's kind of a downside
of old. It's kind of

395
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.030
great that all of our,
all of our components are

396
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:54.580
largely manufactured in China and
it works out pretty well

397
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.220
because we can get low
cost, high quality components. Like

398
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.640
the people at Foxconn, other
big factories in China really

399
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.950
know what they're doing and
do a great job. However,

400
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.380
there is counterfeiting in China,
which is kind of a

401
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.110
big problem. So you do
have to work with that

402
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:14.190
sometimes Then Arduino right here.
And on the top of

403
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.270
it, it's got both things
marked D and things marked

404
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:24.330
a digital and I presume
analog. Yeah, absolutely. And that's

405
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.600
a good concept to understand
What, what do I have

406
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.860
to think about those things?
I thought I was doing

407
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.830
everything in digital now. So
what we were talking about

408
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.450
right now was analog. And
that is to not be

409
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:41.430
too technical. It's basically a
smooth function of voltage, meaning

410
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.510
that your voltage is between
zero and five volts. And

411
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.330
the output of your sensor
is something swinging around somewhere

412
00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.450
between zero and five volts.
But if you plotted it

413
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.420
out, it would be kind
of a smooth curve depending

414
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.140
on what kind of input
you're giving your sensor. Okay.

415
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.290
So I'm imagining a thing
called as a potential geometer,

416
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.570
right? This is me using
fancy language. I'm feeling pretty

417
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.730
excited about it. We were
taking the boys and I

418
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.560
were taking a part in
am radio, and we were

419
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.780
looking at how the tuner
moved and everything. And this,

420
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.020
this idea that I can
just turn this knob and

421
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.840
the voltage will go up
smoothly. That's analog. You're saying,

422
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.780
right. Even though I'm thinking
about five volts, which I

423
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.020
usually associate with digital, that's
just me mixing up things

424
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.360
that is absolutely an analog
thing. And you can do

425
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.120
a lot with analog camera.
You can. And in fact,

426
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.510
most everything was analog up
until a relatively recent period

427
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.880
of time. You know, if
you think about old radio

428
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.540
kits and that was all
analog, Well, let me ask

429
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.850
you this. Then this, this
theoretical temperature sensor that I

430
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.060
want to work with, might
there be an analog temperature

431
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.120
sensor for Arduino and a
digital temperature sensor for Arduino?

432
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.430
I don't think it would
quite work like that. Scott,

433
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.010
because pretty most sensors are
going to be, well, at

434
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.160
least most harmonious sensors are
going to be analog. Meaning

435
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.560
they put out a voltage,
you power it up. And

436
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.230
then they put out some
variable, voltage, voltage, and response

437
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.630
to what it's supposed to
be measuring. But at some

438
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.600
point the analog voltage has
to work with the digital

439
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.850
world and has to work
with the ones and zeros

440
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.060
in your programming language, for
example. And so at that

441
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.130
point, we get to a
concept called an analog to

442
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.930
digital conversion. Okay. And is
that something built in or

443
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.940
do I have to think
about that? Something built in

444
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.890
and it's pretty simple. It
takes a little bit of

445
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.860
thought to understand exactly what's
going on there and understand

446
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.650
how to work with the
output of your sensor. But

447
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.340
in two minutes, you'll have
it down. Okay. Educate me.

448
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.360
Okay. So you've got this
Arduino and a sensor and

449
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.460
you want the two to
talk to each other, and

450
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.950
then you get into the
concept of the Arduinos builtin

451
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.500
analog to digital converter. Basically
the Arduino will look at

452
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.420
the level of voltage on
its input pin. And then

453
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.950
it will turn that into
a number that you can

454
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:54.530
easily understand. So the Arduino
has a 10 bit ADC,

455
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.800
meaning it will give you
numbers between zero and two

456
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.510
to attempt, which is 1024
to represent its input voltages.

457
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.130
And it runs on zero
to five volts. So if

458
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.010
you put in zero volts
to your input pin, it's

459
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.780
going to give you a
zero number on the output.

460
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.030
And you put in five
volts, it's going to tell

461
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.870
you 1024 and anything in
between is going to be

462
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:22.610
a number in between those
two. So 2.5 bolts, for

463
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.730
example, would be halfway from
zero to 10 24. You

464
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.430
know, I, I know that
now, but you're saying that

465
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.800
it's actually a layer of
abstraction that I should take

466
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.540
advantage of. I should. I
know it, but I don't

467
00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.230
have to know it. Yeah.
You're going to want to

468
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.260
know it, to understand how
to take the numbers or

469
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.030
do we know is giving
you and map those back

470
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.270
to what the sensor is
trying to tell you, but

471
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.500
you don't really have to
worry about most of the

472
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:53.260
details there. There's only one
concept I'm gonna understand. And

473
00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.800
that is how does this
number actually translate directly to

474
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.530
the voltage? Because from your
data sheet, like we talked

475
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.900
about earlier, it's probably telling
you what voltage is the

476
00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.100
sensors putting out mean? And
so to do that translation,

477
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.550
all you have to do
is divide the amount of

478
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.790
voltage you're giving your Adreno
by the number of, by

479
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:17.050
the resolution of your analog
to digital converter, which we've

480
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.770
just said is 10 bits
or to the 10th. So

481
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.140
basically you take five volts
and you divide it by

482
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.780
two to the 10 or
10 24, and you get

483
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.290
the number of steps. The
Adreno understands, and you get

484
00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.440
kind of a conversion factor
there. So how that works

485
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.750
is you can take the
number it's giving you and

486
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.420
multiply it by that conversion
factor. And you get back

487
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.310
to the original voltage that
the sensor is trying to

488
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:44.980
tell you Might I find
myself feeling like the numbers

489
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.900
are weird and then going
back there and saying, Oh,

490
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.030
this is out of spec.
I maybe have a bad,

491
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.300
a bad sensor is like,
how often would I find

492
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.790
myself doing this map? Because
I'm feeling like this is

493
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.910
a really great thing for
me to learn educationally. And

494
00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.670
then I would want to
watch for numbers that don't

495
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.270
feel right. Then go back
to the specification documentation and

496
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.340
say, gosh, this is out
of spec. I'm getting numbers.

497
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.110
That don't make any sense.
Yeah. That definitely happens. A

498
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.690
thing I've encountered all the
time is when I'm looking

499
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.060
at the numbers, my Dino's
telling you, and it's just

500
00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.480
one number. For example, I
might have like a voltage

501
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.730
sensor and I'm kind of
like messing with it. I'm

502
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.620
playing with it. I'm expecting
to see the numbers go

503
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.310
up and down, but it's
always telling me 10 24.

504
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.400
Oh, really? What does that
mean? It means, it's Always

505
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.860
telling me that the sensor
is putting out five volts

506
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.230
and we know that that's
the output of the sensor.

507
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.690
It should be changing based
on how the temperature is

508
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.510
changing them, exposing it to
them. Does that mean that

509
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.850
you're either plugged into voltage
when you want it to

510
00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.300
be into the sensor or
that you are having, you

511
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.820
have a bad sensor? Yes.
It could mean either of

512
00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.460
those things. Sometimes I check
my circuit and I realize

513
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.480
instead of connecting the right
output pin to my analog

514
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.810
input on my Adreno, I'm
actually just connecting it directly

515
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.570
to my power supply. So
that happens to you too.

516
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.170
It's just me. Okay. Well
that makes me feel better.

517
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.300
Cause I've had that kind
of stuff happened a couple

518
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.010
of times and I was
like, Oh man, I really

519
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.410
have no idea what I'm
doing Happens to the best

520
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.660
of us. There is a
certain amount of just rubbing

521
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.490
sticks together and hoping it's
going to work out when

522
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.860
you, you know, but at,
at some point I want

523
00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.470
to understand a little bit
farther. I always talk about

524
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.170
layers of abstraction and that's
why it's so great to

525
00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.570
have someone with your experience
to talk to me through

526
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.350
the kind of the one
Oh one stuff, because every

527
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.640
additional layer of abstraction is
indistinguishable from magic, you know?

528
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.370
And I think it's fun
to sit down with an

529
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.950
Arduino and do these kinds
of things, but without actually

530
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.710
understanding that I could take
a multimeter, I'm holding an

531
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.450
Arduino in my hand right
now. And I could go

532
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:45.560
in and watch this and
watch voltages change. As I

533
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.860
move through my, through my
paces, is would there be

534
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.830
an inexpensive way to get
an, an, a solo scope,

535
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.080
which is, that would show
me voltage over time. Wouldn't

536
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.380
it? Right. So a single
scope, you've mentioned the concept

537
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.110
of a multimeter, which is
something that you can put

538
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.690
it two spots in your
circuit, and I probably should

539
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.200
have told you that. Well,
we're getting there. Yeah. Thank

540
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.200
you. You take, you've probably
seen this multi meter and

541
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.690
you know, if you've played
around electronics a little bit,

542
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.820
you'll be familiar with the
concept, but it's this little

543
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.970
box with these two electronic
probes coming out of it

544
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.740
and you can touch those
in different spots of your

545
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.820
circuit. And what that's going
to do is generally speaking,

546
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.620
when you have it on
voltage mode, it's going to

547
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.080
tell you the voltage difference
between the two spots you're

548
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.250
touching. So for example, if
you have your two terminals

549
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.100
of a battery, maybe a
nine volt battery, and you

550
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.470
just connect it directly to
your multimedia, you're going to

551
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:41.660
see nine volts pop up
on your multimeter. But if

552
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.670
you have one of those
buddy, if you're somewhere in

553
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:48.590
your circuit, you can basically,
you generally take the black

554
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.950
probe, which stands for your
lowest potential, your ground point.

555
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.010
So touch that to the
ground side of your battery.

556
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.110
And then you can take
the other probe and put

557
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.540
it anywhere in your circuit.
And it will tell you

558
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.850
what the voltage is. Is
that point in your circuit?

559
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.700
You said anywhere on my
circuit, I can't hurt things

560
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.290
right. By doing that, Generally
speaking, no you can't. These

561
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.410
multi meters, when in voltage
mode are designed to work

562
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.660
with most about any voltage
that you were going to

563
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.440
find yourself throwing at it
without anything bad happening. There

564
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.500
are exceptions when you're working
in like very high voltages,

565
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.660
I get a little trickier.
If you're using it to

566
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.010
measure current or something we
can talk about. But generally

567
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.780
speaking for our, do we
know as insensitive as you're

568
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.630
not going to have to
worry? Okay. So I put

569
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.170
the black on the lowest
potential on the, on what

570
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.090
I think of as the
ground, right? And then I

571
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.230
can move the red program
pretty much anywhere. And you

572
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.210
kind of like, see what
voltage is at that point.

573
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.510
Does it doesn't necessarily tell
me direction? Does it as

574
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:49.230
voltage have direction? Yeah, there
you go. That's a great

575
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.740
point. Scott, you get into
the concept of AC versus

576
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.240
DC alternating current versus direct
current. So if in the

577
00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.680
examples I've been describing of
kind of the, the water

578
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.460
analogy, sensors, pairing, and Arduino,
that's all been a direct

579
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.610
current. You have a buildup
of electrons in one place.

580
00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.360
You have this absence of
electrons at your lowest potential,

581
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.120
your ground terminal, another place.
And you have a flow

582
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.260
of electrons from the high
potential to low potential, pretty

583
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.690
straightforward. And along the way,
it's powering your device, whatever

584
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.290
it's flowing through. But the
alternating current is a little

585
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:30.000
different alternating. Current is when
your current, your flow current,

586
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.420
the direction it's moving is
actually switching back and forth

587
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:39.270
at various speeds. And actually
all of the power transmission

588
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.960
we use is an alternating
current at a speed of

589
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.410
60 Hertz. So 60 times
a second, it switches direction.

590
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.280
How does it move the
a hundred miles or 200

591
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.900
miles? It has to move
to get to my house.

592
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.990
If it's switching back and
forth. That's a great question.

593
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.310
Those XKCD questions. Maybe he
could write a book about

594
00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:04.320
that question, Right? That's a
good question for a power

595
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.270
engineer who could really break
that down in a way

596
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.460
that even I even, I
would give you like not

597
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.300
a great explanation Because now
you're going to make me

598
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.950
go and look about, and
this is what's great about

599
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.930
podcasts. Like this is that
we're going to have show

600
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.600
notes and people are going
to have conversations in the,

601
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.880
in the comments. And they're
going to say, Oh, that

602
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.940
was a great video at
how stuff works. It also

603
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:29.070
makes me thinking about, again,
these layers of abstraction, like

604
00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.670
I know what I know,
and I know exactly where

605
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.880
it turns to magic. Where
does this turn to magic

606
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.520
for you? Like at the
power engineer level, when you're

607
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.850
driving underneath the power transmission
line In so many places,

608
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.260
power's definitely one of them.
Like, I know that AC

609
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.430
is better than DC for
long distance transmission of power,

610
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.550
but could I tell you
exactly why it's more efficient

611
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.890
and why we decided on
that 60 or 70 years

612
00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.490
ago, couldn't break it down
for you. There are things

613
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.490
I'm still learning about, which
are kind of halfway between,

614
00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:06.930
like I understand them and
total black magic, the different

615
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.300
kinds of wireless technology and
when and why we use

616
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.960
different ones to bring the
types of RF. How exactly

617
00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.630
does a Bluetooth versus a
wifi versus cellular and tenant

618
00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.510
work? A little wireless power.
Yeah. Wireless power is a

619
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.720
huge one. Is it working
by induction? Is it working

620
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.910
by, I was reading it
at a startup. That's using

621
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.170
lasers to power things wirelessly.
No one's going to get

622
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:33.150
what could possibly go wrong.
Yeah. So there's so many

623
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.990
different facets of electronics that
I have a good grasp

624
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.620
on two or three of
them. And the other dozen

625
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.890
are total witchcraft. When, when
I start sitting down and

626
00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.350
getting out my multi meter
and learning about my Arduino

627
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.750
and starting to check things,
what are some gotchas and

628
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.520
some pitfalls I'm going to
want to watch for, like,

629
00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.920
if I've got an led,
that's not lighting up, or

630
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.160
if something's going wrong, I
put something in backwards. What

631
00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.210
are some things I want
to watch out for? Well,

632
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.630
that brings us back to
voltage and current and making

633
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.510
sure that you have the
right voltage at each place

634
00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.960
in your circuit, which correspondingly
is going to give your

635
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.840
components either the current they
need the current they're expecting,

636
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.560
or maybe too much or
too little current. So for

637
00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.810
example, you mentioned an led
and that's one of the

638
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:24.460
first circuits you'll put together
when playing out hardware, getting

639
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.680
an led to light up
is basically the hello world

640
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.790
Of the hardware world. It's
extremely satisfying. It is. It's

641
00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.590
a great thing. Yeah. I
remember doing that in my

642
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:35.590
first year of college feeling
like I, you know, pretty

643
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.470
much had all this all
electronics. Yeah. Next up is

644
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.590
an iPad. That's how I
was thinking. Right. But how

645
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.290
that works is that you
have a voltage source, maybe

646
00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.630
five volts or a nine
volt battery, something like that.

647
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.450
You have your led and
then you're going to have

648
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.710
a resistor. And the reason
you need that resistor is

649
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.390
because if you were to
connect your L and D

650
00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:59.470
directly to your battery, you
wouldn't have enough limitation on

651
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.380
the amount of current that
could flow. There's a tiny,

652
00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.590
there's a tiny bit of
resistance, internal to L to

653
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.860
the led internal to the
wires coming off the led,

654
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:11.680
but not at, but not
enough to limit the current

655
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.620
to what you want it
to be. So if you

656
00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:17.890
connected that battery directly to
you led a bunch of

657
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:20.320
Kermit starts to flow and
actually burn out your led.

658
00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.720
Oh really? It would just
go just like a light

659
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.700
bulb burning out. You might
see it come on for

660
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.310
a split second and then
go dark. Oh, well, it's

661
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.350
done forever at that point.
And then it's done forever.

662
00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.170
So what you want to
do is you actually put

663
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.630
in a resistor there, and
that was just limits the

664
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.980
amount of current to a
safe level, the standard amount

665
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.200
of current for an led
kind of an led, you

666
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.560
might get it fries or
SparkFun is about 15 or

667
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.340
20 mil, 20 mil amps.
So you look at your

668
00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:52.420
voltage source, five volts, nine
volts, something like that. You'll

669
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.660
divide that voltage source by
the amount of resistance you

670
00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:59.680
have available, or you'll take
your eye, which is 20

671
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.140
mil amps. And you'll figure
out the number of the

672
00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.140
amount of resistance you need
to make sure that 20

673
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.970
milliamps happens. Okay. The vehicles
I are, you'll figure out

674
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.220
what are you need? So
the eye turns into 20

675
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.910
milliamps depending on your voltage.
And that's the resistor you

676
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.880
need to put in your
circuit. So the first thing

677
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.770
I do, for example, if
my led is not lighting

678
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.350
up, as I look at
denying that resistor and I

679
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.540
do my vehicles, I are,
and I'm saying, okay, based

680
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.490
on my V and my
arm, I actually getting the

681
00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:31.180
amount of current I need
around 20 milliamps, or maybe

682
00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.430
I'm putting in too much,
or maybe I've grabbed a

683
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:36.340
resistor. That's too big. So
I'm only getting like 1 million,

684
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.490
for example. And that might
explain why it's not lighting

685
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:41.910
up. So that kind of
the amount of current and

686
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.490
the amount of voltage playing
with that equals I R

687
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.710
and making sure it's what
the data sheet says. It

688
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.800
could be. That's kind of
the first place I go

689
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.760
for a lot of my
troubleshooting. Hmm. Well, that actually

690
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.860
brings me to this question.
Since I have a, a

691
00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.350
hardware engineer here on the
show, then you can diagnose,

692
00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.470
as we close, what's wrong
with my, my device here

693
00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.740
w the boys and I
built a thing called the

694
00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.680
useless machine. And it's a
little box with a switch

695
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.770
on the top. And I'll
just, you, you, you push

696
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.930
a button, you put, you
basically push a switch and

697
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:15.320
then a finger jumps out
and then turns off. It

698
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.720
turns itself off. Basically, it's
a box with a switch

699
00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.720
that turns itself off. And
the guy has this very

700
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.450
detailed spec and I three
D printed the case. And

701
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.810
I bought all the exact
part numbers. But for whatever

702
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:30.950
reason, the, the switch is
really stiff. So I've got

703
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.440
resistors in here. I've got
power. And I I've gotten

704
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.100
3.3 volts going to the
motor that, that hits the

705
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.770
switch and it just hits
the switch and then stops.

706
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.520
It doesn't have enough oomph
to hit that switch and

707
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.100
knock it off. So I
just started upping the voltage

708
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.800
because I don't know what
I'm doing. And I've, and

709
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.820
I've never had this podcast
recorded before. So I just

710
00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.100
said, screw it because I
have a crying seven year

711
00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.410
old at this point, and
I put a nine volt

712
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.990
battery in there. So instead
of three volts, I'm pushing

713
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.530
nine volts. Now this thing,
this thing turns off with

714
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:08.330
a vengeance because boom, boom,
what's going to go wrong

715
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.820
with the fact that I've
triple over volted this thing.

716
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.540
So basically the guy told
you to put this three

717
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.960
volt motor there, and that
for that three volts, the

718
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.300
amount of current going through
it, it generates a certain

719
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.280
amount of torque in the
motor. It makes the, it

720
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.580
gives the motor a certain
right now it turns out

721
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.700
that wasn't enough for your
project, because you said your

722
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.280
switch was a little stiffer
than expected. Something like that.

723
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.200
Right? So what you did
is you just kept upping

724
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.020
the voltage increasing amount of
current and making the motor

725
00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:40.310
do more work than it
was designed to do. So

726
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.290
it's working. And a lot
of times that's kind of

727
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.530
the secret of electronics. A
lot of times something might

728
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.750
say it's only rated to
a certain amount of voltage

729
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.440
occurrence, but if you increase
that number, it might keep

730
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.610
working. But what you're doing
is you're reducing the lifetime

731
00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.610
of that component. Oh, really?
So that is a fact

732
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.800
like this will not last
as long had I kept

733
00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.110
it at three volts, right?
It means all the internals

734
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.320
that motor, I meant to
work with three volts and

735
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.110
the corresponding amount of current
that's going to drive through

736
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.930
the motor, maybe all of
the windings, all of the

737
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:14.750
little wires inside there only
want to handle a certain

738
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.700
amount of current. And after
that, things are going to

739
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.380
start to degrade. Things are
going to start to get

740
00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:24.730
too hot and example, so
it'll keep working, but eventually

741
00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:28.040
it'll stop working before it
was meant to, because you're

742
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.860
just working at a little
bit too hard. Okay. Well,

743
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.900
hopefully the seven year old
will be in college by

744
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.010
that time, because I glued
thing shut and I don't

745
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.590
know how I could fix
it. We'll call it a

746
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.900
prototype for now. Yeah, it
should be fine for now,

747
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.870
but just something to keep
in mind. Well, this has

748
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.440
been absolutely fantastic. I really
appreciate your time. Hey, anytime.

749
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.670
Thanks for having me on
the show, Scott, it's a

750
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.030
lot of fun. You can
follow. Andrew J drew pre

751
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.630
up on Twitter at twitter.com/andrew
Jadu pre, and I will

752
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.780
put show notes with information,
including a great slide deck

753
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:02.410
that Andrew created to teach
me E one Oh one,

754
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:04.150
as well as some great
courses that you can take

755
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:08.230
online for free and learn
all about electrical engineering. This

756
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.080
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes, and we'll see

757
