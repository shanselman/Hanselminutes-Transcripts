00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.760
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing and
show number 506. In this

10
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.500
episode, Scott talks with John Henry
from cofound, Harlem about today's

11
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.810
startup accelerator. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

12
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.570
episode of Hansel minutes today.
I'm talking with John Henry. He's

13
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.420
the managing director at cofound
Harlem. How are you, sir?

14
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.610
How am I? All right,
buddy. How about yourself? I'm

15
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.220
very well. Thanks for chatting
with me today. Folks can

16
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.170
find cofound, Harlem, cofound dot
C O very cool URL.

17
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.570
Nicely done. Nicely done. Now
I hear a lot of

18
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.590
words like accelerator incubator, startup
incubator. You don't like the

19
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.000
word incubator. I wouldn't say
I don't like it. I

20
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.720
think that actually I have
strong opinions about the whole

21
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.880
thing. I think that the
whole startup space right now

22
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.620
is full with kind of
with a lot of jargon.

23
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.000
And when I was looking
to start this project, it

24
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.490
was elusive to me what
the difference was. And as

25
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.740
I looked up a little
bit deeper, I see that

26
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.960
the difference is really my
new and it's kind of

27
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.790
up to the founders themselves
to determine what it is

28
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.040
that they'd like to be
called. But I will say

29
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.460
that in the primary difference
is that accelerators are usually

30
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.720
a lot more intense and
rigorous and tend to be

31
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.490
shorter in length and oftentimes
invest in the companies, not

32
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.260
necessarily. So for people who
don't know what any of

33
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.960
this is, that there is
a need, there's a company

34
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.310
out there, other companies. How
does that, does that work?

35
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.770
Do you take a piece
of them? Do you give

36
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.230
them a place to, to
start out to stay? How

37
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.810
does that process work? Sure.
Yeah, that's a great question.

38
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.550
So typically I'll speak, I
guess, on behalf of cofound,

39
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.850
Harlem, as opposed to accelerators
as a whole. What we

40
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.410
do is we seek promising
early stage companies from anywhere

41
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.560
and everywhere across the U
S and we provide them

42
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.280
with initially it was thousand
in kind office space and

43
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.820
world-class mentorship. So we were
really fortunate early on to

44
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.390
have some great mentors from
Google and New York times and

45
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.350
MSNBC. And what have you,
and what made co-fund Harlem

46
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.060
really different. And what gives
us a bit of a

47
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.990
social angle is that we
took zero equity from these

48
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.100
companies. And in exchange, the
companies commit to grow in

49
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.580
Harlem for a period of
four years after the initial

50
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.110
nine month program. And so
that's how we do it,

51
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.360
although we're, we're pivoting into
a bit of a different

52
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.270
thing, and I can talk
about that later, but for

53
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.480
the folks out there listening,
right this minute, there are

54
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.350
accelerators that more commonly do
something like they give you

55
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.730
$50,000 upfront. It's a three
month program and they might

56
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.840
take anywhere from five to
7% of equity in exchange

57
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.630
for essentially not only the
money, but the mentorship and

58
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.540
the time that they invest
into you. And the idea

59
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.090
is that, you know, they,
they kind of turn through

60
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.310
all these cohorts and they're
sort of gone and do

61
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.650
well. And eventually you might
see some upside if you

62
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.780
build good enough copies, You
know, there was a show

63
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.810
called all American inventors, kind
of like shark tank. You

64
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.140
know, they're, they're basically the
TV version, you know, which

65
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.230
isn't the real version of
these accelerators. And it, it

66
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.160
seems very, it all, I've
always felt that they take

67
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.620
such a large amount of
your company for such a

68
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.620
small, relatively small amount of
money. Like if you need

69
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.140
money, 50 grants, a lot
of money make no mistake.

70
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.930
50 is a lot of
money, but for 5%, for

71
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.750
7% of your company, it's
your seems a little bit,

72
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.700
I don't know, dangerous, like,
like I think it's cool

73
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.740
that you're really investing in
the community rather than the,

74
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.200
you know, the community first
and the company second almost.

75
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.340
Yeah, no, I agree. And
I certainly think that accelerators

76
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.010
can be a pitfall. In
fact, as I've been diving

77
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.790
into this pace quite a
bit, there are really, really

78
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.600
few accelerators that do a
good job at all. And

79
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.800
Y Combinator is certainly kind
of the poster child. They've

80
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.050
just done a phenomenal job
over the course of the

81
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.990
last 10 years, really setting
the bar for what it

82
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.770
means to build a successful
company. And so if anyone

83
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.970
out there is considering a
beginning of startup or, and

84
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.540
looking into an accelerator, I
do think that there are

85
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.630
some other solid ones out
there, but I certainly certainly

86
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.960
recommend doing your homework, because
like you said, 50,000, when

87
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.230
you're first starting out, 50
K seems kind of like

88
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.870
the end all be all,
but, but in truth, the

89
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.680
value of accelerators lies much
more in the network that

90
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.500
they provide for you and
the quality of mentors that

91
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.130
they can bring onto the
program. Now, forgive me. You

92
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.670
said something where you said
50,000 in kind, what does

93
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.180
that mean? So we have
a bunch of resources that

94
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.180
we offer our startups, I
E legal accounting, et cetera.

95
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.840
And usually these costs can
Mount up to quite a

96
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.310
bit in the early days.
And so what we did

97
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.030
was we got really creative
with value exchange, mostly because

98
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.520
we didn't really, we didn't
have the cash to offer

99
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.010
our startups. So we have
to offer some other type

100
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.980
of value and it really
worked out well because what

101
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.980
we ended up landing on
was nine months of free

102
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.590
office space, as opposed to
the standard three that you

103
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.720
see. And <inaudible> in, in
kind, as I mentioned, and

104
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.610
great mentors in the type
program Kind though, for people

105
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.560
who maybe aren't don't have
English as their first language,

106
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.130
that means $50,000 in value
of services. Is that right?

107
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.830
Correct. Yes. Correct. So that
looks like potentially $15,000 of

108
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.420
legal services, let's say. And
especially when you're incorporating your

109
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.950
startup, it can be quite
expensive, so legal or accounting

110
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.360
services and software as well.
I know we've worked with

111
00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.160
Microsoft and they offer hosting
for companies and Amazon does

112
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.060
as well, et cetera, et
cetera. I see. So you

113
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.090
could Be an accelerator where,
Hey, I've got this great

114
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.150
idea. I pitch you, you
write me a big check

115
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.430
for 50 grand. And I
go out and I got

116
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.580
to start hunting for tech,
startup lawyers and social media

117
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.450
strategists. And I pay them
what I think is the

118
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.780
right amount of money, but
ultimately you're cutting off. You're

119
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.210
almost cutting out the middleman
where the middleman is a

120
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.380
big pilot, Precisely, precisely. And
we thought that was certainly

121
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.950
very interesting. And although we're
just now finishing up our

122
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.830
first nine month cohort next
month, which we're very excited

123
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.370
about, but I'm taking this
kind of a different approach

124
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.240
to it has really, really
tightened up our business acumen

125
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.270
here at the program and
gotten us to hone in

126
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.060
on the things that matter
most because cash can be

127
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.120
a distraction. And it's an,
it's an interesting thing to

128
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.860
talk about and to look
at it in terms of

129
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.640
startups, raising cash and using
that as a metric for

130
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.370
success, I think that they
see the cash and they

131
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.880
want to buy computers and
office space. And if you

132
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.350
can remove that and simply
make the product. Exactly. Yeah.

133
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.630
You've got a list on
your, on your website. If

134
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.920
you go to cofound.co/accelerate for
the list of mentors and

135
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.370
this, this is a very
diverse group of talent from

136
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.550
all play all over. You've
got someone from rap genius,

137
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.810
get someone from NBC, someone
from Google are these volunteers,

138
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.760
are they, how do, how
do you have such a

139
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.090
fantastic and kind of illustrious
group of people, people from

140
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.230
the city of new? Yeah.
So thanks for that. I'm

141
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.730
sure they'd appreciate hearing that.
And in truth, the way

142
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.530
that I got a lot
of these people is just,

143
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.330
it's so funny. It's just
the way that it worked

144
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.600
out before I became an
entrepreneur, I was a doorman

145
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.260
and I was door Manning
at a building. That's just

146
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.170
so near and dear to
my heart. It's in Williamsburg,

147
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.400
Brooklyn on the waterfront there.
And it just so happened

148
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.790
to be a home, the
home of so many great

149
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.120
founders. So the founders of
rap genius live with and

150
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.310
the founders of Vox, he
lived there and the guy

151
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.480
from Dooney and Burke, and
really more than a handful

152
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.990
of these mentors live in
the building. And I was

153
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.880
always super, super earnest and
genuine and took pride in

154
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.680
my work. I think that's
something that came from my

155
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.180
parents having been immigrants. They
always taught me, John, whatever

156
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.460
you do do it really
well. And so when I

157
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.010
was door Manning, I was,
I was the best damn

158
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.660
door man. You could find,
you know, I would learn

159
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.210
your name, your kid's names,
your pets name, et cetera.

160
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.650
And so eventually I got
my first business opportunity to

161
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.930
start my first company. And
I went on and I

162
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.300
did that, but I stayed
in close touch with a

163
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.090
lot of these folks. And
I think that they couldn't

164
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.230
help, but to build this
emotional connection with kind of

165
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.810
my evolution as an entrepreneur,
from having run my first

166
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.080
startup and now doing this.
And so that's really what

167
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.570
kind of got the boat
rolling and the rest of

168
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.500
them. The cool thing about
doing a mission driven company

169
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.100
is that typically if the
mission is compelling enough, you

170
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.580
can get people to buy
into the vision and be

171
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.310
a little bit more forgiving
of the fact that there's

172
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.240
limited resources to begin with.
And so that, that has

173
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.020
been really key for us
as well. I believe Some

174
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.510
people say that it's, you
know, that it's the constraint

175
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.730
that drives innovation, right? If
you simply wrote up one

176
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:27.140
check for a million bucks,
they might create Totally agree.

177
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.770
The people who are the
mentors providing the in kind

178
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.220
value, get out of it,
are they volunteers or are

179
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.290
they just, they get the
sense that they're building it?

180
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.450
Yep. It's, it's been a
mixture of both right in

181
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.540
this minute though, as we're
looking towards our next cohort

182
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.080
and really making our offering
a bit more robust, we're

183
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.720
looking at a term called
entrepreneurs in residence where essentially

184
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.710
we'd be paying some, a
select group of these mentors

185
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.250
to be a little bit
more involved with the accelerator

186
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.040
program and, and hang around
a bit more. But as

187
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.110
of late, it's been, these
mentors are typically there's four

188
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.190
per company, four assigned per
company. And they allocate a

189
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.460
certain amount of time. Certainly
not anything too crazy, but

190
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.210
they allocate time to have
office hours with the startups.

191
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.610
And so for the companies
that works really well, if,

192
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.490
for instance, they're looking to
foster a relationship with the

193
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.610
New York times, or if they're
a media based company, as

194
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.910
an example, then some of
our methods here make good

195
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.580
connections for them. They can
just kind of groom their

196
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.490
growth as they go along,
et cetera. And they get

197
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:44.030
nothing in return really, other
than, other than just the

198
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.710
sense of building a community.
So For example, I could

199
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.030
potentially quit my job tomorrow
and go in and become

200
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.080
CTO at some startup. That
could be a job I

201
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.500
could have theoretically, or I
could become totally, but I

202
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.360
could become like one eighth
of a CTO or one,

203
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.120
four of a CTO. Right.
And give a new startup,

204
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.760
a slice of me and,
you know, eight hours a

205
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.420
week, something like that. Right.
That's a really, that's kind

206
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.710
of a fresh way to
look at it. Yeah. I'll

207
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.040
give you credit. I'll give
you credit. Okay, cool. So

208
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.930
that makes sense. So then
again, if you look at

209
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.480
the list here, you've got
people who have expertise in

210
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.180
dev ops, and you've got
people who have expertise in

211
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.820
education and tech, startup lawyering,
and all that kind of

212
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.110
stuff. As someone who joins
a cohort, you get access

213
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.140
to those people. And then
you are assigned, you know,

214
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.750
your, your four or five,
basically your, your, your team

215
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.820
gets bigger. You know, you
go from being a solo

216
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.140
cofounder to you'd have like
a support network. Totally, totally.

217
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.210
And we don't, we don't
typically like solo founders to

218
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.950
begin with, but, but you
can certainly see this as

219
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.250
a more robust kind of
extension of your team. Well,

220
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.960
let's talk about that idea
of this. You know, you

221
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.880
had a great article in
June of this year called

222
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.620
five ways to survive being
a solo founder, but you're

223
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.190
not a programmer, is that
correct? Correct. Because you can't

224
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.590
do everything right. You can't
necessarily be the business head

225
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.740
and be the tech head.
So how do you, do

226
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.990
you feel that there always
needs to be a tech

227
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.350
head and a business head?
Like how many different people

228
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.400
is like the sweet spot
for a startup? Great question.

229
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.810
So that really depends on,
there's a couple of key

230
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.560
variables here, and I think
it's highly dependent on the

231
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.350
ambition of the founder and
what this company means to

232
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.830
you. Right? So I think
that lately there's been a

233
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.560
lot of pressure. It seems
from the media and what

234
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.660
have you from the tech
crunches and the, and the

235
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:50.370
companies raising 15 million and 180 million
to go and be this

236
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.770
ginormous Uber like company. And
that's certainly a valid aspiration,

237
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.530
I think, and something that
really excites me as an

238
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.850
investor now, but, but also
let's not for every one

239
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.930
of those types of companies.
There's a hundred thousand, perhaps

240
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.570
that really just want to
have their own companies that

241
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.800
generate 200,000, 250,000, that they
can make a comfortable living

242
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.610
for themselves. And so I
think it first starts with

243
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.520
kind of that barometer. How
big do you want to

244
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.880
take this? And if you
do happen to fall into

245
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.220
the bucket of, okay, I've
thought about it and I

246
00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.070
don't want to just make
200 K and, and make

247
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.860
enough for myself and my
spouse. I really want a

248
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.200
high growth startup. Then it's
all about what problem that

249
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.780
you're solving. And certainly we
hear a lot of talk

250
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.660
about the Y being more
important than the what. And

251
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.080
I totally agree with that,
but assuming that you've kind

252
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.210
of gone through these ranks
and you have a strong

253
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.410
why, and you're totally held
vents on this being high

254
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.260
growth, then I think that
the sweet spot is anywhere

255
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.890
from two to three. Anytime,
anytime you get into four

256
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.010
plus, I think you have,
and it's certainly not always

257
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.930
the case because one of
our portfolio companies is a

258
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.170
four person team, but you
suffer the risk of having

259
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.660
too many cooks in the
kitchen where it slows down

260
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.240
your decision making process and
what have you. And then

261
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.000
one person, I just don't
think it's enough to tackle

262
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.180
the workload of a startup.
So anywhere from two to

263
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.300
three is nice. And we
like to say a mixture

264
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.490
of like a hustler and
a hacker or a hustler

265
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:28.450
hacker designer usually makes a
really nice mix. Hansel minutes

279
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:26.590
tree payments.com/hanselman that's Braintree payments.com/hanselman.
I think that within them

280
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.800
kind of the mythos and
the legends of startups and

281
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.170
they are just that there
are myths. There's, you know,

282
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.330
there's the Steve jobs. And
then the Wazniak where the

283
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.540
bill Gates and the, the
bomber, you know, there's the,

284
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.640
the hustler and the hacker.
And that does seem to

285
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.640
be a good, Yeah. Yeah.
I was going to piggyback

286
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.380
off of that and, and
just dive into, I wanted

287
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.560
to dive into this hustler
hacker thing, because I think

288
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.530
it's easy to say, but
one of the elephants in

289
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:02.680
the room, I believe is
this, this whole notion of

290
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.720
how does a nontechnical person
deal with a technical person?

291
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.600
What's that relationship like? What's,
you know, what kind of

292
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:18.400
lapses in communication are there?
What are some assumed knowledge

293
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.330
coming from both parties. And,
and I, I just would

294
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.740
love to dive into that.
I know most of the

295
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.490
audience listening right now are,
are fairly technical. And perhaps

296
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.940
they're kind of curious about
the business side of things.

297
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.450
Is it necessary? What's more
important. Who's more valuable. How

298
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.830
do I communicate the product
who has an unrealistic expectations,

299
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.350
et cetera, what do you
think There's this? You know,

300
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.100
there's that phrase wag the
dog, right? Is the dog

301
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.720
wagging the tail or is
a tail way in the

302
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.180
dog and sometimes feel like
technical people. And I am

303
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.900
definitely at fault, and this
is, well I've, I've done

304
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.140
this in the past, make
the tech because the tech

305
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.320
is cool. Right? And they
don't think about fundamentals. They

306
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.150
don't think about the business.
They don't think about marketing

307
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.120
it. I have a little
startup with that. I made

308
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.610
with my friend, Greg shackles.
We have, we are two

309
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.090
techies though. And we made
a dictation application. So you

310
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.360
can dictate into your iPhone
and it automatically, the dictation

311
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.640
goes into the cloud and
then drops into windows. Oh,

312
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.550
that's pretty neat. It's exactly.
That's like, Hey, that's cool.

313
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.970
But we don't have any
business knowledge. We, we struggled

314
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.190
to put the LLC together.
We still don't have the

315
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.820
lawyer thing worked out, honestly,
from a business perspective, we

316
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.110
have no business plan. We
just made something awesome. And

317
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.760
we just thought that it
would light the world on

318
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.730
fire. Right. It really didn't.
You know what I mean?

319
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.430
Just like, I still feel
like I could wake up

320
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.230
tomorrow. Maybe the world would
have been lit on fire

321
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.680
by our thing. But ultimately
that's a great example of,

322
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.900
you know, two techies making
a techie thing. And then

323
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.400
now we're disappointed that it
didn't change. Right, right, right.

324
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.340
And one of the things
that, that kind of came

325
00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.910
to mind as you were
speaking is, again, it's so

326
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.200
incredibly important for the person
like self-awareness here is huge.

327
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:07.970
The person, the individual must
determine what it is that

328
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.570
they're looking to do. So
for a tech person, that's

329
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.990
just building really nifty products.
Like the arcade that you

330
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.350
have behind you and what
have you, that's totally fine.

331
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.420
Like there's a time and
a place for that. Amen.

332
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.400
If that's all you want
to do kind of on

333
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.680
the side while you work
your, your main gig, then,

334
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.440
then that's fine. However, if
you're looking, if you're actively

335
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:36.710
looking to build a business,
a startup, then I think

336
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:42.980
that this, this business acumen
becomes important. Although I differ

337
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.980
from a lot of folks
on this, I do think

338
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.790
that business people are less
and less valuable nowadays. I

339
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:54.470
do think that MBAs, I
don't know, they're, they're, they're

340
00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:00.800
increasingly less relevant to how
business is conducted in now

341
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.010
now's world. And this is
as a business guy, but

342
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.310
what's, what's interesting for me
in my personal development is

343
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.280
my business acumen was not
developed through school. I dropped

344
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.640
out my first semester, my
business document was developed through

345
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:18.350
actually doing it. And I
do think that humans learn

346
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.880
in a very specific way.
You only get good at

347
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.190
doing exactly what you want
to do. And I'm sure

348
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.380
a lot of us have
heard this example of, you

349
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.580
know, let's say basketball or
golf. I can get tiger

350
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.660
woods to every hour of
every day that I'm awake

351
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.020
for years. Just speak to
me about putting the golf

352
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.450
ball. But until I go
out on that green and

353
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.310
do it myself, I'm not
going to get any better

354
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:47.860
at it. And so with
that said, with said, tech

355
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.460
folks who are interested in
building a product, if the,

356
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.930
why you're doing it is
there. And it's burning inside

357
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.300
of you and you, you
can't not do it. You

358
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.780
wake up every day and
you're really strongly believe in

359
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.190
this. I'm sure this business
stuff might not come naturally

360
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.750
to you, but it will
slowly but surely begin revealing

361
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:16.090
itself to you through relentless
perseverance. And while I do

362
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.060
think that business folks add
some value, I think increasingly

363
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.130
less. So. Yeah, I think,
I think you're right, like

364
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:25.590
experience. There needs to be
a balance. Like I think

365
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.210
if someone gets an MBA
and we're not trying to

366
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.940
pick on MBAs, but we'll
just use the term MBA

367
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.250
to refer to business folks
and just perfect. I think

368
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.830
that my wife has an
MBA. She knows more about

369
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.090
this stuff than I do.
But I think that if

370
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.280
you expect that you're going
to pop out of MBA

371
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.770
school, out of business school,
ready to like hit the

372
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.380
ground and make a business
that's not going to happen.

373
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.460
Exactly. But I think that
when I meet People who

374
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.970
Had had an internship, you
know, when it became interns

375
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.210
and then built a business,
you know, as after their

376
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.020
MBA, I always like, I
always like programs that balance

377
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.750
the, the academic and the,
and the realistic, like when

378
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.870
I did my software engineering
degree, which is not computer

379
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.620
science, it's actually software engineering.
It was required to get

380
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.600
an internship at the end
of the program. And your

381
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.380
last term, before you got
your degree, had to be

382
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.360
an internship at a real
company. And I thought that

383
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.700
was very practical. They literally
forced you, you could not

384
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.230
graduate unless you worked somewhere.
And I should do that

385
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.350
more like every college should
do that. You know, when

386
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.800
people immigrate to the U
S and they do like,

387
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.150
they want to get an
H one, they want to

388
00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.480
get a work visa. Totally.
There's this thing called optional

389
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.630
practical training, right. It's basically
a year after you graduate

390
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.850
from college where you can
work in the U S

391
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.400
to get your, you know,
you get your practical training.

392
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.380
That's something that immigrants do.
But it seems like people

393
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.960
that were born here just
take a year off. You

394
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.460
know, why isn't there a
fifth implied year of undergraduate,

395
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.820
you do your do your
school. And then you go

396
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.200
out and you work for
a year. And we just

397
00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.640
know that you have to
go and work for a

398
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.440
year and not work for
a year to make money,

399
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.390
but work for a year
to learn. It sounds like

400
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.170
you, you accelerated that you
did your semester. And then

401
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.540
you're like, okay, I don't
learn effectively like this I'm

402
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.700
going to go work. Yeah,
sure. And there's certainly much

403
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.590
to be said for that.
I'm sure we can have

404
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.250
in discussion after discussion on
this subject. I do think

405
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.940
education right, as men, it
is ripe for disruption precisely

406
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.320
because it's proving more and
more to be less relevant.

407
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.610
In my view, I think
it's less relevant because startups

408
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:38.820
are increasingly a growing part
of our GDP. In fact,

409
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.800
the internet I was reading
this study was, is pretty

410
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.890
interesting. The internet accounts for
if it were its own

411
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:49.340
sec section in the, for
3.4% of GDP is across

412
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.780
12 large developed countries, which
I thought was fascinating. And

413
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.600
so it's not going away.
It's here. And now that

414
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.460
we have mobile devices, it's
just creating opportunities for previously

415
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.110
unthinkable, scalable business models. And
so we're just seeing technology

416
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.170
applied to so many different
fields that otherwise didn't have

417
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:15.050
it, and it's exploding. And
I think education and government

418
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:19.010
is just lagging behind. So
I do think to your

419
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:22.490
point that we need to
start seeing some fusion of

420
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.530
behind the textbook and application.
And so I'm excited to

421
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.760
see what comes with that.
I am, it's something that

422
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.250
I kind of have on
my radar quite a bit.

423
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.060
So let me ask you
this though, on your page,

424
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.140
you have education partners though.
Yes. Got the Fordham university.

425
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.800
You've got the inner design
innovation center. Are these partners

426
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.160
that you've selected because they
have a disruptive perspective on

427
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.980
education. Hmm. Great question. I've
never had anyone ask me

428
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.420
that. And also a great,
a great observation there. I

429
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.580
am very passionate about making
sure that that entrepreneurship is

430
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.660
if not a viable, alternative
to higher education. Should you

431
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.540
feel that you, that you
don't learn well in university,

432
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.430
at least supplementary to your
education? If you do indeed

433
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.130
think that this, this path
is for you. And so

434
00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.000
the folks over at Fordham
university have a phenomenal data

435
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.410
department. In fact, the, the
actual branch, if you will,

436
00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:25.630
is called the censor of
digital transformation and their students

437
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.420
are just dying to get
their hands on any real

438
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.110
data problems, which I find
interesting. The, the director over

439
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.420
there told me, he's like
John, these problems, you know,

440
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.050
and their kids are bright,
but they're solving theoretical problems.

441
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.050
And they're so out of
touch, I believe. And so

442
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.000
it had occurred to him
that wouldn't it be neat

443
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.580
if we worked with startups
that are working in a

444
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.460
bit of a more dynamic
environment, or we can solve

445
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.010
actual problems for them. And
so time and time again,

446
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:55.660
now we've, we've given them
a unique problem for them

447
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.640
to crack. And they've taken
a stab at it more

448
00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.810
recently, one of our portfolio
companies, band hub, you guys

449
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.440
should check them out. Van
hub.com. They're now the largest

450
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:10.480
online music, collaboration community in
the world. So just quite

451
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.840
simply, people make music together
on van hub. But so

452
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:18.160
they had a request where
they, they want it to,

453
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.200
how do I say integrate
some degree of machine learning

454
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:29.680
to their software, where, where
they can provide audio tracks

455
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:34.240
of single instruments to the
students, and based based on

456
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.260
timbers and certain subsets and
frequencies, they, the students would

457
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.490
be able to develop a
machine learning system that can

458
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.350
identify what type of instrument
it's listening to. So that's

459
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.010
just been one of the
very, of the many neat

460
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.900
things that we've done with
Fordham and city college and,

461
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.750
and Guttman also something similar,
although not censored around data,

462
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.800
as much as it is
entrepreneur. Yeah. It's really significant

463
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.390
to you. You, you said
a lot there, but I

464
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.520
want to call out that
I liked that the, the

465
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.880
Fordham university center is called
the center for digital transformation.

466
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.330
Someone, someone consciously decided that
that was a name because

467
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.620
it served the it's, it
declared what they were about

468
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.070
transformation, which I think exactly
significant. But I also liked

469
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:23.600
the idea that you're giving,
I say kids, but you're

470
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.380
getting college students something to
work on. That is real.

471
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.170
That is fundament. That is
a startup, as opposed to

472
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.380
the theoretical crap that we
give them now, you know,

473
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.710
why aren't we going in
to have freshmen year, maybe

474
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.250
be the basics, but by
sophomore year, why aren't we

475
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.790
going in there with accelerators
and real business problems and

476
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:48.470
making those the assignments totally
agreed that that seems like

477
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.290
such an obvious bit of
low hanging fruit though. I

478
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.650
think that I would suspect
that the, the rank and

479
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.990
file at the colleges would
be afraid that that would

480
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.630
cause dropouts. That would cause
folks to say, Oh, wow,

481
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.310
this is much cooler. If
I quit, I can do

482
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.940
this. The trick would be
to find the balance and

483
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.480
ideally have someone have enough
time that they could finish

484
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.340
their degree and do a
startup at the same time

485
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.250
perhaps. And one thing that
I want to know, and

486
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.310
I think it was a
brilliant observation of yours to

487
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:21.140
the audience listening this that's,
that's a great business opportunity

488
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.290
of anyone should, should feel
inclined to tackle it. But

489
00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.180
by, in large here, entrepreneurs
are always looking for gaps

490
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:33.170
and opportunities to do something
a bit better. And so

491
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:39.170
for me, you're entrepreneurially entrepreneurially
minded in that you notice

492
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.210
the gap and you said,
Hmm, wouldn't that be nice?

493
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.380
And so for entrepreneurs is
just this constant. That would

494
00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.860
be cool. That could be
done a lot better. And

495
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.430
should you feel strong enough
about one particular thing that

496
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.950
maybe usually it's like an
issue that's close to home?

497
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.060
So there's something out for
anyone listening. That's just constantly

498
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.430
comes to mind and it's
just burning and you feel

499
00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.330
really strongly about it. And
it certainly helps that your

500
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.560
technical odds are, if you're
listening to the show. And

501
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.630
then from there, I think
the business acumen just kind

502
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.000
of falls into place and
you may have something real

503
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.940
on your hands, Right? Absolutely.
I like the term though,

504
00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.010
that the gap is, I'm
trying to think about where

505
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.260
all the gaps are, right?
There's the gap between the

506
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.010
business person and the technical
person, but upleveling that even

507
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.950
more, I always talk about
the gap between the business

508
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:31.970
requirement, which is really easy
to say, right? Business business

509
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:34.880
person says, Oh, well I
want the computer to identify

510
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.360
what kind of instrument that
is. That required very little

511
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.620
energy for me to say
that, and then turns into

512
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.960
a nine month project with
a bunch of graduate students.

513
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.060
You know, so there's a
huge gap there. I think

514
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.660
business people, I think underestimate
how complicated it is to

515
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.130
write good solid software. I,
I agree. And I was

516
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.140
in that book here for
so long. I remember when

517
00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.590
I brought in my first
CTO, my first company was

518
00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:01.800
an on demand laundry startup.
So it was very heavy

519
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.700
on the logistics front. And
so pretty much my CTO

520
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.540
was building a layer of
logistics to power our deliveries

521
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.360
and such. And we had
to do things like routing

522
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.590
the, the drivers and, and
prioritizing which deliveries came first

523
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.860
and which, which customers paid
a premium for time sensitive

524
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.640
orders and so on. And
I came into this whole

525
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.510
game of tech startups, again,
having a, not been technical,

526
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.300
but B just kind of
waving my wand and saying,

527
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.420
okay, dude do this. And
I want it done in

528
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.190
three days. And it was
just this incredibly unrealistic expectation

529
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:41.790
of my CTO and through
developing that relationship and a

530
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.830
lot of arguing and a
lot of headbutting and so

531
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.940
forth, we began to get
to a better and better

532
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.300
place where he understood my
sense of urgency because I

533
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.810
cared only about growing the
business and I started uncovering,

534
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.990
Oh, okay, wow. Front end
development is a thing. Backend

535
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.710
is a thing there's different
skillsets for each. And I

536
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.430
even separated it from the
rest of it. So I

537
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.620
began kind of drawing out
the landscape of all things

538
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.850
technical. And I think from
the perspective of nontechnical people,

539
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.300
a tech person, and I
put that, I was just

540
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.750
using air quotes is just
this one person that kind

541
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.510
of covers the entire spectrum
of the whole thing. And

542
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.810
they can act, they can
work super quickly. And I've

543
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:28.050
had to learn a hell
of a lot about MVPs

544
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.530
and kind of building and
stages and reiterating and keeping

545
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:35.880
your ears to the streets,
et cetera. The, the idea

546
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.970
of the MVP though, right?
The minimally viable product, I

547
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.580
think is also a bit
of a concern. I remember

548
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.000
working in startups in the
nineties and I would do,

549
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.310
we would do prototypes. We'd
make, basically we call them

550
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.860
click-throughs right. You know, it
was like, you know, the

551
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.860
windows app that you built
really quickly in like visual

552
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.040
basic six. And if a
business person saw it though,

553
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.470
they're like, wow, I click
on this button. And the

554
00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:01.260
thing I wanted to have
happen happened, it's done right.

555
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.380
Whoa, this is a, you
know, this is a prototype

556
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.780
you show. If you show
a business person, perhaps, you

557
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.930
know, a website that you
auto-generated in node and you

558
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.140
use Twitter bootstrap, they're gonna
think it's amazing. Like we're

559
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.440
finished Totally. One of the
things, that's a, there's a

560
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.670
quick story. And it actually
happened a whole lot. And

561
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:26.190
something that, that my CTO
at the time still, we

562
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.750
still have a laugh about
it. So this day, but

563
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.880
I can tell he was
totally bitter about it. And

564
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.880
that was whenever we went
to go pitch big clients,

565
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:36.120
they would ask me, Oh,
well, can your software do

566
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.530
X, Y, or Z? And
I all, because I cared

567
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.230
about closing that deal, I
would say, absolutely, it can

568
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.910
do X and it can
do Y and Z. And

569
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:48.200
I would just sell up
this incredibly grand Joyce vision.

570
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.160
And then afterwards I'd be
like, Oh shit. And say,

571
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.380
Hey man, you think you
can get that done by

572
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.000
this date. Yeah. That's such
a typical, like, I'm sorry,

573
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.050
but like, yeah. You're not
a unique snowflake and everyone

574
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.820
does that. Can you do
that? Absolutely. Can you do

575
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.610
that? And then, yeah, we've
actually had two story at

576
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.520
Microsoft. We've had times when
one of our VPs would

577
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.040
be giving a speech and
then they mentioned a feature

578
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.440
and then we turned to
each other and we'd say,

579
00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.240
Oh, well, I guess we're
making that. That's a, that's

580
00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.420
funny man. And then of
course, you know, afterwards after

581
00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.260
the meeting, I'd say, all
right, man, listen, I have

582
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.700
a, I have a client
dinner. Alright man, talk soon

583
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.550
and knowing good and well
that he'd have to go

584
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.710
and stay up all night
building the thing while I

585
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.020
was having a steak dinner
with another prospect. So I

586
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.790
can sell them up on
another set of features that

587
00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.070
he'd have to go build.
And so it's this vicious

588
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.820
cycle that I've gotten much,
much, much, much better about.

589
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.050
In fact, I would say
I sympathize now more with

590
00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:50.200
the tech people I'm having,
and now that I'm an

591
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.290
active investor in the tech
space. So, but it took

592
00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:56.050
an evolution, I would say.
Yeah, It's definitely a different

593
00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:59.800
kind of difficult though. You
know, they're, they're, they're the

594
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.630
example I always give is
when I worked, I worked

595
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.120
in finance for many years
and I was the chief

596
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.420
architect of a finance company,
but my boss was the

597
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.500
CTO. So I was the
bridge between, you know, the

598
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:16.270
engineering and the CTO. And
he was the bridge up

599
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.690
even further, like up into
the execs, right? So he

600
00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.760
was the business side of
the technical and I was

601
00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.830
the technical side of the
business and we, we kind

602
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.560
of balanced each other. And
a chief architect was thinking

603
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.560
about, is this the right
technology stack? And then he

604
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.140
would think about the business
ramifications of picking a, you

605
00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.720
know, a technology. So that's
a really refreshing to me.

606
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.590
I wasn't aware of that
distinction there between someone who's

607
00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:42.370
thinking about the business side
of technology. Now, obviously though

608
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.540
his, his, his technical proficiency
was pretty high, you know?

609
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.200
Yeah. He definitely, he definitely
was, but he also had

610
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.250
a, I was the nerd
that they would bring in

611
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.530
for the steak dinners that
didn't know how to order

612
00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.700
wine. He was the business
person who was extremely technical,

613
00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.980
could write the code, but
also knew how to play

614
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:08.680
golf. Those kind of balances
when a company gets larger,

615
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:12.250
I think sometimes you need
your kind of your chief

616
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.700
architect or your chief programmer.
Totally. And that's different from

617
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.190
a CTO. You know, a
CTO is the person that

618
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:22.510
keeps the CEO and the,
you know, the technical person

619
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:25.660
from killing each other. Wow,
man, that's funny because in

620
00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.300
a startup on the opposite
end of the spectrum, right?

621
00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.120
When you have like a
three person team, the CTO

622
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.970
is typically the programmer, the
architect, everything. And perhaps after

623
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:42.420
seed funding, the CTO essentially
becomes a project manager and

624
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:48.060
still is hands on and
probably post series. It depends

625
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.620
on, on how, how good
the team is. But one

626
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.480
of the things that I
see often, and, and it's

627
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.550
really kind of sad, but
as, as startups bring in

628
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:04.160
more and more capital and
they have increasing pressure and

629
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.060
there, there comes a point
where when you raise a

630
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.020
financing round, it's, it's no
longer a relief. You're now

631
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.540
thinking about how you can
turn that money into 20

632
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.240
X, the money that you
got. Right. And so they

633
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.950
started bringing in these high
powered executives and, and sometimes

634
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.980
the original co-founders stepped down
and said VP roles and

635
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.350
all kinds of stuff, but
certainly a story for another

636
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.620
day. Yeah. I think that
in this particular case, my,

637
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.040
my CTO had both an
MBA and a master's in

638
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.550
computer science. So he was
kind of the ideal individual

639
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.900
for that. And I think
that that would be like,

640
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.300
that's the unicorn that you'd
want to find who is

641
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.460
the bridge between the business
and the technical. I think

642
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:46.350
also though that programmers look,
they want to be CTOs

643
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.280
because it's such a big
title. That's like the old

644
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.200
I want to be. They
want to be the CTO,

645
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.720
the most chief technical person.
It doesn't mean you need

646
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.400
to be the best programmer
or the smartest programmer. That's

647
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.310
smart. Something that I hadn't
considered that I'm going to

648
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.830
run over. And until the
most of the accelerator now,

649
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.170
actually they're, they're over right
next to me hacking away

650
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.470
I'm in the conference room.
