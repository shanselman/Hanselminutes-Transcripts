00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.340
and Scott Hunter. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman and this is

10
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.190
another episode of Hansel minutes.
And today we're talking about

11
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.110
bulletin board systems and I've
got on the phone with

12
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.210
me, Jim Hare and Scott Hunter,
founding members of Mustang software.

13
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.750
And you might remember Wildcats
the Wildcat bulletin board system.

14
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.330
Thanks Jim and Scott for
sitting down with me today.

15
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.900
It's great to be here.
Thanks for inviting us. Hey

16
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.480
Scott, thanks for inviting us.
Yeah, absolutely. Jim, who was,

17
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.780
who, who, who started what,
and you were the CEO,

18
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.560
right? Yeah, I was the
original founder and CEO. I

19
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.250
kind of started Scott and
I met on CompuServe back

20
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.610
in, in 85 when we,
cause we both had PC

21
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.530
juniors and, and we kind
of started playing with the

22
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.750
idea of, could we write
a bulletin board system for

23
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.390
the, for the PC junior?
Cause everybody said it couldn't

24
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.060
be done because the, if
you remember way back then

25
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.920
the modem was a non
haze compatible modem back then.

26
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.280
And, and so we just
kinda did it as a,

27
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.040
as a project just to
see if we could write

28
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.970
a mini BBS. And then
I kinda got hooked into

29
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.420
the idea of learning how
to program and, and wanted

30
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.580
to learn how to program
turbo, Pascal. And, and so

31
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.820
kind of started on a
project to write a bulletin

32
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.510
board under turbo Pascal Kind
of funny if you go

33
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.270
back to that era, you
know, Jim and I both

34
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.510
have like 300 baud modems
and we both bought these

35
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.720
awful IBM computers called PC
juniors that were incompatible with

36
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.010
half the world, but they
were cheap and we're on

37
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.440
CompuServe, which was the big
dial up service before the

38
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.800
internet and asking, you know,
where can I find the

39
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.920
BBS that runs on this
thing and ran into a

40
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.810
character that had a turbo
Pascal bulletin board called Colossus.

41
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.290
And I think the guy
that worked on that with

42
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.410
him, Jim Plunkett, and I'd
met him and his BBS

43
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.210
did not work on the
PC junior, but I talked

44
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.130
to him and he's like,
Hey, I'll give you the

45
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.100
source code and you can
try to make this thing

46
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.180
work with the PC junior.
So I, I got the

47
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.460
source code for that and,
and started playing with triple

48
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.820
Pascal. This is like triple
Pascal, one or two, still

49
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.300
impressive. I think even today's
term to think that, you

50
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.820
know, those compilers back then,
you know, compiled in like

51
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.060
one second, you know, thousands
of lines we took, we

52
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.450
took Colossus and, and I
took it and played with

53
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.640
a little bit. And then
I I'd met Jim online,

54
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.040
a friend of ours, Don
Watkins, who ran some of

55
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.590
the forums on CompuServe. He
ran the PC SIG on,

56
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.110
on CompuServe, introduced Gemini to
each other. And next thing

57
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.300
I know I've got the
closet source code and I

58
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480
throw it over to Jim
and Jim and I start

59
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.770
running this thing. And, and,
and that's when Jim had

60
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.670
the idea of, you know,
Colossus was, was kind of

61
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.100
stagnant. Wasn't going all the
directions we wanted. And, and

62
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.950
that's when Jim had the
idea of starting up his

63
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.590
own bulletin board. And I
remember I was at the

64
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.690
time Jim was in California,
I lived in little rock

65
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.180
Arkansas and, and he calls
me one night and we

66
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.210
had this huge brainstorming session
on the phone and, and

67
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.360
about how we would build
this thing and what databases

68
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.090
we would use and all
this stuff. And then, then

69
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.100
we don't talk for about
six months and then I'll,

70
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.290
I'll throw the bone back
over to Jim here. Cause

71
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.530
you know, during that six
months he was out there

72
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.720
going and cranking on, on
building the first cut of

73
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.550
well cap. Yeah, it was,
it was a kind of

74
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.590
a, an interesting time because
I didn't know how to

75
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.560
program. And obviously back then,
you know, there was no

76
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.310
courses on, on turbo Pascal
or anything like that. You

77
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.700
know, the schools were still
teaching Fortran and cobalt and

78
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.770
all those classes. So, you
know, you had to pretty

79
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.690
much learn how to program
out of a book. And,

80
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.900
and so I just started,
you know, I got all

81
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.600
the books I could on
turbo Pascal. And then I

82
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.910
met guys like John Freel
who were kind enough to

83
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.710
give me some of the
source code assembly source code

84
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.410
that had the communications layer
in it. At that point,

85
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.880
I went ahead and bought
a, a clone a PC

86
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.340
at the time. I think
one of the very first

87
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.740
ones that came out to
try to, you know, cause

88
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.530
the PC junior just wasn't
really getting it from that

89
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.060
standpoint. And, and, and then,
you know, met the guys

90
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.890
at turtle power. I remember
the guys at turtle power

91
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.080
Scott and, and, you know,
they kind of helped me

92
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.060
with some, you know, some
objects and, and functions and

93
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.390
procedures and just started really,
really just did it as

94
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.920
a labor of love just
to really learn how to

95
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.360
program and, and to, to
get it running. And, and

96
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.990
the first, I think BBS
we had was a what's

97
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.860
it called junior country or
something like that. And yeah,

98
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.260
it was, it was a
BBS that was running on

99
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.020
a clone PC, but, but
it had all of the,

100
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.810
every single kind of app
you could think of for

101
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.860
PC juniors and stuff. So,
and that's kinda how, how

102
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.650
everything kind of started. You
keep talking about getting help

103
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.260
from people you're doing this
online. This is 25 years

104
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.960
ago, three baud modem. And
You're logging into CompuServe talking

105
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.720
in the forums, asking questions
Yeah. And calling these other

106
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.880
people's DVS as well. So,
you know, John Freel, who

107
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.550
was the original author of
que modem had to BVS,

108
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.370
I don't know. I don't
remember how we ran into,

109
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.400
into the turbo power guys,
but it's kinda funny. And,

110
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.660
you know, especially with, with
me at Microsoft, Jim and

111
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.310
I Wildcat was one of
the first big applications that

112
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.510
was written on turbo Pascal,
which became Borland Pascal. And

113
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.720
so just like we have
insiders groups that come up

114
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.330
and talk to the, like
the asp.net team at Microsoft,

115
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.910
Jim and I were part
of that team for Berlin

116
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.300
and turbo Pascal. So while
we're building the early versions

117
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.060
of, of the, of the
BBS and stuff, we'd get

118
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.620
a call from Borland once
a year and we'd go

119
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.010
up there. And, and we
were actually at Andrews Helzberg

120
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.060
house cause he was throwing
these parties. You know, this

121
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.520
is the guy who created
triple Pascal and now is

122
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.520
the author of C-sharp and
link and right. And all

123
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.180
these and we were, we
were, we would go up

124
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.150
once a year, see what
the new Berlin Berlin technology

125
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.440
was going to be and
go have dinner at his

126
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.930
house. Wow. Was it like
an, it was a nice

127
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.750
house. Was he like a
superstar then He was a

128
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.150
superstar then. But I mean,
I, you know, I would

129
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.070
say that, you know, the
America as a whole is

130
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.590
kind of, you know, blown
up since then, I think,

131
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.220
you know, successful in 85
or 87 was not what

132
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.060
successful in 2005 was, you
know, it was moderate. It

133
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.530
was, it was nice. It
was in Scott's Valley. It

134
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.070
was all nice area and
stuff. You know, I, I

135
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.100
actually remember those, those trips,
you know, very vividly. And

136
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.500
what I thought was amazing
was I was always in

137
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.960
awe because, you know, here
I was meeting the guy

138
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.350
that wrote turtle Pascal, but
they were so personable. I

139
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.420
mean, they're so reachable and,
and you know, they just

140
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.690
love sitting down and talking
about stuff. And I just,

141
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.450
you know, I really was
just taken by the fact

142
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.450
that it was, you know,
the community was just willing

143
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.380
to share anything. I mean
just, you know, ideas, concepts,

144
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.740
you know, how to do
certain things. And, and, and

145
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.290
I think that's what attracted
me to the whole industry

146
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.600
in general was the fact
that I could get on

147
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.220
copy serve, or I copy
serve. I found out about

148
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.010
bulletin board systems and then
from bulletin board systems, I

149
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.640
found out about FIDOnet and
other things, and then started

150
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.390
really digging into this and
found that everybody I met

151
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.580
all the CIS ops that
I met were, you know,

152
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.790
were just willing and able
to share concepts, ideas and

153
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.030
everything. And I think, I
think that's, you know, that

154
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.390
was really the first social
network. I think that, that,

155
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.570
you know, really evolved. And
it was, it was because

156
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.070
we could sit in our,
you know, I could sit

157
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.370
in my home in Bakersfield,
California and use a modem

158
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.650
and connect to people around
the world. And, and I

159
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.310
think that's really was the
big attraction for me. Well,

160
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.230
let's back up a second
and give some of the

161
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.810
listeners, maybe some of the
younger listeners and some of

162
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.420
the international listeners, some of
the glossary of terms that

163
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.010
we've been banding around here.
So originally you were saying

164
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.730
In 1985, you were using
a 300 baud modem. I

165
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.100
think that's fair to say
that's a 300 BPS or

166
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.050
bits per second. That's 300
bits, right. In a second,

167
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:14.640
which is about 37 bytes
a second, which is a

168
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.960
N a K is a
thousand plus bites. This is

169
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.110
a pretty slow thing that
we're talking about. Yeah. When

170
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.300
you were, when you were
reading messages on a screen,

171
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.060
you could watch the screen
slowly paint itself, you know,

172
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.300
everybody's, it's almost like a
remote typewriter. Exactly. It was

173
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.280
like a remote typewriter. It's
like watching the movie war

174
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.010
games. When you see the
text growing across the computer

175
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.660
screens and stuff at a
really slow rate. I mean,

176
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.900
today we complain when our
browser doesn't draw like 30

177
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.070
pictures and everything in like
two seconds. And these days,

178
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.140
you know, you might wait
four or five seconds for

179
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.990
just text, no pictures, no
images at all. Just text

180
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.090
to come up here, put
that into the context of

181
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.580
a single K you know,
what we think of as

182
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.730
a very small unit, you're
looking at about 30 seconds

183
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.290
to get a thousand bytes.
Yes. You know, so then

184
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.510
you think about someone who
wants to send an image,

185
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.760
that's a big deal. Yeah.
And you know, and the

186
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.430
other thing about those times
is, you know, w we

187
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.400
used to at three, at
300 baud modem, we used

188
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.010
to say, would paint a
word. Then when we first

189
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.370
got the Hayes 1200 baud
modem switch, Scott and I

190
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.680
both paid over a thousand
bucks to get when they

191
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.710
first came out, we thought
that was amazing because it

192
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.220
painted a line, you know?
And then when then we

193
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.820
followed the whole thing, 2,400
bod, I never forget when

194
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.970
2,400 baud came out, haze,
2,400 baud modem. And then,

195
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.880
and then U S robotics
came out with the very

196
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.990
first, I remember anyways, 9,600
baud modem. And, and, you

197
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.090
know, so we, we followed
it all the way to,

198
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.080
you know, all the way
When there were standards Wars

199
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.410
that were happening. You know,
I remember that that was,

200
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.430
was like, who's going to
win. And then there was

201
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.890
a device that I think
I spent $300 for a,

202
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.920
what they were calling a
V dot everything, which was

203
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.900
just a modem that said,
whatever it is, we'll speak

204
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.640
it because we're not going
to fight. It was kind

205
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.220
of the equivalent of a
VHS and beta max player,

206
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.380
all in one thing. And
it was the size of

207
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.360
a modern laptop. The motor
Moore's are great for the

208
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.630
BBS community because we got
them almost for free because,

209
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.760
you know, the way, the
way that the modem things

210
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.890
worked, you know, if you
were sitting at home and

211
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.060
you wanted to call my
bulletin board, you'd want my

212
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.700
bulletin board to have the
fastest modem available. So if

213
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.130
you had a fast modem,
it would work. And so

214
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.580
Hayes and us robotics and
all these modem companies, man,

215
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.350
they would throw these modems
at us. The modem would

216
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.880
cost you if you were
an end user, the modem

217
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.490
brand new Mona might cost
like $1,100 for a 9,600

218
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.500
baud modem. But they were
giving them to CIS ops

219
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.840
or like a hundred dollars.
Basically. It probably had cost,

220
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.170
right. There were programs for
basically you register your bulletin

221
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.260
board. Right? Exactly. If we
don't run the fast modem,

222
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.610
then why would anybody buy
it? I mean, cause the

223
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.590
people that are connecting to
us, so it was, it

224
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.360
was a fun time from
that perspective as well. Cause

225
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.030
you know, we all the
new technology, if you were

226
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.600
often actually ran a BBS
full time and they did

227
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.250
do checks to make sure
you ran a BBS full

228
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.690
time. If you ran it
full time, you know, you've

229
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.560
got all that hardware for,
for cheap, maybe an obvious

230
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.330
word, but systems operator, the
person that owns the bulletin

231
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.100
board, That's correct. That's the,
that's the guy that's, he's

232
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.040
the in today's terms, he'd
be the webmaster. It'd be

233
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.250
the guy that's running the
site. And the other thing

234
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.860
that was interesting during that
time from a development point

235
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.470
of view from a programming
point of view was, you

236
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.270
know, I spent probably I'd
say 30% of my time

237
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.690
actually working on the communication
layers for every version of

238
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:35.070
Wildcat and the modem control
layer because you know, trying

239
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.300
to get the modem to
properly pickup automatically was, was

240
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.690
a constant fight for me
because you know, every single

241
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.630
modem member, we were selling
this as a software package

242
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.910
and people were using every
brand of modem that was

243
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:52.080
out there. And every brand
of modem had different timing

244
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.740
delays when they would send
a, you know, a, a

245
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.290
rain, you know, then I'd
have to send an ATA

246
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.350
to have an answer. And
the biggest problems with wild

247
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.750
cat in the early days
was just getting it to

248
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.810
work with all the modems
to automatically answer because there

249
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.420
was nothing worse than to
be a CIS op. And

250
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.540
to sit there, staring at
a screen, waiting for somebody

251
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.750
to call into your books
and board, and then, then

252
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.090
not have an answer the
phone. I mean, that was

253
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.700
just like, that was like
death. They finally get that

254
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.800
phone call to come in
and then for the thing

255
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.890
to not answer. And so
I spent countless hours on

256
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.740
working on the, on the,
on the communication layers to

257
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.620
make sure that Wildcat never
missed a call. And then

258
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.680
as BBSs gay started getting
busier, you, you had to

259
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.430
deal with, okay, now you
have to hang up on,

260
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.120
you know, the person hangs
up and now you have

261
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.400
to immediately reset and be
ready for the next car

262
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.540
or within, you know, a
second or two. So That

263
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.770
brings up a great point.
You know, Scott, Scott was

264
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.170
asking about what, you know,
what that means. And, and

265
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.120
that, that reminds me of
something you don't get today.

266
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.640
When you build a website
today, you know, when you

267
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.490
were a societ back in
these times, your computer typically

268
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.950
had one modem and could
only handle one phone call

269
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.560
at a time. In the
later days of the BBS

270
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.180
industry, there was ways to,
to have multi lines and

271
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.170
do more than that. But
early on, you really had

272
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.100
one line. And the cool
thing about being an assist

273
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.800
shop was you would sit
there and stare at your

274
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.410
computer. And it's sitting there
saying, waiting for a call.

275
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.150
And then as soon as
the phone rings, you know,

276
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.160
as Jim said, we do
all this handshaking and stuff

277
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.990
and we answered the phone.
And then as this, this

278
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.510
stuff, you've got to watch,
you got to watch everything

279
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.300
that person did on your
site. As, as they're typing

280
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.730
and stuff, you actually see
them, the menu withdrawn the

281
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.040
draw on the screen. You
can see them go from

282
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.950
menu to menu. You can
see them typing messages and

283
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.720
downloading files. And it, it
was, it was cool. I

284
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.120
mean, you know, today you
go look at a web

285
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.460
log. Ah, great. It showed
me that my homepage was

286
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.640
showed 3,500 times kind of
like screening your calls, right?

287
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.520
Someone calls your, your voice,
your you're not your voicemail.

288
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.960
So I was going to
say, voicemail, someone calls your

289
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.000
answering machine and you can
listen to them in real

290
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.620
talking. It's a certain voyeurism
they're being able to watch

291
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.710
people do that. Eventually though,
when bulletin boards became big

292
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.020
on messaging and people would
leave messages, I would turn

293
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.690
that feature off because I
don't want to watch someone

294
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.610
leaving messages, you know, as
soon as it got multiline,

295
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.590
it was impossible to do
that anyways, but it was

296
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.630
cool, especially in the early
days when it was really,

297
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.520
really community driven. If you
watch somebody's struggling on your

298
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.230
BBS, you would just press
a button on your, on

299
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.990
your keyboard and you could
write and interrupt them and

300
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.050
say, hi, it's me. I'm
the up? What can I

301
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.470
do to help? And then,
and then let's not forget,

302
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.530
let's not forget the coolness
of when companies like desqview

303
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.930
came out and all of
a sudden we could now,

304
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.140
you know, multitask on our
PCs. And then we had

305
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.420
to figure out ways to
put multiple modems in those

306
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.050
PCs and have multiple versions
of, you know, have desk.

307
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.130
You run into multiple windows
and, and, you know, multiple

308
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.180
thoughts, applications, and windows. Those
were, those were interesting times

309
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.680
to have to figure out
how to make all of

310
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.870
that work and how to
make still that, you know,

311
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.860
time slicing and, and, you
know, communication layers still run,

312
00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.430
even though it was sharing
resources across multiple Cause it

313
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.670
was cooperative multitasking. The desk
view was D E S

314
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.000
Q V I E w.
And that was a quarter

315
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.980
deck product. If I remember
correctly and it was text

316
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.720
mode and I would run
basically these text mode windows,

317
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.390
it smelled a lot like,
like turbo vision, which was

318
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.000
the windowing thing for triple
Pascal. But it was basically

319
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.280
back in the days when
we were drawing windows with

320
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.220
ASCII art and ANSI art,
and I used to run

321
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.850
multiple, I used to run
tweak, computer support BBS, and

322
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.730
I had a desk view
running four lines and wild

323
00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.760
cat software in each window.
And then I moved over

324
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.110
to <inaudible> when I got
my eight megs of Ram.

325
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.240
I had eight megabytes of
Ram. I had more Ram

326
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.170
than in the entire block
combined. I remember hooking up

327
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.480
all my dips, my tiny
memory fields and fields of

328
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.570
dips filling my, my three
86 DX with eight megs

329
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.750
of Ram and then running
<inaudible>. It was a very

330
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.170
amazing feeling to have that
much money Probably using quarter

331
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.960
decks, multiple Ram card at
the time to take you

332
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.630
to extend your memory, right?
Yeah. And then remembering people,

333
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.950
they were, they were kind
of these silly little geek

334
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.220
competitions, as people would try
to optimize their config SIS

335
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.080
and their auto exec bat
and make sure that everything

336
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.900
gets loaded into upper memory.
And there was a tool

337
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.100
called QEM M, which was
the quarter deck man memory

338
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:26.320
manager that would let you,
and then people would say,

339
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.660
and basically what that would
do is it would reboot

340
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.810
your machine over and over
and over again and try

341
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.030
different scenarios until it found
the one that worked and

342
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.930
kind of playing Tetris with
your memory. And then eventually

343
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.360
people decided that they could
do it better than, than

344
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.920
QA. And so we just
write them all out on

345
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.280
paper and make the decisions
ourselves. And all of this

346
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.190
was in an attempt to
squeeze another line or another

347
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.720
instance of, of Wildcat or
whatever We were running into

348
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.600
what little memory we had.
Yeah. And to think that

349
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.250
people think computers are hard
today. I mean, well, that's

350
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.970
what I think. I think
that some of the old

351
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.350
timers like ourselves that suffered
through the 300 bod days

352
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.620
want to remind the kids
with the 20 megabits per

353
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.690
second optical connection to their
house, what software real suffering

354
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.330
look like. Right. And of
course, as we reminisce about

355
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.710
300 bod, some listener who
worked on punch cards is

356
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.510
saying, Oh, these kids with
their <inaudible> in their 2,400

357
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.760
baud modems, they don't know
what real suffering is like.

358
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.340
That's right. I'll tell you
a funny story about the

359
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.240
whole Mustang Wildcat stuff is,
is we, we did, you

360
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.000
know, we, we were in
our heyday in the mid

361
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.500
nineties. So we took the
company public in the, in

362
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.440
the early nineties. And we're
a public company created, traded

363
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.240
on NASDAQ and all this
kind of stuff we're flying

364
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.850
high. You know, we're at
the peak of the BBS

365
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.480
news industry and we're having
good times. And, and in

366
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.030
those days the big computer
show this. And once again,

367
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.210
it doesn't fit the course
anymore. It was Comdex. And,

368
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.880
and for many, many years,
every year at Comdex, we

369
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.280
would go and have a
big booth and show off

370
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.450
our BBS technology. And then
it was in 1995 that

371
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.410
we have our booth, we're
showing off our Wildcat stuff,

372
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.470
our Q modem stuff, and
right behind our booth is

373
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.890
a company called Netscape. And
I remember I met the

374
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.470
booth and Jim goes, Hey,
Scott, you need to go

375
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.700
over and look at this
Netscape stuff. And, you know,

376
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.460
for, for those that, you
know, I've only seen Firefox

377
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.720
internet Explorer, you know, Netscape
was the, the starting of

378
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.990
web browsing. And so they
were showing off their first

379
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.590
web browser. And, you know,
I think everybody from our,

380
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.410
our company walked over there
and sat down and saw

381
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:45.770
this and were like, wow,
Well back then with what

382
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.660
a lot of people don't
realize is, you know, from

383
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.760
at least from my perspective
is, you know, the internet

384
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.480
started, you know, as a
way to connect multiple computers.

385
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.690
And then, you know, was,
was, you know, an early

386
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.820
times, at least to what
I remember was, you know,

387
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.610
email came and then we
sat around a room when,

388
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.740
when the, when we first
got an internet connection at

389
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.770
Mustang and said, okay, now
how do we connect all

390
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:11.120
of our, you know, with
53,000 Wildcat bulletin board systems

391
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.760
out in the universe verse.
And so our goal was

392
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.910
to figure out ways to
connect all of these, to

393
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.690
actually cut, to create our
first web really of BBS

394
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.170
is where somebody could, you
know, post a message, you

395
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.530
know, using the back then
the Fido technology, we kind

396
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.450
of took it and took
it to the next level

397
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.390
where somebody could post a
message and in Bakersfield for

398
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.210
somebody in Chicago and then
have it route, you know,

399
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.280
through what was it, the
TC TC helped me out

400
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.590
with some of the terms
we use back then, Scott,

401
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.170
but we used it through,
we went through the actual

402
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.790
internet layer to send that
message, to Package it up

403
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.640
and then send it across
to the Chicago BBS for

404
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.880
somebody then locally could dial
in and grab their email.

405
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.050
Hi, it's Scott here from
another place in time. I

406
00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.600
hope you're enjoying the show
so far. I apologize for

407
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.100
interrupting it, but I wanted
to let you know that

408
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.310
assembling a podcast like this
every week, isn't free. Certainly

409
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.400
the bandwidth bill crushes us
every month. So I wanted

410
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.060
to let you know that
this show is sponsored by

411
00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.460
Tellerik. They make the show
possible and it makes it

412
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.220
pretty cool products as well.
For example, if you're trying

413
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.100
to build a web 2.0
Ajax application, trying to use

414
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.190
the web 1.0 components, it's
kind of difficult. You got

415
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.450
to get the next gen
stuff. If you want to

416
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.790
build the next gen websites.
And that's exactly what the

417
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.460
folks at Tellerik have got
and their new upcoming product,

418
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.810
which is code named rad
controls. Prometheus's a big pack

419
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.610
of web controls built entirely
on top of the Microsoft

420
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.340
ASP net Ajax stuff that
you already understand. It's going

421
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.110
to give you a lot
of performance interactivity on your

422
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.440
next project. They mirror the
ASP net Ajax API. So

423
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.160
the development's really straightforward client
scripture's shared loading time is

424
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.680
pretty fast. You set a
couple of properties. You can

425
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.010
even bind a web services
for really efficient operation. The

426
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.140
new rad editor for ESPN
and Ajax loads up to

427
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.020
four times faster than before.
And the rad grid will

428
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.130
do thousands of records in
milliseconds. But of course, it's

429
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.000
better to try these things
for yourself. So you can

430
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.120
visit <inaudible> dot com slash
ASP, net Ajax, and download

431
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.730
a trial. Thanks a lot
for listening. And we'll get

432
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.370
right back to the show.
Let's back up a sec,

433
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.530
cause you've mentioned FIDOnet a
couple of times let's talk

434
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.170
about what FIDOnet was for
people who don't necessarily remember

435
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.360
that. Yeah. So if I
don't get the whole point

436
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.420
of FIDOnet was, you know,
back in the, in the

437
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.910
mid eighties, it was very
expensive to make long distance

438
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.660
phone calls. And so your
challenge was let's, let's say

439
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.530
that Scott Hanselman lives in
Portland, Oregon, and Scott Hunter lives

440
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.650
in little rock Arkansas. And
I want to send you

441
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.440
a message. Well, I don't
want to dial into your

442
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.870
BBS in Portland, Oregon, because
that's gonna, you know, that's

443
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.420
going to cost me a
dollar a minute or whatever

444
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.030
the heck it was in
those days. And so the

445
00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.930
idea behind FIDOnet was I
can have a message board

446
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.110
on my BBS. It's shared
all the way across the

447
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.360
country. And what happens is
once at once and in

448
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.780
the middle of the night,
two or three o'clock in

449
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.590
the morning, your BVS might
call my BBS. And when

450
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.730
it does my view, my
BBS will basically take all

451
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.830
the messages that you have
not seen, right? Zip them

452
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.950
up and shoot them over
to you. And this is

453
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.290
occurring. There was thousands of
BBS that were doing this

454
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.140
every single night, every single
night, these would be calling

455
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.300
each other and transferring all
their messages back and forth.

456
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.340
And so the benefit for
the, for the end user

457
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.610
was if I was on
your BBS in Portland, I

458
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.820
could send a message to
Scott Hunter. And over a 24

459
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.320
hour period, it would show
up on my BBS in

460
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.010
Arkansas and I could respond
and we would have a

461
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.530
conversation, but it was, you
know, that's something else. You

462
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.870
know, people, people are spoiled
today by, you know, I

463
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.700
sent an email and it
shows up on somebody's desk

464
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.250
and one or two seconds.
And in the mid eighties,

465
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.050
the way that worked is
you, I would send you

466
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.640
an email and it would
show up and, you know,

467
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.920
on your computer in 24
hours, right. We would, we

468
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.800
would, For those of us
that were, were, were children

469
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.830
at the time, in, in
that time, in the late

470
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.150
eighties, I was still a
kid. I would try to

471
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.790
call as far as I
could, without making a long

472
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:03.920
distance call exact. So for
the cheap, the cheap amongst

473
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.830
us, basically we would call,
we would, we would figure

474
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.100
out what's the farthest East
that I could call. And

475
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.710
for me, I think it
was Walla Walla, Washington. And

476
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.540
I would call a bulletin
board in Walla Walla, which

477
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.820
was the fight on it.
No, that wasn't long distance.

478
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.030
And then we would bounce
ourselves around the country a

479
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.830
little bit at a time
at two in the morning

480
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.890
without actually making a long
distance call. And that was

481
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.250
about the most amazing thing
ever. But these addresses that

482
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.620
we were using were FIDOnet
addresses and we were talking

483
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.460
to FIDOnet forums. So we
weren't quite on the internet

484
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.660
yet. And then in Portland,
the, the big bulletin board

485
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.020
system around Portland, which was
Northwest computer support. And they

486
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.560
were like the 700 pound
gorilla. I actually visited their

487
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.530
offices once. And they had
like 32 modems and a

488
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.510
whole room dedicated to this.
And we, you know, we,

489
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.040
little guy couldn't compete and
they hooked up FIDOnet to

490
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.860
the internet and then started
giving their users for, I

491
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.910
think it was like $5
a month, a free NW

492
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:07.310
cs.org email address. And they
bridged TCP IP and FIDOnet

493
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.340
and suddenly things got really
interesting. And we were bulletin

494
00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.920
board people, which were kind
of like, it was the

495
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.810
alt net we're on the
actual net, which before was

496
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:22.630
really only college students and
scientists and rich people. Yeah.

497
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.760
Just bring back a lot
of memories. I really do.

498
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.660
And, and what was amazing
was just like you said,

499
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.140
that the, the whole BBS
community figured out a way

500
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.560
to start wiring all these
PBS together without really ever

501
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.370
making a long distance call.
And, but it was, but

502
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.410
it also was the very
first time you could actually

503
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:46.270
have really message boards that
could have different themes to

504
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.690
them. And then those message
boards could be active worldwide.

505
00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.960
And so when you look
at the social aspect of

506
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.200
what, what bolts and board
systems were really doing back,

507
00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:00.430
you know, in, in the,
the mid nineties, you know,

508
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:05.050
early or late eighties or
early nineties, it's truly amazing

509
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.570
to see, you know, they
really were the first social

510
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.590
network, you know, that at
least that's my opinion. Yeah.

511
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.630
I think that the point
that you made earlier about

512
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.590
how comfortable you were getting
to know these people and

513
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.480
that they, they made you
feel welcomed, and this was

514
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.200
25 years ago and still
computer culture was such that

515
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.900
you could ask questions and
not necessarily feel like a

516
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.930
huge newb because people would
welcome you with open arms

517
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.800
and say, here's somebody trying
to do something cool. Yeah.

518
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.050
And there wasn't really, I
mean, even though there was

519
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.600
people were competing, there was
so many bolts and boards

520
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.330
now that people were starting
to, you know, to compete

521
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:43.630
in the early nineties and
mid nineties, just, you know,

522
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.500
of natural competition, people wanting
to have a better BBS

523
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.700
and their neighbor. It was
a friendly competition. Most PBS

524
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.950
is when they, when they
met a new, a new

525
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.700
Sasabe would, you know, would
go over to their house

526
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.410
and help them set it
up. I mean, I, I

527
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.860
helped multiple people set up
ultim board systems and, and

528
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.560
you know, my, another, another
guy we brought into the

529
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.830
company, Rick hemming, we met
him because he was running

530
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.180
a, another bulletin board system
product called our, which stood

531
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.710
for remote volts board system.
And he was running that

532
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.710
product and that's how, how
we met. And he ended

533
00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:24.240
up being another partner at
Mustang and, and, you know,

534
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.760
really helped us take the
company to the next level

535
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.370
as well. So, and that
was all because of just

536
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.400
friendships that were made. And,
and then, then the Sasabe

537
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.370
get togethers at Comdex. And,
and then, you know, the

538
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:39.600
industry started creating its own
user conferences and everything. And,

539
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:44.430
and it was, it was
an interesting, and, and kind

540
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.880
of a memorable time really
of my life to, to

541
00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:57.230
remember all those folks that
came to those meetings. It

542
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.990
took a dive. So we
did, as I said, we

543
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.110
saw the, we saw the
incoming and in 95, when

544
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.330
we were actually at that
Comdex and we saw Netscape,

545
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.280
I mean, we knew, we
knew at that point, the

546
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.310
world was changing. I mean,
that was, that was the

547
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:13.730
tip of the iceberg was,
was it that the world

548
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.910
was changing and I don't,
I don't know. And Jim

549
00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.260
can correct me if I'm
wrong. I don't think we

550
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.290
realized how big the change
was going to be and

551
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.890
how fast the change was
going to come. But Mustang

552
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.220
software, fortunately, to kind of
do the short end of

553
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.570
the stick is as that
industry started to decline, we

554
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.750
internally looked at ourselves and
said, okay, we know this

555
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.820
is gonna, we see this
declining. Now let's go, let's

556
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.870
go find another niche to
go build an industry in.

557
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.200
And so that initial that
we built, what we did

558
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.180
internally as a company, this
is kind of interesting to

559
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.300
some people, is we basically
a, the company kind of

560
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.210
scaled down after the industry,
the industry started slowing down

561
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.020
and we took our development
team and, and basically just

562
00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.030
cut it up into four
pieces and said, here's, we

563
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.660
went in there and, and,
and put four ideas on

564
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.410
a whiteboard and cut the
company in four pieces and

565
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.510
said, we're going to have
a snippet of people work

566
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.270
on each of these four
things. And one of the

567
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.690
four things I got to
give Jim credit for this,

568
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.110
this is, this was his
idea was, you know, as

569
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.630
the internet starting to spin
up and people are getting

570
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.980
online, you know, on the
net. Now email was becoming

571
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.180
a big issue. So let's,
let's say you're a company

572
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.880
and you're, you're, you're selling
your product on the internet.

573
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.810
And imagine how many emails
you must get. So suddenly

574
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.060
you were gone from brick
and mortar to, we have

575
00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.850
an online webpage and we're
selling our products on the,

576
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:46.780
and we're getting a 500
messages an hour via email

577
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.290
asking questions. And, and when
we were, when we were,

578
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.620
when we were supporting wild
cat, at one point, our

579
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.140
support group had, we, we
added an aspect of call

580
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.690
center, which is one of
these call center. Things that

581
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.480
as the, as a, as
the phone call, spin in,

582
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.640
as people are calling for
technical support, we had a

583
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.040
board on the wall that
showed how many people were

584
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.010
in queue, the longest it's
in queue. And Jim came

585
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.320
up with the crazy idea
of doing that for email.

586
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.390
You know, what if a
thousand emails are coming in

587
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.160
an hour, how do you
handle that? How do you

588
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.590
make sure you, your, your
employees answered every one of

589
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.330
those? And so one of
those ideas, one of those

590
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.030
four ideas was a product
called internet message center. And

591
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.910
what it basically did is
they would take your emails

592
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.850
and put them into a
queue. And as soon as

593
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.400
the email came in, it
was sending the user response

594
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.890
back saying, Hey, we've got
your email. Here's a, here's

595
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.040
a ticket number. If you
don't get a response within

596
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.650
24 hours, call back or
email back and give us

597
00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.450
your ticket number, and we
can find out where your

598
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.790
request went. And what would
happen on the other end

599
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.280
is, is that the email
would go into a queue.

600
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.230
All the users in the,
in the, in the support

601
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.820
group would run in a
little, little app that on

602
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.310
their, on their desktop that
shows the cues, how many

603
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:52.750
messages were in the queue.
As soon as they were

604
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.640
done with a message, they
click a button on that

605
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.620
interface. And the next email
comes through onto their desktop.

606
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.320
And all of this is
being tracked and stored and

607
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.880
stuff. So we can, you
know, just like a call

608
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.840
center, redo this, we're doing
this for email. So, you

609
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.160
know, let's say you did
call and say, I haven't

610
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.800
got a response in 24
hours as the admin of

611
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.270
the support group. I could
go look up with that

612
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.070
tracking number and say, okay,
well, the email came into

613
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:18.970
our email server at three
o'clock in the afternoon, Joe

614
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.770
and John both looked at
it and they have not

615
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.010
sent a response yet. We
could actually see the entire

616
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.430
history of the conversations and
stuff. And so we actually

617
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.870
rebuilt Mustang around this product.
So we didn't actually get

618
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.870
out before, you know, the,
the, the fall of this

619
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.740
industry, but we actually reinvented
the company before that industry,

620
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.940
you know, perished. Right. Yeah.
And kind of winding down

621
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.450
rewinding a little bit. So
in 95, and as Scott

622
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.090
mentioned in November of 95,
we're at condex. And one

623
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.850
of the things our company
always did was instead of

624
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.820
taking our sales and marketing
people to Comdex, I loaded

625
00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.370
up all of our programmers
and engineers, because I wanted

626
00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:59.820
them to actually work in
the booth and connect with

627
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.070
the customers. Cause then when
customers would walk up and

628
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.230
go, why do you do
this, this isn't, you know,

629
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.000
this isn't very smart. I
would do it this way.

630
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.670
To me. I was one
of our programmers hearing those

631
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.610
comments and not the sales
and marketing team. So it

632
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.590
was always nice to get
the programmers kind of out

633
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.650
of the office for a
week as well, and, and

634
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.280
let them, you know, kind
of regenerate their, their batteries.

635
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.310
And so when we saw
Netscape, catty-corner chests and conduct

636
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.070
November of 95, I, as
Scott mentioned, I had all

637
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.410
the programmers kind of go
through. And, and the, the

638
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.010
thing that amazed us is,
you know, it wasn't about

639
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.670
the BVS anymore. It wasn't,
it wasn't about, you know,

640
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.940
with DBS is it was
your, you were calling into

641
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.320
a specific location to look
at their content. And what,

642
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.670
what the worldwide web brought
with with, with the, the

643
00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:53.150
browsing technology was really more
about content. It was, it

644
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.090
wasn't about where the content
was located. It was about

645
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.100
the content period, and the
fact that you could put

646
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.860
multiple links of content on
one page and make it,

647
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.650
make it graphical. Even though
the BBS industry was moving

648
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.950
to a more graphical platform
at that time, it was

649
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.650
still, you know, all of
the information was, was on

650
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.670
that particular bulletin board system.
And so, you know, when,

651
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.950
as soon as we noticed
that, Hey, it's not going

652
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.770
to be about the BVS
anymore. It's all you know,

653
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.730
or where the server is
located. It's really about the

654
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.520
content we knew that the
end was going to be

655
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.600
near. We, I don't think
we anticipated that, that within

656
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.570
a year, our entire product
line would be eradicated, which

657
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:36.110
is, which is Scott, how
quickly it happened. I mean,

658
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.930
we went from being on
top of the world in

659
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.490
November of 95 to, you
know, to ha you know,

660
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:46.430
having very little, you know,
very few customers in November

661
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.940
of 96, which is when
we started developing these four

662
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.660
products that Scott Hunter just just
mentioned. And so within a

663
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.770
year, we went from having
53,000 bolts and board systems

664
00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.610
to probably I'd say under
5,000, it happened that quick

665
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.680
as people migrated to the
worldwide web. Wow, that is

666
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.160
crazy. And I wonder if
there would have been a

667
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.000
way this is all hindsight
is 2020 blogs really hadn't

668
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.670
happened yet, but to, to
have turned Wildcat into a

669
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.700
content management system of, of
the storage to move the

670
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.870
BBS to the web. Well,
we spent 96 kind of

671
00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:26.170
doing that. We came out
with a product called Annihilator,

672
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.950
which was our, our Wildcat,
a bulletin board system that

673
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:33.400
had it's. We, we, we
acquired a product called Q

674
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.310
modem, which was a communications
product, and we kind of

675
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:41.290
built our own browser, a
web browser into that platform

676
00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:45.880
that would talk specifically to
Wildcat bulletin board systems. And

677
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.280
so the first thing we,
we try to do, because

678
00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.800
we just, you know, we
honestly didn't think the world

679
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.350
wide web would take off
that quickly. We knew we

680
00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:56.440
had 53,000 Wildcat systems out
there, and we knew we

681
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.890
had, you know, hundreds of
thousands of people, if not

682
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.460
millions of people using those
53,000 systems. And so we,

683
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.230
the first thing we try
to do is put a,

684
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.520
you know, a web based
interface into our queue modem

685
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.420
product to connect to these
systems. But the technology was

686
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:18.220
just starting to evolve so
quickly that, that, you know,

687
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.130
we'd just, it was just
trying to stay above water.

688
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.490
And that the thing that
Scott Hunter and I laugh about

689
00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:26.950
today is when you think
about bulletin board systems, well,

690
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.940
you know, we had chat
in Wildcat and you remember

691
00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.150
when people would, would join
into Mo when you had

692
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:37.950
a multi-user BBS, people would
go into chat. You know,

693
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:43.290
that was when we saw
aim, come out with American

694
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.290
online instant messaging come out.
We were like, Oh, crap,

695
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.360
we missed that one. You
know, cause we had, we

696
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.540
had instant messaging in Wildcat.
And then, you know, when

697
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.540
Yahoo groups, you know, first
appeared, we were like, Oh

698
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.390
crap, we missed that one.
We had groups in Wildcat,

699
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.130
you know? And so every
turn we were kind of

700
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.130
like, we were like, Oh
man, there's little bits and

701
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.910
pieces of Wildcat being used
on the internet now. And

702
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.310
just, just one little facet
of it and they're, and

703
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.610
they're becoming so popular. And
so it was, it was

704
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.530
kind of an interesting time
for us to sit back

705
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:16.740
and watch kind of bits
and pieces of Wildcat being,

706
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.150
being redeployed on the internet
as a single application and,

707
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.780
and, and other people were,
were, were benefiting from that.

708
00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.910
And we were like, well,
we missed that one. We

709
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:29.190
missed that one, but you
know, but we did well

710
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.310
with, you know, with internet
message center was, it was

711
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.410
a huge success for us.
So, you know, we got

712
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.660
something right. But there was
a lot of other things

713
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.390
that we of, you know,
kick ourselves about because we'd

714
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.780
created some white papers about,
about deploying some of those

715
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.300
features of, of Wildcat on
the net. And we just

716
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.300
never, it never bubbled up
enough for us to spend

717
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.440
any R and D time.
We actually just said, we

718
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.980
actually talked about taking the
instant messaging out of Wildcat

719
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.380
and making a standalone product
that would have been AOL

720
00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:02.060
messenger or innocent messenger or
ICQ or ICQ. I mean,

721
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.970
we talked, as Jim said,
it was like, like two

722
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.890
or three years in a
row, we were watching all

723
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:09.590
these, these things phenomenons happen
over the internet. We're like

724
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.450
going God, we did that.
We just never did rip

725
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:15.320
it out of the BBS
and, and, and ended up

726
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.330
on the internet. And as
Jim said, we actually had

727
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.850
a product called wind server.
It was code name, the

728
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.410
code name for it was
Annihilator, which was actually a

729
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.260
version of Wildcat that had
an HTP server in it.

730
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.990
So it sits or webpages
it, you could tell it

731
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:31.490
into it. And so, you
know, if once you were

732
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.560
on the internet, you could
actually use Telnet to sign

733
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.690
in and get to get
the old modem interface via

734
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:41.480
Telnet. We actually even had
an internet client very similar

735
00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.640
to what AOL was when
AOL first came out of

736
00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.130
a thick line. You know,
you install this client on

737
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:49.790
your desktop and you get
this application. And, and when

738
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.580
you use this application to
connect to a Wildcat internet

739
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.270
wind server, and when you
do, you know, it looks

740
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.920
just like the AOL does.
So at one point we

741
00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.000
actually were going around saying,
Hey, we'll, we'll sell you

742
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.320
a mini AOL because we
have the client and the

743
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.990
server piece. But, you know,
as Jim said that, I

744
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.460
don't know if it was
just because we were so

745
00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.770
BVS centric at the time
that each of our solutions

746
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.620
around that area were still
just too tied to the

747
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.630
BBS. We never ripped them
all apart. And as a

748
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:21.950
result, as a collection, they,
they didn't do well. But,

749
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.830
you know, the, the, as,
as Jim said, and the

750
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.020
story I was telling earlier,
the internet message center stuff

751
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:32.810
was, was wildly popular. And
that's, that's what eventually led

752
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.320
us out of that space
was, you know, our was

753
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.640
purchased For that product. So
you guys changed your name

754
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.800
from Mustang software to mustang.com,
right? Yes, that's correct. Yeah,

755
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.350
that's correct. That was back
when, you know, we, we

756
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.320
had to kind of reinvent
the company because remember we

757
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.620
were public and all of
a sudden within that 12

758
00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.460
month period where the BBS
market just got absolutely just

759
00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.860
erratic had to figure out
a way to, to reinvent

760
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:03.660
the company. And so part
of that was a name

761
00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.010
change, and I just could
not let go of, of

762
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.720
the name Mustang. And so,
you know, our board of

763
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.270
directors talked and talked and
we finally just said, let's,

764
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.020
let's go to mustang.com and
let's, let's release our new

765
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.780
web based products underneath that
name and part of our

766
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.750
reinventing the company. And so
that's why we changed the

767
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.600
name. Well, then a couple
of months later, you merged

768
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.720
with Quintess right. And then
that got bought by Avaya.

769
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.870
Is there anything left of
Mustang software? Yeah, I know

770
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.990
that the, the, some of
the code is being used

771
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:40.590
in vias contact management application.
So, you know, the reason

772
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.620
why they bought us is,
is they had call center

773
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:48.900
technology already. They had fax
inbound fax technology to manage

774
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.670
that in the call center.
They just didn't have the

775
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.670
email piece. So now, you
know, they can have one

776
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.090
person sitting at a console
and a phone call comes

777
00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:00.630
in, you know, the phone
is delivered to their headset

778
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.840
and a screen pop, you
know, with the user's total

779
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.300
account information is in front
of them. Or if an

780
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:11.130
email pops in, you know,
like the, you know, sales@nordstrom.com,

781
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.140
then the same thing it's,
you know, that message is,

782
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.840
you know, pops on their
screen. Their phone is automatically

783
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.670
put in a busy state
and they're, you know, they're

784
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.180
measured on how quickly they
can answer that email. And

785
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.050
there's a database of answers.
We built a natural language

786
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.740
engine that would automatically read
and scan the message and

787
00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.890
then pop up paragraphs so
that the agent could just

788
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.670
drag and drop right into
those reply messages. So, so

789
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.540
now a person using the
Avaya contact center can, can

790
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.610
handle a phone, a fax
and email coming into that,

791
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:47.190
that contact center. Hmm it's
it's it must be, it

792
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.880
must be strange to look
back and, and have it

793
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.110
be gone. I mean, I
still kind of miss PBS

794
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.180
is a little bit, and
then, you know, I don't

795
00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.060
know, it's almost like it
was all a dream if

796
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.800
that's kind of a funny
way to mention it though,

797
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.450
but I mean, it was,
it was a five or

798
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.180
10 year period there where
as a user of a

799
00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.670
BBS, whereas as a resume
person that ran a BVS,

800
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.830
it was just like, we
thought that was the pinnacle,

801
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.150
you know, it was just
going to get better and

802
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:15.210
better. I definitely didn't see
the internet coming in in

803
00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.180
any way. The part that
I miss the most about

804
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.030
it, and I don't know
why is the internet different?

805
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.650
It might just be because
there's more people on it

806
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.320
was, you know, I remember
in 85 when we ran

807
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.130
into DBS, especially early in
the BBS, BBS has got

808
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.290
a little darker, I should
say, as time went on,

809
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.400
it was amazing just how
nice people were, how Nice

810
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.880
the community was. You know,
you look at the, you

811
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.490
look at the websites today
and, and the blogs and

812
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.580
the, and the comments and
stuff and, and the negativity

813
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.730
and, and stuff like that.
And, you know, God, in

814
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.420
1985, if you went somewhere,
nobody would call you stupid.

815
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:54.110
Nobody said you were dumb
for running something. You know,

816
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.030
how can I help you
I'll come to your house

817
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.890
and help. It was just,
it was a different time.

818
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.220
That's the part of it
that I missed the, The

819
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.330
whole concept of flames and
flaming and, and, you know,

820
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.590
which is when you're being
negative to somebody on a

821
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.260
message board really didn't start
till about 91. That's when

822
00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.440
that whole concept of flames
and, and people started getting

823
00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.730
used to using real anonymous
names and hiding behind these

824
00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.760
anonymous names. And I think
you're right, Scott, it, it,

825
00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.910
before that period of time,
it was, it was more

826
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:27.880
of just, you know, full
disclosure and being in, and

827
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.690
really just being helpful because,
you know, you had back

828
00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.240
then had to be really
kind of a, you know,

829
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.310
an expert in their own
mind. And there was really,

830
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.370
you know, besides the books
that we all bought, you

831
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.560
know, there, that was the
only other resource was to

832
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.920
get on these Bolton board
systems and ask questions, you

833
00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.020
know, to figure out how
to write those, how to,

834
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.990
how to edit those config
files and how to use

835
00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.010
dot, you know, how to
use Edlund to edit your,

836
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:57.010
your dos files and, and,
you know, it was, it

837
00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:00.700
was, it was a different
time and, you know, teaching

838
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.910
people how to use these,
how to go in and

839
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:08.320
create automated batch files and
stuff was, was, you know,

840
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.330
just, it was just a
different time as Scott said,

841
00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.490
Yeah, I miss it. That's
what I'm, I don't know

842
00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.010
about to Scott Hanselman, but
I that's what I miss

843
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.480
the most about. It was
just the innocence of it

844
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.940
and how friendly people were.
And, and, you know, as

845
00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.080
you know, it didn't matter
if you were in a

846
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.100
dr. Dos or dos or
stacker, which, you know, various

847
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.290
products of that era, nobody
cared. I mean, it was

848
00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:30.190
just about the community. Well,
there's the slowness of things

849
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:33.970
right now. I'm finding that
the urgency addiction of the

850
00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:35.800
internet is a problem in
the sense of, if I

851
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.800
can't get an answer in
20 minutes, then I start

852
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.770
getting pretty upset. But, you
know, back in the day,

853
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.450
you'd leave a message on
copy server up on a

854
00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:45.310
bulletin board, and you'd sit
around for three or four

855
00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:46.750
days and you'd wonder if
it was going to get

856
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.810
answered. And that was okay.
That could be part of

857
00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:51.190
it. You know, that's, that's,
that's a great point, you

858
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.890
know, today it's so instant,
you know, back in those

859
00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:56.350
days, when you responded to
somebody, you didn't try to

860
00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:59.830
respond, you know, really quickly
anyways. But if a message

861
00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.510
came to me, I'm not
going to go, you guys

862
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.010
need to respond to this
in the next 10 minutes,

863
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:04.960
because the reality is it's
going to take a day

864
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.260
to get to them. So,
you know, I think if

865
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.600
you thought more about the
response and it was a

866
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.880
great industry, and I, like
you said, I still can't

867
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.130
think that, you know, gosh,
it's only been gone for

868
00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.520
what, 15 years now, or
something like that. I mean,

869
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.070
it was amazing how fast
that industry blew up and

870
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.860
then how fast it went
away. And it wasn't that

871
00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.350
long ago, It took us
nine years, you know, really

872
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.210
from, from, you know, when
you think about, you know,

873
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.680
87 to 96, it was,
it was, it was nine

874
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.210
years of, of really just
being focused and trying to

875
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.250
drive that until we really
had to start, you know,

876
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.120
really totally switching and into
another, another gear with the,

877
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.870
with the internet. So I'm
just glad that, you know,

878
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.520
I was a part of
it. I was glad that,

879
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.890
you know, there's a lot
of other people that were

880
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.170
part of it. There was
a leather BBS products that,

881
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.260
that, that challenged us to,
to take it to the

882
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:59.580
next level there, you know,
and, you know, I, I

883
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.890
miss some of those guys
that I competed with back

884
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:05.370
then, the Scott Brinker's of
the world, you know, cause

885
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.680
they really pushed us to
be, to be the best

886
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.340
we possibly could. And our
customers were so loyal. I

887
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.830
mean, you know, when somebody
are running a Wildcat BBS,

888
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.460
they, they, you know, they
really evangelize our product to,

889
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.490
to their friends and help,
help friends set up their

890
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:25.110
own BBS and, you know,
piracy really wasn't a big

891
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.530
problem for us cause people
were proud of, of running

892
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.900
it and you know, it
was a, it was just

893
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.760
a, you know, it's just,
I just think it was

894
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.220
great to be part of
that era and I'm really

895
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.940
happy that I was able
to, to participate in it.

896
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.240
Yeah. That was the other
thing about, you know, when

897
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.790
I talk about the community
and stuff in those days,

898
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.010
I mean our big competitors
where we had there was

899
00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.740
there was PC board, there
was major BBS, which is

900
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.410
the one by Tim striker
that Jim was mentioning, there

901
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:58.880
was a <inaudible>, which was,
which was PBS. We, we

902
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.280
compete very heavily with all
these guys, but at the

903
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.350
same time, you know, we
would go have a beer

904
00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:05.960
with them as well. I
mean, we show up for

905
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.350
a BBS convention and it
was not uncommon to go

906
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.390
to dinner and have a
beer with all those guys.

907
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:13.910
So, you know, even, even
the, the companies that were

908
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.010
fighting in the trenches, in
the, in those, in that

909
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:20.150
space where we're pretty friendly,
well, people can, can go

910
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:23.300
up to Wikipedia and look
for Mustang software. And at

911
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.390
the very bottom of the
Wikipedia article on Mustang, there's

912
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:29.720
an external link to a
book it's a 57 Meg

913
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:33.410
PDF called the history of
Mustang that has a lot

914
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.030
of the detail that we've
talked about. And a lot

915
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.690
of stories and pictures and
information that people who are

916
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:41.450
interested in BVS culture should
definitely check out. And then

917
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:44.930
people should also search the
internet for the, the BBS

918
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:48.500
documentary, which is kind of
the legendary documentary, describing all

919
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.230
things bulletin board and like
these basically someone wandered around

920
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.510
for a year or two
interviewing people from bulletin boards

921
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.610
all over. Did you guys,
are you guys in that

922
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.670
document? Some of our employees
where I was traveling when

923
00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.490
they came by, but a
lot of our, they came

924
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.070
to the Mustang campus and
sat on the couch with

925
00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:09.890
several of our, our engineers
and, and, and actually interviewed

926
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.500
them. So there's some great
clips of, of those folks

927
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.520
in there. Very cool people
can see that@pbsdocumentary.com, there's definitely

928
00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.650
two or three of our
engineers that were involved in

929
00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:23.270
that documentary. You can see
that@bbsdocumentary.com or search for BBS

930
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.850
documentary on Google video, and
that's been released as creative

931
00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.730
common. So you can see
it in multiple parts up

932
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.210
on, up online, or get
a DVD Set. And then

933
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:32.800
both of you guys are
on Twitter now, the new

934
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.560
BBS. So I'll put links
to your Twitter names as

935
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.880
well. Great. Well, we'd love
to love to hear from

936
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.180
people that were ever ran
a bulletin board systems, be

937
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:47.310
sure to send us a
message and I'll look him

938
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:50.160
speak up so we can
see it and bring back

939
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.140
some more memories. No, we
should do. We should make

940
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:56.190
a, we should make a
Facebook group for users, users

941
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.230
in CIS ops of wild
cat software. You should set

942
00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:01.890
that up, Jim. Yeah, I'll
do that. Alright. Well, thanks

943
00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:04.350
so much to her and
Scott Hunter for sitting down and

944
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.230
talking about bulletin boards and
Mustang software. We appreciate all

945
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.480
the work that you guys
did to keep us connected

946
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:13.020
to even 25 years ago.
It's our pleasure and thanks

947
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:17.160
for having us on today.
Thanks God. Another episode of

948
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.350
Hansel minutes, and I'll see
you again next week.
