That's bitly.com/datadog shirt. Hi, this
is Scott Hanselman. This is

10
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.670
another episode of Hansel minutes.
And today I'm talking with

11
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.720
dr. Molly peoples. She is
a associate astronomer at the

12
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.740
space telescope science Institute, and
she's astronom Molly on Twitter.

13
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.600
I'm doing great. How are
you? You're doing all kinds

14
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.880
of stuff and I'm just
enjoying reading about it. I

15
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.910
started@molly.science, kudos for the.science top
level domain. That's pretty amazing.

16
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.300
Yes, very nice. Very nice.
And I just got lost

17
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.630
in the, all the stuff
online that you're doing around

18
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.400
that, that interface of theory
and data, and we're working

19
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.660
on Hubble right now. So
how does that work? This

20
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.300
was launched in 1990. This
is how old, now it's

21
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.650
a 30 year old telescope.
We are coming up on

22
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.240
the 28th, 29th birthday of
it. April. Yeah, it's still

23
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.360
going strong. The last servicing
mission was in 2009 where

24
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.780
they installed to do instruments
and repaired to others. And

25
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.380
we're still getting groundbreaking science
from it. Seriously. Like this

26
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.510
is not to put too
fine a point on it,

27
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.360
but my Apple watch has
more processing power. Does it

28
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.170
not? Yeah. So how is
this old thing still producing

29
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.020
amazing stuff? Is it, is
it really about the physicality

30
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.240
of the mirrors and the
telescope itself and not about

31
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.180
the process? Yeah, that's the
main thing, you know, we

32
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.090
do the most of the
processing of the data here

33
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.250
on the ground. So the
two main things are that

34
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.940
it is the Hubble space
telescope. So it's in space,

35
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.640
it's above the atmosphere of
the earth. And so it's

36
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.520
able, it doesn't have to
look through all of the

37
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.560
air that's in the atmosphere
and so it can get

38
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.700
amazingly chris' pictures. And the
part that I find particularly

39
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.060
relevant for my science is
a lot of my science

40
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.980
requires the ultraviolet and you
can either have UV astronomy

41
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.740
from the ground or life
on earth. So we put

42
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.490
our UV instruments up in
space. Okay. So then if

43
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.100
the atmosphere, the, the, the
atmosphere of the earth is

44
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.120
absorbing or blocking all these
different wavelengths is the Hubble

45
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.210
it all or above the
important parts It's above. Most

46
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.560
of it, Hubble's in a
very weird orbit because it

47
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.990
had to be accessible by
the space shuttle in order

48
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.630
to do the servicing missions.
So it's above the vast

49
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.800
majority of the atmosphere, but
there is still little, little

50
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.890
wisps of it up there,
which is why some of

51
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.030
the future observatories and some
current ones now are going

52
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.610
out to, beyond the orbit
of the moon, where you

53
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.970
really don't have to worry
about anything from the Earth's

54
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.340
atmosphere anymore, but it's harder
to get to if you

55
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.370
want to fix, Okay, well,
350 miles up is a

56
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.400
nontrivial amount of way up,
isn't it? Yeah, but I

57
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.890
mean, that's closer. I'm sitting
here in Baltimore. That's closer

58
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.710
than I am to Boston
right now. So no, that's

59
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.400
a good point. It's closer
than you think. Yeah, it

60
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.860
is closer than you think.
So what is it sending

61
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.050
down? And in what way?
Like, is this just a

62
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.350
stream of texts that we
can listen to? Or can,

63
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.930
can someone with a software
defined radio or their own

64
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.110
thing, like as it passes
by, can we catch what

65
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.400
Hubble's spitting out? I'm not
actually sure. I know I'm

66
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.830
pretty sure it goes to
the deep space network, but

67
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.530
I'm not actually sure of
the details of like how

68
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.520
the raw packets are sit
down, but they're definitely different

69
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.170
levels. And then they get
repackaged at the Goddard space

70
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.100
flight center and sent to
space telescope for final processing.

71
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.030
Okay. So this is the
deep space network is this

72
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.120
worldwide network of like catching
everything that's coming back from

73
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.730
space and then processing it.
And then when you wake

74
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.650
up and go to work
in the morning, how do

75
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.600
you consume this data? Do
you go to a website

76
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.730
or is it sitting in
a file somewhere? So I

77
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.460
basically don't consume the data
cause I'm primarily a theorist,

78
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.170
but the way that one
would do it is it

79
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.420
takes very few hours to
go from the data being

80
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.770
taken on orbit, to being
delivered to the online archives

81
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.880
that we host here at
space telescope, it's called mast

82
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.080
used to be the multi-mission
archive for space telescopes, but

83
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.320
we renamed it, the Mikulski
archive for space telescopes, because

84
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.800
Senator Mikulski was such a
huge advocate for the Hubble

85
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.670
space telescope or the idea
of democratizing science through archive

86
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.030
data. And yeah, it can
take just a few hours

87
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.690
to go from having the
data just be taken and

88
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.960
it's online, ready to be
downloaded and looked at. That's

89
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.540
really interesting. That makes me
realize though, that this isn't

90
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.820
like hidden from us, right?
If you want the data,

91
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.410
if you were an enthusiast,
if you're listening to this

92
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.830
podcast, you don't have to
have special top secret access.

93
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.810
This is just science and
it's out there for people

94
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.790
to consume. Yeah, it's all
out there. And just go

95
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.920
to mass.stsi.edu. Most of the
data we have is from

96
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.340
Hubble, but there are many
other space telescopes. We even

97
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.050
have some data from ground-based
observatories that are there. That

98
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.830
can be, we have quick
look pages and ways to

99
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.290
easily access it. And we
also do a lot of

100
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.550
developing of tools for people
to once they download the

101
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.430
data, to be able to
process that data and analyze

102
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.860
it to try to lower
the bar for access for

103
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.610
people. <inaudible>. Now, when I
asked the question about how

104
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.950
you consumed it, you said
that you're a theorist, but

105
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.810
you kind of also are
you, you live between that

106
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.700
world of theory and that
world of data, maybe you

107
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.430
can help me understand the
roles of people that, what

108
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.260
do you do as a
theorist and how does that

109
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.680
relate to someone who might
be consuming the raw data

110
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.090
and where does that interface?
Yeah, so I mean, the

111
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.620
easy reason why I got
into theory originally is most

112
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.010
astronomy of course, requires going
to the physical telescope and

113
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.750
staying up all night. And
so I joke that I

114
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.000
like sleeping at night, which
is why I like either

115
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.610
theory or, you know, my
telescopes to be in space.

116
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.300
But what I do is
run simulations of the universe

117
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.240
and where I actually know
what's going on. So for

118
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.080
example, if you take a
picture of a galaxy with

119
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.570
Hubble, it's beautiful. And, but
it's also a huge mess.

120
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.620
And you want to know
things like how quickly is

121
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.050
this galaxy forming stars? How
far away is this galaxy?

122
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.810
How old is this galaxy?
How much gas does this

123
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.880
galaxy have? Things like that.
And instead what you get

124
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.200
are a bunch of photons
that have different wavelengths and

125
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.010
different positions on your detector.
And somehow you want to

126
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.320
answer all of those questions,
you know, based on that

127
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.490
distribution of light. Whereas if
I make a simulation, I

128
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.840
know to start with our
priori, I know I can

129
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.480
just measure in the simulation.
Well, I just warmed this

130
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.880
many stars in the last
mini million years. And therefore

131
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.160
this is the rate I'm
forming stars at. I can

132
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.710
draw a sphere around my
galaxy and say, ah, this

133
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.450
is how much gas is
in there. This is how

134
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.690
many stars are in there.
So what I like to

135
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:10.240
do is create synthetic data
from the simulations that look

136
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.810
as much like the real
data as possible that I

137
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:19.000
can then treat like the
real data and use to

138
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.550
interpret the real data. So
I can, for example, say

139
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.610
if I make this measurement
on the real data, am

140
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.400
I actually measuring what I
think I'm measuring? Is there

141
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.580
a bias or systematic in
that measurement that I'm not

142
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.690
aware of? And if I
get the measurement out from

143
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.140
the simulation that I know
is the underlying physical conditions,

144
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.870
it's a lot easier to
believe that measurement on the

145
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.760
real data Does. And forgive
my ignorance ahead of time.

146
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.770
I've been there, basically everything
that I'm going to ask,

147
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.390
but how does one avoid
a kind of scientific confirmation

148
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.860
bias where you convince yourself
that something is by working

149
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:01.160
backwards or you just always
questioning your assumptions? Yeah, definitely.

150
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.780
It's so one of the
ways that people will often

151
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.040
use simulations is to say,
well, if I measure the

152
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.180
same thing, like say the
same distribution of galaxy masses

153
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.120
in this simulation, as I
mentioned the observations, then that

154
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.460
must mean that whatever physical
models I have in the

155
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.080
simulation are correct. That's where
you can definitely run into

156
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.520
confirmation bias. And I've definitely
seen claims out there in

157
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.890
the literature that, you know,
say, Oh, I made this,

158
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.560
you know, we got this
scaling relation, correct to these

159
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.440
galaxy properties. Correct. And therefore
our models are correct. And

160
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.020
you look at their models
and you're like, yes, but

161
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.220
your models are unphysical in
the following five ways. What

162
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.410
I prefer to do is
turn the problem, look at

163
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.000
it from the other side
and say, well, if I'm

164
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.040
able to make a universe,
that's close to realistic that,

165
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.050
you know, may not be
perfect in the following, you

166
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.070
know, 27 ways, but it's
close enough to realistic that

167
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.160
the data have vague, you
know, that the statistical properties

168
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.980
of the data are close
enough that I can use

169
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.060
it to test my measurement
methods or inform my measurement

170
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.730
methods on the real data.
Then that means that I

171
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.860
can actually go out and
make those measurements on the

172
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.200
real data and learn about
the real universe that way.

173
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.920
Okay. Are these, are these,
I presume these are tiny

174
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.530
universes. Are these universes that
you are assimilating that are

175
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.290
limited only by your compute
and memory? I mean, everything

176
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.480
I do is limited by
my compute and memory and

177
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.170
hard drive space. Yeah. So
there are two kinds that

178
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.880
we, we do for these
kind of cosmological scale simulations.

179
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.410
One is you pick some
volume that Scott, you know,

180
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.820
hundreds, thousands of galaxies in
it. And you start with

181
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.660
the universe was very, very
young and you let it

182
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.530
evolve hopefully for 13 or
14 billion years until it gets

183
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.430
to today. Or you say,
Oh, you know, the James Webb

184
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.190
space telescope that's launching in
a few years is gonna

185
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.620
be really good at looking
at the early universe. And,

186
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.330
you know, that just happens
to only be a few

187
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.700
billion years, you know? So
it's a shorter amount of

188
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.040
time that you have to
let the compute the computation

189
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.800
run for, or there you
have to make like a

190
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.850
statistical measurement of all the
galaxies everywhere in this volume.

191
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.970
But the tradeoff there is
that what you probably have

192
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:29.270
not resolved those galaxies very
well. So because you're spreading

193
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.320
the computation, computational power out
everywhere and the whole volume.

194
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.160
So you can do statistical
things, but they may or

195
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.350
may not actually be based
on that kind of data.

196
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.120
The other thing you can
do is say, well, there's

197
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.520
this one galaxy that I
really want to track its

198
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.610
evolution for. And so I'm
going to embed it in

199
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.400
a full cosmological volume and
get like the large scale

200
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.960
gravity, the large scale gout
gas flows that matter for

201
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.630
the evolution of this one
galaxy. And then I'm going

202
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.640
to just pour all of
my computational resources into really,

203
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.480
really, really resolving the small
scale structure of what that

204
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.450
galaxy is doing through time.
So I've been mostly doing

205
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.900
the latter, but the general
game is you kind of

206
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.990
do both. Then you figure
out what the differences are

207
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.790
and try to bridge the
gap to get the full

208
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.790
statistical volume. So this, this
analogy may not work, but

209
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.970
it feels to me like
it's the, it's the cosmological

210
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.520
equivalent of if a galaxy
falls in the woods, does

211
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.470
it make a sound you're
focusing on the one you're

212
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.750
looking at and the ones
that you're not looking at,

213
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.510
you kind of allied or
you yada yada yada, over

214
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.980
those things. Yeah. And it's
basically because gravity is really

215
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.930
nice like that, that on
large scales, if you're very

216
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.330
far away from something you
don't care about, the small

217
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.710
scale structure of what that
thing is doing gravitationally, you

218
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.540
just care about what the
center of mass of that

219
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.230
thing is doing. So you
can resolve it in these,

220
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.450
we call them zooms when
you're zooming in on a

221
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:05.070
single galaxy, the stuff that
is very, very far away

222
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.950
from that galaxy, you don't
have to add much computational

223
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.710
power to, in order to
get the relevant parts of

224
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.840
it from it. Correct. Okay.
Okay. So just like in

225
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.880
a video game, when you
get closer to something that's

226
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.490
far away, the textures get
more and more and more

227
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.550
resolved and you start to
care and by observing them,

228
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.790
you care more and that
forces it to resolve itself.

229
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.970
Interesting. And then how big
are these things? Are we

230
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.980
talking about, I mean, like
talk about it in the

231
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.180
sense of compute and memory
and, and where you find

232
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.510
that you are limited. Yeah.
So they kind of range

233
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:42.150
a lot. So actually the
outputs that are refined everywhere,

234
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.640
large volume, try to get
the hundreds and thousands of

235
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.280
galaxies. We have a bunch
that we've been trying to

236
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.700
move over from the blue
water supercomputer to here in

237
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.090
both trying to copy those
over from, from Illinois here

238
00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:04.230
in Paltz to Baltimore. And
they're like 130 gigabytes each,

239
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.570
which doesn't sound like much,
but we have a few

240
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.360
hundred of them. So, I
mean, I think the total

241
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.240
volume that we have of
that one is about a

242
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.950
petabyte. So we won't be
able to keep all of

243
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.180
the data. And so we
have to kind of figure

244
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.190
out like, all right, which
of these outputs are actually

245
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.250
important. Do we actually want
to keep longterm? So I

246
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.500
think we're going to probably
just keep like, you know,

247
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.030
maybe about a hundred terabytes
of it, the smaller versions

248
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.570
that we have, again, can
really depend on how you

249
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.680
do the resolution. So one
way to think about it

250
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:41.850
is for every say parcel
of gas in the volume,

251
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:49.410
you have a 3d position,
a 3d velocity, a something

252
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.590
that's tracking its composition. Basically
you have like a temperature

253
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.970
and energy. So at the
very least you have an,

254
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.010
I'm probably missing one of
the relevant parameters. You have

255
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.550
eight parameters that you're trying
to keep too, depending on

256
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.210
how you ran it double
or flip precision. So multiply

257
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.230
a lot. And if you've
got 10 to the eight

258
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.530
resolution elements, you're easily running,
you know, 25 gigabytes per

259
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.620
output for those. So the
zooms can be a lot

260
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.370
smaller, but they're still pretty
meaty. And so if you're

261
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.620
trying to do analysis on
them, you really want a

262
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.360
large Ram machine. And I'm
looking at the blue waters

263
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.270
website here. And just to
give folks that may not

264
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.310
be familiar a little bit
of context, it says more

265
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.370
than a head, a bite
and a half of memory,

266
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.660
25 petabytes of disk storage
and 500 petabytes of tape

267
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.640
storage. And this is just
from a website a couple

268
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.100
of years old. So who
knows if it's been beefed

269
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.980
up since then, it's, this
is not just a fire

270
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.080
up a few virtual machines
in the cloud type of

271
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.000
a problem that we're trying
to solve. Yeah. And blue

272
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.540
waters was actually slated to
go offline and March it

273
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.450
they've already got plant. Like
it's, it's all, it's on

274
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.610
its way out. We actually
got an email this week

275
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.010
saying that they're going to
keep it plugged in until

276
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.870
December, which is very exciting,
but it's definitely kind of

277
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.910
the older, older generation, right?
Yeah. So this is something

278
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.590
that's quite a few years
old and now you're moving

279
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.530
on to the next giant
supercomputer. Yeah. And unfortunately the

280
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.760
newer versions that are being
made, they really like putting

281
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.090
lots and lots of cores
on a single node. And

282
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:32.050
so for a fixed amount
of memory per node, you

283
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:37.150
end up with a lot
less memory per core, which

284
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.440
makes them very inefficient for,
for these kinds of, of

285
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.100
simulations, which is very sad.
So, so what you care

286
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.050
about more is about holding
all these things in memory

287
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.570
and processing on it. You're
less interested in the parallelism.

288
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.810
Well, no, the parallelism is
very important, but just with

289
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.140
the given the architecture that
is out there, we usually

290
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.490
end up memory limited. So
for example, the computer that

291
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.950
I use the most is
NASA Pleiades computer. And it's

292
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.080
got a bunch of different
nodes to choose from, but

293
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.120
it'll be, you know, about
128 gigabytes per node. So

294
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.950
maybe four to five gigabytes
per core. So depending on

295
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.830
whether or not you have
the hyperthreading on, you know,

296
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:27.820
it can be like a
28 to 32 cores, the

297
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.680
new stampede two machine that's
at the Texas computing center.

298
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.730
They have these knowns that
are 68 cores per node

299
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.610
and only have 96 gigabytes
per node. So the, the

300
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.980
Ram per core is like
ridiculously small. And so you

301
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.960
have to use a whole
bunch of nodes in order

302
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.910
to get up to the
number of cores that you

303
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.720
need to do the calculation
and nerded to still have

304
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.570
everything in memory. And it
just all get shot very

305
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:59.240
quickly. Yeah. I'm looking at
the, I'm looking at the

306
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.660
Pleiades website and the stampede
website, and it's very interesting.

307
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.910
It's all about trade offs.
Like one of them has

308
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.670
a quarter petabyte of memory
and one of them's got

309
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.610
upwards of a petabyte of
memory, but then fewer cores

310
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.260
and you go back and
forth, one's got a half

311
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.420
million cores. One has a
quarter million, which one's the

312
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.940
right for your problem. Yeah.
And a lot of it

313
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.620
is also for a given
piece of code. How well

314
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.950
does it actually scale to
lots and lots? Of course.

315
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.620
So the code that I
actually use for my simulations

316
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:36.320
is called Enzo. And it
was originally written in 1996.

317
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.100
And this is definitely the
power of open source programming.

318
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.540
It's one of the few
cosmological simulation codes. That's still

319
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.180
going strong because many people
have contributed to the code

320
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.910
base over the years, but
it just has a fundamental

321
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.470
limitation that it just does
not scale well to more

322
00:18:54.470 --> 00:19:01.040
than about a thousand course.
And so the main developers

323
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.280
of that code have completely
started from scratch, hired an

324
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.480
actual computer scientist who knows
how to write code and

325
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.790
rewritten it in a language
that's going to be better

326
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.260
for scaling it to two
more code cores. And we

327
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.950
think that it'll actually be
able to scale perfectly up

328
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.900
to something the size of
a blue waters, which will

329
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.540
be very, very exciting. So
that means that at a

330
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.810
fixed resolution and amount of
computing power, you can do

331
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.810
that same thing, but over
a much, much, much larger

332
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.810
volume. What is the name
of the next thing beyond

333
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.670
Enzo? Is it going to
be into version two or

334
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.850
something else? It can be
Enzo E where he is

335
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.870
for Exoscale. It was called
SOP for a while, but

336
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.780
then it became more ambitious
as we went from pentascale

337
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.990
Texas scale. Wow. It's so
interesting as a software engineer

338
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.390
to hear about these entire
worlds and entire projects that

339
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.370
people depend on and they
use every day and these

340
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.560
problems that you're trying to
solve. Well, a lot of

341
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.300
us are just out here
trying to get JavaScript to

342
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.580
work on our shopping carts.
It just puts everything into

343
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:05.600
perspective. Hey folks, you're a
very good developer, probably regardless.

344
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.510
You do write bugs. That's
unavoidable. What is affordable is

345
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.060
wasting time trying to track
down the cause of those

346
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.530
bugs century.io provides full stack
error tracking that lets you

347
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.650
monitor and fix problems. In
real time, you can see

348
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.410
the severity and the scope
of the error get immediate

349
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.200
access to the stack, trace,
connect the problem to the

350
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.650
commit that caused it and
fix it without delay century.

351
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.870
It's a name so common
that they have to include

352
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.970
the top level domain in
their advertising to make sure

353
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:38.630
you remember it. century.io, that's
century.io, open source, full stack,

354
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.320
web apps, native apps, mobile
games, smart oven mitts. If

355
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.170
you can program it, they
can make it far easier

356
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.190
to fix any errors you
encounter with your code may

357
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.740
be broken. Let's fix it
together, visit century.io. What I'm

358
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.230
looking at, some papers that
you've written and some spaces

359
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.410
that you explore. And I'm
trying to understand what the

360
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:06.330
galactic, the, the collective media
circumgalactic medium. Yeah. Certainly like

361
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.220
to meeting him is awesome.
It's like the most awesome

362
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.640
thing you've never heard of.
Yeah. So the way that

363
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.410
galaxy forms, so galaxy like
our Milky way, right? Basically

364
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:20.280
what galaxies do is they
turn gas into stars, right?

365
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.240
And then stars like to
blow up when they die.

366
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.990
So they return a lot
of that material back to

367
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.130
the galaxy. That's the basic
thing that galaxy spent all

368
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.260
their time doing, making stars
and then starts dying and

369
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.980
blowing up. Now two pieces
of that is one. They

370
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.320
have to get the gas
from somewhere. They just don't

371
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.500
have it to start with.
And to when these huge

372
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.240
explosions go off the, that
material is usually not gravitationally

373
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.090
bound to the galaxy. It's
not going to stay in

374
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.310
the galaxy. It's going to
go outside of the galaxy.

375
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.560
So the circumgalactic medium is
what we call all of

376
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:05.460
the gas that is roughly
gravitationally bound to the dark

377
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.630
matter halo that the galaxy
resides in, but is not

378
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.240
in the galactic disc itself.
It's so it's not where

379
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.880
the stars are. So to
give you a sense of

380
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.710
scale, we in the earth
are about eight kiloparsecs away

381
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.580
from the center of our
galaxy. A kill a parsec

382
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.740
is a thousand parsecs. A
parsec is 3.2 lighters. The

383
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.640
radius of the dark matter
halo that we're living in

384
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.550
is 300 kilo parsecs. So
our galaxy is a very,

385
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:44.970
very, very small fraction volumetrically
of this entire volume. So,

386
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.470
okay. So the two things
that we've known for a

387
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.980
long time are that one,
most of the gas that

388
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.730
you would expect to be
in this dark matter, halo

389
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.450
is not in the galaxies.
The galaxies are very inefficient

390
00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.210
at turning all of the
gas that's in the halo

391
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.030
into stars, depending on the
mass, the galaxy, it can

392
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.390
be like from only five
to 20% of that entire

393
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:11.040
materials inside the galaxy. And
two, this is the one

394
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.490
I find much more interesting.
So all of the elements

395
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:18.270
on the periodic table that
are heavier than helium were

396
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.150
made in the death of
a star. So all of

397
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.840
the oxygen you're breathing right
now, all of the carbon

398
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.940
that's in your body, et
cetera, was born in the

399
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.370
death of a star. So
that idea that, that idea

400
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.860
that we're all just the
star dust. That is like

401
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.540
a real thing. That's not
just a thing we say

402
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.440
to be romantic. That's very
literal. Yes, no. It's like

403
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:43.140
super, super literal. Now the
part that's really exciting about

404
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.480
that, right, is definitionally stars
are in galaxies. So stars

405
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.180
die when they're in galaxies.
So all of the heavy

406
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.860
materials you would expect to
be in the galaxies, but

407
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.720
if you actually do the
math and you do the

408
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.930
accounting, the budgeting, and you
say, well, how many metals

409
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.900
have I made? How many
metals do I have? Astronomers

410
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.870
are lazy. And So-Cal everything
heavier than helium metals. How

411
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.520
many of these heavy elements
do I have? How many,

412
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:11.120
how many are still in
galaxies? I'm only about 20

413
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.950
to 25% of them are
still on the galaxies. And

414
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.140
so the exciting thing that
we've been able to do

415
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.460
with one of the ultraviolet
spectrographs on Hubble in the

416
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:28.190
last 10 years is actually
point to where most of

417
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.680
this gas and most of
these heavy elements are in

418
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.970
the circumpolar, lactic, medium, outside
of the galaxies. And it's

419
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.520
very difficult to do because
this gas is very, very,

420
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.020
very, very, very, very diffused.
So it does not generally

421
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.840
emit light to give you
an idea of how diffuse

422
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:52.220
it is. Imagine a one
meter cube space, there'll be

423
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.910
like one atom in that.
Oh, wow. That would be

424
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.320
hard to see if I'm
sitting in front of it.

425
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.850
Exactly. But luckily space is
really big. And so if

426
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.520
you've got, you know, a
huge path link to look

427
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.610
for, what we can look
do is look at the

428
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.870
signatures of background light, that's
passing through it and look

429
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.250
at characteristic absorption of that
background light to measure and

430
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.610
quantify where this material is.
So that's one of the

431
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.860
reasons that we use a
lot of the synthetic data

432
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.530
because the direct measurements are
so difficult in the first

433
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.970
place that the simulations and
the synthetic data can really

434
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.630
help us figure out how
to interpret those data in

435
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:36.070
terms of the underlying physical
properties. How often is your

436
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.050
pin? You're a, one of
your main tweets or your

437
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.530
pin tweets is talking about
going back and forth in

438
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.140
Slack with some of your
colleagues and going, Oh my

439
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.500
goodness, look at this. Holy
crap, Holy crap. That happens

440
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.270
in the movies. Like every
20 minutes, like, you know,

441
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.510
the astronomer that they always,
the president always calls to,

442
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.700
you know, to come and
talk to the aliens. Usually

443
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.580
it gets to cool discovery
several times. Are you going

444
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.250
like days, days? Like, Oh
my goodness, Holy crap. Or

445
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.140
is it weeks? How often
do you get those? Like,

446
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.180
Oh my goodness, we just
discovered this. Or we just

447
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.030
found that, or we just
confirmed this. I would say

448
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.210
it depends on how excitable
our group is. Well, positive

449
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.810
feedback is always good though.
Yeah, it is. So the,

450
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.130
the thing that I and
my group have been doing

451
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:23.710
in the last two years,
that's very novel is usually

452
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:27.070
in the simulations. What people
will do is they'll put

453
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:32.260
their computational power in the
very dense regions. So in

454
00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.490
the galaxies where the stars
are actually forming, and that

455
00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.520
makes sense if the observations
you're trying to compare to

456
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.940
are the pictures of the
galaxies, the properties of the,

457
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.620
the things that are easily
easy to measure. And what

458
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.890
we were coming to realize
was, well, most of the

459
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.490
volume and most of the
material is not in those

460
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.420
very dense regions. And that
a lot of the activity

461
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.480
that's happening is happening in
these very low density regions

462
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.100
that are further out. And
so we created some new

463
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.140
techniques for adding, sorry, improving
the spatial resolution in this

464
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.580
very low density regime. So
we were, you know, every

465
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.950
time we look at these
simulations, we see something new

466
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.940
because we're using this new
technique and that can get

467
00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.360
buried every time. Yeah. So
every time we actually have

468
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.340
a new plot that we
make from those, we get

469
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.260
very excited and, you know,
the, that from the observational

470
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.140
point of view, if you're
used to just looking at,

471
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.380
you know, little squiggly lines
from a spectrograph and then

472
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.350
using your imagination to interpret
what's going on, and these

473
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:48.440
large scale cosmic bubbles, it
can be exciting to, to

474
00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.980
actually see those happening, you
know, in an animated GIF

475
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.330
on Slack. It seems like
the, the cosmological equivalent of

476
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.880
like someone giving you like,
you know, five pixels and

477
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.460
then someone goes enhance, and
then you can see the

478
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.980
license plate. And you're like,
Oh my goodness, that's amazing.

479
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:08.150
But you're actually doing that.
Yeah. The, the analogy that

480
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:15.470
my, one of my colleagues
uses is it's like putting

481
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.640
on a pair of reading
glasses, but the actual, the

482
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:24.440
words that you're looking at
have changed. So you have

483
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.260
this picture that you expect
at low resolution, but when

484
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.110
you actually allow the physics
that's happening at the smaller

485
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:36.380
scales to do its thing,
then you know, the whole

486
00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.920
picture changes, which is very
exciting. And it, but I

487
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.760
mean, it, these take, you
know, minis, you know, easily

488
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.550
10 times longer to run
than some of the more

489
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.940
standard simulations. So we understand
why people haven't really tried

490
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.210
to do this before. We
joke some time sometimes as

491
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.520
programmers that, you know, there's
a lot of time where

492
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.200
we just like go to
lunch and come back to

493
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.320
see if the compile has,
has finished when you run

494
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.570
simulations. Like how much of
it is just like hanging

495
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.790
out, waiting for the thing
to go. And like, are

496
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.950
these things taking months? Or
how long does it take

497
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.310
for them? Oh, all of
it. I mean, I have

498
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.640
some runs that I started
back in may that I

499
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.750
really hope have made it
the 14 billion years of cosmic

500
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:24.290
history. Maybe by this may,
maybe not. They take months

501
00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.170
and months and months. Yeah.
W what, if you forget,

502
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.910
have you ever been like,
Oh, that run has done,

503
00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.120
what was I doing? So
I've, haven't have not ever

504
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.360
had that happen. The co
the supercomputers are very good

505
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.520
at emailing you when your
job is finished. And so

506
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.120
you kind of get in
this pattern of please the

507
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.230
longest wall clock time you're
allowed is five days. So

508
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.300
you get very used to
every five days, logging in

509
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.650
resubmitting, all your jobs going
away again. And I've got

510
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.960
mine on a scripts, they
back up automatically. So I

511
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.840
don't even have to do
that manually anymore. My favorite

512
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.420
though, was a simulation that
when we were just starting

513
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.720
on the, on this project,
we asked a colleague to

514
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.910
run for us. And like
two years later, we were

515
00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.190
like, you know, it'd be
really nice if we had

516
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.580
a simulation that whatever. And
he's like, I ran that

517
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.730
it generated a petabyte of
data. Would you like it?

518
00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:20.890
And we were like, yes,
because it had taken over

519
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.900
a year to run and
we weren't the ones running

520
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.740
it. So we'd completely forgotten
about it. Oh my goodness.

521
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.050
Yeah. I've had a number
of things like that where

522
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.730
it'll come out of nowhere
and I'm like, Oh, wow.

523
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.100
What was I thinking? Where
did I, you know, where

524
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.310
did I put my keys
kind of equivalent? Yeah. Oh

525
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:40.410
my goodness. So people can
check you out@molly.science, and you're

526
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.290
talking about science and life
on Twitter as well. And

527
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.110
as well on your, on
your website, you've got videos

528
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.050
of public talks, you're writing
and all these different kinds

529
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.300
of things that you're doing
as well as do you

530
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.250
did Hubble Hangouts for a
while as well, where you

531
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.430
were talking publicly about how,
how, how the science gets

532
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.790
done. Fantastic. Well, thanks so
much for chatting with me.

533
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.970
Thank you so much for
inviting me. This has been

534
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.700
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

535
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:23.160
week. <inaudible>.
