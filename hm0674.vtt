Hanselman. This is another episode

10
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.260
of Hansel minutes. And today
I'm talking with Priti, Kasey

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.790
of great stuff. And now
you've started a new adventure.

15
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.590
Thanks, Scott. Yeah. Thanks for
coming on the show I

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.840
wanted to talk to you
about, and this is going

17
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.160
to be kind of open
ended. So help me with

18
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.540
this, like the blockchain for
regular people, for like the

19
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.120
people who are listening to
this show, we kind of

20
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.190
get the tech. We kind
of understand, but when maybe

21
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.260
we feel like there's something
we don't understand because we're

22
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.480
not as excited about it
as maybe we should be,

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.580
or as some of the
people in the community are.

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.680
Yeah, sure. I mean, happy
to explain any questions that

25
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.630
you have. I think like
the one thing I want

26
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.110
to correct you, there is
like blockchain is technology. Sure.

27
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.010
But it's also a narrative
and in a new kind

28
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.280
of like story and way
of living that people want

29
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.100
to believe in. So I
would say like, we should

30
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.340
look at it from both
angles. I appreciate that. Yeah.

31
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.360
That's interesting. Okay. So you're
saying that I may be

32
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.490
trying to put it into
a box and make it

33
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.970
smaller than it is. Yeah.
Like, I mean, you know,

34
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.270
before the show you mentioned
something about potentially it feeling

35
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.960
like a cult and that's
right. It's like blockchain is

36
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.410
technology. Sure. It we've created
a whole new way and

37
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.490
primitive for achieving a distributed
ledger without a central party.

38
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.140
That's the obvious. But then
what that enables is kind

39
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.630
of this like story that
you're buying into, which is

40
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.860
like decentralization, censorship resistance, like
freedom from like governments, things

41
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.350
like properties that people care
about and narratives that people

42
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.480
want to believe in because
they ha they are trying

43
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.040
to fight against the, the
centralized evil government and banks.

44
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.790
Interesting. Okay. So that, that
unpack that let's unpack that

45
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.790
because there's a lot there.
Are you saying that there

46
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.540
are, we, we say the
technology is by its nature,

47
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.940
political, like one can not
be apolitical and also be

48
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.730
a technologist, but you're saying
that there is a life

49
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.200
philosophy and a political philosophy
behind it, such that blockchain

50
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.510
represents freedom from something is
undesirable. So that people who

51
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.810
are of a, of a
like-mind are flocking to the

52
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.080
technology because they also have
that shared belief system. Yup.

53
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.560
You said it exactly how
I should have said it,

54
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.080
but that's absolutely right. If
you think about it, like

55
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.960
the history of Bitcoin, right.
It was kind of invented

56
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.610
around 2008, 2009 era. And
that was around the time

57
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.820
when the financial crisis was
happening. Things were not going

58
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.940
well in the economy. People
were starting to lose trust

59
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.620
in existing systems, whether that's
government or banks. And really,

60
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.250
I think that the, the
primitives that need that were,

61
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.940
that, that were needed to
make Bitcoin happen have existed

62
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.510
for decades prior. And I
can share a blog, post

63
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.300
a blog, a very good
blog post that highlights all

64
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.090
the things that actually existed
before this. But it was

65
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.660
a timing that was just
like perfect around that time

66
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.530
when there's just a lot
of loss of trust amongst,

67
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.730
especially like libertarians and people
like people who were seeing

68
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.340
what was happening and Bitcoin
came along and was like,

69
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.390
Hey, look like we can
build a trustless system to

70
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.960
manage our money. And like,
that really like resonated with

71
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.050
people because it was solving
a fundamental problem that people

72
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.360
felt like that they had,
which was, they didn't feel

73
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.430
like they can trust governments
and banks. Interesting. Melanie Swan

74
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.120
authored a book called blueprint
for a new economy. Like

75
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.940
it just says blockchain blueprint
for a new economy. Like

76
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.580
you went from like a
technology buzzword to like, and

77
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.390
let's talk about how we
can restructure like humanity itself.

78
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.070
It got big, fast. Yeah,
exactly. And like what fundamentally

79
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.860
attracts a lot of us
to block, at least in

80
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.920
the beginning, what attracted a
lot of us is. Yeah.

81
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.590
The technology is cool. Like
it's, it's really cool understanding

82
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.130
how Nakamoto consensus works, how
proof of work works and

83
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.340
seeing all that. But what
it forced a lot of

84
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.410
us to do is kind
of let go of the

85
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.200
ignorance that we had of
like how current systems operate,

86
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.660
like when things are going
well, you don't really try

87
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.630
to understand how those things
work and when things are

88
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.150
not going well, like then
you're like, why isn't this

89
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.880
working? And so it forced
a lot of us to

90
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.030
go back in history and
read about the systems, how

91
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.160
they were put in place,
like why they were put

92
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.290
in place and figure out
like, okay, is there a

93
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.510
better way or in a
new way to do it?

94
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.450
And I think like, fundamentally
my thesis is that that's

95
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.000
why there was a lot
of hype around blockchain is

96
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.180
because it was like, it
was like this revolutionary new

97
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.830
way of, of living and
doing things. Is, is that

98
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.840
something that one has to
buy into? Like sometimes when

99
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.830
SQL server came out or,
you know, entity relationship diagrams,

100
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.440
you know, I can't remember
a time. Maybe you can,

101
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.660
when there was a technology
that came out other than

102
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.980
the internet itself that got
people, this amped from a

103
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.760
geopolitical philosophy, philosophical perspective. Like,
I guess what I'm saying

104
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.710
is I can not think
of something that is that

105
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.720
big. And do I have
to, if I want to

106
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.950
use it, I could just
say, well, I'm going to

107
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.430
give some blockchain in this
project or do I need

108
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.880
to buy into all of
the, the, the philosophy behind

109
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.160
it? I think like I
would say it is if

110
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.070
it works, it does have
the potential to be then

111
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.740
the, not the new internet,
but as big or important

112
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.520
as the internet. And it's
because like fundamentally what we're

113
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.740
trying to change is how
humans interact in, in financial

114
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.970
and economic economies. And that's
like huge, like that's billions

115
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.930
and billions and billions of
dollars worth of interactions that

116
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.300
we're trying to change. So
yeah, it has the potential

117
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.670
to be huge. But I
think like I would, I'm

118
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.740
not going to say that
we're anywhere close to that.

119
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.550
Like the narrative is way
further out than the actual,

120
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.130
like where we are in
terms of real technology and

121
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.440
people actually using it. So
there's a lot of catch

122
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.740
up that we have to
do to meet that like

123
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.500
narrative that seems to be
in the air about what

124
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.140
this thing can do. Well,
that brings up an interesting

125
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.600
question then. So from a
technology perspective, for those of

126
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.510
us who are listening, who
maybe have, you know, Googled

127
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.340
for blockchain, but we haven't
actually done anything with it.

128
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.900
Are we at version 0.1
as just like an emerging

129
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.630
thing? Or has, has something
been achieved where it's like,

130
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.210
all right, it's 1.0, and
it's ready to go big?

131
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.370
Or, or is it like
you said, really still being

132
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.380
evolved and being actively. Yeah,
we're very early days. It's

133
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.450
kind of like when the
internet came out and like,

134
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.810
you can barely store like
two songs on your computer

135
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.950
or something like it's. And
like, and it's funny because

136
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.170
like humans, humans, just history
doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.

137
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.330
Like I was reading a
book about like how the

138
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.020
internet happened and it's, it
just feels exactly like the

139
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.740
early days of the internet,
the, today in the blockchain

140
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.100
world, like things that are
incredibly slow, the blockchain can't

141
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.930
store anything large, like transaction
have transactions happened once every

142
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.240
10 minutes on the Bitcoin
blockchain, a little bit faster

143
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.360
on Ethereum. Like, it's just
like, it's, it just feels

144
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.850
like, like, like so early.
But I think like what's

145
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:06.490
interesting is like humans always
overestimate what they can do

146
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.740
in the short term, but
underestimate what's possible in the

147
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.430
longterm. So what you see
is like, we had this

148
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.810
overestimation of what can happen
in the next, like, like

149
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.530
over the last couple of
years of like what this

150
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.900
thing can be, but then
like people share it to

151
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.750
reach like their limits. Like
things were falling flat. Things

152
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.680
were not scaling like, like
the ICO boom happened and

153
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.520
it completely fell apart. All
the altcoins went to zero

154
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.870
and then now everyone's like,
kinda like totally underestimating. What's

155
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.650
still possible in 10 years.
So I think like the

156
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.130
builders are still building behind
the scenes, but yeah, we're

157
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.530
totally in the early days.
And I think like before

158
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.570
we see anything like really
big and meaningful, it'd be

159
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.630
at least like another five
years. Hmm. It's interesting that

160
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.280
you talk about how there
was kind of like a

161
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.070
little mini crash there. I
remember where I had relatives

162
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.100
calling me and saying like,
I should go to Coinbase

163
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.740
and sign up, like immediately,
this is the boom. It

164
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.930
was like a, a little
boom. And it feels like

165
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.450
it only lasted a couple
months. And then basically we,

166
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.990
we, the, the great unwashed,
the regular people kind of

167
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.540
set up, well, this didn't
happen. I didn't get rich.

168
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.330
My Bitcoin's not worth anything.
And then we, we stepped

169
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.600
aside. But to your point,
the true believers are working

170
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.100
hard to move this forward.
Yep. Yep. And, and like,

171
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.910
if like Twitter gives you
a false illusion of like,

172
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.120
sometimes what's actually happening behind
the scenes, like there's actually

173
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.820
a lot of teams that
are not public on Twitter

174
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.450
and like shilling, their coins
are Bitcoin maximalists who just

175
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.900
like, try to say, you
know, like they have like

176
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.730
very like strong views and,
and, and almost like, yeah,

177
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.950
there's so much happening behind
the scenes. That's not on

178
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.470
Twitter. And so I think
like sometimes people have an

179
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.070
impression that crypto Twitter is
blockchain, but like, that's not

180
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.360
true. Well, as with all
cultures, there are cultures and

181
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.680
subcultures and sub sub cultures
within them. But most people

182
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.570
just want to do good
work and they want to

183
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.870
use the right tools for
the job. Where do we,

184
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.910
where do we start when
we're thinking about like, I

185
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.790
have a technology problem and
I'm not sure if I

186
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.460
should use some blockchain app
platform to solve that problem.

187
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.850
If you're asking that question,
you probably don't need it.

188
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.930
Wow. That's an awesome answer.
Actually. I appreciate that. Like,

189
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.290
I I'll be honest. Like,
I mean, I just, I

190
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.960
think like that that's, that's
the mistake we ran into

191
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.550
in 2017 where everyone thought
that like they needed a

192
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.360
blockchain and then like, they
shoved a blockchain into stuff

193
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.640
that didn't need a blockchain.
And then now we're in

194
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.400
2019 and realizing that a
lot of these projects didn't

195
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.070
need a blockchain to start
with. I feel like that

196
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.890
about like Mongo DB for
awhile, or like document databases.

197
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.740
Yeah. So I think like,
let the builders, if like,

198
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.440
yeah, let the builders kind
of keep building and like

199
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.290
make the use cases more
obvious, but it's not, if

200
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.720
it's not obvious to you,
why you need a blockchain,

201
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.600
then you probably don't need
it. Okay. So what, what

202
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.880
is an obvious thing that
would cause me to go?

203
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.110
Yeah, of course. I didn't
even need to ask the

204
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.240
question. Yes. There's no other
way to solve this. But

205
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.690
with blockchains, Like I would
say, if you're trying to

206
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.640
build a system where you're
trying to coordinate a bunch

207
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:20.120
of people to do something
without a central party. So

208
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.060
you want the system to
be decentralized and you don't

209
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.670
want a central party to
be meaning like, you just

210
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.150
want people to coordinate amongst
themselves. That's when you probably

211
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.810
can use a blockchain. And
an example of that is

212
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.560
any kind of basically like
Bitcoin is an example of

213
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.220
that. And the reason that's
an example is because you

214
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.070
have a system where there's
no central party, there's no

215
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.920
bank, but you still have
all these people coordinating to

216
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.590
achieve a common goal, which
is to have a censorship

217
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:54.280
resistant money. So it's, it's
like, you're trying to just

218
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.190
coordinate a bunch of people
to achieve a common goal.

219
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.720
And you want it to
be decentralized like now, like

220
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.030
when does something need to
be decentralized? And when does

221
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.910
something need to be centralized?
Like this is something honestly

222
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.010
that we, as an industry
restored trying to figure out,

223
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.840
and we're actually still trying
to figure out, like, where

224
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.500
does decentralization actually makes sense?
And what things should still

225
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.220
be centralized because there's no
perfect answer. It's not like

226
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.520
everything should be decentralized and
everything should be centralized. And

227
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.500
so I would say we're
still in early days of

228
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.610
figuring that out. Hey folks,
I hope you're enjoying this

229
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.660
podcast. You know, I've done
over 650 podcasts, so I

230
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.060
must enjoy doing it. And
I hope you enjoy listening.

231
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.730
But if you enjoy stories
about the people behind the

232
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.000
technology you use, you should
also check out the greater

233
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.630
than code podcast. They focus
on the human side of

234
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.290
software development. They've got stories
of inclusivity and accessibility from

235
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.720
the people you don't normally
hear from search for a

236
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.020
greater than code in your
favorite podcast app, or check

237
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.480
out greater than code.com. I
hear the word trustless a

238
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.940
lot. Like if you're in
a situation where you want

239
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.970
to do something and you
really can't trust everybody, even

240
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.370
an end, the people involved
may not even trust the

241
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:10.710
centralized place. Like, like a,
like a distributed Kickstarter would

242
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.760
be a reasonable use of
a blockchain. Yeah. Like fundraising

243
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.640
in a distributed way. I
can totally see that another

244
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.420
example might be like a
YouTube. I can imagine like

245
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.430
content creators and then people
who want to pay for

246
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.610
that content or wanting to
all, just do it without

247
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.920
like a central party taking
some kind of cut out

248
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:35.070
of that. And yeah, like
I think like, I think,

249
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.440
yeah, like, well, we'll have
to see what will come

250
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.620
out of this, but right
now the application level use

251
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.960
cases are, are, are, are
not really as prominent. The

252
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.220
main use cases right now
for blockchain are basically money.

253
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.970
Make a store of value
where, which is like Bitcoin.

254
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.950
Like you just buy Bitcoin,
you hold it because it

255
00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:00.360
has some value. And then
we're starting to see early,

256
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.590
early use cases where people
are trying to use cryptocurrency

257
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:10.350
for things like collateralized debt
and other financial assets. But

258
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.070
again, we're in very early
days. Okay. What is the

259
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.090
difference between I understand Bitcoin
as a, this is a

260
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.920
stored value and it's the
one that is fun to

261
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.200
say it's one, it feels
good in our mouth. Bitcoin's

262
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.910
fun to say it's the
one that always gets on

263
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.720
the news. And then Ethereum,
which I believe introduces this

264
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.060
concept of a decentralized virtual
machine. And I keep hearing

265
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.920
about Ethereum as a distributed
computing platform. Yeah, that's correct.

266
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.350
So Bitcoin, obviously it was
founded, it was the first

267
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:43.200
cryptocurrency and the, one of
the visions that was outlined

268
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.840
in the Bitcoin white paper
was that people can build

269
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.130
applications on top of Bitcoin,
like these centralized applications, but

270
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.840
Bitcoin did not make that
easy. So the scripting language

271
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.310
Bitcoin is basically almost like
writing assembly and that's not

272
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:03.110
very developer friendly. So then
Vitalik and the Ethereum founding

273
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.510
team came along and were
like, we're going to create

274
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:11.720
something that is much more
favorable to building applications, not

275
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.480
just to have a currency,
but also have other applications

276
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.240
be, be able to build
on built on top of

277
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.520
that. And so, yeah, you're
right. There is kind of

278
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.970
like a distributed virtual machine
in the sense that it

279
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:29.030
still has the consensus engine.
It's a blockchain there's transactions.

280
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.450
But what it also has
in addition to what Bitcoin

281
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.690
has is that it has
a smart contract language that

282
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.770
looks similar to JavaScript where
you can actually code quote

283
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.990
unquote smart contracts, which are
like basically self enforcing rules.

284
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.810
And so you can use
these cellphone forcing rules to

285
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.220
build any kind of application.
And that's really the difference

286
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.780
between Bitcoin and Ethereum and,
and you're, you, you can

287
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.480
probably go online and see
some of the early applications

288
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.690
of what people have tried
to do on Ethereum. Things

289
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.780
like one of the earliest
successes were like was crypto

290
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:12.650
kitties where people try to
build basically virtual goods on

291
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.270
Ethereum. And that was an
example of an application. Now

292
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.160
people are trying to, there
was like, there's an for

293
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.730
example, something called Peppa where
people took Twitter and tried

294
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:27.080
to build a decentralized version
of Twitter on Ethereum. It's

295
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.390
actually pretty cool. So yeah,
you're starting to see early

296
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.460
use cases, but a lot
of these just feel, feel

297
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.670
like toys right now. And
no one's like using them

298
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.700
at scale. Okay. So these,
the smart contracts that the,

299
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.270
that use the solidity language
that sits on top of

300
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:49.480
Ethereum is this general purpose
computing. Like I can do

301
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.750
computing of like ask questions
that are not related to

302
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:58.960
transactions and contract, or is
this primarily about elevating standard

303
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.770
traditional contract law into an
enforceable way that lives inside

304
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.880
of a blockchain? No, it's
it's I think like calling

305
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.340
it smart contracts was a
huge mistake because they're not,

306
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.570
they're not technically like legal
contracts, like when you're writing

307
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.920
a smart contract, it's, it's
just, it's basically just like

308
00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.530
you would write code there's
functions. There's FL statements. There's

309
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:34.640
adding subtracting numbers, like complete
thing, complete language. And, and,

310
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.790
and it's not necessarily like
a legal contract. And so

311
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.620
I think like calling is
my contract is wrong. That's

312
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.590
why I actually prefer to
call it like self enforcing

313
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.550
rules because once you code
the contract force itself, because

314
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.540
it runs in decentralized way
and it's being managed by

315
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.750
the blockchain. So you define
a set of rules in

316
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.380
these more contracts. For example,
a rule might be that

317
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:04.590
every day I pay Scott
Hanselman 10 cents on the blockchain

318
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:11.130
or something. And that, that,
that rule gets re enforced

319
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:14.760
by itself because the blockchain
is validating that contract and

320
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.200
making sure that transaction happens.
Okay. So let me dig

321
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.750
in a little bit and
show my ignorance and hopefully

322
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.930
help the audience as well.
So where is this running?

323
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.830
Are we all running agents
in the background on our

324
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.890
machines is, is the blockchain
a bunch of us running

325
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.220
bots and little processes, The
blockchain you can think of

326
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.720
it as just to simplify,
think of it as a

327
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:45.860
spreadsheet. Okay. And the spreadsheet
has all the transactions from

328
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.100
day one that happened on
it. And every time you

329
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.200
update that spreadsheet, everyone else
can see that update. And

330
00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.570
everyone's maintaining a copy of
the spreadsheet. So think of

331
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.930
it as a Google sheets.
Basically every time you change

332
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.000
something, I can see it
every time I change something,

333
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.910
you can see it. The
only difference is that every

334
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.140
change in that spreadsheet has
to be approved by everyone.

335
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.350
We all agree. We all
trust it as a group.

336
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.380
Yes. We all have to
agree on that change. And

337
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.360
the way we agree is
by that's what the consensus

338
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.980
quote, unquote consensus algorithm does,
which where a bunch of

339
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:32.180
miners are incentivized with tokens
to compute something and make

340
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.120
sure that that's a valid
transaction. And then they, if

341
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.670
it is a valid transaction,
they get the authority to

342
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.340
add it to that spreadsheet.
And then everyone looks at

343
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.800
it, updates their own spreadsheets.
And they're like, okay, we

344
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.250
added this transaction. Let's move
to the next one. And

345
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:50.540
so we're all collectively together
working to make, update this

346
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.170
spreadsheet and agree on it
over time. Okay. So then

347
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.750
in the example where you
said that there was a

348
00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.750
contract or a pit bit
of code, that's paying me

349
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.530
10 cents every day, is that
running in multiple places and

350
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.830
it's being it's happening multiple
times and being agreed upon

351
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.040
multiple times. Yeah. So there's
a smart contract, right? And

352
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.510
it's, it has this code
and the contract says that

353
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:20.120
like, Preethy send Scott 10 cents.
So that's a transaction. And

354
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.880
that, because of this smart
contract, as soon as the

355
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.900
smart contract is invoked, that
transaction gets executed. And then

356
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.270
now to add that check,
to make sure that transaction

357
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:34.670
gets added to the blockchain,
every, all the miners verify

358
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.160
that transaction, they approve it
and then it gets added

359
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.660
to the blockchain. Okay. So
it it's the, it's the

360
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.360
acknowledgement that it had happened
and the agreement that had

361
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.980
happened. And it's okay. And
it's been added to the

362
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.270
chain that is distributed, but
the actual running of it

363
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.150
is not necessarily happening like
everywhere. Is it happening on

364
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.840
a random person's machine? No,
no, no. They're running of,

365
00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.040
it happens everywhere too. Like
everyone's maintaining the same, same

366
00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.710
VM. Yeah. So everyone's ranked
running the same VM then

367
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.680
are we all running everyone's
code always all the time.

368
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.760
Yep. So then how does
that, and this is forgive

369
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.500
me, this, I felt this
was going to be bad

370
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.980
before I said it. How
does it scale? Does that

371
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.830
not mean that there is
a finite amount of compute

372
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.440
available, which is the Cartesian
product to face, you know,

373
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.290
with all the different people
involved in it. That's right.

374
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:29.190
It doesn't scale. Yeah. I
mean, like I, I wrote

375
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.980
about this a year ago
and I think like, w

376
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.710
we started to realize this
about two years ago when

377
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.090
we created this thing, but
then we realized that when

378
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.420
you put everything on the
blockchain, it doesn't scale. And

379
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.780
there's only so many transactions
that can happen in a

380
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.490
minute or in 10 minutes.
And beyond that, like, it

381
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.370
just creates bottlenecks. And a
great example of this is

382
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.350
what I mentioned earlier. There
was an application we'll call

383
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.010
crypto kitties, which went viral
and people were trying to

384
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:03.200
buy these crypto kitties, but
then like it completely clogs

385
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.780
and network. And if there
am just like, basically on

386
00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.960
what it almost like broke
Ethereum, because there was, it

387
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.270
just couldn't handle all those
trends. So you're saying like,

388
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.340
literally meme cats, like cute
pictures of cats brought down

389
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.880
the chain. Yeah, exactly. Because
people like cats more than

390
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.790
others. Yeah. The internet loves
cats, but yeah, that was

391
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.250
kind of the moment of
realization. I mean, we, a

392
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.770
lot of us in the
background have known about the

393
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.900
scale, but he problem for
a long time. But in

394
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.540
the public side that it
wasn't a very obvious problem.

395
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.590
But when cryptic PDs came
along, everyone, if finally ring

396
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.660
the bell and everyone's had
their like, Oh shit, like

397
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.810
the buck chain is not
scalable. And that's when people

398
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:50.600
started to explore that's windows,
like the proliferation of alternative

399
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.960
blockchains. So now scalability was
a big problem and everyone

400
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.170
had to solve it. So
then you're seeing like tons

401
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.170
of different ways of solving
it. And there's like tens

402
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.840
of different blockchain projects that
are solving it in different

403
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.930
ways. There's EOS there's if
they're in with its own

404
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:12.270
solution and tezo is and
cosmos, and I can go

405
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.170
on forever. But so that's
one approach. People are either

406
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:21.450
like trying to find different,
new, trying to like invent

407
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.990
a new blockchain that solve
the scalability problem. Or the

408
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.630
other approach is they're moving
to what we call layer

409
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:32.280
two, where they're trying to
build solutions where a lot

410
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.400
of the high volume transactions
happen off the blockchain, but

411
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.280
they only go to the
blockchain when they need to

412
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.600
settle or when they need
to dispute. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.

413
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.280
What I said earlier about
different blockchains to solve the

414
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.570
skeletal problem, that's layer one
mini Lake. It's the blockchain

415
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.690
layer that you're trying to
add more scalability to, or

416
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.790
you can go a layer
two, which is like above

417
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.090
the blockchain and it doesn't
ever touch the blockchain, but

418
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.160
only hits the blockchain if
they want to settle or

419
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.420
dispute. Interesting. Which is a
classic computer science thing. If

420
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.190
you have a problem, well,
we need to add a

421
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.010
layer of abstraction to can
get rid of that problem.

422
00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.020
And in this case, we're
going to de referencing the

423
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.580
pointer and moving everything off
of the, off of the

424
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.590
bottleneck. And we'll just run
it locally on our own

425
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.840
machines, but then you have
to figure out which part

426
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.080
do you trust? Which part
do you not trust? Yeah.

427
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.140
And this is the whole
nother problem. Cause like now,

428
00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.270
okay, look, and now you're
going to layer two. And

429
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.390
so you have, for example,
one example is state channels.

430
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.990
And the C channel is
basically two parties are sending

431
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.810
transactions to each other. So
let's take the Scott Hanselman

432
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.030
and Preet the example where
we're sending 10 cents to each

433
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.070
other every day. So we
can just create a state

434
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.190
channel together and we're sending
10 cents to each other every

435
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.010
day. But we only go
to the blockchain when one

436
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.520
of us wants to either
cash out or if like,

437
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.350
we want to dispute because
you didn't send me the

438
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.080
10 cents. And so the only
time I go to the

439
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.730
blockchain is when we need
to like fix something or

440
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.000
have cash out. But the
problem with that is like

441
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.480
the, we haven't really figured
out an efficient way to

442
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.620
do that because I, the
proofs that are required when

443
00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.480
you, when you go back
to the base layer to

444
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.110
layer one, you need like
efficient ways to calculate proofs

445
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.910
that like this happened, this
happened and the efficiency there

446
00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.360
is not there yet. We're
still like several years or

447
00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.870
months away from getting efficient
way to do that. Yeah.

448
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.150
Well, it sounds like layer
two would then allow you

449
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.570
to do like recurring subscriptions
and loans and you and

450
00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:36.490
I could have a year
or more worth of interactions

451
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.270
on that layer and then
never actually hit layer one.

452
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.770
But then when we do
hit layer one, we got

453
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.070
to start asking ourselves all
kinds of hard questions about,

454
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.380
do we even trust each
other over the last year

455
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.390
of interruptions? Yeah, exactly, exactly.
And then this brings the

456
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:56.710
question of like, you know,
it brought up an interesting

457
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.810
question because if we're doing
a lot of these stuff

458
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:03.190
in layer two, then it
made us rethink about what

459
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.730
actually does have to exist
in layer one. Cause like

460
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.450
we started off with putting
everything in layer one and

461
00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.780
realized it's not going to
scale. So now we're like,

462
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.480
okay, can we move things
to layer two? But then

463
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.390
like now, or like, okay,
like if we're moving to

464
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.430
things to layer two, like
what does it mean? Like

465
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.990
what, what actually should exist
on layer one? Because we

466
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.730
know the blockchain doesn't scale,
we know that takes a

467
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.400
lot of work to secure
the network. Like miners have

468
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.880
to expend all this, either
energy or money or power

469
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.050
to, to keep this blockchain
secure. So like if we're

470
00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.610
going to spend all that
money to keep it secure,

471
00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.220
let's make sure that we're
only storing in there what

472
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.930
we really need store and
not like necessarily crypto kiddies.

473
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.300
Right? Like, do we really
want a store for shell

474
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.320
kitties on the blockchain? I
don't know. Hmm. And that's

475
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.780
from a, again from a
computer science perspective, that's such

476
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.870
a funny thing to me
because we're always moving up

477
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.000
and down the, the layers
trying to figure out the

478
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.940
right thing. You know, video
card device drivers should belong

479
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.910
in the kernel. Oh wow.
Video card device drivers can

480
00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.310
crash an entire computer. They
don't belong in the kernel.

481
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.880
They belong in user space.
Well, there's performance issues. If

482
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.320
we move, you know, and
we just go back and

483
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.520
forth, it's, it's, we're watching
the internet itself and the

484
00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.180
blockchain kind of refactor and
learn. And as the community

485
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.600
tries to solve the problems
that they plan for, and

486
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.340
then the problems that they
never expected that they would

487
00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.710
have. Yeah, exactly. And I
think it is totally, totally,

488
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:34.130
totally. And if, if it's,
it's so funny because like

489
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.970
the same problems, people, humans
solve the same problems over

490
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.120
and over and over again.
And sometimes it would help

491
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.680
if people would just like
read about how it was

492
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.240
solved in other areas or
in the past, because I

493
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.070
just don't think people are
as good at learning from

494
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.350
history as they should be,
especially when it comes to

495
00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:55.040
technology. It's funny that you
mentioned that because I am,

496
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.300
as, as someone who has
been doing software for 27

497
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.900
years, almost 30 years, I
don't want to be the

498
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.690
old person that says, Hey,
we did that before, but

499
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.910
I do see a lot
of really amazing people in

500
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.000
their early twenties with a
lot of great energy building,

501
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.610
building stuff. And I don't
want to be a gatekeeper

502
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.230
and I don't want to
be a hater, but I

503
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.620
do want them to crack
a book and maybe explore

504
00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.750
some of the problems that
were solved in the forties

505
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.680
and fifties and seventies. Oh
yeah. Totally. Like, especially in

506
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.230
the, I mean, you, you
see the suspicion in the

507
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.250
JavaScript world where like people
love to reinvent the wheel

508
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.790
and you're like, this was
solved. There's people have thought

509
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:40.190
about this for decades. So
you're using this, you're using

510
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:46.220
this a true story.io, T
R U story.io. You're building

511
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.500
a social network to try
to identify what is true

512
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:54.590
and what isn't. Yup. That's
right. And rebuilding part of

513
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.390
it in a decentralized way.
And the part of it

514
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.570
in a centralized way. And
I can explain. So as

515
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.930
you said, we're building a
platform where we crowdsource the

516
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.650
validation of claims that people
make on the internet. And

517
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:10.190
so we're starting specifically with
claims in the cryptocurrency space,

518
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.250
but then moving to other
categories of information as well.

519
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.470
And the reason we are
building our backend on the

520
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.250
blockchain is because we do
the way we revalidate these

521
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.760
claims. If we have a,
it took an incentive where

522
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.390
people are putting their skin
in the game and incentivized

523
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:34.640
to validate these claims. And
so we, instead of us

524
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.730
managing those tokens and that
protocol, we want it to

525
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.740
be self enforcing and decentralized.
And so that's layer that

526
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.100
sits on the blockchain, the
rules that govern how the,

527
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.250
how the validation happens, sits
on the blockchain. And then

528
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.120
we're building API APIs and
an application that's more centralized

529
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:57.120
that provides the user experience.
I'm, I'm getting kind of

530
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.350
a Snopes meats Quora with
skin in the game, kind

531
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:05.880
of a vibe out of
this. Exactly. Interesting. Okay. So

532
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.330
someone could theoretically game it,
but if they were trying

533
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.950
to do that, they would,
it would cost them a

534
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.050
great deal. If they were
trying to like convince me

535
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.990
that the earth was flat
on true story. Exactly, exactly.

536
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.420
It would cost them a
great deal. And like, just

537
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.690
like any decentralized system, it
works under the honest economic

538
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:25.710
majority. So I won't really
go into the detail of

539
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.620
how the incentives work, but
like how at a high

540
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.970
level, like you are staking
and then you're earning reputation

541
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.790
over time for being right.
And so we dis-incentivize people

542
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.360
like, let's say tomorrow, a
state actor wants to come

543
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.540
in and buy truth. Like
let's just not possible because

544
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.420
you have to earn reputation
on the platform, which takes

545
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.470
many, many attempts before they
can buy truth, per se.

546
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.830
And by that time, at
that time, that person is

547
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.590
a high reputation user. And
like everyone's already watching that

548
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.890
person. Cool. Well, I wish
you all the best and

549
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.930
I'd very much appreciate you
hanging out with me today

550
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.720
and helping me get my
head straight around blockchain or

551
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.210
on a theory in the
future. It sounds like an

552
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.870
exciting future. Indeed. Awesome. Thanks
Scott. We've been talking with

553
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.690
Preethy Cassie ready from true
story. And this has been

554
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.750
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

555
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:30.270
week. <inaudible>.
