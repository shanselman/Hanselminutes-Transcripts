Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.270
Hansel minutes today. I'm talking
with Kevin Scott. He's the CTO

17
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.320
of Microsoft and just for
full disclosure, I happen to

18
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.560
work for Microsoft. So you're
probably my boss in some

19
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.870
way, five or six up.
I'm not sure how it

20
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.040
works. I'm not sure how
it works either. So I

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.850
was talking to you before
we started recording here, and

22
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.160
I did not realize that
you were a remote too.

23
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.790
I'm remote in Portland. Yes,
I am. I live in

24
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.880
Los Gatos and tend to
spend a couple of days

25
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.910
a week up in Redmond.
Oh, wow. A couple of

26
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.850
days a week. So that
is, you're commuting more aggressively

27
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.320
than I am. Yeah. Has
that been a problem? You

28
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.260
know, I will, in all
honesty say that it's not

29
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.990
my favorite thing in the
world. I'm, I'm sort of

30
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.950
a home body. I've got,
you know, wife and two

31
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.460
little kids, seven and nine
years old. And like, my

32
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.720
preference would to be at
home, but you know, I'm,

33
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.840
I've sort of been shocked
that I've been able to

34
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.960
do as much of this
job as I have been

35
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.650
able to do remotely. Because
like, even though I'm up

36
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.780
here a couple of days
a week, that's still means

37
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.390
that three days a week,
I'm in Los Gatos and

38
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.990
working remotely. Yeah. Yeah. It's
worked. It's amazing though. Like

39
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.850
every time I go up,
I'm like, ah, I could

40
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.220
see why they would want
me here and I could

41
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.040
see why moving here would
be good for the career.

42
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.530
And I could see why,
you know, people always say,

43
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.530
when are you coming up
next? Like it's not possible

44
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.850
for them to speak to
you when you were away.

45
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.310
Yeah. Do people give you
that? The, are you coming

46
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.900
up next soon? I get
less of that actually all

47
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.520
the time. I mean, one
of the things that I

48
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.430
tried to do and I've,
I I've sort of done

49
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.790
this a few times. Like
not, not where I was

50
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.810
like living quite so remotely
as this, but like back

51
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.010
in 2003, when I joined
Google, I joined the New York

52
00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.280
office, which was at the
time 10 engineers. And like

53
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.030
the center of gravity at
the company, them was entirely

54
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.630
a mountain view in California.
And so I spent a

55
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.690
huge amount of time back
and forth, but my strategy

56
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.350
has always been, you know,
do, do a whole bunch

57
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.000
of traveling at the beginning
of a project or whatever

58
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.020
you're doing to sort of
establish relationships. And then once,

59
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.220
you know, once folks have
some degree of a relationship

60
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.520
with you, the remote stuff
gets a whole lot easier.

61
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.610
And like, there's way less
of this. Like, Hey, like,

62
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.960
you know, when are you
going to be here in

63
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.430
person? Yeah. Yeah. I definitely
did a lot more traveling

64
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.490
early on when I started,
once you build the relationships

65
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.130
and they remember that you
exist and that you're cool.

66
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.440
They'll put up with any
kind of promote things that

67
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.410
they need you to do.
Yeah. And like technology, I

68
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.710
think is making it a
lot easier. So video conferencing

69
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.890
tech is better now, you
know, things like teams like

70
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.060
makes, makes things better, you
know, mobile phones, like in

71
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.450
a certain way, make things
better. That's a, you know,

72
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.810
it's interesting, like how much
easier it is now than

73
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.340
like the S you know,
15 years ago at Google.

74
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.460
Yeah. I was actually, I'm
in a meeting. I said

75
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.780
that I was in, I
was in a meeting last

76
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.210
night, not last night, yesterday
afternoon. And I said, I

77
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.400
was in a cafe. I
was in McDonald's because they

78
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.420
have really good wifi. And
I was using teams on

79
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.050
an iPhone and I could
see the screen. It was,

80
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.860
it was surprising. I just
had a little bit, a

81
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.560
bit of a moment there,
like, Oh, wow. You know,

82
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.810
I'm actually in a meeting
and they can hear me

83
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.340
fine and they can see
me fine. And I can

84
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.000
see their screen on a
freaking iPhone. Yeah. It's amazing.

85
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.270
Right. Yeah. It was cool
that it worked right. Yeah.

86
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.760
I mean, I, the older
I get, the more I

87
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.190
have those moments where I'm
like, Oh my God, I

88
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.740
can't believe I'm doing this.
Like, I'm talking to my

89
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.270
phone and it's understanding what
I'm saying. Or like the

90
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.540
phone is listening to the
music that's playing in the

91
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.260
background, in this noisy environment
and identifying the song. So

92
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.320
I don't even have to
do the search to remind

93
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.500
myself what it is. It's
just nuts. Right. That's actually

94
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.990
a really good segue because
you said you've got little

95
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.720
kids, I've got a 10
year old and a 12

96
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.680
year old, and I'm starting
to notice their expectation for

97
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.790
technology is much deeper than
like their, their grandparents, my

98
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.600
parents who are in their
seventies, my kids are profoundly

99
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.170
disappointment, disappointed if they can't
be like, you know, Hey

100
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.950
Google, Hey Alexa, Hey Cortana.
What's the song. Or how

101
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.020
old is Oprah? Like, if
they can't get the answer

102
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.300
right now, they're mad. Yeah.
The way they consume content

103
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.840
and media is different as
well. So my kids are,

104
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.370
so I think from a
computing perspective, they tend to

105
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.390
be voice natives and touch
natives. Like, that's just sort

106
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.950
of like the two paradigms
that they get. And like,

107
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.220
they expect just like you
said everything to be immediately

108
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.260
available, including their content. And
it's like torture for them

109
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.140
to watch TV. They just
don't get it. Like, why,

110
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.600
why do you hope people
like sit down and like,

111
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.800
watch something when somebody else
decides that it's the right

112
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.480
time for you to watch
it. And you sit through

113
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.630
these like interruptions in your
programming, like every few minutes.

114
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.770
Like, are you insane? Exactly.
Exactly. Well, we used to

115
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.650
have appointment television and my
kids are like, has a

116
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.910
new episode of Supergirl arrived
yet? I'm like arrived. Was

117
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.280
it delivered? Like where do
you think Supergirl? Kona? I

118
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.290
mean, I mean, I know
what day it's on TV.

119
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.440
Yeah. That's awesome. That is
the historical context that you've

120
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.480
got. It sounds like it's
similar to mine. You've been

121
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.360
in the business for a
long time. Yup. You're you're

122
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.050
ABD with a PhD in
computer science. You worked at

123
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.470
LinkedIn on the engineering side,
you SVP at LinkedIn for

124
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.280
six, six years. Were you
a dev at some point?

125
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.980
Like, were you like, like
on the, the line writing

126
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.440
code? Yeah. I, I was
actually chatting about this yesterday,

127
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.390
so I got my computer
science degree when I was

128
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.980
like in the early nineties.
And the first job that

129
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.190
I had after I graduated
high school was for this

130
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.190
company in Lynchburg, Virginia called
electronic design and manufacturing. And

131
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.970
it was funny enough, like
also a startup. So this

132
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.480
guy who knew one of
my teachers from high school

133
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.270
happened to be starting this
company and was looking for

134
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.540
a high school kid to
come in and help out

135
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.960
as they, you know, bootstrap
their business. And like a

136
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.470
lot of it was like
putting together like racks and

137
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.920
shells and equipment and whatnot,
because they were literally starting

138
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.170
from scratch. And like, I
sort of became like their

139
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.380
network administrator and, you know,
the, the it guy as

140
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.020
well as like their programmer,
because we did, we did

141
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:13.330
electronics, design consulting work for
the industrial controls industry. And

142
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.700
so I spent a ton
of time, like four years

143
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.650
part time while I was
in college. And then I

144
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.530
worked, worked there for a
couple of years after I

145
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:26.050
graduated before I went to
grad school, both writing industrial

146
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.760
control systems, mostly in assembly
language. And because my boss

147
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.790
and like, he's like seriously,
like one of the most

148
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.770
awesome people I've ever met.
I learned so much from

149
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.450
him, but he was also
like one of the cheapest

150
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.570
human beings on the planet.
And rather than buy new

151
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.250
manufacturing equipment, he would go
to auction and buy all

152
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.120
of this junk that was
20 years old. And he

153
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.140
would do all of the
mechanical rehabilitation of this equipment.

154
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.120
And he would like give
the, the electronic controls parts

155
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.040
to me and say, Hey,
can you figure out how

156
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.560
this thing works? And like,
get it to function again.

157
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.070
So it was like, yeah,
I was writing assembly language

158
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.220
and like figuring out like
which wires on the wire

159
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.670
wrapped a bus on these
PDP eights that were controlled

160
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:17.840
in these 1970s era icy
insertion robots work. Oh my

161
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.530
goodness. That idea though, that
someone was looking for a

162
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.730
high school student, like, does
that still happen? Like you

163
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.500
said, you were with VIP
guy, how can we make

164
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.620
more IP guys and gals
at that age? It feels

165
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.340
like people come out of
college with a BS in

166
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.630
computer science, but because they
weren't there when it started,

167
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.100
like maybe you and I
were, they didn't have that

168
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.800
privilege. They might be missing
that low level stuff. Right.

169
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.710
Because JavaScript is the new
metal, but the metal, the

170
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.050
metal stops at JavaScript. Maybe
they set up their network

171
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.660
at home. Yup. But they
missed it unless they went

172
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.620
into the low level stuff.
There's so many layers now

173
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.020
that didn't exist before. And
I wonder if we're doing

174
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.740
people a disservice as, as
they enter the industry. Yeah.

175
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.040
I wonder This all the
time too. So one is

176
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.710
like, I think, you know,
we really should be doing

177
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.520
a better job trying to
get kids at a bunch

178
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.240
of different ages involved in,
you know, what you and

179
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.240
I probably did just as
recreation, like when we were

180
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.960
like, I started coding when
I was 12 years old

181
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.670
and you know, it was
like coding and like hacking

182
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.150
together machines and like building
your own PC and, you

183
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.070
know, just doing a bunch
of tinkering stuff. But it's

184
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.230
a headstart though, isn't it?
Yeah. It's totally a headstart.

185
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.930
So, you know, my wife
and I with our family

186
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.980
foundation and it's mostly my
wife who runs the foundation,

187
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.920
spend a bunch of time
trying to figure out. And

188
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.860
like, we were mostly we've
started in the Bay area,

189
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.920
which is just our community
where we can sort of

190
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.590
work face to face with,
with a bunch of these

191
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.980
nonprofits have been trying to
fund people who are doing

192
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:04.460
innovative things to sort of
get the spark ignited for

193
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.610
kids as young, as, you
know, sort of seven or

194
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:12.290
eight years old in STEM.
And then to like give

195
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.370
them sort of a continuing
stream of experiences throughout their

196
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.800
childhood and adolescence that reinforces
this, you know, sort of

197
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.930
sense of wonder. I mean,
it really was like this

198
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.810
amazing thing for me when
I was, when I was

199
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.960
a kid, like, I just
love doing this stuff. It

200
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.730
was, you know, nerd. Right.
But like, I, I, you

201
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.210
know, raced home from school
and like, I, you know,

202
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.390
went straight to my computer
and it was always, I

203
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.390
always had a project. I
always had a next thing

204
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.480
that I wanted to do,
whether it was programming or

205
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.990
a mod or something or
the other. And yeah, I

206
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.190
mean, like, I think we
have to do a better

207
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.220
job, but I mean, other
thing that you were talking

208
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.980
about this notion that the,
you know, sort of abstraction

209
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.910
boundaries, so to speak for
kids is higher now. Like

210
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.830
I think it's totally true.
And on the one hand,

211
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.280
it's like this great blessing,
you know, you just sort

212
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.690
of think about what power
we have put in the

213
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.500
hands of an average developer.
Now, like you've got third

214
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.790
party clouds like Azure, you've
got like incredibly sophisticated programming

215
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.980
tools where there's so much
already done for you in

216
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.790
the standard libraries. And you
have open source and like

217
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.420
this amazing community of people
out there who are just

218
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.670
building an incredible array of
tech that you can contribute

219
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.990
to and incorporate into your
own own work. And like

220
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.180
all of that's amazing, but
it is a little bit

221
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.680
scary that at some level
the abstractions that you're working

222
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.990
with on a daily basis
to do your job are

223
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.370
like very, very, very, very
far removed from like, Oh,

224
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.490
there's a, you know, there's
a current going through this

225
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:06.520
wire, you know, Les somewhere.
And, you know, I worry

226
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.860
that I'm starting to sound
like an old fart now.

227
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.390
Well, this brings up an
interesting question though, right? Because

228
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.390
from a, from an inclusion
perspective, if we want everyone

229
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.910
to be involved in technology,
it's important for you and

230
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.810
I, as you know, middle
aged men to recognize that

231
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.610
not everyone's going to have
that experience of running home

232
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.460
and playing with their COVID
or 64 and nine. Right.

233
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.070
And it's weird for me
to want my 12 year

234
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.410
old to do that too,
you know, but at the

235
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.750
same time, is it okay
that he just presses a

236
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.210
checkbox and Azure, and then
he scales his website to

237
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.210
a global scale and then
has no concept of what

238
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.550
actually happened. Yeah. I mean,
I don't actually think so.

239
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.250
I mean, like, this is,
this is the old, old

240
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.060
geek in me. Like I
think there's, I think for

241
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.880
all of us and like,
this is, you know, this

242
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.380
is probably traveling like way
far afield from like tech

243
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.450
conversation. But like, I think
everyone should have, you know,

244
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:09.030
like some degree of inquisitiveness
and demand that they like

245
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.570
at least have the ability
to go all the way

246
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.700
down to the metal if
they want to, or need

247
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.240
to, you know? And so
like, that's true, whether it's

248
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.760
like, you know, you're consuming
media and like, you don't

249
00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.100
know whether it's fake news
or not. It's also true

250
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.490
if you're like an Azure
developer. And like, the truth

251
00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.650
of the matter is, is
like if you're building any

252
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.160
sort of, you know, sort
of website at scale, even

253
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.320
if you've got all of
this amazing infrastructure at some

254
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.370
point, like it is going
to be like a massively

255
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.590
complex system. And at scale,
like statistically speaking, like all

256
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.840
of the things that could
happen are going to happen

257
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.120
and somebody's going to need
to figure out what's going

258
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.950
wrong. And you know, like,
well, what you're saying is

259
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.700
abstractions Leak, but, but I
could, I could play devil's

260
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.620
devil's advocate a little bit,
even though the devil doesn't

261
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.750
need an advocate. What if
I go, what if I

262
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.540
decide to go and buy
a, like a Nissan leaf

263
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.270
or a small electric car,
but now I've spent all

264
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.730
this time learning how a
clutch works on an, a

265
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.330
stick shift. Yeah. Like at
what point are we, it's

266
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.820
not just layers on top
of layers. It's completely changing

267
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.570
the paradigm. Yeah. I mean,
like the truth of the

268
00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.160
matter is like modern society.
Like things are so complex

269
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.690
that there are very few
Renaissance people in the sense

270
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.820
that, you know, one individual
understands everything, you know, but

271
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.480
like, you know, I think,
you know, something along the

272
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.720
lines of the open source,
ethos of ethos of like

273
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.600
at least having the knowledge
out there and having the

274
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.170
ability to like push past
these abstraction boundaries, if you

275
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.420
need to. I think it's
actually an important thing. I

276
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.130
think the point he said,
if you need to write,

277
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.260
like, if it's a black,
if it's black boxes on

278
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.020
top of black boxes all
the way down, and that

279
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.720
presents a problem, it dies.
If you can go pretty

280
00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.280
far down, then that'd be,
that'd be exciting. Yeah. And

281
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.610
you know, like, and we
have, we have things today,

282
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.820
like YouTube, you know, like
I'm a, I'm sort of

283
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.750
a OCD hobbyist. And I
bought my first three D

284
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.200
printer two weeks ago. Oh
dude. We could do a

285
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.610
whole show on that. I'd
love to talk to you

286
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.190
about that. Yeah. And so,
like, I never had one

287
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.800
before, but, and the reason
I bought it is because

288
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.760
I'm a woodworker and I
had this thing that I

289
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.460
wanted to do in my
wood shop where like the

290
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.840
part literally didn't exist. And
rather than go pay someone

291
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.300
to design the part for
me and to have it

292
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.330
fabricated, like I went and
grabbed a copy of fusion

293
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.460
three 60, which I've been
meaning to learn for a

294
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.560
long while. And I'm on
a three D printer. And

295
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.650
I designed the part myself
and I learned fusion three

296
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:48.160
60, like while I was
on vacation and in Hawaii,

297
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.440
my kids were on spring
break. This is how dad

298
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.370
vacations. And I learned how
to use it by watching

299
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.440
like a ton of YouTube
videos. This is like amazing.

300
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.060
It's like the matrix it's
like, you just sort of

301
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.790
load this crap into your
brain and then go, Yeah.

302
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.110
It's, it's definitely slow. It
is almost exactly like, yeah.

303
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.090
When, when Trinity wants to
learn how to do a

304
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.190
helicopter, it takes her a
couple of seconds. It takes

305
00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.200
us to a couple of
YouTube videos, but I'm yeah,

306
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.950
totally sure. I could fly
a helicopter Benefit. Like compare

307
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.710
that to when we were
teenagers, it's like, no internet,

308
00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.830
no, This is the thing.
So I'm trying to teach

309
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:25.210
my children, patients because patients
for me was posting something

310
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.950
on CompuServe and waiting two
weeks, maybe getting response. I

311
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.890
guess patients on the internet
now is posting something on

312
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.200
stack overflow and then returning
to it two weeks later

313
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.840
to find your own question
and you're all alone. And

314
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.540
no one, no one cares,
But it's, it's it, you

315
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.750
know, it's, again, it's sort
of crazy. Like when, no

316
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.810
matter how obscure the thing
is, like, if you, if

317
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:52.140
you type it into, into
the internet and there's no

318
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.740
answer, you're shocked. Oh yeah,
exactly. The loneliest thing on

319
00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.740
the internet is searching for
something and finding yourself alone,

320
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.830
asking about that question, because
then you know that you

321
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.780
have to go and dig
in now. Right. And figure

322
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.350
it out. But then our
responsibility as members of the

323
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.620
internet I would propose is
to then put the answer

324
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.610
out there. Yes. That's where
having a blog owning your

325
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.920
own domain. There's another thing
I want to get into

326
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.700
my kids' heads. Yeah. And
not just putting the answer

327
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.320
out there, but like being
rigorous and ethical and, you

328
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.320
know, sort of committed to
like doing your honest best

329
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.400
to, you know, that this
is as good as I

330
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.090
can do to like represent
a solution to this problem.

331
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.190
And here's how I worked
through it. And here are

332
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.820
my sources and, you know,
like trying to, you know,

333
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.310
again, like follow as much
of the scientific method as

334
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:51.320
humanly possible so that if
someone comes upon your answer,

335
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.660
they both have the assurance
that like you've gone through

336
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.550
this rigorous process, but they
also can like follow what

337
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:03.050
you did if they like
need to reproduce it. Yeah,

338
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.170
exactly. And that requires not
only an awareness of ethics,

339
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.510
and I'm glad that you
used that word, but also

340
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.740
an empathy for this individual
or individuals who are going

341
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.050
to visit your page, that
you can't see that you

342
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.180
don't even have to put
yourself in the mind of

343
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.810
someone overseas, who is bumped
into your page and they're

344
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:25.670
looking for your solution. Yep.
Hmm. That's tough bridging that

345
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.540
world is, is a, is
an ongoing challenge as a

346
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.670
parent. Hey, this is Scott.

M E L I S

355
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.730
S a that actually that
theme of being a bridge

356
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.810
is one of the things
that I wanted to ask

357
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:16.430
you about, because I have
been a chief architect at

358
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.060
a publicly traded company where
my boss was the CTO

359
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.680
and he and I were
constantly going back and forth

360
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.810
about what my job was
as chief architect and what

361
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.750
his job was as CTO.
What do you see the

362
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.540
job as a CTO versus
you were the vice president

363
00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.810
of engineering at LinkedIn, which
is very hands on, right?

364
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.710
Yeah. You know, I, I
think that struggle is actually

365
00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.040
typical because like, I don't
know that there is one

366
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.980
definition of CTO. Like I,
I always resist like folks

367
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.550
like wanted to call me
the CTO at LinkedIn and

368
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.770
in my startup ad mob.
And I resisted that title

369
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.590
at both places, because in
my mind there was a

370
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.700
clear distinction between a VP
of engineering who had operational

371
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.380
responsibility, like you add code
to build and engineers careers

372
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.560
to, you know, nurture and,
you know, make sure that

373
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.500
they were doing okay and
getting what they needed. And

374
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.130
like you had dates and,
you know, you were responsible

375
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.690
for availability and latency and
like all of these, you

376
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.960
know, sort of operational metrics.
And in my mind, like

377
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.810
a CTO was always someone
who was, you know, not

378
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:40.380
necessarily Mmm, Completely disinterested in
those sorts of operational things,

379
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.790
but their responsibility was just
a different time horizon. You

380
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.650
know, that's a, that's a
little bit of what attracted

381
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.070
me to this job. So
when Satya and I were

382
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.680
talking about it a year
and a half ago, I

383
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.500
guess, was like when we
were, w we're beginning to

384
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.470
have the conversation about what
I was going to do

385
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.610
next. After, after being a
head of engineering and operations

386
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.600
at LinkedIn for six years,
he had two problems that

387
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.560
he was looking for help
with. So one was like

388
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.930
the horizontal technology roadmap at
Microsoft. And so, you know,

389
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.390
like basically the way that
Microsoft runs is like, we've

390
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:22.410
got, we have technical people
who are running, running our

391
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.910
divisions. So, you know, Scott Guthrie
is, you know, running cloud

392
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.020
and enterprise. And like this
big group of folks that

393
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.230
like now even includes the,
like the windows, the windows

394
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.650
kernel and recheck jaw is
running like all of our

395
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.270
experiences stuff. So office three
65 and our surface hardware

396
00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.690
division. And like, basically all
of the stuff that sort

397
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.660
of has a, has a
customer, a, you know, sort

398
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.740
of a consumer and customer
interface. And like, those are

399
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.720
gigantic jobs. I mean, like
truly epically, epically, big jobs.

400
00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.590
And so part of, you
know, like what Satya was

401
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.900
observing is like, when you
sit around his staff meeting,

402
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.990
like he was the only
person, only technical person, like

403
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.860
only person with engineering background
on his team who was

404
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.390
like actively trying to connect
dots between those two organizations,

405
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.700
like in terms of tech
stuff. And like, he just,

406
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.620
you know, he's also CEO
of the company. So he

407
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.200
didn't have enough bandwidth to
like, do that at the

408
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.440
sort of proper scale that
it needs to be done

409
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.870
at. And like, you know,
the other thing too is

410
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:32.340
like, you know, everybody, like
my colleagues who are like

411
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:38.280
awesome are running like super
big businesses where the operational

412
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.870
demands are like, just like,
they're, they're really intense. Like

413
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.070
they, you know, just like
you think how many people

414
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.280
and how much revenue and
like what the expectations are

415
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.590
like the whole team like
needs like a little bit

416
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.550
of an assist with like,
what's the longer out technology

417
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.470
roadmap for the company. Like,
what do we think we

418
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.340
want to be in five
years, for instance. And so,

419
00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.590
like, that's a, that's sort
of my job. Like I

420
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.170
have a team of people
here at Microsoft who are

421
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:12.080
really fantastic, who help connect
those dots across, across team

422
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.950
and organizational boundaries, you know,
and a lot of that

423
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.340
work over the past year
has been an artificial intelligence

424
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:24.650
where, you know, you've got
this technology that is becoming

425
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.670
increasingly important to like absolutely
everything you do from, you

426
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.960
know, like managing resource utilization
and cloud infrastructure all the

427
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.990
way to like how you
build the next feature in

428
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.980
Excel and like making sure
that we're connecting all of

429
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.180
those dots. And, you know,
in like a really robust

430
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:50.440
way is key to our
future success. When we, as,

431
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.820
as consumers, not as, as
techies. And, you know, I

432
00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.280
don't have any inside baseball
here, but as a consumer,

433
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.910
I've got all these new,
these voice things in my

434
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.640
house now. Right. I can
talk, I can yell at

435
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.100
Cortana and she's right there
listening. I can see her

436
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.230
on my computer. I can
turn to my right. And

437
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.990
I've got an Alexa. If
I had a Google phone,

438
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.800
I could ask Google and
what my kids all believe

439
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.770
is that that's artificial intelligence.
And they don't think it's

440
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.740
very smart because for example,
they might be watching YouTube.

441
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.460
Like you mentioned before that
they want to say, Hey,

442
00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.630
Cortana, who's that? Yeah. And
that's where it falls down.

443
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.440
Or, you know, Alexa, you,
we literally just talked about

444
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.640
this like two seconds ago
and now you're confused. So

445
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.290
then the, the, the nontechnical
partner is fairly unimpressed. I

446
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.930
would have to say, my
nontechnical partner is unimpressed. It's

447
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.090
just like, Oh, this is
artificial intelligence. I don't know

448
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.950
why Elon Musk says it's
going to kill us all

449
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:52.480
because it's just, Yeah. Now
look, I think your nontechnical

450
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.420
partners. Right. So, you know,
for like, I've like, I,

451
00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:03.370
I have been building machine
learning systems since 2004 at

452
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:10.390
Google. And, you know, like
anybody who has like a

453
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:14.170
degree in computer science, you
know, especially our age, you

454
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.410
know, just sort of remembers
what, you know, what AI

455
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.350
was like in the, you
know, in the nineties and

456
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.510
like how it's evolved. And
so, like, you know, I

457
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:27.550
think the thing that really
excites computer scientists and technologists

458
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:32.530
is when you have problems
where the data scale is

459
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:40.530
just unbelievably high. And with
the ability to like use,

460
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.590
you know, Silicon like GPU
is where you've like this

461
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.120
particular flavor of compute power.
That's very amenable to solving

462
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.760
like a particular type of
optimization problem that you need

463
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:56.280
to like, do parameter fitting
for deep neural networks. We

464
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.950
may just like an incredible
amount of progress over the

465
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.850
past, you know, six or
seven years. And the places

466
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.050
where like, stuff has really
is legitimately smart is perception.

467
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:12.840
So recognizing speech, labeling objects
and images like is really

468
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.910
good now. And, you know,
like we've also gotten good

469
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.860
at playing like particular flavors
of, you know, games with

470
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.160
like some degree of strategy
involved in them. So like

471
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.440
go and chess and Dota
and ms. PAC man. But

472
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.300
yeah, I mean, like in,
in the limit, like we

473
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.650
have a long way to
go before we have either

474
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:44.760
single systems or confederations of
machine learning systems that live

475
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.920
up to the human expectation
of intelligence. Yeah. I did

476
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.350
not work in AI in
the nineties, so I don't

477
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.560
have that historical kind of
feeling like I do around

478
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.160
the web. I know I
can look at a modern

479
00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.290
browser and go, wow, this
is so much better than

480
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:02.660
Netscape navigator. Right. Like, I
can feel that my gut

481
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.450
and I have like an
Nvidia GPU, and I can

482
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.920
say this is so much
better than a three D

483
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:12.320
effects or a Hercules monochrome
card. Yeah. Do people, do

484
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.540
you working in, like you
said, you worked on this

485
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.090
at Google many years ago.
Do you have that same

486
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.670
feeling where I can go?
Yeah. Remember doom number quake.

487
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.830
Now look at the Xbox
one X, see how much

488
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.080
better that is. Do you
feel that in your chest

489
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.120
around AI? Yeah, I, I
do. You know, and like,

490
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.230
look, I, I chose not
to specialize in AI when

491
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.340
I was in grad school.
Yeah. And like, this is

492
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.720
like, I th what I'm
about to say will like,

493
00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.580
people will be like, Oh,
you made a weird choice.

494
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.160
So like, I, I was,
I looked at AI then,

495
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.530
and I'm like, Oh God,
this is like, awful. Like

496
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.840
most of the people who
were doing it were, and

497
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.290
no offense to those people
were doing, you know, sort

498
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:58.460
of like robot task planning
and, you know, Well, that's

499
00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.440
what, that was the state
of the art though. Yeah.

500
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.840
Yeah. State of the art.
And so, like, I chose

501
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.840
to be a compiler guy,
like God almighty, like that's

502
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:13.430
another whole can of Darkery,
but I, you know, like

503
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.910
I, that, that sort of
assignment that I got when

504
00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.860
after I was at Google
for just a, just a

505
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.070
few months, was like, we
had a practical problem that

506
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:27.140
we needed solved with, with
machine learning. And it wasn't

507
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.400
very sophisticated machine learning at
the time, but we were

508
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.570
able to do, you know,
what I thought was like

509
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:39.140
a really amazing job solving
the problem, mostly because we

510
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.040
had a ridiculous amount of
data to use build these

511
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.790
statistical models, the amount of
data that we were training

512
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.420
on back then, and like
what the statistical models could

513
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.970
do, or just nothing in
comparison to what, what we're

514
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.990
doing now. It's funny how
the word order of magnitude,

515
00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.300
like the older you get,
the more you realize what

516
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.250
an order of magnitude really
means. And then you have

517
00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.860
a couple orders of magnitude,
You know? Yeah. And this

518
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.240
is probably like 14, 15
years, probably five orders of

519
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.190
magnitude. Maybe like I can
do more sophisticated things on,

520
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.730
you know, these two tight,
next video cards. I've got

521
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.210
an, a, you know, Alienware,
Aurora machine sitting under my

522
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.100
desk at home that I
could do on a cluster

523
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.910
of a thousand machines. Not
everyone has a desk like

524
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.970
that, but I appreciate it.
But I'm someone actually online,

525
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.670
I think it was someone
at stack overflow said something

526
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.070
along the line I'm paraphrasing
very broadly, but it was

527
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.070
like, Oh, a terabyte, your
big data is a terabyte.

528
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.100
Yeah. Right. And like, and,
and somebody is going to

529
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.250
think that's adorable, like 15
minutes from now. Right. I

530
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.550
mean, because like, yeah. Oh
yeah. They're like, yeah, like

531
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.990
Ram is the new SSD.
SSD is the new, you

532
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:55.020
know, tape drive The, and
the, you know, the really

533
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.020
interesting trend line here. Like
there, there are two that

534
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.330
are sort of driving all
of this innovation. Like one

535
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:04.080
is like the explosion of
data. And like, if you

536
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.590
think data's big now, it's
like gonna be nothing compared

537
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.420
to where it's at in
a few years. Like, so

538
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:13.830
the, the shocking thing that
will be happening is, you

539
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:18.090
know, Gartner predicts that we're
going to have 20 billion ish

540
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:24.210
IOT devices connected to the
internet by 2020. And like,

541
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.030
and like, you know, some
people think that, you know,

542
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:30.900
we're gonna like start seeing,
you know, eight, 9 billion devices

543
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.540
a year coming online. And
like, all of those things

544
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.150
are like benefiting from Moore's
law. And like all of

545
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:42.660
this, like, you know, the
fact that GPU, like technology

546
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.900
that, you know, sort of
started off as like a

547
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.750
gaming thing that then migrated
into the cloud to train

548
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.260
machine learning models that, you
know, now all of us

549
00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:55.530
are working on a, you
know, sort of Silicon to

550
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.650
like, make that go even
faster is gonna like, be

551
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:03.060
available for cheap, you know,
in all of these IOT

552
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.120
devices. And like all of
those things, like their, their

553
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.640
point in the world, like
the reason that they will

554
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.760
exist is to like, have
sensors on them and to

555
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.600
gather data about the world.
I think about a, like

556
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.120
a self driving car, for
instance. Yeah. Th these things

557
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:23.370
are moving terabytes of data
a second around from LIDAR

558
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.520
and vision systems and whatnot.
And like, the car itself

559
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.150
looks like a little data
center on wheels. And like,

560
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.200
this is just 2018. Like,
imagine what the world's going

561
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.390
to look like 10 years
from now. Oh my goodness.

562
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.950
I just, I don't feel
comfortable rebooting my bulb. Like

563
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.380
I don't feel my legs
go full stack. You know,

564
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.200
I recently put in a
smart switch. So it was

565
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.400
like, what kind of light
bulbs did you get? And

566
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.930
I was like, yeah, I
think a switch is fine.

567
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.000
I would like my house
to be even dumber than

568
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.520
that. Like, I'd like to
centralize the smart, I don't

569
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.610
want to boot up windows
on a light bulb any

570
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.320
more than I want it
on a switch. I want

571
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.280
it in some smart hub
wiring of my house should

572
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.700
be smart, not the switch
or the light bulb. Yeah.

573
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.960
But yeah, I think, you
know, like back to what

574
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.620
your kids are experiencing. So
like, we have set this

575
00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:16.930
expectation with 'em that you
talk to your technology and

576
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.270
that it understands what you're
saying to it and is

577
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.940
able to respond, which means
that like, everything's going to

578
00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.700
have to have smarts built
into it. Like, that's just

579
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.280
what they're going to expect.
And like, they will, I

580
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.470
mean, this is the amazing
thing about human beings, right?

581
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:32.980
Like we like a whole
bunch of us, like watch

582
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.070
star Trek and star Wars
when we were little kids

583
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.500
and like, you know, saw
all of this crap and

584
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.690
like, you know, we were
like, yeah, this is be

585
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.080
like, we spent our entire
lives, like trying to manifest

586
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.190
it. That's what kids are
gonna go do Is like

587
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.510
the, you said a lot
of cool stuff, but that's

588
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.010
like, that's like the deepest
thing you said so far,

589
00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.500
because that's really what happened.
Right. Like all of these

590
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.950
tablets. Yeah. You know, captain,
captain Picard, we had at

591
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:59.890
first, you know, talking to
the computer, Scotty, picking up

592
00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:03.880
the, the Apple mouse in
star Trek for computer, you

593
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.160
know, like that's what we're
trying to build. And we've

594
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.390
been trying to build this
for 50, 60 years and

595
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.940
we won't be satisfied until
we get it done. We

596
00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.490
will not have last thing
I wanted to ask you.

597
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.570
I hear that you're starting
a monthly podcast. So you're

598
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:20.350
jumping into the game. Right.
I am. And, and, and

599
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:25.210
like, I hope to learn
from, from folks like you,

600
00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.940
the thing, the thing that,
you know, that I want

601
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.560
to be doing with my
podcast is I want to

602
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.250
celebrate some of the unsung
heroes that are behind the

603
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.860
tech that we all use
every day. And like, one

604
00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.590
of my, one of my
first guests is going to

605
00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:45.550
be this guy who, who
invented a turbo Pascal. Like,

606
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.560
do you, did you use
turbo Pascal when you were

607
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:51.160
a teenager When I was
a full grown adult? Yeah,

608
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:56.620
absolutely. Yeah. I mean, so
like, yeah, I was sort

609
00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.920
of reflecting on this like
a little bit, like, I

610
00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.440
don't know whether I would
have had a career in

611
00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.860
technology if it weren't for
a turbo Pascal. So I,

612
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:10.720
I learned to code on
a Tandy color computer to

613
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:15.220
when I was 12 programming
and basic. And then, you

614
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.800
know, like some flavors of
assembly language, like 65 Oh

615
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:23.560
two and Z 80 assembly.
And like, when I went

616
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.430
to the science and technology
magnet school, when I was

617
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.410
a senior in high school,
like I was lucky enough

618
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.440
to, like, I went to
this rural, like school in

619
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.430
the middle of nowhere and
like two kids, two kids

620
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:40.740
from our school Got to
go to this, this thing.

621
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.630
And so, like, I was
lucky enough to be one

622
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.380
of the two kids. And
I took like a real

623
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.890
computer science course for the
first time there. And we

624
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.610
programmed in turbo Pascal five
five, which was, I think

625
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:56.040
the point where they introduce
object Pascal. And it was

626
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.100
like, Oh my God, like,
this is amazing. Like this

627
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.250
isn't hacking, this is programming.
Like, this is like, you

628
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:07.080
can build real software, like,
yeah. Are you interviewing Phillipe

629
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.790
con or Andrew's housework? Andrews
Hillsburg I worked on Delphi

630
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:15.810
as well. Oh, wow. That's
awesome. I used to do

631
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:19.470
Delphi and I would drop
into inline assembler because sometimes

632
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.110
you just need inline assembly.
Sometimes you did. I mean,

633
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.600
like the screen buffers were
slow, man. That's what I'm

634
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.510
saying. And you know, even
now thinking about Pascal generally

635
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:31.860
free Pascal on free a
free pascal.org is an open

636
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.960
source compiler for both Pascal
end and open Pascal. And

637
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.430
you could write Pascal on
like a Nintendo wi yeah.

638
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.560
They can compile it to
a game. Boy, you know,

639
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.910
when, when <inaudible>, I mean,
C is portable, but free

640
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.720
Pascal is best. I will
have to go check that

641
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.140
out. Yes, definitely. So, you
know, like the idea is

642
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.810
like, let's talk to some
of these folks who may

643
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.190
be people outside of the
industry, or like maybe only

644
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.740
the deep ciders inside of
the industry even know about

645
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:06.720
who did things that touch
an entire generation of programmers

646
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.890
and like understand, you know,
some of the like interesting

647
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:15.540
things about their experience, creating
these things. What is the

648
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.860
name of the show and
how do we find it?

649
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.700
It's going to be called
behind the tech and you'll

650
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:23.340
be able to find it
wherever you find a podcast.

651
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:31.110
So everywhere, everywhere the iTunes
store, Spotify, Google play or

652
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.170
wherever it is that kids
go these days. Very cool.

653
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.910
When, when can we go
and check that out in

654
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.730
the next couple of months?
Next couple of months. Very

655
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:41.040
cool. Well, thank you so
much, Kevin Scott for chatting with

656
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.280
me today. Thank you. It's
been great. This has been

657
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.370
