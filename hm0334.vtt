printing Kickstarter, the ultra bot.
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

10
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.770
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

11
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.250
talking to William steel, bill
Steele, creator of the ultra

12
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.580
bought a modification of a
popular three D printer. How's

13
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.920
it going, bill? I'm very
good. So I'm starting to

14
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.380
think about three D printing.
I've talked to Pete Brown

15
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.920
about this a couple of
times the kids are always

16
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.430
breaking toys and plastic stuff.
So I've got this idea

17
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.850
that I'll just put my
three D printer next to

18
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.690
my inkjet printer. And when,
you know, GI Joe loses

19
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.630
an arm, I will just
print out a new GI

20
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.820
Joe arm. How close is
that to being real Actually,

21
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.360
that's exactly what I do
already for my granddaughter. You

22
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.570
know, she has, I'll come
up with a little toy,

23
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.730
draw it in Google SketchUp
or something like that, and

24
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.950
just send it right to
the printer and, and make

25
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.510
it, you know, an hour
later she has the part

26
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.280
or the toy. Really? That
is crazy. That is amazing.

27
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.820
Okay. Well, let's start at
the basics then. So three

28
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.600
D printers kind of got
there. They're kicking the butt

29
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.940
when a thing called the
MakerBot cupcake came out and

30
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.750
you talk about that and
why did that change things?

31
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.480
Yeah. Prior to that, prior
to the open source community

32
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.870
effort around three D printing
three D printing was left

33
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.500
for big manufacturers with lots
and lots of money that

34
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.080
was, you know, starting in
the early eighties. And those

35
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.260
machines were really, really expensive
and the parts they produced

36
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.960
really weren't, you know, the,
you couldn't use them for

37
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.640
anything. And then several years
ago, I believe in 2005,

38
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.170
2006 timeframe, a gentlemen over
in England named Adrian Boyer

39
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.040
developed a machine called the
rep rap, which was an

40
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.330
open source three D printer
designed to self replicate, designed

41
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.240
to be able to produce
its own parts, to, to,

42
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.500
you know, allow a new,
new type of economy. If

43
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.320
you will, where, where we
don't have a supply chain,

44
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.220
we simply have a, a,
a machine that produces the

45
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.650
parts and locally, and he
thought about it and he

46
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.890
thought it would be really
neat to have a, a

47
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.560
device that was able to
self replicate much the same

48
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.810
way that the, a plant
and a, you know, an

49
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.870
animal have a symbiotic relationship.
He thought maybe a human

50
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.810
and a printer could have
a symbiotic relationship where one

51
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.110
supplies, the other one material
and there, and, you know,

52
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.550
that allows one to reproduce.
And then the benefit is

53
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.500
it also allows it to
be used for other things,

54
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.150
you know, creating blown, knickknacks
and toys and whatnot. And

55
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.040
that first product that he
produced was called Darwin. And

56
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.680
right about that same time
I, a group of guys

57
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.860
up in New York city got
together and they decided that

58
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.930
they wanted to use a
laser cutter to make a

59
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.400
three D printer. And they
designed a machine around the

60
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.030
original Darwin that they called
the MakerBot and their first

61
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.390
product was called the cupcake.
And the cupcake was given

62
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.880
its names simply because one
of the, one of the

63
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.770
guys on the team actually
liked to cook. And he,

64
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.760
he realized that, that this
3d machine could be used

65
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.900
to actually decorate a small
cupcake and the machine could

66
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.820
actually make a part about
the size of the cupcake

67
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.550
as well. And that, that
actually led, you know, into

68
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.610
a product that he called
the MakerBot cupcake, which was

69
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.140
the first, you know, really
mass produced three D printed

70
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.030
that you could just go
by. And when I say

71
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.490
mass produced, it was actually
low volumes. They probably sold

72
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.660
3000 of them total, but
they, they were kits and,

73
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.570
you know, hobbyists like myself
purchased them. And, you know,

74
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.640
we built them and played
with them for years. And,

75
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.890
and I, during the playing
of them, I realized that

76
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.030
there was a, a need
to improve it specifically for

77
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.150
my own use. So I
thought about redesigning some of

78
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.940
the components and redesigning, you
know, the, the, the way

79
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.640
the whole unit kind of
worked to better suit my

80
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.250
needs. And that's, that's kinda
what led me down the

81
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.820
path today, where I am
with the ultra bot. So

82
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.970
the, the MakerBots, the originals,
they were made of wood,

83
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.450
right? Yeah. Yep. The, they
actually, the original Darwin was

84
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.880
actually made out of threaded
robs and plastic parts that

85
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.680
could be printed on another
printer. You know, you went

86
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.120
to the hardware store and
you bought a whole lot

87
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.730
of parts. And then the
MakerBot guys, you know, they

88
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.380
had their laser cutter and
they thought, wow, we could,

89
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.600
we could really speed up
the process of manufacturing these

90
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.050
things if we use laser
cut parts. So that's what

91
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.030
they did. They, they used
a nice Birch plywood that,

92
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.540
that actually made, you know,
made it really easy to

93
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.210
assemble the printer, kind of
like Ikea furniture set up,

94
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.930
you know, building them became,
you know, instead of being

95
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.600
a month or two long
process, I got it down

96
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.730
to four or five days,
you know, you could, you

97
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.850
could easily build one of
these printers. And the, that

98
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.500
was actually one of the
things that I changed in

99
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.480
the design. I, I really
liked the idea of laser

100
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.820
cutting, but I really didn't
like the idea of having

101
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.740
a wood chassis. Cause it's
first off, it's a wood

102
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.080
chassis. It looks like a
wood chassis. It acts like

103
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.680
a wood chassis. It, it
creaks in it it's fragile

104
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.150
and it's, you know, you
don't want to get it

105
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.950
wet for example. So I
redesigned the case in acrylics.

106
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.240
So my case is pure,
clear acrylic. You know, it's

107
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.730
actually quite nice looking when
you look at it, it,

108
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.770
it, I get all kinds
of compliments because of the

109
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.670
way the machine looks. It
actually lets the little kids

110
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.950
actually see what's going on.
You know? And when somebody

111
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.840
comes up to look at
the printer, they can see

112
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.360
all the moving parts inside
of it, you know, all,

113
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.880
all the gears and the
police and the belts and

114
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.640
the motors and you know,
everything going on inside of

115
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.880
it. And that lets them
open their mind up a

116
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.770
little bit and say, wow,
this is kind of neat.

117
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.960
So fundamentally, how does this
work? I mean, I think

118
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.000
that we all understand, or
at least I understand how

119
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.970
an inkjet printer works. You
know, you've got this ink

120
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.780
in a, in a cartridge
and that ink then gets

121
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.620
dripped out onto the page.
And I assume that there's

122
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.920
some heat and some electrical
stuff going on. How, how

123
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.530
can I print something in
3d? What is my, what

124
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.980
is my ink? Ah, that's
a great question. The ink

125
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.700
is actually plastic and we
use, what's a welding wire,

126
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.510
basically. It's just a, a
1.7, five millimeter or a

127
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.670
three millimeter filament of wire,
a plastic wire. And what

128
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.700
we do is we, we
very much like a ice

129
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.980
cream, a soft serve ice
cream machine or a hot

130
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.010
glue gun. We extrude that
plastic out. Now, the way

131
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.690
we extruded is we drive
that through a tube, into

132
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.710
a hot end, you know,
a heated nozzle. And then

133
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.160
we simply move the nozzle
over our build surface. So

134
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.890
just like I was building
an ice cream cone, if

135
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.870
I would, I would turn
the novel on to start

136
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.750
extruding the soft serve ice
cream, I would place the

137
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.570
cone under it and move
the cone around to give

138
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.700
it the shape, you know,
the spiral shape of the

139
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.070
actual ice cream cone. And
then when I got to

140
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.780
the top of it, I
just shut the ice cream

141
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.960
maker off and that stops
the extrusion. And when I'm

142
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.410
done, I'm left with a
cone shaped ice cream treat.

143
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.070
We do the exact same
thing with the plastic. We

144
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.360
move, move the, well, the
MakerBot actually move the part

145
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.200
underneath the extruder. My new
design actually moves the extruder

146
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.500
overnight over there parts. So
it's a much smaller piece

147
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.410
moving around, which gives me
a much larger build area.

148
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.530
But I basically just melt
the plastic and kind of

149
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.970
just like you said, dribble
it onto a surface that

150
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.330
that's designed to catch that
plastic. And then the next

151
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.450
time, when I, when I
draw the very first layer

152
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.660
I get done, I move
the extruder up just to

153
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.720
shade, you know, just a
fraction of a millimeter. And

154
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.380
then I draw again and
then I move it up

155
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.480
again. And then I draw
again and I keep doing

156
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.000
that until I get, you
know, 100 to 200 layers

157
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.730
later, the part actually made
in three dimensions. Okay. So

158
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.080
let me see if I
get my head around this

159
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.660
because we are doing an
audio podcast and not video,

160
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.880
although people can certainly go
and see video of this

161
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:18.500
happening@ultra-bot.com. So the original MakerBot
had a, had a plate

162
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.400
and by plate it's just
literally a square that you're

163
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.350
going to print onto. And,
and it had the extruder

164
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.380
is the, the nozzle, the,
the thing that makes the

165
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.750
kind of the design as
if you were making a

166
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.930
drawing on top of a
cake and the original maker

167
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.180
about would move the plate
or the nozzle. Yeah. It

168
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.890
would move the plate. It
would move the whole cake

169
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:49.850
around The entire thing. You're
printing underneath a fixed nozzle,

170
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.390
Right? Yeah. Mine is moving
the novel over the top

171
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.800
of the cake. And then
which makes it, the novel

172
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.390
is much smaller than the
cake is so I can

173
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.850
move it much further, which
allows me to create a

174
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.260
park. Well, in reality, the
ultra bod can actually produce

175
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.570
a part about six times
the volume of the original

176
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.990
MakerBot in the exact same
size chassis. It literally is

177
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.690
the exact same chassis. In
fact, I use all of

178
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.430
the, all of the major
components from the original MakerBot

179
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.670
cupcake can actually be moved
into an ultra bot. That's

180
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.800
one of the upgrades that
we did is, you know,

181
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.890
for all those 3000 MakerBot
owners out there, they can

182
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.830
actually upgrade their unit to
ultra box simply by buying

183
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.110
a new chassis and you
know, a couple other minor

184
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.710
components. They can use their
re utilize their nozzle, their,

185
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.120
their, their drive system, all
the motors, the electronics, everything

186
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.540
just ports right over to
the ultra ball. Why, why

187
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.720
wouldn't why isn't this obvious.
I mean, it seems obvious.

188
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.900
And as with all good
ideas after the fact, do

189
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.180
you think, wow, that was
obvious. What, why would they

190
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.210
make that decision to move
the entire object underneath the

191
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.310
fixed a limitation? They actually
had a very good reasoning

192
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.930
for it. When they, when
they designed the cupcake, they

193
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.390
actually had a couple of
restrictions that they had to

194
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.300
deal with. One of them
was that the, some of

195
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.880
the technology that I'm using
hadn't been invented yet, for

196
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.590
example, they needed to have
the extruder drive mechanism on

197
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.800
top of the extruder. Nobody
had developed what we call

198
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.860
the boat in the style
extruder, which has the drive

199
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.340
motor motor separate from the
actual hot end of it.

200
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.830
There's minor separated by about
two and a half feet

201
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.380
of silicone tubing. Now, what
it actually did was they

202
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.130
realized that with their system
and extruder packaged together, that

203
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.810
weighed about 1.6 pounds. So
they actually realized in their

204
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.350
design that their parts, because
they are limited to four

205
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.540
inches, it was a lot
easier to move the part

206
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.800
than it would be to
move the extruder. But then,

207
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.640
you know, the three D
printer technology has evolved and

208
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.340
there's been a lot more
input on it. Let's put

209
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.380
it that way. And there's
been a lot new, a

210
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.510
lot of new ideas that
have been, you know, applied

211
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.690
to three D printing that
I simply applied to their

212
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.090
old design. So I kind
of removed some of the

213
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:16.680
constraints that they had with
newer technology. So the extruder

214
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.830
is the, is the fundamental,
like, that's the thing that

215
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.740
could be most improved when
one is, is doing this.

216
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.800
Just like there was a
time when inkjet printers would

217
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.910
do like 150 DPI and
then 300 and then 600

218
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.850
and now 1200. And it
was all a nozzle based

219
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.730
stuff. It wasn't the moving
around of the paper. It

220
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.810
was the improvements in the
nozzle, Right? Yeah. The a,

221
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.990
that's actually one of the
other technologies that we've done

222
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.960
when they originally designed their
printer, it was designed for

223
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.000
three millimeter filament and their,
the extrusion technology hadn't been

224
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.820
fully developed yet. So they
had a half a millimeter,

225
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.950
basically a resolution, if you
will. And that, because they

226
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.070
were using a half a
millimeter novel and they, the

227
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:07.080
temperature controllers and everything, you
know, hadn't been fully realized

228
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.810
that we have today in
my design, there was a

229
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.700
threat. There was another reason
for that too. And that's

230
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:17.220
the electronic controllers. And the
motors were at the time

231
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.010
set up to drive stepper
motors, one full step at

232
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.460
a time. And the electronics
that do the call 16th

233
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.050
stepping hadn't been developed yet.
So the original MakerBots to

234
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.350
produce parts, but they were
very, very rough course, you

235
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.800
know, half a millimeter resolution,
if you will, on the,

236
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.330
on the axis and with
the new electronics driving one

237
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.480
16th step, we, that automatically
gives us much, much finer

238
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.620
control over the motors and
positioning. And then the advent

239
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.940
of using 1.75 millimeter filament
allowed us to use much

240
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.750
smaller drive systems, as well
as to, to control the

241
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.200
filament faster. We can actually
do things that with the

242
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.850
modern settlements that we couldn't
do previously, for example, when

243
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.590
you move to the end
of a line and you

244
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.180
want to change layers, or
you want to move to

245
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.910
a second on the old
MakerBot cupcake, we had a

246
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.280
DC motor that would simply
stop spinning. And as the

247
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.850
head was moving, the heat,
the plastic that was in

248
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.710
the nozzle would kind of
drivel out and it would

249
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.740
leave a string filament between
the two parts. And you

250
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.830
would have to shave that
off with a modern setup.

251
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.200
We actually use a small
stepper motor to drive the

252
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.530
extruder instead. And with the,
with the stepper motor, we

253
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.780
can actually quickly reverse it
when we get to the

254
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.480
end of the line. And
that quick reversal will actually

255
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.480
suck the plastic that's in
the right, at the end

256
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.110
of the nozzle, back up
into the nozzle so that

257
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.390
it doesn't dribble out. And
then we move over to

258
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.460
the next part. And right
before we get to the

259
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.490
part, we start the nozzle
back up a little bit

260
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.470
earlier than we would have
normally. And that repopulates, that

261
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.440
nozzle with that melted plastic
so that when it starts

262
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.280
to extruded, it's definitely there.
And that, that made the

263
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.930
quality drastically improved. I mean,
just by incredible mounts, simply

264
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.450
by adding a little bit
of logic and a little

265
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.340
bit of more, you know,
a little bit more technology

266
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.010
there. And the nice thing
is, is this is a

267
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.810
very, very simple change that
now every single three D

268
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.910
printer out there that is,
you know, from the open

269
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.730
source community uses this exact
same technique. So that's interesting.

270
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.650
There's two, two questions there
that kind of came up

271
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.920
in my mind first is
there there's logic. So there

272
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.310
was a software change where
someone said, when you're moving

273
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.040
at a little, you know,
for lack of a better

274
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.050
word, a little body English
on it, put a little

275
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.710
spin on it and things
improved. And then there's also

276
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.850
the actual physical changes to
the device itself in the

277
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.600
improvements in the extruder and
in the motors, did, did

278
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.460
the stepper motor not exist
or was it just that

279
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.440
no one had ever gotten
around to saying, Oh, we

280
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.280
should use your stepper motor,
duh. You know, I, it

281
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.650
was the second one that
net promoters existed because that's,

282
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.080
we're using the exact stepper
motors that we used on

283
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.060
all the other axes, the
X, Y, and the Z

284
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.290
axis. They use the exact
same motor. It's just that,

285
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.290
for some reason, it was
never applied to the, the

286
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.400
extruder at that point. But,
but you're right, that, that

287
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.800
the software change was also
required. That that little bit

288
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.740
of English, I love that
term that you apply to

289
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.610
it, that's actually done, you
know, in the, the, the

290
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:30.040
software that actually calculates the,
the, what we call the

291
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.950
toolpath. So when you, when
you create a model, you

292
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.620
create it in a, you
know, a tool like AutoCAD

293
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.530
or Google SketchUp or something
like that. And then you

294
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.410
convert it into, what's known
as an S T L

295
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.460
file. And STL is a
stereo lithography file. It's basically

296
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:50.680
a file designed for three
D printers that then gets

297
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.070
what we call sliced slice
here. There's a couple of

298
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.780
different programs that do that,
but it's slices that, that

299
00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.580
STL file up into the
layers. And then it calculates

300
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.000
the, the tool path that,
you know, the, the extrusion

301
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.350
motion over the build surface,
which generates all the logic

302
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.080
to, you know, that we
actually feed the printer itself.

303
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:16.690
And that tool has seen
some pretty drastic. And just

304
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.930
by itself, pretty drastic changes
just by itself. For example,

305
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.100
the, the original version used
a tool called ski forge.

306
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.170
And this, this scheme forge
tool would take quite a

307
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.040
while to process a, an
STL file into the appropriate

308
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.810
G-code. And it also pretty
course, you had to do

309
00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.360
a lot of hand tuning
to get it, to work

310
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.230
now with a modern software.
There's a, there's a simpler

311
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:48.190
tool called slicer, and that
flasher tool, you, you really

312
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.090
just tell us that the
diameter of your nozzle, what

313
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.340
the material is and how
big your build area is,

314
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.050
and it calculates everything else
for you. And it works

315
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:03.840
incredibly quick. It's, it's about,
it's probably five to 10

316
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.320
times faster than, you know,
the old scheme forge engine

317
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.540
was W when I, when
I plug one of these

318
00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.060
into my computer, am I
just plugging in this into

319
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.280
a USB port? And what
does it show up as

320
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.080
It actually just shows up
as a, a USB port

321
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:24.140
and with a serial it's
just a serial port to

322
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.470
the actual computer. We, we
do pretty much serial over

323
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:31.580
USB, and the software is
just looking for that virtual

324
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.910
serial port. So for example,
the, the default serial port

325
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.860
that I have on all
my machines is com three,

326
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.170
cause that's the last one
that's general. So this is

327
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.040
just like those old style,
you know, RS two 32

328
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.460
to USB adapters, you know,
I plug it in and

329
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.690
it says, Oh yeah, I've
got a serial port. So

330
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.570
I assume there's no driver
needed because those are virtual

331
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.040
serial ports are built into
windows. Now That's exactly right.

332
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.960
That is exactly the way
it works. That makes it

333
00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.070
easy. It works consistently across
all offices. So for example,

334
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.680
the software that I use
to drive the ultra bought

335
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.740
is called pro interface, which
is a UI on top

336
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.290
of a couple other packages
like slicer. And there's a,

337
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.160
there's the actual calculation engine
that we call printer interface,

338
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.700
but those packages are they're
portable packages. So we, the

339
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.760
entire printer face package, for
example, will run on Mac

340
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.250
it'll run on Linux and
a run on windows with

341
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.310
no problem. You know, it's
just, just the install that

342
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.070
you want. In fact, the,
what I was doing yesterday

343
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:36.770
was I I've actually built
a, a package for iOS

344
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.710
and the Linux environments that
you could just, you know,

345
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:44.390
do a get out and
install it. So, so bear

346
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.790
with me as I try
an extended analogy here to

347
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.740
get my head around how
this works around 1989 or

348
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:57.920
1990, I was a try.
I was installing an Epson

349
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:04.070
FX, 80 dot matrix printer,
likely on two, I think

350
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.750
it was either a two
86 or something, and I

351
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.420
was running like paperclip or
some really old, or maybe

352
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:13.160
WordPerfect, but even before WordPerfect
okay, there was no concept

353
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.010
for printer driver. At that
point, you, you got a

354
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:21.260
spiral notebook fill of full
of codes and you installing

355
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.470
a printer meant that I
would sit there for, you

356
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.290
know, four to six hours
and type in codes to

357
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.440
say, here's the control code
to make bold. And here's

358
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.800
the control code to make,
you know, a Tallix and

359
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.570
you know, about a year
and a half after that,

360
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.110
of course, that became very
tedious. And then the, the

361
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.460
word processor itself would start
to support that printer. And

362
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.670
you just select it. So
basically the idea was rather

363
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.070
than the entering in all
the details, the, that got

364
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.600
moved upstream to the word
processor vendor, and then that

365
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.600
got moved upstream to the
printer vendor. And then that

366
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.460
got moved up to the
OS itself, kind of hearing

367
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.590
you say in the world
of three D printing, we

368
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:10.290
are going through that process.
This is not, We've pretty

369
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.110
much done that same process,
except that we didn't go

370
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.030
to the OS layer. We
have an abstract, we have

371
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.110
an abstracted out language called
G-code. Now that the idea

372
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.990
isn't just in the three
D world, it's actually all

373
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.620
CNC machines use this language.
It's a common language called

374
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.550
G-code and it's just handled
over serial. What is CNC?

375
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.200
Let's make sure we got
to make sure we explain

376
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.050
all of our acronyms for
our listeners. All CNC is

377
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.420
computer numerically controlled. So there's
mills and drill, you know,

378
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.840
router tables and, you know,
planting machines, there's all kinds

379
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.000
of machines that can be
automated with computers and that,

380
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.790
that language that they use
as a common language, and

381
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.300
it's called G code and
G code was developed, I

382
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.170
think literally way back in
the sixties, early seventies, and

383
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:02.820
pretty much every machine has,
has adopted that approach. The

384
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.350
G code platform itself, the
language itself is, is extensible.

385
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.290
So you might have a
generic version where you say,

386
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.680
move the X axis to
this location. And then there

387
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.400
might be a machine specific,
a code that says, okay,

388
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.660
turn the extruder on at
a temperature of 205 Celsius.

389
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.160
So there's, there's an there's
that patients for the different

390
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.940
machines, but there's a standardization
across most of the, you

391
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.700
know, the communications protocol and
everything else that goes with

392
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.210
it. And the way we
actually configure the software is

393
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.340
they basically tell it what
kind of a machine we

394
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:43.230
have. And the, the generic
form of three D printer

395
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.090
that we use is what
we call a five G

396
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.200
machine. So we use that
version of the protocol and,

397
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.020
and that's kind of built
into all the firmware of

398
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.380
the printers to understand that
version of the protocol, But

399
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.200
it seems like there's a
level of complexity for the

400
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.650
average user. Like, you know,
you described, you know, the

401
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.450
speed at which it goes
and how it talks to

402
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.130
the motor and all these
kinds of things. That would

403
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.360
be like me telling my
dot matrix printer, how fast

404
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.130
turn the paper and how
hot to make the ink

405
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.070
and how quickly to go
back and forth. That's, that's

406
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.200
not something that I think
my wife or my mom

407
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.660
or my dad would want
to do. Will that ever

408
00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.180
be abstracted away entirely, or
will I always have, Actually

409
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.970
that is attracted away right
now. That's what the slicer

410
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.090
software actually does. You tell
it that you're printing with

411
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.200
abs and it knows which,
what temperatures to run the

412
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.350
extruder app for abs, and
it, you tell it how

413
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.840
big the filament that you're
using and how big the

414
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.960
novel is. And that's a
onetime setup. You know, that's

415
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.050
pretty much standard across the
machines. You're either using 1.7,

416
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.520
five or three millimeter filament,
and then it can calculate

417
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.590
everything else based off of
that. So, you know, it's

418
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.090
a one time setup you're
plugging in, you know, three

419
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.710
or four values and it's
configured for the machine. Oh,

420
00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.310
okay. So this is cool.
So I'm, I'm sitting here

421
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:04.150
with, in my hand and
I'm looking at a adapter,

422
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.030
that's like a plastic adaptive.
You've seen these dongles that

423
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.100
you plug into your Mac
and they've got like VGA

424
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.890
on one side and something
else on the other side.

425
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.730
And it's got like a
nice plastic cover on both

426
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:20.560
sides. It's very smooth and
curved. And I, I'm trying

427
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.970
to kind of think to
myself, Oh, you know, I

428
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.810
could improve on this design.
I could change this. Could

429
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.090
I build something like that?
And would it, you know,

430
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.450
how close to this, this
polished Apple dongle, would it

431
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:36.820
look Well, it, you can
build something like that because

432
00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.550
we are building things up
in layers. You are going

433
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.310
to see the layering effect
of it on, on most

434
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.590
of the surfaces. So if
you have a cube, there's

435
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.500
six surfaces, five of the
surfaces will have some kind

436
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:53.260
of texturing on the bottom
surface. The build plate is

437
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.500
very flat. So when you
extrude on it, it actually

438
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.360
will fill up any voids
and it will make that

439
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.930
surface incredibly smooth, but all
the other surfaces will have

440
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.910
some kind of texturing on
it because of the layering

441
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.940
and that layer, that texture
and the depth of that

442
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.760
texture. It's going to be
dependent on your novel, how

443
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.480
big your novel is the
finer, the nozzle, the higher,

444
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.850
the, you know, the higher,
the quality of the part,

445
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.520
if you will. But there
is a downside to that.

446
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.770
The higher quality parts actually
take a lot longer to

447
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:25.270
print because, you know, for
a 0.2, five millimeter extruder,

448
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.330
it's going to take four
times longer than a 0.5

449
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:32.350
millimeter extruder to extrude the
same diameter filament. So this

450
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.720
sounds like the kinds of
things with like draft mode

451
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.320
versus best versus photo paper
on my inkjet. Right? Do

452
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.740
I want it fast or
I want it good. Right.

453
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.420
And that's the trade off.
You have to make a,

454
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.880
with the nozzle selection that
you use. Now, that's not

455
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.250
saying you can't swap out
the nozzles, right? You can,

456
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.740
you can easily do that.
The other option is to

457
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.160
actually go with a printer
that has multiple extruders. There

458
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.120
are, these are actually coming,
you know, easily available. Now

459
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.210
I pull the latest MakerBot.
What they call the replicator

460
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.930
actually has two novels, you
know, from the factory. So

461
00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.450
you can have two different
materials to different size nozzles,

462
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.650
two different colors. So you
can make parts with a

463
00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.080
draft nozzle in it. And,
you know, a high end

464
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.860
novel, high quality nozzle. In
fact, the, the ultra bot,

465
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.370
this is actually breaking news
for everybody. The ultra VOD

466
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.500
actually was designed from the
ground up for being a

467
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.680
dual extrusion device. So it
actually has a support for

468
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.980
having two extruders built into
the unit. And you're ultra

469
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:35.200
bought. You can, people can
see this@ultra-bot.com yesterday, you launched

470
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.420
a Kickstarter and a few
hours later, you completely funded

471
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.670
your Kickstarter and you still
have a month to go

472
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.990
yup. Funded a hundred percent
funded and in less than

473
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.410
a day, that was awesome.
Yeah, it is cool. So

474
00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.920
you've got a couple different
levels here. Help me understand

475
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.910
these levels. For example, I
see there's the people who

476
00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:01.850
already have MakerBots can upgrade
for like $200, $300, but

477
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.900
at the lowest complete level,
you have a seven 99

478
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.430
level that gets you a
complete kit on assembled. Yeah.

479
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.160
The, of the seven 99
is the unassembled without the

480
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.310
heated build platform, which is
a great for using a

481
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:21.110
plastic called PLA or polylactic
acid, PLA is a plastic

482
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.320
that is made from corn
starch and sugar. And it

483
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.600
smells great when you make
parts with it. It's not

484
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.130
like you're cooking waffles. It's
actually friendly in the home

485
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.120
kind of, you know, plastic.
The, the next level up

486
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.430
from that is the a
hundred dollars more, which includes

487
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.190
the heated build plate. You
need the heated build plate.

488
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:44.780
If you're going to use
a plastic called abs abs

489
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.420
is the same plastic that
Legos are made out of

490
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:52.730
a very, very hard material.
The PLA turns is more

491
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.990
sugar like, well, it's a,
it's a, it's a more

492
00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:00.860
brutal material, but it's harder.
But you know, under normal

493
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.600
use, you're not going to
break either one of them.

494
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.660
So they're, they're both incredibly
strong plastics and they're both

495
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.260
very, very easy to use
with a three D printer,

496
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:16.040
a hundred dollars gets you
the electronics, the, the heated

497
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.910
bill platform and the other
necessary upgrades actually support the

498
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.360
abs plastic. Okay. So I,
I misread that. I thought

499
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.510
that the one that says
this printer is not equipped

500
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.850
with the heated bill platform
meant that there was a

501
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.430
missing part and I could
not print right off the

502
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:34.100
bat. So I can't do
seven 99. I could print

503
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.320
something immediately, as soon as
I put the thing together.

504
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.320
Exactly. Yup. When you're using
TLA, the build surface, all

505
00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.600
the only thing that I've
ever used for build suffers

506
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.290
for PLA simply blue painter's
tape. That happens to be

507
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.140
the best surface I've. I
mean, everybody in the community

508
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.410
has found for printing on
for using PLA it just

509
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:58.910
works beautifully, and it's very,
very inexpensive. So you've sold,

510
00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:05.000
you've completely funded your Kickstarter,
but of these multiple levels,

511
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.990
the unassembled ready for PLA
ready for abs, and then

512
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:14.150
the fully assembled you're selling
ones, at least on Kickstarter

513
00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.480
that are completely assembled and
include the, the build platform.

514
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.270
Why do you think people
are spending the extra money?

515
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.530
Well, I, I, to tell
you the truth, this is

516
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.230
I think the biggest miss
in the community out there

517
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.500
right now, and the fact
that having a fully assembled

518
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.860
unit for a reasonable cost
is a product that was

519
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.130
lacking. Most people do not
want to build their own

520
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.350
units. You know, they want
to just, just like you

521
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.580
don't go to a best
and buy an HP printer

522
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.310
on assembled, right. And you
buy it assemble. They want

523
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.610
to have the enjoyment immediately
when they take it out

524
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.430
of the box. And that's,
that's kind of the market

525
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.730
that I wanted to fulfill,
having a completely built unit

526
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.820
that was available for anybody
to use that, you know,

527
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.740
for somebody that aid, that
thought they didn't have the

528
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.590
time or the skills or
inner just the desire to

529
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.830
actually assemble the unit themselves.
The other thing that I

530
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.470
want to target is really
the education market. And that's

531
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.560
a, that's a market that,
you know, kind of like

532
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.450
what Apple did in the
early days they had, they

533
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.570
had units that were low
cost available to schools. This

534
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.980
is really where the big,
you know, the big advancements

535
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.330
are going to come from.
These kids are going to

536
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.870
see this technology, and they're
going to understand it, you

537
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.240
know, very, very early on
and incorporate it into their

538
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.150
lives. Just like we're seeing
today with computing, you know,

539
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.880
computing when you and I
were kids was, well, actually,

540
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.280
you're, you're a lot younger
than I am, but when

541
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.860
we were kids, you know,
competing didn't exist in the

542
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.000
home and, you know, then
along came the Apple one,

543
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.220
then the Apple twos and,
you know, machines like that,

544
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.160
that allowed us to tinker
and explore. We're really in

545
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.140
that phase right now with
three D printing, you know,

546
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.600
we have, we've got guys
that are building their own

547
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.940
printers and, you know, doing
that, and that's great, but

548
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.430
where are the Apple twos
of the world? That's where

549
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.220
we need to move. And
MakerBot kind of stepped into

550
00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.830
that with our newest machine
where they, they sell their

551
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.220
machine only as a completely
assembled machine. And that's good,

552
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.890
but still, you know, kind
of out of reach for

553
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.520
a lot of people from
a price perspective. So their

554
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.550
machine is about $2,000. And
I, I thought, well, you

555
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.580
know, we could really provide
the same kind of thing

556
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.370
for a lot less. And,
you know, in my opinion,

557
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.320
make a better looking machine.
Cause in fact there's a

558
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.540
still wood. So, So, so
the, and there's lots of,

559
00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.280
to be clear to people
there's lots and lots and

560
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.070
lots of different choices out
there and, you know, explore,

561
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.900
cause I'm sure that there
are other literally dozens of

562
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.410
different kinds of printers that
they could use, but yours

563
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.040
is a, is a improvement
and enhancement on the original

564
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.850
MakerBot. It is of your
own design that you kind

565
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.030
of inherits from the good
things and improves the things

566
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:53.340
you didn't like, but it's
effectively a, an advancement on

567
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.860
the MakerBot cupcake that allows
you to print much, much

568
00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.510
larger stuff. Exactly. Yeah. And
you said it earlier. I

569
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.910
do not under, I mean,
there are a lot of

570
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.370
choices out there and you
know, if you're in the

571
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.620
market for a three D
printer and you want to

572
00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.030
do a kid or you
want to do, you know,

573
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.770
you want to learn about
it. There are a lot

574
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.900
of great machines that are
a lot lower costs. I

575
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.300
mean, no, no kidding. There's
there's machines that you can

576
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.200
buy for four or $500.
Remember it's a four or

577
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.020
$500 machine in a kit
form. You're going to get

578
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.210
a lot more for your
money than a pre-assembled unit.

579
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.820
And, you know, that's, that's
going to show through, but

580
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.030
the idea is that, you
know, what I personally want

581
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.850
is I want the awareness
out there because I honestly

582
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.880
believe that three D printing
is, is simply going to

583
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.730
change the economics of the
future. You know, today we

584
00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.910
have a supply chain that
stretches to, you know, as

585
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.940
far as China and central
China. And, you know, if

586
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.490
I want to buy a
comb, it's, for some reason,

587
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.100
it's cheaper for them to
produce that comb all the

588
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.960
way in China and ship
it all the way across

589
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.450
the oceans and warehouse. And
then these buildings and, you

590
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.310
know, do all this stuff
for me to, to go

591
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.160
buy this comb on for
99 cents, hanging on a rack

592
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.270
at a dollar store, you
know, that that's mind boggling

593
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.180
that things are that cheap,
but if we could eliminate

594
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.300
all of that other, you
know, other stuff in between

595
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.500
by using a device like
this, we could, we can,

596
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.210
for example, bring back manufacturing
to the U S and

597
00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.190
make it, you know, you
know, get us back to

598
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.580
the point in the, in
the world economy where we

599
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.910
belong. You know, so for
example, the, that same comb,

600
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.520
if I wanted to print
a comb, in fact, if

601
00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.740
the comb that I have
in my back pocket right

602
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:36.440
now is copy of the
old black unbreakable comb that

603
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.340
I printed on my printer.
It took maybe 15 minutes

604
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.950
at the most, and I
didn't have to go anywhere

605
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.380
to do it. It's made
out of abs plastic and

606
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.150
it works just the exact
same way as any other

607
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.970
comb I've ever had. Right.
And you didn't have to

608
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.200
draw, you didn't have to
get in your car and

609
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.620
drive to Walmart to do
it. That's fantastic. So people

610
00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:59.500
can learn more about your
ultra bot@ultrahyphenbot.com. I'll add a

611
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.450
link in the show notes
for people to check it

612
00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.420
out. And there's multiple videos
up there that will give

613
00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.540
people an idea of how
it works, and they'll be

614
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.880
able to see it in
action and then talk to

615
00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.030
you and leave comments and,
and learn about the, how

616
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.870
three D printing works. Yeah.
Yup. Fantastic. Well, thanks a

617
00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.220
lot bill for taking the
time to talk to me.

618
00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.940
Thank you so much, Scott.
This has been another episode

619
00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.310
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
