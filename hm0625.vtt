10
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.420
All right, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

11
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.330
of Hansel minutes and I've
got Arlen Hamilton, founder of

12
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.360
backstage capital. You were on
the show two years ago,

13
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.930
and I think I was
less than professional. You are

14
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.120
so professional, but I was
going to tell, I was

15
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.700
going to say, well, we
should say that Christie's here.

16
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.230
Christy beds. Hello. Hi. Ooh,
Christie pits is my investment

17
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.420
partner at backstage capital and
she's with us today in

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.930
Portland. I should say that
I wasn't talking smack. I

19
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.110
was gonna say to Christie.
So we recorded like two

20
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.500
years ago. I had just
met Scott, just probably a

21
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.450
couple of days prior to
that at, at an event.

22
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.620
Right. And he came and
he recorded at the hotel

23
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.670
and he came in, he
didn't have a couple pieces

24
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.060
of equipment that he needed,
but it was fine, you

25
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.800
know, but it was, I
was just like, huh, I

26
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.710
wonder, you know, cause I
hadn't done many podcasts at

27
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.050
that point and you know,
hadn't met a lot of

28
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.060
people in Texas. I was
just like, what's going on

29
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.920
here? And I, it was
fine. It was, I was

30
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.770
in a rush I'll whatever,
as soon as he pushes

31
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.960
record though, it's like, you're
transported into another world. You're

32
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.200
so professional. Like you're so
good. It's almost like it's

33
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.860
the second skin that you
put on or something it's

34
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.500
really good. It reminds me
a lot of musicians who

35
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.350
just go on stage and
they're on, or are actors

36
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.140
who are just like shooting
the breeze and then they're

37
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.450
like, action. And then boom,
they're there. You know? So

38
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.450
yeah, I thought it was
really interesting. That's very kind.

39
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.280
I appreciate the compliment. And
if, if, if I may

40
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.520
then thinking about how you
were at the time you

41
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.730
were, if I may say
somewhat shy, you were a

42
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.470
little nervous and you said
that you didn't do a

43
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.770
lot of public speaking truth,
all of that, but you

44
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.680
now have a podcast of
your own and you are

45
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920
the subject of another podcast.
That's right. So do you

46
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.250
consciously take things that you
are either uncomfortable with or

47
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.730
you're not like not your
specialty and then just keep

48
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.860
doing them until you become
an expert at them? Depends

49
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.890
on my interest level. So
I don't necessarily do that

50
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.010
for everything, but if I
am really interested in and

51
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.050
really get, have it in
my head that I, I

52
00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.000
need to do something to
be better or Sorry, hang

53
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.170
on. There might be an
edit point there. Did you

54
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.790
take it off airplane mode?
Yeah. Yeah. It might be

55
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.310
me cause I'm on an
airport. No airport. We have

56
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.050
to be on air. I
think I can do it

57
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.760
when you took it off.
I can do about 30

58
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.000
seconds ago. It started again.
I apologize. I'll do it

59
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.560
too. I realized that that's
asking you for you to

60
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.810
be disconnected for Yeah. There's
a lot that goes on

61
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.540
in our, in our phones,
Scott. I don't know Actually,

62
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.190
you know what I thought
would be an edit point.

63
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.810
I think we'll just keep
it in there because we're

64
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.570
in this case, sometimes you're
on your phone and you're

65
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.990
doing a podcast. You can
hear the email. Yeah. Who

66
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.460
is Shane? And I can
hear it like a ghost

67
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.770
anyway, even when I'm not
really hearing it, I hear,

68
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.890
I hear emails going, getting
home or like buzzing in

69
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.700
my pocket. Even when there's
nothing there It's changed in

70
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.290
the last two years. Is
this just, is it an

71
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.590
order of magnitude more? Huh?
When it comes to me

72
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.280
not being shy, not being
able to speak you're right.

73
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.170
I'm flashing back to it.
And it was a very

74
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.980
different situation about a year
ago. Exactly. I spoke did

75
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.920
like my first public speaking
thing in tech and it

76
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.740
was because two months prior
I made a promise to

77
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.250
myself that I would no
longer miss out on opportunities

78
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.100
because of a, of my,
my issue with state. Right.

79
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.070
And so I had really
bad stage, right? Like, like

80
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.150
half the population does. And
it was just to me,

81
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.230
it was like, no, I'm
not, you're not going to

82
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.120
do it. I don't, I
don't do anything. I don't

83
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.400
want to do. I can
do stuff online. I can,

84
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.380
I don't have to go
in front of people. And

85
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.810
then I had two things
happen where I missed out

86
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.600
on one was I missed
getting an award that my

87
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.750
mom was attending and I
couldn't take the award because

88
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.480
I couldn't do the, it's
so silly to hear it

89
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.490
now, but I couldn't do
the acceptance speech. And they

90
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.080
needed you to be able
to do that in order

91
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.810
to be honored at this
thing. And I just told

92
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.150
them, like I just said
no, and that, and I

93
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.940
realized as I was watching
someone else get the award,

94
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.600
how not cool. That was
of me. And then the

95
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.900
second thing was I missed
out on an opportunity to

96
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.820
possibly speak with one of
my heroes, Richard Branson, because

97
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.850
he was speaking at Forbes
30, under 30, the same

98
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.310
year that I was asked
to speak and at the

99
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.670
same stage right after me.
So I had said no

100
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.160
to that because I just
put it, it was at

101
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.520
Faneuil hall, which was at
the time like saying go

102
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.640
to the white house and
speak on the lawn basically.

103
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.760
And so I said, no.
And I watched from the

104
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.700
seats and watched him speak
and watch him go back

105
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.470
to the green room where
I would have been sitting

106
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:38.100
and possibly meeting him. So
in January, 2017, I said, I'm

107
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.200
going to say yes to
three different speaking engagements this

108
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.110
year, that year. And even
if it sucks, even if

109
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.230
it's horrible, I would have
tried. So then a Neil

110
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.550
Williams who, you know, from,
from black and Brown founders

111
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.880
and from zebra con, and
if she's also a founder

112
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.870
in our portfolio, she asked
me to do something in

113
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.320
March of 2017. I reluctantly
said yes, because I had

114
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.590
already made that promise to
myself. She made it very

115
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.250
comfortable. I was terrified. There
were probably 60 people in

116
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.020
the room. Tops still terrified.
And then something happened when

117
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.930
she asked me the first
question, like I was terrible.

118
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.750
I was off on the
side, just like shaking and

119
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.850
Christie knows you was there.
Like I was like, it

120
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.130
was can confirm. It was
like really it was, my

121
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.220
heart was pounding. And I
was like, why, how did

122
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.620
I get here? And actually
someone offered to like, go

123
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.770
get me alcohol. Because at
the time I used to

124
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.710
drink and quite a bit
and they were like, can

125
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.090
I get you something? Cause
they wouldn't get me something

126
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.070
to drink, but I didn't
drink it. And so I

127
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.950
got there, got on to,
you know, get in the

128
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.920
seat with the microphone. It
was being live streamed as

129
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.870
well. And something about that
first question, she asked me

130
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.170
that first question and I
looked out and the audience

131
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.470
and I was just like,
there's people just like smiling

132
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.910
at me. And like, I
felt like it was so

133
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.350
much more important that I
said, I shared then me

134
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.960
being about myself and how
scared I was, it felt

135
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.420
like someone was going to
get something from it. And

136
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.910
then that started being proven
over and over again, when

137
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.740
people would come up to
me and say, Hey, I

138
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.110
saw you speak at this
thing. And like that inspired

139
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.780
me to do this other
thing or something like that.

140
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.140
And, and when I realized
that it wasn't important that

141
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.720
I sounded super smart or
if I knew it didn't,

142
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.630
it wasn't important that I
didn't know everything. Right. It

143
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.610
was more important that I
showed up and then I

144
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.940
shared, and then I gave
of myself and then when

145
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.990
it became about other people,
that's really easy to convince

146
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.430
me to get over something.
When I, when I sometimes

147
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.640
I'll come into contact with
young people that are on

148
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.290
stage or I'm coming off
stage and they're about to

149
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.900
come on after me or
whatever. And I was talking

150
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.870
with a young woman who
was an intern at Microsoft.

151
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.360
And I didn't realize that
after me, she was going

152
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.070
to be giving her first
talk ever. And I could

153
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.590
tell she was vibrating with
that. Like what have I

154
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.680
done? Yes. Right. What have
I signed up for? And

155
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.080
I was trying to figure
like, what am I supposed?

156
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.130
I was expected to like,
kind of like say something

157
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.460
inspirational or like just, and
I just said, everybody here

158
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.920
wants you to succeed. This
audience is not against you.

159
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.660
They want you to kick
butt and they're going to

160
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.060
cheer when you do. And
I don't know if that

161
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.300
helped or not, but she
did kick butt. Yeah. So

162
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.490
that's my, now my go
to thing, like remind them

163
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.890
that the audience loves you
that's they came to see

164
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.280
you. So, yeah. And I,
and I think that's definitely

165
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.880
helpful. And I know for
me at that point, I,

166
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.750
everything that people said to
me just sounded scary. So

167
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.320
what I try to say
to people is like, yeah,

168
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.530
you could suck, you know,
what's but what will happen

169
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.480
if you do? You know,
what's the worst that could

170
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.550
happen if you do this?
W what's the worst that

171
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.500
could happen is a big
statement that can get people

172
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.110
twisted off into their own
minds. You know what I

173
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.980
mean? Cause really bad stuff
could potentially, yeah. I think

174
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.940
it Comes down to, you
know, it's a lot, like

175
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.920
a lot of things like
stopping a vice or something

176
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.590
it's like it has to
come from within. It has

177
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.360
to be your time. It
has to come from, you

178
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.520
can get advice from everybody.
You can hear things and

179
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.310
maybe those things will echo
in your mind. But when

180
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.300
it comes down to overcoming
a fear like this and

181
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.120
like so many other types
of fears, it really just

182
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.420
comes down to you have
that moment, I think. Right?

183
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.070
I mean, I've, I've had
that a few times. I

184
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.140
read, I read an article
that that was talking about

185
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.900
why people have their vices
and why they fail to

186
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.050
stop smoking or why they
fall off their diet. Like,

187
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.330
I'm on like another diet
right now. And my wife

188
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.980
is like, you know, you
always do this for a

189
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.680
couple of months. I log
every calorie. And then I

190
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.950
stopped. Right. And I read
this article that said, we

191
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.640
have a Wells of willpower
and that well, that well

192
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.600
of willpower can be depleted.
I don't remember figuring out

193
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.770
how to fill it up
though. I'm hearing, I hear

194
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.790
it's like, yeah, I could
mainline diet Coke. Wow. Yeah.

195
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.210
Yes. With Lyme. What I
want to understand though, is

196
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.190
that in all the things
you're describing, whether it be

197
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.940
starting, you know, bootstrapping your,
your, your capital fund, whether

198
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.680
it be getting over public
speaking concerns, you must have

199
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.260
this infinite well of willpower.
And how do you, where

200
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.090
does this, where does this
well come from? Cause you're

201
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.470
describing all these things that
require reserves of willpower. The

202
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.230
image I just got was
that it's not a, if

203
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.760
it's a, well, then, you
know, some of it has

204
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.430
to go somewhere and it's
almost like, it's just, I

205
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:34.220
mean, you want my honest
answer. I weighed 240 pounds.

206
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.430
So yes, I have willpower
about a lot of things,

207
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.470
but it's transferred. So I
used to have a, you

208
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.290
know, I used to drink
really heavily and was not

209
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.250
able to stop until about
10 months ago. And that

210
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.030
was nothing I could control
until I could. And I

211
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.370
would say definitely I have
willpower because I don't think

212
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.160
I could have gotten here
at this point at my

213
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.520
career and what we were
doing at backstage without willpower

214
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.580
and a lot of other
things. But I think everybody

215
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.610
has that. There's something there's
some vice and I, you

216
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:10.820
know, my vice is chocolate
diet Coke, breads and cheese.

217
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.670
See, we can, we can
very much vibe over the

218
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.210
cheese and diet Coke crowd
because there's people at work

219
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.030
that I will see put
down two, three pots of

220
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.050
coffee before lunch. Yeah. Nobody
says boo. Right. But I

221
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.090
drink two diet Cokes, but
you need to take a

222
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.060
break. Yeah, Yeah. Yeah. I
mean, I think we do.

223
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.030
I think we do All
the problems I could have.

224
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.570
Like aspartame is low on
the list. Like I'm diabetic.

225
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.510
What else can I drink?
Right. The air in my

226
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.140
mouth tastes better than water.
So if I can't have

227
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.380
diet Coke, like cut me
some Slack, let me drink

228
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.480
a diet Coke. Can I
live? Oh wow. She's like

229
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.010
this podcast has taken a
turn. Take a several turns.

230
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.780
Yeah. I didn't even get
me started on cheese. We'll

231
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.650
see. I'm a string cheese.
Like I, Oh, Oh, I'm

232
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.380
sorry. I need to stop
this podcast. Yes. Do you

233
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.480
bite the string cheese or
do you pull on the

234
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.340
sides? Okay. I'm a lady.
Okay, good. Oh, of course

235
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.160
I appeal it. It's that's
what it's there. Yeah. That's

236
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.490
why it's great. Amongst the
cheese community of which you

237
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.920
and I are members. This
is the pineapple on pizza

238
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.950
question. Do you just bite
the string cheese like Savage

239
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.370
or do you peel up
people that do that? The

240
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.040
people who bite into the
kitchen? I must confess. I

241
00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.640
have punched this string cheese,
but I prefer to peel.

242
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.820
However, I will bite for
efficiency and not enough diligence

243
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.650
I have. Oh, Why you
did it to a string

244
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.320
cheese? I know we have
so little time. Do you

245
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.180
let them be disrespect? The
kid cat and you just

246
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.030
go silent. Oh, the kid
Kat. Oh, I have methodology

247
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.310
on the kit. Kat. Okay.
So the kit Kat, I

248
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.020
like, I like to, you
know how it's like, give

249
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.420
me a break. I'm going
to take a break of

250
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.840
the KickUp or what's the
frame? Is that okay? Like

251
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.590
I really do need to
break to, to kick Kat.

252
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.890
Cause it takes me about
45 minutes because I want

253
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.520
to eat all the chocolate
off. Oh. And then the

254
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.670
wafers one by one. I
don't like, That's how the

255
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.880
cat wants to be eaten.
We're judging her. We don't

256
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.950
want to be judged, but
we're judging her judgment there.

257
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.330
Meanwhile, district cheese down the
hatch. I think the next

258
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.250
time you go to buy
string cheese, you leave it

259
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.940
there for people. Yes. You
don't care The other cheese

260
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.670
that you can chew on.
Right? You can have the

261
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.880
little ones, a little baby
bell weirdo. Like the couches.

262
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.560
You can have those and
you can eat the outside

263
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.550
too. If you want to
just eat the wax, it's

264
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.340
fine. The judgment In this
room over what we eat.

265
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.290
Sorry. Okay. So this is
their vices and the well

266
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.800
of willpower is not limitless,
but you focus on the

267
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.290
things that matter to you
and you cope with that.

268
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.050
I think it's the same
thing that makes, you know,

269
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.870
it's kind of cliche, but
I am sort of I'm

270
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.290
full on whether that's good
or bad. So if I'm

271
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.710
interested in something I can
become full on and that

272
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.460
gets me starting a venture
capital fund from nothing. And

273
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.770
it also gives me like,
I'm going to eat that

274
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.430
pizza, that whole one and
own it and yeah. Yeah,

275
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.180
yeah. And so it's, it's
good. And it's bad. It's,

276
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.580
it's a, it's that double
sided sword as it were,

277
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.580
That skill though has made
this fund even more successful.

278
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.040
So the years, two years
later, since I last talked

279
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.920
to you, how many investments
have you all made? We're

280
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.150
officially at 80 Of a
hundred and that's that number

281
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.460
as well. So I said,
when I first set out,

282
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.700
I set this goal for
myself of getting to a

283
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.890
hundred companies by 20, 24,
not as a race or

284
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.310
anything, but sort of like,
I felt like that is

285
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.850
what was needed to make
the most impact and the

286
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.350
most noise. I thought that
if I invested in five

287
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.810
or six companies, that would
be really cool cause they

288
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.970
didn't have any money. So
that would be something right.

289
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.060
But I thought, you know,
I want to do something

290
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.010
that people think is impossible
because they're saying that they're

291
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.630
not enough companies even started
by women or people of

292
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.050
color or LGBT founders. So
I had to have very

293
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.840
high standards for what we
invest in. And I was

294
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.300
seeing so many companies. And
since then I see we

295
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.030
see like thousands. We see
like 1200 this year probably.

296
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.770
And it's going to, it
was like a thousand the

297
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.300
last couple of years. Hey
folks, Intel is a sponsor

298
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.120
this week. And I welcome
them because they're bringing some

299
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.540
high performance developer tools for
all of us. Check out

300
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:33.310
Intel's parallel studio X, E
I've talked about parallelism before

301
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.590
on the show and the
importance of using the complete

302
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.680
instruction set, unlocking the power
of the process or that

303
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.170
your code is running on.
Now, you all might be

304
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.500
writing C or C plus
plus Python or even Fortran,

305
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.140
but as your code building
in such a way and

306
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.000
written in such a way
that it uses the latest

307
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:56.770
techniques for vectorization multithreading multi-node
parallelization or memory optimization, Intel

308

314
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.460
comparing. Now to when we
spoke in 2016, did you

315
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.590
feel that like, kind of
you were, you were niche

316
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.960
before and now everyone knows
you. Cause like, while we

317
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.820
were walking from the first
floor to the second floor

318
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.660
of this building, you got
pitched like twice. Yeah. And

319
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.260
that's low. Yeah. You know
what I mean? And like,

320
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.910
and I was part of
it because I wanted someone

321
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.330
to meet you, but it
was just like, everyone is

322
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.450
to giving you the equivalent
of like my mix tape

323
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.390
is fire all the way
up. You know what I

324
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:51.670
mean? God, you tripping me
out, But it's true though.

325
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.680
Isn't it right? Isn't that
right? Oh, it happens all

326
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.260
day long. I mean, on
the bus to the airport,

327
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.410
I get pitched all the
time and, and it's only

328
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.320
going to get me Well
when you have a hundred,

329
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.190
when you have a hundred.
Yeah. And you know, so

330
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.470
yeah. I get pitched a
lot. I, I, the thing

331
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.810
that I set out to
do that I didn't know

332
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.370
if I would be able
to, but I knew that

333
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.550
I wanted to try that
thing is happening, which is,

334
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.030
I said, what if there
were someone that every black

335
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.300
founder in the country, if
they were starting a company

336
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.550
they would want to have
on their cap table, what

337
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.320
if there was, there was
someone and I can't say

338
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.030
that a hundred percent, dude,
I'm not going to go

339
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.350
that far, but they at
least, you know, seven out

340
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.220
of those 10 are going
to know backstage or know

341
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.520
of us. Right. And maybe
five out of 10, want

342
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.260
us on their cap table,
if not more, what does

343
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.770
that mean? Cap table cap
table is it's just a

344
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.610
list of investors in your
company. Okay. And let me

345
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.280
ask you of the questions
that some of the people

346
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.170
who will be listening to
this show will be thinking,

347
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.410
why do black and Brown
founders need an advocate or

348
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.450
a fund of their own?
Why aren't they just pitching

349
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.920
the regular quote unquote regular
way? <inaudible> they are, they

350
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.810
are pitching the quote unquote
regular way. Okay. They're just

351
00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.340
there, there's a lot of
bias. And there are a

352
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.960
lot of roadblocks for, for
black and Brown founders that

353
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.500
are just inherently there. And
they're, you know, I said

354
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.240
that two years ago and
I can tell you with

355
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.360
Emily even more now I
know You've been both on

356
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.910
the inside and the outside.
Yeah. Yeah. And th th

357
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.140
th we talk about data
collection. I mean, we have

358
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:36.740
it, we see it in
droves and there's just, there's

359
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.600
so much, now there's so
much to that question now

360
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.580
because it's more than it
was when I started. It's

361
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.360
when I started two years,
a lot has happened in

362
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.230
the war, in the world.
And the things that I

363
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.490
couldn't have imagined with backstage
have happened, where in some

364
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.840
cases it's just about, I
recently had someone contact me

365
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.530
who, who is in a
very competitive, competitive round. Okay.

366
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.520
Oversubscribed, you couldn't get into
the round, but they wanted

367
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.330
backstage just because they didn't
have any women of color

368
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.330
on their cap table on
their list of investors. So

369
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.960
translate some of that into
layman's language. So oversubscribed, meaning

370
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.270
that everyone wanted to invest
in them. Yeah. So that's

371
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.730
another thing that you do
very well. Scott here, you're,

372
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.140
you're you're your own person.
Okay. I know. I just

373
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.030
want to advocate for the
listener. You are you're, you're

374
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.010
so good at that. I
see I'm learning. Cause I

375
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.170
have my own podcast. I'm
learning more and more from

376
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.600
you. Okay. So this, this,
this people, they were oversubscribed.

377
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.020
So this company went out
there. The example I just

378
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.770
gave. So this company had
already raised the amount of

379
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.050
money that they wanted to
raise, that they set out

380
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.420
to in a very quick
amount of time, which is

381
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.570
not normal. And then on
top of that, they had

382
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.240
a waiting list of investors
saying, can we please invest?

383
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.760
Because you're such a cool
company and such a good

384
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.650
company we want in and
they show, you can walk

385
00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.240
up to them and say,
Hey, can we, can we

386
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.340
talk? I had to have,
like, I would have a

387
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.900
million dollars and I would
want to give it to

388
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.180
them. They don't even want
it. They have enough people

389
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.590
I've even, I can't give
them money. Absolutely. Wow. So

390
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.980
that same company, this is
just an example. Yeah. They

391
00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.880
reached out to me and
said, we'd like you to

392
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.750
get in before we close
this round officially legally. Interesting.

393
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.640
So they went for you
and said, we want your

394
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.500
money because we want you
on our list of people.

395
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.280
We can call investors. We
can say backstage appreciates us.

396
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.950
Yeah. And gets us and
on their list of, I

397
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.690
mean, these people, you know,
the people on the waiting

398
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.880
list and the people that
had invested her top tier

399
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.510
funds, who would just say,
they're getting a note. It's

400
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.750
almost like, think about it.
If you go, if you

401
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.300
walk up to a club
and they're they say, are

402
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.710
you on the list? Yeah.
If you're not on the

403
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.690
list, you kind of, you
can wait in line. There's

404
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.460
a chance you might be
able to get in. But

405
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.960
what they said to backstage
was, Hey, VIP, you're already

406
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.260
in, come on back, You
cut the line, open the

407
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.480
velvet rope. And then you're
in the club. Yeah. I

408
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.740
got a little bit, I
felt privileged. It was, it

409
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.760
was a little taste of
privilege that I had. So

410
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.800
let's, let's talk about that
a little bit. We've talked

411
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.200
before about how I do
like what my friend, Dan,

412
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.460
Juan Simmons invented this idea of
lending privilege, but I don't

413
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.620
lift people up. Give him
a little bump, the Hanselman

414
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.680
bump along the way. On
the way up. I talked

415
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.970
to people. I try to
talk to people that don't

416
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.510
tease me. Now I try
to talk to people on

417
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.610
that. I try to talk
to people on the come

418
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.910
up and give them some
visibility. Right. So very much

419
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.850
so. So originally, you know,
some number of years ago,

420
00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.040
and you can tell me
how many years ago you

421
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.710
were lacking in a number
of privileges, not the least

422
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.230
of which being a roof
over your head. And now

423
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.370
you're finding yourself both in
some ways, underprivileged, but in

424
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.700
some ways extremely perfect. You
could call venture people on

425
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.650
the phone. You probably can
text people that Google ventures

426
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.050
right now, as a privilege
I do not have. Yes.

427
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.300
How does that feel when
you have one foot in

428
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.670
a place of privilege and
one foot, a place It's

429
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:55.680
funny, it's a humorous ride
because within moments I can

430
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.760
experience both so I can
feel a plane. Yeah, absolutely.

431
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.070
Yeah. And I bought planes.
I probably fly four or

432
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.440
five times a week now.
So I board planes a

433
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.050
lot. I'm in first class
a lot. So I had

434
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.570
that experience of, do you,
can I see your ticket?

435
00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.180
Are you supposed to be
here a lot? And I'm

436
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.210
like, you know, you know,
While you're on the way

437
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.570
to close around, like the
irony of that. Yeah, Exactly.

438
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.690
Like I would have just
said, or I would have

439
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.530
just spent a day just
working my ass off and,

440
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.260
and working with hundreds of
thousands of dollars, you know,

441
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.900
back and forth in some
way or another. And then

442
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.130
I get on the plane
and go to the next

443
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.400
place to maybe do a
speaking engagement or meet with

444
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.110
a founder. And I'll have
that moment of, you know,

445
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.530
you're the help, you know?
And that happens every day

446
00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.430
happened within 24 hours. I
mean like of now, like

447
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.390
it happens every single day,
those microaggressions, but on the

448
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.510
other side of it, I
would, the way that I

449
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.940
describe it is that I've
been siphoning privilege for the

450
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.270
past three years. And what
I do is I see,

451
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.830
like I watch men and
I watch white people and

452
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.920
I see what they do
with their privilege. And I

453
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.650
siphoned it. Like, I don't
know, there's probably some sort

454
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.850
of, This is interesting juxtaposing
lending privilege and siphoning privilege

455
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.100
Siphon it because sometimes people
don't, there's not a lot

456
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.230
of people like you who
want to lend it. So

457
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.600
I appreciate the land, but
with the ones who are

458
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.830
not lending, boom, while they're
looking over, I have the

459
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.380
little, what do you call
it? When you're taking people's

460
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.110
gas at the car? You
know, I'm talking about Christie,

461
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.670
Christie. No, it's not that
I've done that once or

462
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.680
twice as a young person.
Yeah. Christie pits. Have you

463
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.880
ever siphoned gas? I have
not saved. And you use

464
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.090
it big straw, like, Oh
my goodness, you take it.

465
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.490
You take a bucket. And
when they're not looking to

466
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.120
get up behind car, Chris,
You say something about, so

467
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.280
I thought they got black
chain. So blonde and nerdy

468
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.480
all the time. Same When
you, when you say you

469
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.130
have to suck in on
the big, on the, on

470
00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.430
the tube and you have
to, to the Duke, that's

471
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:01.930
what I meant. But you
have to also make sure

472
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.970
if they're in the car
at the time though, you

473
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.830
have to be aware of
their line of sight so

474
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.600
that they don't look out
the rear view mirror and

475
00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.090
see you safe. You have
Siphon gas from a car

476
00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:14.380
that had, But the trick
is though, if you can,

477
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.880
if it's affirmative, it's I
neither confirm nor deny. But

478
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.420
if you can get some
older cars, then the gas

479
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.300
tank is on the back
in the old cars and

480
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.000
you unscrew it on the
back of the trunk. Right.

481
00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.180
Then you don't have to
come up on the side.

482
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.670
Cause the driver's side is
dangerous. You can't siphon gas

483
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.090
out the driver's side. You
say if one were to

484
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:40.210
theoretically siphoned gas, I don't,
I'm not so sure. So

485
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.570
you siphoned privilege. I do.
I mean, I observe it.

486
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.450
I do a lot with
privilege. I play with privilege.

487
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:54.100
I observe it. I don't
necessarily respect it. I don't

488
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.570
have any sort of, I
don't look at it in

489
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.080
awe in any way, including
my own. So I don't

490
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:06.250
have much reverence for privilege,
which means that it's really

491
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.830
easy for me to also
share mine. That was the

492
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.140
next thing I was going
to ask. I, I tweeted

493
00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.880
something a couple of weeks
ago that got like a

494
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.490
thousand tweets or whatever he
thinks. And it was the

495
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.170
most important thing that you
should do once you've made

496
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.760
it up over the ledge
is to send a ladder

497
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.160
back down. And a lot
of people really appreciated that

498
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.080
tweet. And then a bunch
of other people were like,

499
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.610
what was it? A rope
ladder? What kind of a

500
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.940
ladder? I don't think you
just kicked the ladder down.

501
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.950
And then I kept the
Twitter, Twitter, the only place

502
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.580
where you can give away
money, give away money. And

503
00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.290
someone still has a problem
and tells you how you're

504
00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.350
doing it wrong. Which I
experienced this year. I have

505
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.230
experienced that this year when
I started a nonprofit and

506
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.860
I got and Alyssa Milano
retweeted. Okay. What about that

507
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.200
nonprofit? Cause that was a
genius idea. That was micro

508
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.710
loans, right? Micro grants. Yeah,
grants. It's a total nonprofit.

509
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.890
So I, you know, backstage
capital is for profit Sharky.

510
00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.880
I get to play in
that world every day, but

511
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.580
it, it kind of just
started. I, my, my dad

512
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.420
passed away a couple of
years ago and he had

513
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.250
this little house. It was,
it was not much to

514
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.740
speak of in Jackson, Mississippi,
but then I became the

515
00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.190
owner of it. And a
couple of years later, I

516
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.280
sold it and got a
little bit of money from

517
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.310
it. And I gave my
mom some money and gave

518
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.110
my brother some money. And
then I said, Hey, I

519
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:28.480
wanna give ten five hundred dollars grants to
people who are working on

520
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.880
something cool. And it can
be for profit or nonprofit

521
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.160
that they're working on, but
just something cool. So I

522
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.770
just put a tweet up,
got a lot of response.

523
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.150
And The question was, what
would $500 do for you?

524
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.970
And it's not expecting anything
just to create, to make

525
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.780
exactly. Yeah, I'm not, I
didn't want to dictate what

526
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.640
they were doing or give
too much of a parameter

527
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.370
around it. It was more
like, cause I had done

528
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.650
something a little bit similar
on a smaller scale for

529
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.620
Christmas, just kind of went
on line and like gave

530
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.290
away a few things. And
I saw the results of

531
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.780
that like a couple of
months later and I was

532
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.610
like, this is too cool.
Like you can do something

533
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:06.210
for $50 that just has
some impact. And I remembered

534
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.480
being you, you alluded to
this before, but I remember

535
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.560
being so broke just recently,
just in the last three

536
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.850
years being so broke were
$50 would have just made

537
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.610
my week to get that
out of nowhere. So that's

538
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.470
what I did the Christmas
thing about. And then the

539
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.870
500, I said, well, 50
we'll do something. 500 were

540
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:29.160
really do something and really
affect change and move things.

541
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.090
And I'm I'm about, I
like to see things happen

542
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.210
pretty quickly. I know I
can sit around. There was,

543
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.910
there's an instantaneous aspect of
this. It wasn't just like

544
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.820
pay down someone's debt. You
want to take that and

545
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.280
do something. That's what I
was looking for. I mean,

546
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.500
but people could kind of
just pitch whatever. And they

547
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.420
just told me, I saw
people just started sending things

548
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.890
and, and then Alyssa Milano
retweeted it. And then because

549
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.220
of that, Debra messing, who
plays grace and will, and

550
00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.460
grace who I've been watching
for nearly 20 years, she

551
00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.580
retweeted it and liked it.
And so we got, I

552
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.570
got like 1500 responses for
10, for 10. Oh yeah.

553
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.480
So when I, when that
happened, I did choose 10,

554
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.990
which were awesome. But then
I said, Hey, there's this

555
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.450
is something and it's not
so big. Then it's unknown.

556
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:20.270
It's insurmountable insurmountable. So I
decided to turn it into

557
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:25.940
like an official nonprofit where
we gift $500 grants, just

558
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.300
PR PR, why can't I
talk to them periodically throughout

559
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.780
the year? And there's really,
I mean, it's, it's So

560
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.400
it's not, it's not a,
GoFund me. It's not a

561
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.420
Patrion. It's something different. It's
like this $500 is a

562
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.360
barrier between me and this
great thing that I want

563
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.920
to do. Yeah. I started
with Brian Landers and Diane

564
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.300
Therese who are both friends
of mine and on the

565
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.420
backstage team. And we just,
we, we get to, you

566
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.350
know, grant people money to
do cool things. So it's

567
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:58.400
anything from, There was a
cause player who wanted something

568
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.530
like it was like, It's
a black woman who like

569
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.900
young woman who wanted to
go to this convention that

570
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.030
she'd never been able to
go to. And she showed

571
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.420
pictures of her doing cosplay.
And you know, that's not

572
00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.610
really my thing to be
honest, like it's not the

573
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.780
world that I live in.
I've had a lot of

574
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.170
like friends that do that,
but it's not something I

575
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.900
personally would do. But I
was like that like gives

576
00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.870
her joy. There's pure joy
on her. Her whole Twitter

577
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.440
feed was cheese. Just kicked
about that. And for people

578
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.180
like you and I, who
are privileged to go to

579
00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.240
conferences and speak at conferences,
I know people who go

580
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.840
to a conference every three
years, I couldn't get into

581
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.990
a conference before three years
ago. I just couldn't. There

582
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.230
was no way that could
happen unless somebody handed me

583
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.550
a way in. And I
just, I thought about like,

584
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.010
kind of set myself into
the feature and say, what

585
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.630
would that be like if
she were able to go,

586
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.940
what get that? What could
that mean for her? And

587
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.970
what could that create in
her and stirring her and

588
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.100
what could she then do
with that? And that was

589
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.030
just, That's just one example,
the trip of a lifetime

590
00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.660
for that For her. Yeah.
And like, it's there it's

591
00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.070
attainable. So yeah. So now
we, now we do And

592
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.180
what is the name of
that? And where can we

593
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.950
go? And it's a nonprofit
I can donate money to

594
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.410
That's right. You can apply
or you can donate money

595
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.570
if you, if you'd like,
and we get donations from

596
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:17.400
$5 to 5,000, honestly. Yes.
So anything is great. You

597
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.470
know, it is it's called
cover and it's project cover.org.

598
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.290
Okay. And it's also project
cover on Twitter. Covid.org. It's

599
00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.660
a nonprofit and you might
even be able to go

600
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.580
and check with benefi if
you have a big company

601
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.440
and they might be able
to do matching against that

602
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.960
because it is an official
nonprofit. It is officially. We

603
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.380
have a fiscal sponsor and
it's a tax deductible donation.

604
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.450
Now let me ask you
this. As we close the

605
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:46.200
podcast, is there a, can,
can a person invest in

606
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.060

have to give you a

607
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.130
certain amount of money? Like
if there's a rich person

608
00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.250

not even to take your

610
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.500

I'm so glad that things

635
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.960

backstage capital. You've got a

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.390
team of thousands now. Yeah.
Yes. There's thousands of us
