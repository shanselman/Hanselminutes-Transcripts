9
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.660
of Hansel minutia, the focus
is data backup strategies. Hi,

10
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.030
this is Carl Franklin and you're
listening to Hanselman it's from

11
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.960
Hanselman. It's that com how
you doing Scott? Oh, it's

12
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.510
been quite a week girl.
This is a, it's been,

13
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.280
it's been a little crazy.
I've been, I've been running

14
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880
around playing it manager for
the, for the Hanselman family.

15
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.570
Yeah. Speaking of it, we,
we did a run ass

16
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.930
radio this week, the first
episode. Yeah. Greg Hughes and

17
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.270
Richard Richard Campbell. Yep. And that turned
out really well. Yeah. It's

18
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.190
going to be great. I
respect those guys a great

19
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.530
deal. And Greg is a
very good friend of mine.

20
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.050
He works here at Kirlian
and he's a real deep

21
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.960
it guy with a real
hardcore security focus. So I

22
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.580
think they're going to play
off each other. Well, I

23
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.410
think people should check that
out. So if you don't

24
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.880
know what we're talking about,
it's a new show we're

25
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.700
doing every week. Richard, Campbell's
the host Greg Hughes who

26
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.220
works with Scott is the
cohost and it's about it

27
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.850
with a Microsoft centric view.
And that's it run as

28
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.720
radio.com. So I've been busy
too, because I actually edited

29
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.820
the show and got the
new show online and, you

30
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.040
know, modified, you know, added
the modules to the code

31
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.870
to be able to handle
the new show and blah,

32
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.960
blah, blah. So it was
went fairly smoothly, but it

33
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.170
just took a long time.
Yeah. So, you know, my,

34
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.590
my, my parents lived down
about two hours away from

35
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.840
where I'm at. So I
I've been trying to do

36
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.300
a lot of, I mean,
not that I don't want

37
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.800
to visit them all, like
as often as I can,

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.080
but I try to do
most of my work remotely,

39
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.270
try to remote in use
copilot.com, VNC different things like

40
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.490
that. But you know, sometimes
you just can't get the

41
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.190
work done that you want
to get done. And, you

42
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.140
know, I posted on my
blog a while back about

43
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.930
having a backup strategy for
your family home. Right. And

44
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.230
that is to have backup
strategy. Right. Cause basically what

45
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.110
happened was I lost, I
lost my dad's email. I

46
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.930
lost two years of his
email. Yeah. You were telling

47
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.960
me about this. This was
in a, the one that

48
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.700
uses Firefox or whatever Thunderbird,
right? Yeah. It's the, it's

49
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.010
the Firefox kind of suite
at the Mozilla suite of

50
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.710
things. And I just got
confused or something I don't

51
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.210
really know happened, but So
then I kind of went

52
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.730
on this, I'm on this
tear to go and back

53
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.090
up the whole family. Okay.
I drew this diagram and

54
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.060
you kind of presented it
to the whole extended family

55
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.620
about, you know, how exactly
we're going to back up

56
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.260
all of our stuff up.
And I'm okay with being

57
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.830
the hub of these things.
But the problem was that

58
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.980
the strategy was very vague
before and it never been

59
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.470
written down and talked about.
So I got all those

60
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.140
little two gigabyte, tiny Kingston,
what do you call it?

61
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.130
Little USB keys are like
the size of a piece

62
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.520
of Trident gum. Yup. They're
the size of the USB

63
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.170
connector. Right? So all the
family members who have no

64
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.560
broadband, all the dial up
family members have those little

65
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.560
two gigs now. So I
went over to like went

66
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.110
over to 86 year old
uncle Ronnie's house and hooked

67
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.060
him up with a batch
file that would copy his,

68
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.250
my documents onto that little
device and, you know, suppress

69
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.650
errors slash Y all that
kind of stuff. Have it

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.960
run on a weekly schedule.
So his email is backed

71
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.120
up, cause he's on a
laptop. That's definitely running on

72
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.180
borrowed time. You know, if
you're, if, if he's like

73
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.250
anybody in my family, my
mother, you know, grew up

74
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.760
in my parents, grew up
in the depression. So, you

75
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.660
know, they have that, you
know, save everything mentality. And

76
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.270
one of the things they
like to save is electricity

77
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.280
by turning the computer off
when it's time to do

78
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.880
the automatic updates. So it's
very hard for her to

79
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.880
get automatic updates because she
turns her computer off when

80
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.630
she's not using it. Right.
And yeah, Yeah. He's the

81
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.220
same way I set it
up to back up in

82
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.780
the middle of the afternoon
when I know he's on

83
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.150
the machine and I also
made it so he could

84
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.160
back it up whenever he
felt like, and he'll probably

85
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.500
end up running it himself,
but he's also gotten in

86
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.950
the habit of printing out
his entire contact list. So

87
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.660
he puts it a hard
copy as well. Cause he's

88
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.810
the keeper of all records
of, of all records Hanselman.

89
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.840
Yeah. Right. He's got the
whole, the family, the family

90
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.170
tree everything's managed and hard
copy is very organized. So

91
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.030
then I go over there,
you know, once a month

92
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.300
and pick up that device,
copy it to my system,

93
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.580
take it home and then
put it onto my, my

94
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.710
Microsoft home server. That's a
good idea. So all the

95
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.680
D all the dumb, the
dial up people do Sneakernet,

96
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.620
which is a very effective
way of doing things. And

97
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.890
now I'm set up with
mozy.com Moz. Why now? What's

98
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.490
that? That's the online backup
service. It's 50 bucks a

99
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.700
year and they will back
up an unlimited amount of

100
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.830
data. Right now, I backed
up about a hundred gigs.

101
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.140
So how does it work?
I mean, do they just

102
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.090
do a low speed, constant
backup? It's actually, you, you

103
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.550
can set it to, and,
you know, at throttle at

104
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.920
any speed that you want,
but right now mine's going

105
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.170
at about 600 K a
second. It's been running for

106
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.080
the last week and a
half. It's just about finished.

107
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.320
And then they'll do differential
backups from there. So I

108
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.040
won't use up so much.
I think if you have

109
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.590
a lot of data and
if you lose it and

110
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.600
it's all in an online
backup thing, it'll take a

111
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.750
long time to download it.
Well, you know, with Verizon

112
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.570
Fios in the U S
at least you've got 15

113
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.480
megabits down. I presume that
mosey will, might not necessarily

114
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.090
send it to me as
fast as that, but certainly

115
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.370
within a few days, I
could get the majority of

116
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.980
what I want. I don't
need to get my VMs

117
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.370
and my, my music immediately.
I'm more interested in taxes

118
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.360
and personal files. So for
us about three gigs is

119
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.550
the essential amount. That's that
kind of the, the amount

120
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.970
of really important stuff. Then
there's about 15 to 20

121
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.260
gigs of pictures, family photos.
And then it gets into

122
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.090
video, raw video, virtual machines
and music and stuff like

123
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.360
that. Okay. So I set
the parents up with mosey.

124
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.680
They've got a cable modem.
And before I did this,

125
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.690
my dad had been having
some trouble with his machine.

126
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.700
So he brought it over
to the house. You know,

127
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.590
he comes up to see
my son a couple of

128
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.120
times a week. So he
brings the computer to the

129
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.060
house and he was, it
was full of spyware. So

130
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.690
I put on <inaudible> put
on Firefox, showed him both

131
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.170
of them, set it up
with a spy bot, spent

132
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.150
quite a while, cleaning it
up and making it nice

133
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.200
and then sent, it, sent
him on his way. And

134
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.220
the next day the system
was infested with some kind

135
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:10.220
of Russian virus, Trojan, evil
thing. And I said, how

136
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.700
mean he was, he felt
really bad, you know? And,

137
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.750
and I don't think he
has to be, he shouldn't

138
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.850
have to be computer savvy.
So he felt bad. But

139
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.140
whenever somebody gets some infestation
like this on their machine,

140
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.510
I try not to make
them feel guilty because it

141
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.940
just happens. Right. Right. So
I'm trying to figure out,

142
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.200
I've got the thing immunized,
I've got antivirus software. How

143
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.480
in the world did he
get this thing on? Well,

144
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.440
somebody sent him a picture
of like an elephant eaten,

145
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.930
a snake or a snake,
eat an elephant or something,

146
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.810
you know, video basically. And
I said, how did this

147
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.430
happen? It's like, well, I
didn't do anything last night.

148
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.290
I came home after I
left your house. And I,

149
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.290
my buddy sent me a
picture of a video of

150
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.690
an elephant needing a snake.
And I watched the video.

151
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.540
And that was it. Well,
turns out that it had

152
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.380
some kind of custom video
codec that it auto downloaded.

153
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.780
And it said, you can't
watch this video unless you

154
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.980
download this video Kodak. And
the codec was an evil

155
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.010
toolbar and the evil toolbar
brought friends to the party.

156
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.150
And the next thing I
knew a balloon popped up,

157
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.910
like, you know, the little
balloons from the tray balloon

158
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.620
pops up and says, your
computer's infested with spyware, click

159
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.740
here to download an anti
spyware program. That probably is

160
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.340
also spyware. Right? He downloaded
a program called spy, locked

161
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.650
by locked is actually a
anti spyware program that is

162
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.820
evil. Right. And the thing
is that when he sent

163
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.980
me a screenshot, I taught
both my parents how to

164
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.380
do screenshots. That's kind of
their primary way of saying

165
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.020
this is something went wrong.
Yeah. Hint, print screen, and

166
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.210
send it to me. So
I get these two gig

167
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.510
to gig rather to Meg,
you know, big images like

168
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.790
what's this, and then a
big screenshot of something horrible

169
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.090
that's happened. And th the
part that killed me was

170
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:58.710
that the balloon had said,
click this balloon and spelled

171
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.530
balloon wrong. No. So There's
your first clue. Your first

172
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.450
clue that something, I think
it's gone bad is poor

173
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.360
grammar, poor spelling. You think
that the evil people would

174
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.700
realize that spellchecking would make
it more likely for us

175
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.800
to do their evil thing,
But poor grammar is the

176
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.890
thing that's very difficult for
somebody who doesn't speak the

177
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.280
language to get, right? Because
you might know somebody who

178
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.230
kind of speaks both languages,
but, you know, for the

179
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.550
kind of people we're talking
about, you know, it's not,

180
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.820
they're not the most highly
educated people in the world

181
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.190
that write these things. Well,
you know, I dunno I

182
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.960
can't speak to that. Cause
I don't know who they

183
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.350
are. I know that they're
very likely contract programmers that

184
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.600
don't think they're doing. I
mean, presumably they're not doing

185
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.360
evil. I've always wondered about
this. Who are the spyware

186
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.940
people, maybe one of the
spyware people is listening to

187
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.240
our stuff and can call
me and let me know

188
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.310
who they are, because I
want to know, are you

189
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.450
sitting at home thinking I
could do this really evil

190
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.910
thing? You know, I could
name my DLL, an eight

191
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.180
character random, you know, random
name and hide it in

192
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.510
system 32, or, you know,
I could Ms. Bell calc and

193
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.150
I could be calc two
dot exe. I've got a

194
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.360
story for you. Okay. Once
w when I was working

195
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.850
at Metro technologies, this is,
these are the guys that

196
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.410
made a dos Mitty sequencer
back in the eighties, and

197
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.070
a cakewalk ate their lunch
basically. And these guys had

198
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.200
copy protection on their stuff.
And that's probably a big

199
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.690
reason why it didn't go,
why it didn't last, but

200
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:30.380
so DAS based sequencers, right?
So one person, somebody calls

201
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.770
up protect support, and you
know, everything's going really slowly.

202
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.850
It's PA you know, I'm
running out of memory and

203
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.140
your sequencer pluses, I'm losing
time, all of this kind

204
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.870
of stuff. So then they
spent about an hour on

205
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.730
the phone with the technicians,
got all the way to

206
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.870
the main developer. And he's
like, well, honestly, if I'd

207
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.330
have to see the computer.
And so the person said,

208
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.100
well, I'll drive it over.
I think they were at

209
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.500
Fordham or something like that.
And we were in Westchester

210
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.730
County, New York. So this person
drove up with their computer,

211
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.820
which was an old IBM
XT, right. This was about

212
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:10.040
that time and monochrome screen
and, and everything in there.

213
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.830
It's going slowly, sure enough,
they plug it in and,

214
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.920
you know, they don't know
what's wrong with it. And

215
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.370
there's, you know, they're looking
around, there's no nothing crazy

216
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.190
going on. It's just running
really, really slow. Is it

217
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.740
the turbo button? You know,
the turbo button was pressed.

218
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.260
I mean, it was like,
you know, they'd like do

219
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.980
a, a directory and, you
know, it would, it would

220
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.100
spit out characters like bunk,
bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk,

221
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.140
bunk, bunk bot. I mean,
it was really, really honk

222
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.380
and slow. So I'm staying,
I just walk up to

223
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.220
it and I said, Hmm,
maybe it's a virus. And

224
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.150
everybody goes off, you know,
here's this, the head developer,

225
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.320
this must have been 88,
89. This was the time

226
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.150
of the stoner virus in
the ANSI viruses. Yes. CSRs,

227
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.380
SRS. Good time. So the,
so the, you know, the

228
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.430
head developer there goes, you
know, you're crazy. And then

229
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.280
one of the other guys
who work there, one of

230
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.250
the developers said, well, wait
a minute. Let's look. And

231
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.110
he went into the DAS
directory and he did a

232
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:14.430
directory DIR. And he saw
that beep.com was in there.

233
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.580
I remember beep Oh, Beep.com.
Cause when you type beep

234
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.250
there's a, there was the
order of precedence. Yeah. Yeah.

235
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.420
So beep.com was like 539
bytes, let's say, so he

236
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.150
typed it beep and it
went beep and then he

237
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.060
did another directory and beep.com
was all of a sudden,

238
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.290
you know, 800 something bites.
Right? Aha. Yes, it is

239
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.650
a virus. So it turns
out that, you know, that

240
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.360
was the first time I
said, Hey, maybe I'm not

241
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.470
so stupid after all. But
turns out that this person

242
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:48.060
was connected to a network
at school, you know, through

243
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.110
modems, it was known networking
really Like CVS is in

244
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.780
FIDOnet. Yeah, it was a,
it was a school network

245
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.750
and a school BBS and
this person had downloaded something

246
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.420
and picked up a virus.
So even, even back then,

247
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.330
you know, the TSRs were
there in memory and would

248
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.170
attach themselves to the end
of executable files. And that's

249
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.680
how they spread. The question
that I want answered is

250
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.280
are they, do they have
whiteboards and meetings like we

251
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.780
do. Do they sit in
a room and did they

252
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.720
say, okay, here's how it's
going to go down. Right.

253
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.070
You know, we've just got
this Microsoft IE browser and

254
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.260
there's this thing called a
browser helper object. And we

255
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.650
could make an evil toolbar
take over the world. I

256
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.900
understand these guys who go
to college and they, they

257
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.820
might write a proof of
concept or want to be

258
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.040
noticed by the security community
and then get a job,

259
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.680
right. Break into the bank
to work for the bank,

260
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.920
but to work for like,
you know, Gator or one

261
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.940
of those companies where you're,
you're literally evil. I mean,

262
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.550
there's no other word there
isn't, there is level, it's

263
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.750
just a, what price your
soul. Right. So I had

264
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.790
to, you know, go back
down there and check my

265
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.250
dad's machine out and spend
another hour futzing with it.

266
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.480
So what I ended up
doing is I took my

267
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.760
dad's. I took basically, I
took my Mac mini down

268
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.310
there and I gave it
to my dad. Cause he'd

269
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.190
never seen a Mac in
his life. I mean, he'd

270
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.320
seen them like they're at
the mall. And I know

271
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.120
that there's another kind of
person out there called a

272
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.270
Mac. Right, right. It's like
the first time I went

273
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.160
to synagogue, you know, I
was like 15 and my

274
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.900
friend's like, let's go to
synagogue. And I'm like, Oh,

275
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.960
okay, what's this hat, you
know? And then you realize

276
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.420
that this is whole universe
of other people who go

277
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.480
to church on a different
day. Right. And, and he's

278
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.660
really, he's finding it really
fascinating. It's like, there's a

279
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.300
whole world of Mac people.
What's this? Oh, well that's

280
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.000
the, that's the doc thing.
What is it? Why does

281
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.280
it do this? Where's the
menu where's Alta for, you

282
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.890
know, all those kinds of
fun questions. It's like, he's

283
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.340
a kid again. Wow. So
he's running the Mac, but

284
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.790
you know, max, you know,
I love max. They're pretty,

285
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.190
they're great for browsing and
for, for male, you know,

286
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.410
it just worked right. He's
love and that's all he

287
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.100
wants browsing and male, when
it started falling down was

288
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.210
when I tried to do
some, some drive sharing. Hmm.

289
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.430
Right. You have to know
the different, you have to,

290
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.680
you know, you basically have
to read the, read the

291
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.610
manual. You have to go
make special URLs to attach

292
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.940
to servers. Like, because you
know, Samba S a M

293
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.630
B a as the, as
the, the Linux open source

294
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.350
kind of way to talk
to SMB simple message block,

295
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.710
basically what we think of
as UN UNC paths. Right?

296
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.390
So he, I took his
old machine and turn it

297
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.460
into a server and then
I have to go and

298
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.210
make a URL. SMB, colon,
whack, whack server name slash

299
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.930
<inaudible> it's it was fine
once I got it working,

300
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.270
but I don't know how
he was expected to get

301
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.260
Mack, to enter inter-operate with,
with windows. And I spent

302
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.420
about two hours trying to
get his printer working. And

303
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.520
right now he's at the
point where he's got his

304
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.980
email and he can look
at his files. Everything's cool,

305
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.150
but utterly and completely unable
to print. And I have

306
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.050
absolutely no idea where to
even start. I mean, it

307
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.670
recognized the printer, it connected
to the network printer, it

308
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.670
prints and it says, Hey,
it worked and nothing comes

309
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.580
out. Wow. You know, so
it's just, it's all of

310
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.680
it's just got me frustrated
that just computers are just

311
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.050
too freaking hard, but Oh
yeah. But back to the

312
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.110
backup thing, what I ended
up doing was just creating

313
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.750
a Cron job to backup
all of his files to

314
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.930
the, the, the, you know,
the server kinda made it

315
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.910
like a little poor man's
network. There's two people in

316
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.730
the house. So there's three
computers, mom, dad, and the,

317
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.620
and the server. And then
we back it up again

318
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.200
with mozy.com. I got them
their own account. And they

319
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.860
ended up with about three
gigs of data. So as

320
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.870
long as you can get
past the idea that the,

321
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.570
the data is going to
be encrypted and sent over

322
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.550
to them, they encrypted locally
and they send it off.

323
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.810
But some people don't like
to give, give up that,

324
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.850
that the, that control. Yeah.
Right. But, but I like

325
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.370
it. I think that mozy.com
or services like it are

326
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.290
going to work out very
nicely and 50 bucks for

327
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:56.270
unlimited couldn't, couldn't beat that
price. What is your backup

328
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.030
strategy anyway? What do you,
What do you do? My

329
00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:03.610
backup strategy is all secondary
discs in an external USB

330
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.520
drives. Really. I love the,
my book 500 gig. Oh

331
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.160
dude. To the, my book,
I've got my books all

332
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.110
over the place. I do,
you know, I plug them

333
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.490
in and it's all offline.
You know, it's not a

334
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.460
problem. You know, that's pretty
much my sole backup strategy.

335
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.530
You know, you're going to
love it. The home server,

336
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.800
the windows home server, we
should do a whole show.

337
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.510
I'm going to call those
guys. I, I called them

338
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.660
earlier to talk to Charlie
Kendall, the PM for windows

339
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.840
home server. Yeah. I think
we're allowed to talk that

340
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.550
we're all, you know, there's
the beta program now. And

341
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.140
I think there were some
invitations that went out, but

342
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.160
basically you plug in as
many and as odd oddly

343
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.300
shaped and oddly sized, external
drives as you like. And

344
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.610
it just turns them into
one big giant drive. Wow.

345
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.490
So I just took all
my external drives, added some

346
00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.150
35, a 75 and a
two 50, just a bunch

347
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.030
of random ones that I'd
forgotten about, plugged them all

348
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.000
in. And then it does
kind of a S a

349
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.770
kind of a software raid,
kind of a thing. It's

350
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.380
not raid proper, but they
basically build their own custom

351
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.470
file system. Nice. On top
of NTFS. And I ended

352
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:10.140
up with like a 785
gigabyte rated. No, I wouldn't

353
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.730
say rate again, rate isn't
the right word for it,

354
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.030
but a software duplication strategy,
such that I can remove

355
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.130
one of the drives and
not lose the data. Yeah.

356
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.950
And then you can add
as many as you want,

357
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.080
and removement whenever you want,
you just have to warn

358
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.760
it that you're going to
remove something. And then it'll

359
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.600
make sure that those files
are sufficiently duplicated elsewhere. So

360
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.070
I've just been basically making
a res of these, these,

361
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.030
my books, these Western digital,
my books. They're fantastic. The

362
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.910
biggest problems we have here
of course, is that, you

363
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.560
know, we have a lot
of data. I mean, we're

364
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.160
producing five or six shows
a week, sometimes seven, and

365
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.350
there's just a lot of
data backing up here. So

366
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.600
we need to have archive
as well as duplicate archive,

367
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.290
you know, and then take
things off our raid. So

368
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.390
what I'm looking into now
is a couple of NASA

369
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.180
devices, a couple of network
attached storage devices. Do you

370
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.280
have any of those? I
looked at the, is it

371
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.120
the Buffalo technologies one, they've
got a, a terabyte one

372
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.600
that's basically for two fifties
and it's running a little

373
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.390
Linux box and it's got
a, a, an HTTP server

374
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.150
that you can go in
and manage it. But I'm

375
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:18.350
thinking that my, my network
attached storage situation is going

376
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.440
to be the home server.
I I'm, I'm absolutely enamored

377
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.010
with this thing and convinced
that it's gonna change, change

378
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.110
stuff. It's fantastic. Well, this
is at home. What about

379
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.490
it? You know, what about
it? Where, I guess you

380
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.230
don't have to do the
work though. We were at

381
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.870
work, right? We're a big
company. We've got EMC and

382
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.580
a San and all that
kind of stuff. So you

383
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.620
don't have to worry about
it at work, but you

384
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.380
know, you can nuke the
place and there's backup storage

385
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.780
everywhere. It's matter of fact,
I think Greg was talking

386
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.480
about that on run as
radio, the sand stuff. Oh

387
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.520
yeah, absolutely. He is the
guy that manages all that

388
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.630
stuff. Yeah. Big stuff. What
about Apple TV? Have you

389
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.680
seen this? Yeah. You know,
Omar is kind of my,

390
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.650
my eye into that kind
of stuff. Omar Shaheen, and

391
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.200
the word on the street
is that the quality is

392
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.890
garbage Ryland. And it's not
that the Apple TV sucks

393
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.620
cause it doesn't just the
content quality of the content

394
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.330
sucks. And I know this
to be the fact, because

395
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.970
I remember I, when I
went to Tanzania in December,

396
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.780
I loaded up my 80
gig iPod video, which can

397
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.780
do both NTSC, the U
S standard for TV and

398
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.320
pal, the European and African
standard or except for in

399
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.810
France. And then I took
that with me to Tanzania,

400
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.410
loaded up with movies and
TV. Cause they, they, they

401
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.080
don't have like on demand.
They have satellite TV down

402
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.640
there, but they didn't have
on demand. So I basically

403
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.180
brought my portable TiVo w
w which was my iPod.

404
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.850
And most of the movies
that I bought are, you

405
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.130
know, three 20 by two
40. And they're really kind

406
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:44.150
of, you know, and Peggy
and they were okay in

407
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.860
a 19 inch screen, but
they were letterbox chorus. So

408
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.780
if I was going to
blow that up, you know,

409
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.270
imagine three 20 by two
40 or 40 by four

410
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.290
80 plus highly compressed and
peg four and stick it

411
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.930
on a big 42 inch
plasma. I'd be pretty disappointed

412
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.630
as well. You know, it's
funny that you should say

413
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.120
that. Cause I just like
five minutes ago was looking

414
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.900
at this email that came
from the iTunes podcasting team

415
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.640
and it came to plop
and it says basically that,

416
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.570
you know, please increase your
videos that you're publishing on

417
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.230
iTunes to six 40 by
three 60. I'll read it

418
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.350
right now. I swear to
God, it came at 9:05 PM,

419
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.170
which was just like half
an hour ago. It says

420
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.350
greetings from the iTunes podcasting
team, Apple TV is here

421
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.630
and podcasts are making a
big move into the living

422
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.790
room. We want all of
them to look as good

423
00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.270
as possible. So we have
three video formatting recommendations for

424
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.970
you. Also note that we
have just posted a revised

425
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.380
and expanded technical spec. Finally,
the Apple worldwide developer's conferences

426
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.810
coming up, blah, blah, blah.
So it says recommendations for

427
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:50.220
formatting video podcast. One, if
you're encoding your video podcast

428
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.640
at three 20 by two
40, please increase the resolution

429
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.220
either six 40 by four
80 or six 40 by

430
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.950
three 60, depending on the
aspect ratio of your source

431
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.720
files. Why? Because video podcasts
at this resolution look great

432
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.800
on Apple TV and still
port to video iPods, lower

433
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.100
resolution podcasts might also work
on both platforms, but they

434
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.010
don't look nearly as good
on a widescreen TV. Well,

435
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.990
hang on, they port too,
but don't they take up

436
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.480
four times as much space
apparently. I mean, you know,

437
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.160
No, no. I mean, they're
not automated. You're not doing,

438
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.730
they're not doing transcoding. No,
no, no port meaning, you

439
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.790
know, Meaning it'll look fine.
You can ride a run.

440
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.370
Yeah. As always make sure
to test any and coding

441
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.980
changes, blah, blah, blah. So
to it's best not to

442
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.820
create two different podcast feeds
for different resolutions by doing

443
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.430
so you dilute the popularity
of your podcast and reduce

444
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.280
exposure in our charts. It's
better to have one feed

445
00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.130
high in the charts than
two that are lower. Hmm.

446
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.960
Interesting. What are you you're
in, that's a very interesting,

447
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.100
because plop is known for
giving the listener choice. Yes.

448
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.350
But when we go to
iTunes, we only do MP3

449
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.950
and, and it's interesting that
we don't, we don't have

450
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.040
the AAC in iTunes. Right?
Why is that? Because I

451
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.340
always wanted to add like
all the advanced AAC, bookmarking

452
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.030
and pictures Let's show marking
works on, on iPods now

453
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.990
without AAC. The only reason
we ever did AAC was

454
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.840
because somebody wanted the bookmark
feature in iPod suit with

455
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.930
MP3s. Now how do we
get our, our Hanselman, its

456
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.300
logo on the iPod? I've
been trying to figure that

457
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.790
out. It should be there.
I mean, it's all in

458
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.210
the feed that we have
the iPod graphic in the

459
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.880
feed, the iTunes graphic in
the feed. It's a 300

460
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.690
by 300. Yeah. Graphic. Cause
right now in iTunes, I

461
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.430
mean, we don't have a
lot of iTunes listeners, but

462
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.410
in iTunes right now, when
I download it into my

463
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.220
iPod, the graphics are in
iTunes, but they are not

464
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.690
on the, on the actual
iPod while it's playing, you

465
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.350
don't get the album art.
I don't know if I've

466
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.350
ever seen that with any
podcasts that I run. Oh

467
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.320
well that's because I believe
there's an AAC editor that

468
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.520
embeds that metadata within the
AAC. Oh, okay. And you

469
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.160
basically get the album art,
like Merlin Mann's show has

470
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.590
that. Right. And then you
can set up these little

471
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.110
trigger events like you could
in windows, media player a

472
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.810
few years back where I'm
like, I know that the,

473
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.240
the Ricky gervais' podcast did
this, where they hit a

474
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.580
certain point in the show
and then he would actually

475
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.740
bring up a graphic. So
it's almost like a presentation

476
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.240
where you could say, right.
I take a look at

477
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.310
this picture and then click
the picture shows up and

478
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.770
you can do that with
WMV files as well. The

479
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.900
problem, the problem that I
have with that is I

480
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.780
haven't found an automateable solution
to it. No, it's all

481
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.000
manual. You're absolutely right. And
you know, we're all about

482
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.340
automation. We're putting out all
these shows and I don't

483
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.000
want to have somebody, you
know, manually doing that well,

484
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.740
and we don't want to
waste anybody's time. Whoever we're

485
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.570
talking to right now is
listening to this on the

486
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.790
train or on their commute
and double time. And I

487
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.350
don't want them looking down
at a picture and then

488
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.810
crashing and then coming to
my house and telling me

489
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.500
that Hansel minutes killed their
spouse. That's right. That's probably

490
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.630
a good place to stop
right there. Yeah. That is

491
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.850
a pretty good place to
stop. You know, it was,

492
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.040
it was fun. Just talking
to you about some stuff

493
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.420
that we need to catch
up on and I'm sure

494
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.820
everybody listened and liked it
as well. This is show

495
00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.490
59. And I think that
having it be the third

496
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.620
minutiae show, I think that's
a pretty good ratio of

497
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.890
contact and minutia. So hopefully
people didn't think the show

498
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.160
sucked. Awesome. Alright, Scott, thanks
for hanging out with us

499
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.530
and we'll see you next
week on Hanselman.
